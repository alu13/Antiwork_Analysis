0,Pieces of paper are more valuable than human life.,i refuse to work for food  water  amp  shelter as they are basic human needs  it's like working in exchange for air   i'll be in the streets dying to overexposure as apparently that is by default what we're worth  i accept it    we're expected to give about 40  hours a week to a society that literally think you don't deserve  water  unless you have pieces of paper   i guess smart people choose not to reproduce so we have an entire society of brainless scumbags who think they're normal    some quotes     it is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society  - jiddu krishnamurti   the real hopeless victims of mental illness are to be found among those who appear to be most normal   many of them are normal because they are so well adjusted to our mode of existence  because their human voice has been silenced so early in their lives  that they do not even struggle or suffer or develop symptoms as the neurotic does  they are normal not in what may be called the absolute sense of the word  they are normal only in relation to a profoundly abnormal society  their perfect adjustment to that abnormal society is a measure of their mental sickness  these millions of abnormally normal people  living without fuss in a society to which  if they were fully human beings  they ought not to be adjusted    aldous huxley ,agqbv9
1,More Frustration and Complaining....,not only did my employer  which i quickly left behind for another one  have a policy of working people for 16 to 24 hour days  they also have a weird thing where they send checks in the mail from california  it looks like they pay every week  but there's a delay in payment      nevermind me with bills to pay and stuff ,ahctr1

3,I have to remind myself of this sometimes.,reminder to everyone that  your best  doesn't mean pushing yourself to your breaking point   your best  means the best you can do while being the best you  met enough sleep  give yourself breaks  listen to your limits   your best  is better when you're happy and healthy  ,agln67
4,Punching in and out now.,i work in a typical office environment  and as of 2019 office employees are being required to punch in and out on a new time clock system  i understand that many places already do this  especially in factory or shift settings but i find it demeaning and unnecessary for office work  i think it's annoying and causes employees unnecessary stress  for example it pressures people to do things like drive dangerously in traffic in order to be on time  it erodes trust in the workplace  and it is a far cry from the best measure of productivity  it in fact  in my opinion  probably makes employees less productive  because they're now focused on fulfilling their time constraints  feel less autonomous  and therefore less happy  it just boils down to treating employees like professionals  my time shouldn't be watched like a hawk      i'm pretty upset by this   ,ahd3cz
5,Why do you work fulltime? Why not work as a barista for 2 days a week?,i did the calcs and i would earn 900 euro a month  it would mean you have to live very minimal  1 room appartment  no car etc  but you would be absolutely free  currently considering this as an alternative to retiring at 37 and thus working very hard now to earn enough money to reach that goal    why do you still work 5 days a week  if you find a partner and live together it would even be 1800 euro a month  that's more than enough for a minimal lifestyle or am i spoiled by my countries healthcare system  ,agjfq2
6,MikeRoweWorks.org is pro-work propaganda BS,the other day  my dad called me to tell me about a website that he thought i should check out because he heard it being talked about on fox news  i'm sure most of y'all have heard of mike row  the former host of the discovery channel show   dirty jobs  well  i figured i'd visit his website just to see what my dad was talking about  and holy shit  it is the most disgusting bullshit with regard to fetishizing work in general and hard work  especially skilled labor and manual labor  in particular  it really made me think of this subreddit  lol  why my dad thought it would be good for me to check out  though  i don't know  i'm not a skilled laborer or tradesman at all  never have been and hopefully never will be  just thought it would be an interesting discussion among possibly like-minded people ,aiwwmq

8,My boss found my $40 of missing tip money and now wants it back.,hey guys  i work at a pizza coffee joint in a small gas station  it s hell on earth and the only reason i stay is because of the tips  the other night  while closing  i lost  40 out of my apron  i searched the entire store and figure it was gone for good  this really really sucked considering i m saving up for moving and and a big trip this summer and  40  to me  is a lot of money  i was so excited the next morning when i asked my coworker if they had saw it and she said yes  and in turn  asked my manager where it was  she put it in a baggie inside of her desk  i was the only one who worked the night before  by the way  and instead of asking me if i lost the  40  she just put it away     the bag had two twenty s and like   0 25- 0 50 in change  i didn t remember having the change  but i figured if it was in the bag  i must ve left it there too  i took the whole thing  this morning i wake up to multiple messages from my manager asking me where i put the change that was in the bag  she said since i took the  0 50ish  she wanted me to return the entire amount because she needed it for a deposit   i think she s pissed off because she wasn t planning on giving me my money in the first place  what do i do  should i return the money  ,afvsdw

10,"Being a temp blows, and my current situation is why the work force pisses me off. (Long post)",hey there  i'm typing this on mobile late evening  apologies if there are typos or if i use weird phrases in this post  its been that kind of day   so to start off  i hope you are having a great day night  whether you are starting a shift  in the middle of it  or doing some overtime  i wish the best possible outcome for you   i was fired from a retail job i held for two years  happened a few months ago  hated the place  yet i met great people  since then i applied for some positions  recieved some call backs for some interviews  but nothing stuck  with no luck  i found myself one day walking into a temp agency desperate for a job   this agency was pretty good  pleasant people that assisted me well  and they found me instant work at first in a foam factory  great place actually  i struggled a bit  not gonna lie  but i felt comfortable there   well  unfortunately one day i receive a text from my agency not to return to said factory  could be multiple reasons  being a temp  it can happen  yet at the same time i just feel like they let me go because the night before i was doing really bad  new product  new way of handling it  and it took me all night to figure out a strategy that worked for me  i asked for help  was told  just keep at it  then thought i figured out  what to do by the end   so time passes and i'm offered a position at another factory  nice pay but long hours  whatever  i'll take it  i'm nervous though because i've heard about this place before  and not in a good way  it was established in my small city about 6 years ago  and every time i've thought or heard about this place  i'm repelled by it  just not my cup of tea  but who knows right  might as well try   i hear nothing back about the interview for a week  i call the agency again  position was taken  not sad about it  so what else do they have  well  they suggest a few options that really dont sound appealing  and the last suggestion is a training session at the same place  guess i'll take it   thanks for reading this far  i'll wrap up soon  i'm at this factory currently and let me tell ya  this place is so stupid  disorganized  with drama and supervisors picking favorites off the bat  some machines are great  and some are very not  i'm usually in the cold warehouse section  and i despise the cold  could i move  yeah  but other machines are pure ass   now i'm a young guy that has the same mindset as this sub  fuck work  and how it's set up  fuck these hours  and how long they are  fuck these dicks who dont make it easy to be here  fuck these breaks that dont even last twenty minutes  just fuck it   so  what's the point of this post  i work at 6 in the morning  it's almost midnight  and my hip area is bothering me to where i can't sleep  i've taken some aid and tried stretching it out and it's still bugging me  it's minor  so nothing crazy  i dont want to go in today reddit  yesterday was already garbage  my work already stated they need all available employees to go in and i said i would  but i'm really tempted to not go   my family is counting on me to continue this job  my girlfriend is counting on me  i can afford to miss a day  i just feel guilty as fuck  i hate how the workforce is set up because when you feel ill in any way  you are forced to go to get that paycheck  its agony  and just like you  i would do anything to not be in this vicious cycle   alright  end time  my questions are  1  should i say fuck it and call in  2  should i ask the agency if there are other job opportunities  3  have you had an instance where something was bothering you enough to not work  minor or major  and how did you feel  i'm going to attempt to sleep now  so feel free to comment  and i'll do an edit later  thanks for your time ,af4zbw

15,A babysitter for adults,backstory  22 year old manager at a popular fast food restaurant in texas  tl dr  hard work is bullshit and i m quitting my job   i don t truly have a problem with working  i kinda like the idea of dedicating myself and working with a team  i enjoy that lemming nonsense even if it is kind of stupid  plus i like learning about my coworkers and employees  most of them are great people but lack the ability to get any upward economic movement   that s kinda what i want to talk about  the employees  these guys and girls work twice as hard as me and get no where near the pay  how is that fair  my job is basically to make sure that don t screw up and to handle the angry consumers of our food  so basically i m a babysitter for these people  and they definitely don t need me  yet i get paid almost 15hr and they get paid 8-9 an hour   plus i have to fight my fellow managers to get my guys hours  but they have the same problem  all of their employees need more money and that means they need to work longer hours  i mean these people have kids to feed and rent to pay how is it the companies place to get in their way because they want to save a percentage on labor costs   i mean i do work 50-60 hours a week  but most of that is spent on my phone  plus i earned my position basically off the back of my social skills  it had nothing to do with how hard i work    at the end of the day  these people work hard  are stuck in a cycle of completely depending on this job to survive and i just don t feel right about it  how could i  they deserve better then what they have   so i m quitting my job  going back to college and becoming a nurse  at least then i can help someone even if it s just a little bit ,ai3jqu

35,Can't Get Out,i can't get out or break the cycle  i simply cannot survive without maintaining a job and income  but i absolutely hate my job  it is a hellscape that threatens my sanity  i am seeing a psychiatrist next week because it hurts so much  i need out but i don't know how much longer i can take  and the devil you know is better than the devil you don't  my spouse and father are saying that i should go back to school  but my first degree obviously went to shit since i hate my fucking job so much  i hate every job i've ever had  i feel hopeless and bitter  i feel like i have wasted years of my life in exchange for a middling job as i trudge along towards death  how do i know any other career path won't provide the same exact outcome       what the fuck is wrong with me ,agbb1y
36,Banned for suggesting we need to get rid of wage labor: A Tale,i had an interesting experience on r communization tonight  i told some people that i thought communism meant getting rid of wage slavery  i even explained how i thought this could be done    i was told that getting rid of wage slavery didn't address women's issues  colonialism  etc  when i responded that if wage labor was eliminated that women would not be dependent on men and could tell men to fuck off  i was banned summarily from the subreddit    i am pretty sure i never violated any rules of the subreddit  i just think many communists really don't want to think about actually getting rid of wage labor  despite their protests to the contrary  banning may be the only way they can handle the issue   i think the real rule i violated was to talk about getting rid of labor  no one -- not radical leftists  social-democrats or hard-core communists -- want to talk about this issue ,afp2by
37,Let's talk animal liberation,every year  billions of animals are tortured  enslaved  and killed  they always know what is coming  and are never complacent to the gun  there is a great new documentary i would recommend to anyone called  dominion  and its free on youtube to watch    amp x200b   i see no way to remove wage slavery  exploitation  and other capitalist symptoms from the lives of humans without rightfully removing exploitative systems from the lives of animals  therefore  i see it as the obligation of every leftist  especially every antiwork anarchist  to live a vegan lifestyle and call for animal liberation    amp x200b   disclosure  let's make it clear that animals are not the same as humans  nor are their lives as important as human lives  however  their suffering is unnecessary and unacceptable and they are our companions on the earth ,af9729

40,Working on my death as my lifestyle.,it's maddening  the hoops to go through to get a job is depressing enough as it is  i'm overqualified for everything  tha fuck  i used to interview people at my old job  and watching how my colleagues just wrote people off and mocked them  sometimes months after the interview  it's like those interviewees are people  you pricks  i have to accept that the people interviewing me will treat me the same    most of my days feel like i'm waiting to die  i lost my entire family in 2018   father to a terminal illness  no treatment or cure  stepmom and half brother used me as a babysitter  then one day the locks on my house were changed and she hooked up with my dad's cousin    my friends have families  jobs  and homes now and i never see them  maybe once a year    i've had so much shit happen to me since i was born  that it's jaded me so bad that i dont want to continue it anymore    to paraphrase stanhope    if you watch a movie fir an hour an a half  and its sucked all the way in  no one should blame you for leaving 20 minutes early ,af1rik

43,Boundaries,i wanted to share an incident that happened a few weeks ago  i am a supervisor in a call center  one day  i was browsing on social media and tagged a fellow supervisor in a post by one of our former co-worker who now works in a different call center   when sm found out  he talked to me during work and it turned ugly  i explained that it was just a joke  he then went to explain how i was improving and now i was going downhill  i honestly didn't understand his point since this was outside the workplace  work performance should be measured while you are at work  not by what you do on social media   i was really agitated because i exert a lot of effort in what i do  i do things and take tasks even when no one asks me to  in addition to being underpaid for my position  calling me out on a stupid post with no derogatory comments towards my current company is pretty childish   i also think that he is overextending his authority to where it doesn't belong   sorry for the rant but i am upset by the way i was treated when there are other bigger issues to deal with ,aimifk

45,Stigma in the wrong place,so recently i've noticed a tendency to blame individual workers for the struggles that they have finding or keeping a decent job while  at the same time  hiring managers  bosses  and hr reps are by and large heartless  unconcerned people who like documentation more than living  breathing human beings      it really does seem like the stigma of failure or whatever is being put in the wrong place here  from my own personal experience  i've had employers give me more hours than i asked for  employers who weren't up front about what was required of me  employers who haven't paid me on time or at all  employers who didn't hire me because i didn't have experience  supposedly  but then turned around and hired a 16 year old who can't handle the alcohol they sell  employers who refuse to listen or take my needs into consideration when i tell them i can't make it on federal holidays because the bus isn't running  employers who regularly send me emails inviting me to apply for a job but then aren't available to take my call and never call me back      and somehow all of this is completely my fault  okay then ,aj1hxv

47,I've been working while sick for two weeks now and it's pissing me off,the fact that we live in a society where your livelihood is threatened when you take the time you need to rest when your sick is appalling to say the least  it's a fucked up cycle where you can't get better because you have to keep working even though you're sick    the best part is i'm then considered responsible by my coworkers for when they get sick  even though that responsibility falls on our employers  i can't imagine how many customers i've gotten sick unknowingly as well   i'm tired of this shit  i want nothing more than for our workforce to band together and demand better treatment  but all of my coworkers are boot-licking troglodytes  it's not just them  a majority of americans are like this  and it just makes me feel alienated from society  ,afrvs2
48,"I finally quit my job, and I could t be more relieved.",first of all  sorry for any formatting or grammar issues to come  i m on mobile and currently still at work for my last few hours    things have been building up for some time  mostly with the store owner just being a real bitch and not treating any employees right  she s been a stay at home mom forever and has no idea how to actually treat people like employees rather than kids  usually this entails yelling at us for any mistake to be made or belittling us and making us feel worthless rather than using it as a learning opportunity  originally her husband ran the store and put in 50  hours a week of unpaid labor to try to stay afloat  unfortunately  he had to fall back on a more corporate job  making about 400k a year to build back from their debt  so the plan was for his wife to come in since she technically is the other owner  only things just got worse when she came on about 5 or 6 months ago    she began only coming in for a few hours a day to eventually being there less than a week what i would work in a day  on top of that she would come in much later than she scheduled herself and leave early to pick up her kids from school so they wouldn t be home alone  both of her kids were in high school and could very much take care of themselves  most problems could very easily be traced back up to her  and instead of owning up to it  she turned it around and blamed it on us and belittled us and just treated us like kids    there s many many more good stories and just ridiculous things that she would do that made it seem more like a written out reality show rather than a failing business  anyway  everything accumulated up to the past week or so  a customer had come in and made a large purchase that ended up being a fraudulent charge  of course since i was in the store at the time it was my fault  and that s what she would tell you  that i was incompetent and untrustworthy in the store  yet she continued to have me open and run the store on my own  in reality  i had practiced all security checks i was taught  check to make sure the id matched the card and run the transaction  which is what i did  the kicker is that she was actually in the store watching the customer and noticed how suspicious he seemed  but she still decided to leave early before any purchase was made  she also berated me for how much she told me not to do transactions like that and to check more security things and be more suspicious  which first of all is complete bs  i was never taught anything more than checking id  and second of all she wasn t in the store enough to even  teach  me anything like that  like she even had any business experience in the first place    so today i decided to just hand in my 2 week notice since i was planning on going back to school soon anyway  after handing it in and telling her why i guess she couldn t stand the idea that i would quit before she could fire me  so she told me today would actually be my last day  i m not sure if that counts as quoting or being fired but either way i m still happy to not have to come back tomorrow or ever again    the kicker is that she wants me to stay to finish my shift for then next few hours  as you can tell i m doing that by writing this and looking for some freelance work online    today i feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders  and for the first time in a while i feel  happy     there s many more stories i could tell of how ridiculous she was as an owner and a person  usually racist tirades or trying to find ways to dig herself out of problems she created to try and not look like the cause of them in the first place  but i ll save those for later updates if you guys seem interested  ,ajfxyg

51,Frustrated,apologies in advance for the length and the rant  i'm just feel like i've reached my breaking point with capitalism having its foot firmly planted on my throat  i don't even know where to start with how angry and depressed work has made me  not just my current job  but the idea of working 40  hours period just to be granted the  privilege  of barely scraping by and surviving while the rich get to live it up simply because they were lucky enough to be born into wealth or screwed enough people over to achieve it    i work for local government and have been for the last 6 years  in various departments  all of which suck  the pay is already shit and then they take out 11  for a retirement we may not even see  i have a chronic illness that's managable with meds but i have to work full-time to receive healthcare coverage because i live in the ultra civilized and advanced country of america  which i hate  my health shouldn't be contingent on my fucking employment status  the job itself is mind-numbingly dull  i sit in a cubicle all day and do maybe 4 hours worth of work and the rest of the time i have to  look busy  because god forbid anyone work less than 40 hours a week even if there's no work to be done  i have trouble sleeping monday-thursday but on weekends i sleep like a baby  wonder why  s  and when it's time for me to get up and face another 10  hour day  including getting ready to go to this place i hate being and my commute  i honestly find myself wishing i'd died in my sleep  i despise waking up before the sun has even risen so that i can spend my day being miserable    i hate having to come here and pretend i don't loathe every second  i hate spending more time doing someone else's inane busy work than i spend on myself  i hate that i see my coworkers more than my family and friends  i hate that when i get home i feel so physically and emotionally drained that i can't even work on my passion  that i don't even have the energy to exercise and keep myself healthy  all i want to do after a soul-numbing day in this cubicle is smoke a blunt  eat unhealthy food  because it feels like the only highlight of my day  and pass out while watching some banal program on netflix or hulu  i hate that americans have been so indoctrinated and brainwashed that they think this is an okay  normal way to live  i hate that my supervisor felt the need to put me on a disciplinary plan because i occassionally clock in at 8 01 instead of 8 00 on the fucking dot  we literally had a meeting where we went over  20 occurrences  i had and over half of them were me clocking in 1-4 minutes after 8 00  like i don't spend 9 fucking hours here doing the stupid bullshit you assign that i don't give a fuck about  but it's no problem if i clock in a minute or two early  because who gives a fuck about my time as the employee  right  i hate having to pretend i give a fuck about trivial ass bullshit that i'm in no way invested in   i write  shoot  and edit films web series  i like doing narrative work  i have no problem spending 8-12 hours on a set for nothing because i love doing it  but lately anything film-related has felt like an extra chore  i feel like i get no enjoyment out of it anymore  i can't branch out and work for myself as a videographer because the things i would make money shooting  weddings and events  i hate so it would just be another form of prison  i just want to shoot and edit my own stories  i want to finish the novel i'm working on  i want to focus on my health and have the energy to make nutritious meals and workout  i want to better myself  but i feel like i'm trapped in this neverending cycle of bitterness and depression  i've tried therapy  i've been on four different antidepressants  i'm convinced that the problem isn't with me  i don't think i have a chemical imbalance  i think the system is just fucked  and it drives me insane how when i talk about this to friends and family they just kind of  have accepted that this is life even though they're all just as tired and drained as i am  where is the outrage    i can't stand how wages are stagnant but it costs more and more to live  i'm living with my parents because i can barely cover my bills on what i make  so that makes me feel great as a grown man  a while ago my mom told me that when she and my dad initially got married they didn't plan on having any kids and then they changed their mind  and i've found myself resenting them for that  like why would you bring me into this world to be worked to death and unfulfilled  i wish they would've just stuck to the original plan or at least just waited and only had my younger brother because i'm not built for this bullshit  and i'm tired of everyone saying to  look at the bright side  or  be more positive  or  your life is what you make it  and all the rest of that lying motivation porn  being more  positive  is nothing more than lying to yourself to get through a shitty existence and i'm incapable of doing that  it's like telling me to laugh at a movie that i don't find funny  sure  i can do it  but it won't be genuine    i'm considering going to grad school but the thought of working full-time on top of classes and having absolutely no time to myself feels so daunting  plus i would go for counseling therapy  for more money and flexible hours  but then i feel like i'd have to peddle all that  be positive  shit that never worked for me  how can i counsel people using methods i don't believe actually work   tuesday night i played a favorite sad song of mine and cried for like half an hour  i don't want to be alive anymore and i'm only 31  the only things that keep me from killing myself are my nephew  and upcoming niece  and the fact that i don't want to fail at that and then end up in an even worse position  it just wears me down that i'm spending my youth toiling away instead of finding fulfillment  this morning i woke up three hours before my alarm and couldn't get back to sleep because i knew this shit was looming  five 8 hour days  and it's only 8 if you're lucky smh  and two days to recuperate is dismal  i feel like you have to choose between bettering yourself or decompressing and actually relaxing on your off time  feels like there isn't enough time to do both  so it's either work all week and then grind more for your own personal goals when you're off and never really get any relaxation or relax and make no personal progress   even just working 6 hour days or only 3-4 days a week would be better than this  i just need more of a fucking balance  i don't see how work life balance exists when we spend so  much  fucking  time at work or doing work-related things  why must we all start at exactly 8 00 a m  why do we all have to be herded into this box where we have to get up at 5 30 in the morning and fight traffic to get to work by 8 00  i hate that those are the universal hours because we aren't all the same  it's just really been grinding me down lately and i needed to vent somewhere i would be understood   if you read all of this  thank you  i realize i'm in a better position than some  but it still sucks that work basically swallows all of us whole  deep breath  i'm done ,ah11n7

64,Absolute hell hole: The realities of working a bullshit job,i feel as though i m about to have a full-blown mental breakdown  so  i figure that writing everything down might be cathartic in a way  i m generally a very happy person  bubbly  lively and outgoing  i studied marketing in university  a decision i now regret  because i believed that it would lead me into a creative career where i could use my brain and writing skills   flash forward to today  i m working in marketing in a foreign country  which seems exotic and cool at first blush  however  this country is known for its very conservative  boring  work culture  i was  lucky  enough to land this job when i first arrived here because they were seeking someone with an american background and high-level english skills  when i arrived for the interview  i was shocked by how bland  drab  and beige the office setting was- no decorations on the wall  no meeting rooms  just an open-concept office with floor to ceiling beige grey  however  during the interview i was told how progressive and innovative the company was  this company is a supposed leader in the technology and computer industry  i figured that perhaps the company culture itself was a bit livelier than the beige surroundings   a year later  i struggle to muster up the strength and motivation to wake up each morning and get ready for work  i sometimes weep at the breakfast table  absolutely dreading the 8 hours and 45 minutes of intense boredom which await me  i literally count down the minutes until i can clock out in the evenings  having to sit in silence for so many hours each day is torture  i feel like a factory farm pig locked in a gestation crate  the paradox is that my body and mind are completely exhausted after a long day of doing nothing  i can t even summon the energy to work on side projects or anything creative once i get home    my colleagues are all very much into their jobs  completely engrossed in their mundane day-to-day tasks  enthusiastically editing spreadsheets and typing away on clunky keyboards  most people have spent their entire careers working for this company  so they ve been brainwashed to believe that everything that happens here is normal  every decision must be approved by upper-management  even for insignificant things  i e  needing a new notebook from the supply cabinet  maybe it s the culture differences which cause the most strife  but i have never worked in such a boring  soulless environment    on top of this  i am a migraine sufferer and since i spend hours staring into a screen  my migraines have become increasingly worse and more frequent  i also fear that the artificial fluorescent lighting does not help the matter either  i have requested to work remotely a few days out of the week  but the request was denied because i don t work in sales    perhaps the most misery-inducing aspect of the job is that overall attitude of most people who work here  most are stuck up and only criticize and complain  working in group projects is dreadful as you will be outright scolded and embarrassed for any slight error while praise and encouragement fall by the wayside  you could do 99 100 things correct  but the one thing that is wrong is instantly noticed with the top managers copied in on the subsequent email   i absolutely despise my counterpart on my team  she is so negative and pessimistic and makes every day an absolute hellish experience  i have spoken with my boss about her attitude and he completely agreed  stating that i m not the only one who has told him about it  unfortunately  she will not be moved out of my department as she is a kiss-ass and accrues exorbitant hours of overtime because she makes herself look busy    overall  i cannot believe the constant hell i experience on a day-to-day basis  i m sure most of you can relate to this   sorry for the long rant  but honestly  i feel a bit better by letting this out      ,agxwtu

66,Are families the main reason for people/workers/slaves to not think critically about their situation?,it seems to me that  people do not refrain from their work neither physically of mentally due to the fact they need to provide for their families  they simply cannot get out of the treadmill because they have to sustain their relatives    it's possible to sum it up with the fact that they have no time to think properly  no time to imagine a a different world than this one that they  we  live  being watching the clock all the time  having to adjust your daily life to fullfill the necessity of the place where you work  company or employer  makes a working person unable to have new experiences  go to other places  meet different people  having deep conversations  use the imagination  learn new things  between other things which would make one to reason about this situation  sum it up with the fact that everyone around is doing it    sum it up with the fact that most of the people who work with you  or people in general around you  do not have anything against this entire situation due to the same factors as you   sum it up with the media and the  common sense  saying that the state in which your life is is your fault  and that you must work more and study more to make your life and  your relatives family life better   sum it up with your desires of consumption status which are being fed in you since you are a kid   being a antinatalist  i clearly believe that all the pieces fit together  like  we are told to follow that same path  grow up  study  have work  have a family  retire  if it is possible  die  and let your children do the same as you  either by your example or because the society in general forces it in their mind    after having children  because  you  have done it so without thinking about the world which you are putting this child  i am assuming it  since it seems like most of the cases are like this  sorry if i am offending someone with it  you are gonna be a slave of it  because you must work to provide and protect it    now  there is no way out  if  luckily there was any kind of criticism of our way of life and the system who rule us  it should be shut down because one who has a family to provide  should not have time to entertain such kind of thoughts  such is this system which is gonna make a  living  for them  and for you    amp x200b    amp x200b    amp x200b ,ag9poc

78,Honestly guys what options are there to earn money outside the 9-5?,hi guys  to be honest with you my life has been an utter mess the last few years or so   long story very short  i m in my early 20s   had a very senior well paid job that i was  lucky  to get  given my age  and after some years quit because despite the money and  status  beyond that fuck the imprisoning 9-5  i m still young i don t wanna die here let s try get out of it    fast forward a few years basically tried to make passive income  no success    always suffered with anxiety and depression and because of my now stronger than ever anguish  start making music again  which i did for years as a teen    really believed that i could make a life doing that  no  i m not saying i ever thought i could attain commercial success but at least feel fulfilled purposeful true to who i am  but to be honest music is hard and i wonder if i really am cut out of it or if this is just a woe is me type plea  i look at other natural born musicians and don t feel my reasons are as natural or pure as there s  to be honest with myself  and after a year of music and writing and thinking about  my craft  literally 24 fucking hours a day  i m just concluding this today  so it s hard t swallow but it feels freeing as i was struggling with the music and pushing myself to do it  to  make it  when it just felt off    so my question is what the fuck else can i do   oh and also i have a girl i love and that loves me too but because i m so fucking unstable i can t promise here i would stay by her indefinitely and give her such commitment    so i m basically aimless  broke  alone  25 years old where my friends are getting married and buying their first properties  and my dad kicked me out the house because he s just not happy with my decisions  appearance and tattoos i ve started getting    i m sorry to give my life story  i just couldn t think of better people to share it with perhaps for some advice    i am glad i never took the safe road  sure  but i just have nothing or no aim to show  that s hard  ,agy6vn
79,"""She will be mised... She wouldn't want us to get behind in our work""",this happened many years ago but it still upsets me   it was my first real job after college for a well known company  we'll call it cube farm  inc   we often had to work mandatory overtime because their salespeople over-promised what could reasonably be done   furthermore  our sister offices were unionized and their employees could not be forced to work ot   therefore  if the other offices got behind in their work  they would make us work their accouts because we had no protections in our southern state   yes  we got time and a half  but it gets tiresome doing 5-16 hours of mandatory ot every week because of management's poor planning   i didn't have children at the time and lived 5 minutes away and it was brutal for me  i felt bad people with small children and or long commutes    one of the long time supervisors was brutally murdered on a sunday morning  we'll call her jane  jane was also pregnant and her boyfriend allegedly killed her  but no one was ever charged in her death as far as i know   jane worked there for at least 10 years and had a large presence   people were understandably upset  after the funeral arrangements were made public  the director of the department gathered everyone together and said the following     jane was a valuable member of our team and she will be missed   unfortunately  her family chose to schedule her funeral in the middle of the week   many supervisors  and i will be going to the funeral  so the company's presence will be felt   so it's not necessary for you all to go   jane would not have wanted us to get behind in our work but if you must go  please know that you will not be granted pto  that you must make up your time from the funeral and if you do not complete your ot  you will face consequences   she tried to seem sympathetic but she failed miserably   i couldn't believe how cold she was   i didn't go to the funeral because i didn't know jane that well   most of my department did go anyway  so they had to make up about four hours of regular work in addition whatever ot we had that week    of course  jane's desk was quickly cleaned off and her job was posted the next week   ,ajc348

81,Politics and antiwork,the connection between wage labor and the state is so obvious  one  would have to be blind to miss it  and the sense among the working  class that wage labor is vital to their actual physical survival  translates into unquestioned support for the state  there is  in my  opinion  no chance to abolish wage labor without directly confronting  the wage workers on these issues  that is a tough mission no sane  communist wants to contemplate  you can t persuade workers to abandon  the state by reasoned arguments  you have to confront their attachment to wage slavery and the state head-on like you would confront their racism   nativism and nisogyny  ,afyq2h

Any ideas about any routes I can take to be happy?,hi  r antiwork  i'm a 17 year old sixth form student in the uk who is set to finish in june  there was a point where i was convinced that i was going to go to university  i got aab last year  it's not like i'm not capable  but nothing stuck - i can't imagine dedicating myself and 30k of my future savings to a career that i don't even know i'll enjoy and that'll dominate my life  so  the plan is to just get any old job once i finish  and earn while i plan my next move  thing is  i'm not sure what my next move is going to be  i need advice   seasonal work has piqued my interest  as i can't stomach the idea of full-time work with heavily regulated holidays  i've been looking into things such as outdoor instruction  e g  ski instructor  as it appeals to my interests and isn't an office job  a more 'professional' version of that that i've heard of is getting a contract-based job  such as nursing  and taking off with the money you've saved for a few months   my skills are all pretty much all creativity oriented  language is my main strength  and i'm very artistic  but picking a job based on what you love isn't necessarily the route to go down  even though it can make things easier  i just want to end up in a place where i earn enough to achieve my goals  such as travelling  but in a way that doesn't drive me crazy and that doesn't suck away all my time   i'm sure i'll think of something  but i'd really appreciate any tips  what's a good way of avoiding the corporate grind  yet still living a good life  what ways of earning can i pursue that fall in line with my antiwork mentality  i'll take any suggestions - deviating from the norm means doing the unorthodox  i have ideas  sure  but it's hard for me to make a decision  i'm naive and an overthinker by nature and trying to avoid the status quo doesn't exactly have a handbook  at least i have reddit   thanks in advance ,ag88aj

102,Do you think depression is more common in recent generations?,i've been depressed for a while  started maybe 6 years ago and gotten slightly worse since  it started for reasons i'd rather not go into towards the end of my time at college  uk  but after university and starting my first job it escalated  now in my third job and it's hitting new peaks    what surprises me more is how many of my friends that i've made at different stages in my life have been hit by it too  people that i'd never expect started to complain about the system we've got  we're all stuck in this trap of not being paid enough and having to deal with stupidly high rent prices just to make profit for people that were born at the right time  it's relentless  why shouldn't we give up  by the time those that hold us down die their children will have been taught their ways and the cycle will continue  there's no escaping  and even if there was  the easiest way out is to be holding other people down  we complain at each other as we wake up before the sun rises and crawl towards our positions  begging for a way out but without good fortune there won't be one    i'm not sure what i wanted from this  but i needed to vent about feeling punished for being born in a time when everyone has had their fun and you're here to clean up their party ,ag67oj
103,"Working ruins my health, mood, well being, creativity, vision.",before i was working i had like a month free  it was mushroom season  it was glorious  i lived so free  somedays i woke up early in the morning because i was so excited to barefoot around and hunt for mushrooms my family could eat later for dinner  thats probably the best feeling  also i have been outside alot and my vision was slowly improving  about 1 5 diopters in 3 months  because i was active focusing on distance vision alot  btw my vision goes kinda hand in hand with my mood  good vision   good mood  now that i have been working for a couple of months my vision has gotten worse again  my health is fucked  im tired  i don't feel good  im just down all the time and and coming up for air constantly     amp x200b   my question is now that i have some money whats the best way to go on about this  sure i can take alot of months off and live really good  but then i'll be broke again and forced into another job  so how can i think more long term  i might want to escape this sistem but that would mean moving out my parents house  getting a plot of land somewhere  build something on it and hope noone finds me and kicks me out  grow mostly my own food and try to keep expenses to a bare minimum  that would mean i would need to work like 4-5 months of the year  maybe i should get some animals or just do something that produces an income on that land and maybe im good  but damn land with building perment costs so much  i probably wont afford it in like few years  i mean land used for farming is muuuch cheaper but if i built anything on it it better be hidden really well because it's illegal  god knows what my family would think  hah  btw im from europe   tnx 4 reading ,akpc4f

106,It's impossible to ever go back to not being antiwork,i feel like learning how the world operates in terms of work is such an eye opener that's it basically like losing virginity  i can no longer start a new job being stuck somewhere 40 hours of my week doing bullshit for work and just shrug it off  i can no longer accept cuts in my pay because i simply finished a job too quick and told to go home  i can't accept a bully manager or one micromanaging 15 minutes of a so called  flexible schedule  i won't accept coworkers being ridiculed by others  i will not work one minute over if not getting paid for that minute  i lost my naive and innocent outlook   i sort of knew it all before or else i wouldn't have held off working until my late 20s  i lived in a bubble of family and college for a long time  i dreaded the thought of typical work  but i still entered workforce with a optimistic outlook  i did the minimum wage restaurant job  did commission sales at retail  stocked shelves  physical labor  manly  jobs  drove here and there  did the 9-5 at a pretencious educational facility  etc  i've been sucker punched enough in only a few years to make it seem like 40   once you start reading articles and books about our work culture it's even harder to go back  you find online communities like this and it really sinks in  you're not alone  yeah you may be that one ant out of your colony that will not slave away for the queen  but you find there are other ants feeling the same   never go back into the cave  the matrix  the prison  whatever you want to call it  ,alq9fs

110,Do any of you feel allergic to society because you can't find peace with work? Are any of you older than 30 that find yourselves here?,i don't even have boredom as an excuse  though that's obvious   in two years  i was fired from several temp jobs  superfluous for some  late  unlucky    in two  bosses just decided i was stupid  no matter what i did  in one of them  i know anxiety made me dumb  in another  a younger teammate fucked up shared assignments  i was blamed  it was that simple  my employer actively encouraged and condoned bullying too    if any of you are underemployed or you're another living joke of a grad with the  useless  degree whose entire life has no value you might know what i'm talking about   i think the worst thing is  i'm a quiet  awkward  low stamina person  i'm not unfriendly but i garble  there are moments in interviews or conversing with others where i viscerally feel sweaty and twitch with anxiety fatigue while smiling   that's enough    that  and course  coming into work being too old to be as low value as you are   i am antiwork for many reasons but i think the incredible hostility to training if you are not  chosen  is the worst of them    that and the 8 30-6 schedule  which it's humiliating and an admission like a crime  i physically can't do it without wanting to kill myself every day    that's enough to be totally unemployable in most of america and most jobs  frankly  it's also enough if you don't have a lenient boss  to be deemed a bad apple    it's funny - that's my big vice    in the office where i was blamed for every mistake a young  nasty  bratty coworker made and treated like a fucking imbecile even when i did more than my share of a project correctly  my bosses fell in live with a literal ex convict who harassed me repeatedly and gossiped ruthlessly    if you relate i'm listening  i'm venting here because the despair and anxiety while i recover is like the perpetual need to vomit up my own self  past  life    if i were likable  attractive  and the sort of person that could actually be trained through failure problem solving - the ideal way to grow as an employee i would still dislike this  i would still think capitalism is a fucking evil scam  especially now  a threat to citizen well-being and democracy  a poisonous con where human beings are commanded to compete with machines as you travel down the ladder and abused on that basis  humiliated  expected to do three jobs under one title for 1 3 the salary of what they would have earned - with training  - before the recession    but i could hide  i might foster a little personhood for myself    this is my entire life  especially i am very  very old  30  and still treated as entry level with no real way to gain new skill  continuing ed courses are treated as shit and worse some of us really need a classroom someone to ask questions of   when i found out i had a hernia  the second biggest concern i had after thinking about surgery was how this would already add to my unemployability  ,ah0jn5

115,I recently found this subreddit and I’m curious about it.,just a bit of context   i m currently working my first job and it s absolutely miserable  granted  i work part time at a subway and subway is an easy job  i get that  but damn it is so tiring being on your feet all day  and it s so exhausting having everyone bark orders at you   so i can t remember how i discovered this subreddit exactly  but i think someone linked it in the comments of some viral post a while back  anyway  i was curious as to why this subreddit exists exactly  are you all here to talk about why working a typical 9-5 is horrible   like my philosophy professor once said   isn t the 9-5 a type of slavery  or do you all have some sort of knowledge or speculation about working less   side note  i hope that this type of text post is allowed here  if not  please let know and i ll remove it  i apologize in advance ,acq7zp
116,What makes you hate work? What were you doing before you came to this sub? How many of you have experienced unemployment?,i'll be frank  i'm probably older than a lot of you   i graduated ten years ago  spent many years in grad school and getting paid minimum wage and burnt out before i could finish my degree  i was in early childhood  held in contempt even more than other teaching    i was steered into it when i was batshit crazy by a parent who panicked and also was and remains psychologically abusive    i am ashamed of my entire life  the last time i felt like any  self  i had got a voice during my day to day life or felt equal with other people - and close - was high school    my college degree is useless  the real sick joke is that in the years since  i can see that even the side employable skills like excel were offered to business school students at my alma mater they sure as fuck weren't in my major  even though i was in the social sciences and took a stats class  all since forgotten and my weak point    i'm pretty dumb  and i accept it  i think of myself as somewhat thoughtful emotionally  it's not a virtue valued socially  it's not interesting  and it's not employable   coding is employable  being really strong quantitatively is employable everywhere  being able to grasp a mathematical concept  knowing how to invest  being able to turn b s  into that's employable    i never had that acumen but i'm not particularly good at anything else    society and all of happiness is based off of living up to others' designations of your worth  it goes beyond capitalism  but i am completely ill-suited to capitalism  especially now  i am not physically hearty  for a skilled trade  i think jobs that require people to be off their feet for more than two hours are literally torture   nurses might have to endure that  but there is no reason someone working in retail shouldn't get a stool   even if it's inevitable a lot of jobs will suck because the demand for certain skills change - it is too embarrassing to admit that about yourself    - i hate that nothing i can do is valued enough even for me to be trained or kept around  something i wonder if any of you experience  i'm not just anti work because work sucks - i'm anti work because i don't belong anywhere  in a capitalistic society    it wasn't for lack of effort but the effort came too late and it's flawed   - i hate the stench unemployment carries  it is beyond humiliating being a contractor and having nothing but that on a resume - insulted by the same sorts of recruiters you enrich - when you are out of school  in 2018  my temp experience is comparable to a criminal record  if they were internships  and i were 22  it might be different  i have had recruiter after recruiter tell me i'm a piece of garbage after milking my resume for leads or wasting my time with interviews and then never calling back    even when i think   hey  this was real work for  someone each time i look for work again  and i'll have to  - i don't have a resume  if your experience isn't valued  your resume is a list of sins and failures  a confession    - i hate the ageism i feel burning on me  i have no time left  my health is shit  - it feels like a roadblock to getting a salesforce cert or studying to get into a bootcamp or an mba  ha  i am anxious and just  can't do it  i can't even begin   if i have get in what i worry about is failure    the only jobs i can get are worthless  benefit-less  come with no security whatsoever  even less than so many perm jobs  and pay shit  this year for the first time the simple effect of sitting in a frigid office and a shit chair left me with back  shoulder and hand pain i spent all week with  it's frightening - i know what a privilege it is to sit   - i hate the 9-5  8 30-6 30  8-6  with a mandatory  unpaid lunch   in america  unless you're a programmer  if you can't do that schedule and you haven't earned the right to come in later  you're a fucking lowlife  and honestly  even 10 can be rough  depending on your commute    my boss tolerated me coming in at 10 15  i stayed late  she hated it and i get why  it meant she didn't invest in me  and even though she told me otherwise  it made me easy to fire with the other four people let go from a team of ten  she gave me nine months  i'm still grateful but i know i'm back at square one  i'm horrified at my own physical weakness    waking up  being cognizant  pushing through the mix of fatigue  loneliness  anxiety  and unfocusedness  that guiding this post  to put on makeup  drink coffee  shit  pee fifty times  and sweatily jog to the subway  and deal with any fun surprises with that  - it is the worst part of working to me  the fucking worst     i hate that my biological clock puts me to sleep at 1am  wakes me up at 11am  and makes the 9-6 schedule an actual physical torture  if i say that out loud anywhere  maybe eve here  - you're told you're a weak  lazy piece of shit with no character     i don't think i am  but in a system where other people are told the workday starts at 9am  and they can do that of course i feel like one  i'm made one    - i hate the fucking indignity of the open office  the paranoia  everyone can watch you be slighted  and you can watch how people that are valued are treated  totally unable to relax  to glower  i felt myself being watched every time i got up to drink coffee and pee   - i hate how much of work is social performance  i realize constant  grinding fatigue makes small talk and just retaining information so much harder    choosing to come in for the later shifts when given the option and even then inevitably being late - five minutes  ten minutes  fifteen minutes- makes me seem like a criminal  and makes me feel like one  i get it - it's important to be on time    the longer i stay in a job  going to sleep in pain and waking up in more pain  the harder it was  that actually is humiliating   needless to say  90  of the misery is based off the sheer physical expectation attached to work in capitalism    - and finally - i hate the loneliness of work    ,aem94t

118,A Rant From a 22 Year Old,hey everyone  i'm new to this sub but these are ideas i've agreed with for as long as i can remember  i have actually thought about work and  progress  a lot since then and these are a few things i've come to the conclusion of  so far  i'm really open minded and open to discussion on any of them    amp x200b    summary  true progression is not being achieved currently  due to crab in a bucket mentality  and lack of knowledge as to other options  movements like what this subreddit promotes will help heal the people and make the world a much better place    amp x200b     we are not  truly  progressing as a society even with all of our hours we are putting in       contrary to what i've heard before  having more children is not progression as a species  living longer lives is not necessarily progression either  what does it matter if you live for 70 years  especially after 50  of those years spending 5 7 days for someone else  by the time you have any amount of money saved up and can stop working your body is already one leg in the grave  not to mention your mind        we essentially live until we get to the point that we lose our minds and then are subject to relentless marketing  infomercials  gambling  alcohol  more and more people are being born into this system and see absolutely none of the good stuff when its good  but still have to experience all of the bad when its bad     amp x200b     people are usually bitter to you if you do not work and they do       i just came back home after being on the road for a couple of months  i've been having car trouble and because of the holidays i haven't been able to get my car in the shop for a while  so i'm staying at my parents place  on the floor  my mother and father have an oddly strong work ethic considering how they are when they are off of work  but for a bit of background ever since i've turned 16 they've been hounding me to get a job so i could buy stuff even though i had just about everything i could ever need   they make a crazy amount of money yet growing up i remember they would always say how they couldn't buy stuff because we were living paycheck to paycheck  my dad wakes up at 4 and then gets ready and after his commute he gets to work at 7  he usually comes home around 6 and then proceeds to get drunk           in this little anecdote  which i've also had confirmed to me by asking my friends about their parents  i'm trying to say how it's obvious they are both unhappy and in need of some form of escape  yet they think work is the only way forward  if work really was good  where would the yelling come from  where would the alcoholism  divorce rate  and drug use rate  including prescription  come from     amp x200b     people expect work to be unpleasant       of course  at some points work can be hard  and uncomfortable  this is the process of growth and it would be just as wrong to do something that didn't make you a little bit uncomfortable  and at the end of the day work is still  work  but for some reason it really doesn't sit right with me to have a real person working a completely unproductive job  it's essentially a mental prison where you get to distract your mind from your shitty life in exchange to be able to go home after confinement to relax and stuff yourself to get some energy for the next day  think of all of the time for art and social interaction and searching for meaning we could have if we just worked less  it's a lot harder to be impatient when you actually have an abundance of time and patience is something everybody could work on    amp x200b     for men especially and  increasingly for women  a lot of people will think less of you if you work an  unprestigious  job        i'm really happy right now  i have a beautiful girlfriend  i've been on a roadtrip for a while and just working minimally for food  and i've been getting a lot of time for all the things i love  reading  writing  making friends  yet on at least two occasions people have criticized my life decisions because they aren't societally ideal  no college  no job  no desire for success  and don't get me wrong  i respect the opinion of each of these people and have been looking to see how i can improve  but i can tell these aren't the happiest people  it's a common thing i've noticed  people give you weird looks if you are ever walking around and smiling or laughing  people go like  why the fuck is that guy so happy  it's a polarizing thing but unhappy people tend to create more unhappy people in my experience  because of that i have always tried my hardest to be as positive and kind as possible to everyone i meet and to not let any negative person drag me down  people are deeply sad right now even if not obvious  movements like these are going to be what hopefully starts the healing of our countries spirit   a final little note    amp x200b   this is probably not the coherent  i didn't write this with any structure in mind so excuse the rambling bits but i hope the message rings clear  work is increasingly becoming less and less of the answer as our work moves away from directly satisfying survival needs  we find no great long term joy in being a grocery clerk bagger  what we find joy in is making a deep connection  teaching someone or being taught  finding love  having a family  these are the things that really matter  and we need to bring them back ,ac0kdf

121,Being lied to by older generations,so i had a bit of a fight with my mother yesterday  both of my parents are late baby boomers early gen x  and i wrote out why i've been angry for months to them  essentially  stating that i've been lied to  having a college degree is necessary to get a good job and setting yourself apart  that working hard and playing by the rules will reap rewards  that staying loyal to a company will benefit me    amp x200b   but it's all a lie  or a scam at least  sure  you need an education to be proficient in certain fields  but with the amount of debt you accrue will put you back years before you can save up  invest  or work on building yourself  as degrees become more common  it is harder to market yourself as different  so it comes to networking-which i feel benefits people who are already rich or with social capital  i'm not fond of networking either  it is forced and fake from my experience  and that doesn't even guarantee you anything  staying loyal to a company doesn't mean much nowadays  pay raises aren't as high as they used to be  wages are stagnant compared to the standard of living  and you sometimes will be stuck with retail fast food jobs for college graduates  that's not even considering jobs may force you to start part time and earn your way to full time or that even entry-level jobs require years of experience in the field to even be considered    amp x200b   and their response  to be hopeful and keep my head up  that my life will turn around  that my generation struggles with being patient and feeling we are owed something  but things are worse and continue to get worse  people my age are starting to get on their feet and be independent in their 30s while previous generations could start in their early 20s with less debt and a higher wage considering inflation  i just feel stuck in my current situation because it will take several years before i can comfortably say i can live on my own-which i crave because i like being independent  ,ad6ue3

126,Short text from Alan Watts, so this goes very deep into us  it goes deep  deep  deep into a problem we have about guilt  i wonder often if there's any relationship between guilt and gold - that the love of money is the root of evil  it's a very true saying  because you see i was saying yesterday that the difference between having a job and having a vocation is that a job is some unpleasant work you do in order to make money  with the sole purpose of making money  and there are plenty of jobs because there is still a certain amount of dirty work that nobody wants to do and that therefore they will pay someone to do it  there is essentially less and less of that  that kind of work because of mechanization  but if you do a job  if you do a job with the sole purpose of making money  you are absurd  because if money becomes the goal  and it does when you work that way  you begin increasingly to confuse it with happiness - or with pleasure   yes  one can take a whole handful of crisp dollar bills and practically water your mouth over them  but this is a kind of person who is confused  like a pavlov dog  who salivates on the wrong bell  it goes back you see to the ancient guilt that if you don't work you have no right to eat  that if there are others in the world who don't have enough to eat  you shouldn't enjoy your dinner even though you have no possible means of conveying the food to them  and while it is true that we are all one human family and that every individual involves every other individual  while it is true therefore we should do something about changing the situation   alan watts ,acilz6
127,I have a feeling this essay will be meaningful here in a way it won't anywhere else - on generational burnout and late capitalism: https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work?utm_source=dynamic&amp;utm_campaign=bffbbuzzfeedreader&amp;ref=bffbbuzzfeedreader,anne helen peterson writes for buzzfeed and honestly the way she talked about millennials smacked hard of the  snowflakes line  people hear so often but she brings it home    the truth is - i'm an older millennial    i'm supposed to be senior in a career  i never started one  i graduated into the recession and a series of fear-based decisions means i am a perpetual temp if i'm lucky  my psychological and physical health get worse  i live in perpetual fear of being without health coverage  i am poor enough to have state insurance this year  i live in fear of tripping the wire    even in an essay like this  i feel invisible  i would kill to be 25 and making 50k a year and paralyzed by errands    i am  from shitty  minimum-wage jobs where a snitty  shitty recruiter a decade my junior pockets half of my wages and my benefits so an employer can cut me loose in six months   anyhoo - https www buzzfeednews com article annehelenpetersen millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work utm source dynamic amp utm campaign bffbbuzzfeedreader amp ref bffbbuzzfeedreader   i think it covers anxiety about work  image  and how those are linked very well  i think about both constantly   the importance of working in american life just as part of a social narrative is something that has tormented me for a long time and she talks about it eloquently here too    some key paragraphs  after she talks about social media and the exhortation to  brand  oneself -    the more work we do  the more efficient we ve proven ourselves to be  the worse our jobs become  lower pay  worse benefits  less job security  our efficiency hasn t bucked wage stagnation  our steadfastness hasn t made us more valuable  if anything  our commitment to work  no matter how exploitative  has simply encouraged and facilitated our exploitation  we put up with companies treating us poorly because we don t see another option  we don t quit  we internalize that we re not striving hard enough  and we get a second gig       one of the ways to think through the mechanics of millennial burnout is by looking closely at the various objects and industries our generation has supposedly  killed  we ve  killed  diamonds because we re getting married later  or not at all  and if or when we do  it s rare for one partner to have the financial stability to set aside the traditional two months  salary for a diamond engagement ring  we re killing antiques  opting instead for  fast furniture    not because we hate our grandparents  old items  but because we re chasing stable employment across the country  and lugging old furniture and fragile china costs money that we don t have  we ve exchanged sit-down casual dining  applebee s  tgi fridays  for fast casual  chipotle et al  because if we re gonna pay for something  it should either be an experience worth waiting in line for  cronuts  world-famous bbq  momofuku  or efficient as hell   even the trends millennials have popularized   like athleisure   speak to our self-optimization  yoga pants might look sloppy to your mom  but they re efficient  you can transition seamlessly from an exercise class to a skype meeting to child pickup  we use fresh direct and amazon because the time they save allows us to do more work   this is why the fundamental criticism of millennials   that we re lazy and entitled   is so frustrating  we hustle so hard that we ve figured out how to avoid wasting time eating meals and are called entitled for asking for fair compensation and benefits like working remotely  so we can live in affordable cities  adequate health care  or 401 k s  so we can theoretically stop working at some point before the day we die  we re called whiny for talking frankly about just how much we do work  or how exhausted we are by it  but because overworking for less money isn t always visible   because job hunting now means trawling linkedin  because  overtime  now means replying to emails in bed   the extent of our labor is often ignored  or degraded   it's long but good     lol  and still does not touch those of us whose capacity to labor is simply not valued  ,adico2
128,Just read this AntiWork post and I have a few question regarding the comments and such,just found this post  linked below  and i decided to read all he comments to see what it s all about  i recently finished a macroeconomics course so naturally this topic relates closely to what i just finished studying   the point the op seems to be trying to make is that when   the buying power of a group of people increases by way of an increase in wages  the buying power of those who did not receive the same increase percentage-wise will actually decrease  according to the macroeconomic standards  this is because at  x hr  mr  johnny appleseed can afford product a at  d  but if mr  johnny appleseed s wages increase to  y hr  he could still afford product a at  d with much more leftover   or at least  that s how you think it would work  see  the producers of product a have workers too  they have minimum wage workers who also had their wages raised to  y hr  and it s not like product a is some super valuable and desirable product  just because people can buy more of it doesn t necessarily mean that they will  so the money to cover the cost of paying higher salaries has to come from somewhere  and more often then not  that money comes in the form of an increase in prices  so product a is longer being sold at price  d  it is now sold at price  f  so now  the people who were making  x hr and could only afford so much of product a at price  d are now making  y hr and and afford about the same amount of product a as before when it s sold at price  f   meanwhile mrs  jane doe over here who saw no change whatsoever to her salary of  z hr now has to purchase product a at price  f instead of  d  her buying power is now worth less than before because the price increased but the wages did not because the employer couldn t afford it  they already have other minimum wage employees and those mandatory raises are nearly bankrupting the company  they can t afford to give raises that match the inflation in prices  so those who were making  z hr now have less buying power altogether   apply this same process to the entire economy  from grocery stores to to the housing market  and that s basically how inflation works   all of that seems to be specifically what the op was trying to argue  regardless of how eloquent he was or wasn t  i do also see the side of those corporations whose ceo s hoard moneys away like a squirrel with nuts  they should be recirculating the money they make to increase the economy s success in growing  i 100  agree  however  we cannot force then to do so anymore than we can force our neighbors to spend their own savings just to boost the economy  unfortunately  if we want to see change  we have to be the change ourselves   my question now is  even though wage increases are good things  is there a better way to bring about wage increases than forcing employers to pay them  i ask this because in some cases  employers have had to fire other employees just to keep doors open and some have even gone bankrupt already  the place i work at is struggling already and i actually fear for my job at this point  the large corporations who are hedge funded can handle all of this  but small family-owned business are suffering hard because they can t employees enough people to maintain there businesses   that s all folks    r antiwork https www reddit com r antiwork comments ae7ihh nyc just raised the minimum wage to 15 i do st jqpgnfl1 amp sh 83fc4a6c ,ae9dyi

133,Step one: do not ever allow any job to control your life.,hey folks  long-time poster here  i wanted to try and share a story advice with you all concerning the concept of jobs and the mental cage they  attempt  to put us in    amp x200b    approximately two years ago  i broke out of the prison known as depression  i battled it for about one year  although it was caused by many things  i can say without a doubt that the main culprit was  jobs  solely being seen as a tool  constantly being disrespected  my life outside of work  better known as   my real life  not being taken seriously  being threatened and talked down to  getting injured from the job and once again not being taken seriously  being surrounded by fakers and masks  the list goes on i had put up with these things for so long that eventually i came to just view them as  normal  and the  adult life   i had been caged    the job was all i thought about  my life wasn't even mine anymore  i was always worried about what  my wannabe masters   the managers supervisors employees thought of me  doing absolutely ridiculous and degrading things just for the sake of trying to get them to think well of me  in my worthless pursuit for their  love  i had totally lost myself    my passions  gone    my joy  gone   my happiness  gone   my loves  gone   my peace  gone   my creativity  gone   my ambitions  gone   my life  gone  my self  gone   but my  loyalty  and  dedication  to these jobs stayed  coincidence  i don't believe so    the system is built to slowly make jobs all human beings think about  who cares about all that other stuff in your life  it's not going to make your employer richer  you are just a tool  a pawn in the game    amp x200b   i noticed that no matter how kind i tried to be with the people at these jobs  the end result was the still the same  they didn't think any higher of me and they still repeated the same behavior at the end of the day   but  like the fool i was i just blamed myself for that  i would call myself a loser and that i should take the blame  i mean  the job was everything to me  and the people there were the greatest ever  if they still looked down on me  then that means i must be a total failure    amp x200b     no    amp x200b   the exact day that i left that job  i swear to you all that the light had finally started its fight against the darkness  it amazes me to this day that that was all i needed to open my eyes  a detachment  i began realizing everything about how foolish i was  i realized that those people were not my friends  i realized that i was my own person  i realized that i was free  i realized what life really was  and thankfully  i began remembering everything about myself  i reclaimed everything  from my passions  to my old friends  to my hobbies  to my favorite tv shows  i got myself back    and now  two years later  it's only gotten better  i now know that jobs are simply a means of getting money  that is it  i don't invest any feelings  passion  or attachment of any sort into them  if i'm there  i do only what the job entails  treat people with basic levels of respect  and get out of there  nothing more  i keep my life defended from every job  never allowing them to trespass into it  honestly  if i'm not clocked in  my mind is completely void of all things related to a job  i will never allow them to control me again   the reason being that my life is literally everything  it's all i have  and there's no way that i'm going to let it be tainted because of a few greedy individuals who only care about how much work i can do for them at the end of the day   to all of you reading  i encourage you to do the same  reclaim your mind  and your life  stop calling days that you're not being used your  days off  these are just your days  stop calling your nights of comfort in your home and space  work nights  and filling your mind with dread related to a job  don't even give them that power over you  and stop going to a job expecting to find your life's purpose or  second home  i can't imagine someone ever finding those things in a place they're only at for money      amp x200b   your life is yours    amp x200b ,ac4w6r

137,In remembrance of /u/-red-ataraxia,many of us can relate    https www reddit com r depression comments 3dvvep misery in terms of 40 hour work week https www reddit com r depression comments 3dvvep misery in terms of 40 hour work week    gt you and me  i think we're the exact fucking same    i have an hour long commute  i have to wake up at 5 am  leave at 6 am  and be in by 7  i leave at 3 pm  and make it home at 4  i have to go to bed at 9 pm in order to wake up the next day not feeling like tired shit because the human body is a disgustingly inefficient thing    the instant i get home at 4 30 pm  my mind goes into timer mode  i start counting the hours  the minutes  sometimes even the seconds  i have exactly four and a half hours to do things i want to do before i have to go back to the slog the next day  i need to cram that time with as much of the things i want to do as possible    my weekends are the same  i wake up  and i start counting  saturdays are less of a problem usually because i can wake up when i want and go to sleep whenever i want  but it's still there casting a shadow over everything  i get one day  one day out of seven where i don't feel stressed about waking up when i have to and sleeping when i have to  and when saturday starts  i have twelve or fourteen or sixteen hours before sunday  when sunday starts  i have until 9 pm until my weekend is over    when the forty-hour work week starts to get to you like it does to me  you start feeling stifled for time  and the paycheck you receive starts feeling worthless  because it's not like you can use that money to buy the time back    this is your life  ending one hour  one minute  one second at a time  for forty hours a week  maybe even more    if anyone asks you out  whether it's your so or your friends  your parents  anyone  even if your relationships with them are happy and healthy  your brain can't help but make an automatic calculation  how much of my time will this take  how much will i have left until i have to go back to work  and when even the slightest thing goes wrong--if you forgot to get something at the store  if there's traffic  if someone makes a mistake and costs you more time  you start to resent it  you resent that delay  and the people who caused that delay  for wasting the precious free time you have  and every hour  every minute  every second that slips away is time that you don't get to spend doing the things you want to do    things you used to enjoy no longer provide the same fulfillment  because you can't stop that clock  you can't stop counting the hours  the minutes  the seconds  even if you're enjoying yourself  even if you're having a blast and accomplishing a lot  even if at the end of the day you feel like a champion who is closer to your dream  that shadow is there  telling you that  you only have this many hours  this many minutes  this many seconds left until you go back  like a guillotine slowly inching its way towards your neck  and when you're having fun  that realization causes you to get jerked back into the real world    hey  fucker  have a good time  i hope you did  because it's another forty hours until you can even start to get it back  now start lifting  jackass  your life doesn't become yours until we say it does    my job doesn't suck  the work is nothing special  if a little tiring  but it's not murdering me  i work at a good company  my co workers are good people  my boss is a pretty understanding guy who always tries to be fair and helps out whenever he can  my pay isn't anything stellar but it's liveable  and some people would envy having it  20 an hour    but i get the sense that i'd feel like this with the vast majority of work  forty hour work weeks  no matter what  get tedious  become meaningless  burn me out  the only way i can avoid it is to not work a day in my life--to do a job that i love  but how many people get jobs they love  how many people get paid liveable wages  enough to have a room and food  doing what they love  how many people even  know  what it is that they love to even pursue it in the first place    the fact that the starving artist is a running joke in america--someone going hungry trying to do what they love--is the cruel reality  and the fact that we're okay with it and point and laugh with everyone else  even fake laughter  is the cruelest reality imaginable    you want to do what you love  fuck you  that's not how the real fucking world works  shitheel  now hop to it  you've got forty hours of work to do  and if you want to fucking eat  you better fucking do it    i'm reminded of that movie  in time  starring justin timberlake  it's a movie about a dystopian future where money has no more meaning  and people trade time  a coffee might cost thirty seconds  a cab fare might cost two minutes  a high quality mountain bicycle might be four months  a new sedan might be nine years    there's a watch everyone has embedded in their arm that tells them how much time they have  and when the number reaches zero  they die  some people have hundreds of years of time  some people live minute to minute    that's what i feel like  that some people have the rest of their lives to look forward to  with their 90 years of time  and here i am  scraping by with only a few hours on my clock every day before the clock hits zero and i die    and in america  you can't talk to anyone about it  nobody at all  not really  because even if some individual people might sympathize and wish they had less working hours alongside you  society will think of you as a lazy piece of shit who just wants to mooch off of others  all because you're not willing to surrender forty hours a week  one hundred and sixty hours a month  one thousand nine hundred and twenty hours a year for a paycheck  and you have to convince yourself that you need this paycheck  that you need this money in order to not get fucked in the ass by taxes and bills  you try  you try so  hard  to justify it  you need this money  you need to give up these forty hours to live  this is necessary  you try    but it doesn't work  not really  not until it's too late    i've been trying to search for a job where i can work from a home office  but for someone like me  there's no options  everything requires more schooling  more experience  and getting schooling or experience requires time and money i don't have and can't get  and even then  i've only been at this job for a few months  i can't quit yet because i need to stay long enough for it to look good on my resume    i know drugs will make it worse  alcohol will make it worse  the most i can do is try to anesthetize myself with the activities that i used to like  activities that used to give my life meaning and purpose  i used to enjoy these things  but now the most these things can give me--these things i used to love and enjoy--is a distraction  a temporary illusion that i'm not miserable  which wears off at 9 pm every day    there's a light at the end of the tunnel  and i can only hope that it's a train ,ad7nic

143,"Easiest night of ""work"" ever",i know we mostly post depressing shit  which is totally fine  but i thought i would share this   so as some of you may know  i work with dogs at a boarding facility  now that the holidays are gone i guess a lot less dogs are here overnight on the weekends  today we have three dogs   all i had to do was take them outside with a co-worker  make sure they had water and put them back in and done  took less than 10 minutes  now i have the rest of the night to myself  i work from 10 30 pm to 7 00 am   and i actually get paid  even if i fall asleep  apparently you need manager ok but i never have listened to that  if the dogs need me  they will make it known   anyways  a few hrs to myself before a 4 hr nap and then do it again and go home for another nap  time for some netflix ,addqq4
144,The perspective of a teenager who's discovering the reality of jobs,a little bit of context  i'm 18  finished high school in 2017  i'm currently a student and i'm not from the us  i'm from argentina  i come from a family where no one works 8 hours or more a day and everyone has at least a month of vacations  my mom works at a school 5 hours a day with two-months vacations  she has like 10 free days  besides sick days  my dad would be the exception  because he's a trucker so when he travels he pretty much works all day  but he also gets to spend months without working  no one close works at a private company  maybe because there aren't many where i live  they either work for the government or are independent  and they don't experience much stress  i used to go to school for 4 hours a day  and had almost four months of vacation  not to mention that there were plenty of  missed days  it was pretty cool and i loved to spend my time pursuing my hobbies and doing things i enjoyed    for most of my life i imagined work as something you did for 4-5 hours a day with at least one month of vacation  but some time ago i was at university and looked at the it job offers  out of curiosity  because i luckily don't need a job  for private companies  and all of them were a 9 to 6  with one hour of lunch  not only that  but the vacation offered was only two-weeks long in most cases  i investigated more on the internet about people working at such companies  and some people mentioned working extra hours  or being called about work-related stuff when they're at home  i was shocked  i discovered that this is pretty much the norm at most private companies in my country  and now that i'm paying more attention to people mentioning jobs on reddit  it's almost always a 9 to 5 job  and usually at companies  i also keep hearing about it in movies and videos  reading about in articles  i thought  how is this just considered the normal thing to do  i'm starting to think this is even more common in the u s  maybe it's because you have a lot of companies there  and companies tend to have that type of schedule  how rare are part-time jobs there    i feel like i discovered a part of the adult world i was unaware of before  and it's honestly sad  how do people even find time to do all house chores  hang out with friends s o  go to the gym  pursue a hobby  etc  maybe for young single people it's doable  but i can't imagine how people with kids find enough time    i guess a lot of people would call me naive or spoiled by complaining about this  but i really can't imagine myself being at work from 9 to 6  unless you're extremely passionate about what you do  it doesn't seem good  i actually mentioned it to my parents and they agreed that it's too much  my mom even adviced me to avoid full-time jobs  i just hope i can find part-time jobs  since i don't think not working is an option     i agree with the ideas presented in this subreddit  it would better if we had an option not to work at all  but i think that if most people could at least work less hours and in better environments  it would much more bearable and there would be much less stress  some people may be happy working  and that's ok  but i don't think it's what we're all meant to do  some people may even like working  8 hours a day  and it's ok  but i definitely don't think we should all do it  everyone has different rhythms  different tastes  different needs  and it doesn't make sense to try to force everyone into the same type of life  ,acc7f2

146,Adding my ramble to the mix,i took a degree in archaeology that  while i don't regret it  it's considered useless since it can't be used for profit unless i assist oil and gas in destroying the environment  and destroying historical sites  non o amp g jobs only open up if you have a masters and if someone dies retires so i don't have much of a chance  and i can't afford a masters nor did i get good enough marks or have enough experience    i've spent 4 years at this dead end job unrelated to my degree  being absolutely shit on by all but one manager  working my ass off while i'm told to be grateful for a  1 raise above minimum wage after 4 fucking years  i do the work of 2-3 people because no one else will  or i spend the slow days here staring at a fucking screen  wasting my time  when i could be at home doing shit that actually matters to me  i'm exhausted with nothing to show for it  because all my money goes to basic needs  and helping my family not end up homeless    i've hated every job i've had prior to this  i try to change jobs and i get absolutely no call backs  everything requires you to pay through the fucking nose for certifications for apprenticeships  when what they'd teach you in school is what they're supposed to be teaching as part of an apprenticeship  i'm so fucking sick of having to pay an atrocious amount just to be able to work to make money to pay off those debts   but i'm at the point now where i'm questioning what the point is  when i'll undoubtedly hate that next job eventually too  and to get out of this system i'd have to work my ass off to save to be able to afford something like starting a commune or something  i feel so stuck and i have no idea how to get out of this  short of suicide  everything is so fake  and i'm constantly wondering why i can't just be a happy little consumer  eagerly earning my pittance wages so i can buy the next cool thing  the people who surround me are happy with that  it's to the point i don't even want to see my friends because i'm fed up with the discussion of  what should i buy next  by my rich friends  and the determination my poor friends have to achieve that  no one considers that there might be something better  and everyone is too afraid of change to try to work at it    i'm so tired of humans devaluing anything that doesn't make profit  i'm tired of the fakeness of our society  i'm tired of these oil and gas rednecks that i have to live with corrupting everything  the yellow vest movement started here  and i was eager to join  until it turned out to be neo nazis thinking its a world wide anti immigrant movement and an opportunity to push a pipeline down our throats  they're incapable of comprehending anything beyond their next dirty dollar   there's no point to this post  i come to work every day and slowly get angrier as i waste my time being told to try to make the most profit i can while selling an essential medical device  it makes me fucking sick    tell me how you got out of this shit pile  or how you plan to  or just tell me something to take my mind off the constant internal screaming that consumes me daily  ,adwuum

160,Quick Rant,just discovered this sub a few days ago  i work in marketing  however i'm a one person marketing team at my office  that sounds like something that would keep me very busy  and 3 4's of the year it does  however  the industry i'm in is almost entirely dead in the winter  so from november to march i come in from 8 00 - 5 30 and sit at a desk for 8 5 hours with a mandatory 1 hour lunch break  my day to day work can be accomplished in roughly 1-2 hours on an average day  maybe i'll respond to 5-10 emails and take a few phone calls throughout the rest of the day  but really i'm just sitting here pretending to look busy with reddit opened on one screen and my completed work open on another  i could easily do about 90  of my work from home and at least be productive during the day but i am forced to sit here for 8 5 hours because that's  how things have always been  it truly bothers me and makes absolutely no sense to me that i can't just come in for 2 hours and get all my work done and go on about my day answering emails and phone calls when they come  ,adxum4

164,The Gig Economy and Work,i feel particularly motivated today to write a piece on the so-called   gig economy  three words  don't  fall  for  it  i am desperate to find some kind of work soon because i need to do big things like pay rent and utilities and put food on the table so i am part of the typical demographic that companies like ubereats  grubhub  postmates  and others go after  they make promises of 16-18 dollars per hour which are just patently false  they make claims about being able to work whenever you want  on your schedule and time  they tout one of the benefits as being self-employed  let's break this down a little bit further to discover the lies of respective marketing departments   1  self-employment  you're not actually self-employed but you're an independent contractor  you still want to carry some form of worker's compensation so if you get injured  you're taken care of  in a real self-employment situation  you would be able to set the rates at which you're willing to work  the gig economy sends you a job and there is no negotiating the rate at which you'll be compensated  it is a set rate at which you must take  you risk having your contract terminated if you accept a job and then cancel later  you also become the subject of gamification in which the company gives you meaningless donkey and carrot incentives which add up to scraps when compared to what the company has made at your expense  2  16-18 dollars per hour  factor in the cost of gasoline  insurances  commercial insurance and workman's comp  wear and tear on your car  and you might actually be earning  less than minimum wage  the 16-18 dollar range they quote is predicated on having no business expenses  clever bastard from hell marketers  3  work whenever you want  no  that's not necessarily true either  you need to work when the demand is high for a service  if you work when demand is low  you're in a net loss situation   you're better off working a terrible minimum wage job than in the gig economy  just don't do it  ,acw346
