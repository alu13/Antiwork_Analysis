6,We’re one big happy family...,this is what the owner of my company said to me in my latest review   over the last 6 months i have had part of my finger amputated due to a workplace accident i wasnt given much support whilst away having surgery and upon my return i took on the role of producing work from start to finish which was sold for thousands of s i am an apprentice and i earn much less than minimum wage once i completed several pieces of work i asked for wage rise to minimum wage so that i could afford to live the owners of the company dug their heals in gave me bad monthly reviews stating that i do not accomplish enough to earn minimum wage again my work has been sold for a total of 16k over a 3 month period i eventually managed to get a small raise from them but now theyve made it very clear that i am not liked within the company   yeahfamily,ei9kh0
7,Homelessness in my city is getting really bad,im from london and its gotten so bad in the last two years like the stations just filled with homeless people as in loads of them its awful   ive noticed theyre getting younger and theres more women on the streets too also you can tell who has been made newly homeless because their clothes and overall appearance tell you this is a recent situation that theyve fallen into   i think a lot of people are only 3 or 4 paychecks away from homelessness if they dont have support because universal credit social security welfare gives you peanuts ive signed on at 2 different points in my life due to job losses and mental health difficulties  the most recent timecan you believe im only entitled to 650 a month as a single adult with no dependants i was renting a private property at the time and once my rent was paid 511 pm what does that leave me to leave on  its shocking what saved me was additional income from my side hustles and a loving supportive partner who has a really good job it made me feel really bad having to depend on him though  if i dont have this support and additional selfemployed income stream i cant tell you where i would be  ive now moved to live back with my mum to get back on my feet but even she faced homelessness in temporary accommodation due to the removal of tax credits and income support given to lowincome earners  this government has killed so many people and with no regulation in the private housing sector so many young people are becoming homeless the ones not on the street are sofa surfing   today the government announced the highest increase in minimum wage lol wasnt even up to a pound in decades but its still at only 8 lower if youre under 25 meanwhile the rich capitalists have almost tripled their wealth in a 10 year period  a young homeless woman was making her way asking for food and my eyes just welled up   i feel so disillusioned with life,ei7sjw

15,Globalism and free trade are why work sucks.,conservatives real crime isnt cutting welfare or healthcare or taxes its allowing corporations to ship jobs where labor is cheapest this reduces both wages and jobs stateside free trade means americans have to compete not with each other but with every other worker in the world for a job ironically enough marx was a proponent of free trade as a way to produce a united worldwide proletariat   women entering the workforce has made employment a worse deal an increase in the labor force with no corresponding increase in demand for labor results in lower wages studies show that women arent really that willing to marry men who make less than them conditions where men dont make enough to get married and raise a family are typically conducive to socialist uprisings women who end up childless later in life often report feeling depressed and even suicidal   immigration regardless of legality has also driven wages down same principle as above except even worse more labor with no increased demand except immigrants dont need higher wages the 1965 immigration act means that americans must compete with people all over the world for jobs   in this essay i hope ive convinced you of the best ways to bring wages and jobs back so we can all do less work   close our borders   ban free trade   incentivize women with money and tax breaks to become wives and mothers   offer money to immigrants if theyll voluntarily repatriate,efwlbg

17,"Impulsively Quit My Job (sorry, pretty long)",im not sure if this is the right sub apologize in advance but im home alone today and would like some input from someone else i got a retail job in a smoke shop right out of high school the owners are a bunch of young brothers from pakistan and i was the first person they hired since the beginning weve been close pretty open about things went to their weddings etc we were family fast forward to almost a year ago when they decided theyd open more locations to fuel the costs of opening a pharmacy this is also coincidentally when i started slowly hating my job a lot of days i got to sit around and watch tv but its still retail and i was doing everything for the store basically running it making orders customer service keeping track of other employees tracking sales and payroll running out to get whatever for the store despite not having a car and having to borrow one no breaks no sick days no holidaysweekends off no vacations no overtime no benefits getting yelled at for stupid reasons and lots more bullshit to name for 13 an hour seriously a shift manager at dunkin donuts makes more and every day at a retail job having to talk to customers makes you genuinely hate your life i couldnt even get to eat lunch without customers walking in because they didnt give us breaks even on 12 hour days i worked until 9pm christmas eve its things like that that add up until you cant take it anymore not to mention theres been a ban on flavored vape juice and theyve been asking me to illegally sell it from the back which would screw me over if i got caught so today i got the schedule mixed up and didnt come in on the 10am shift we only work one at a time so if i dont go in the store doesnt open and the owner gets pissed he called me at 1025 and told me that if no one is there by 1045 i wasnt even awake and ready and i live a half hour away that he would not only suspend me but punish the other employees and suspend them too for two weeks which makes no sense the owners have been complete dicks since opening their pharmacy and losing money from the vape ban and they only come into the store to point anything out thats wrong which weighs on you so i texted him that and said i wouldnt be coming back they want to close down anyway and cut my hours to 25 a week i just want to know if i acted impulsively in anyone elses opinion or if i should feel free for finally saying ive had enough he keeps calling me and i wont answer i think he wants to ask me to stay but i dont know if i should go back he didnt even say anything when i quit at first except ill give you good references like i did with your apartment way to do things for someone to throw it in their face later unemployment really scares me and i dont want to feel like im making a mistake it sucked and i was miserable but it was a pretty easygoing job on days when i didnt have anything to do and i got hired on the spot and i know i wont find that again which is whats freaking me out just feel like i need a bit of reassurance or advice right now ive just done so much with no appreciation and they think the opposite and honestly i couldnt give less of a shit about smoke products lol,eg3nwe
18,Understaffing to make us feel guilty,just before christmas i got extremely sick like not able to eat sick but i didnt take any sick days not because i needed the money or because i really like my job but because i know the people this would fuck over would be my colleagues and friends  we are constantly understaffed and i never realised this could be to make us feel guilty for taking time off in the three years i have been with my company i have taken 1 sick day and that was in aampe all night due to being assaulted  i didnt t take time off when i was hit by a car and needed stitches in my face because it would fuck over my friends i didnt take time off the second time i was assaulted because my friends needed me in work  fuck this shit and fuck any company who purposely leaves their workers understaffed i get 3 weeks paid sick leave a year and you can bet i will be getting it this year,eg3ry8

25,Going from a balanced 8 to 2 PM school day to 9 to 5 or more like 9 to 8 is insane.,i dont understand how working parents can have children in this day and age it seems like they would never see each other with a traditional work schedule  i think only restaurants or stores should be open longer than 2 pm but office work if we were raised to going to school from 8 to 2 pm work shouldnt be any different  it really disgusts me how much work takes up so much of someones day most people i know only have time to work scramble together a dinner maybe have an hour with their family  if they are lucky and then go to bed with that amount of time away its a miracle people arent disconnected from their loved ones but i suspect most people are the people that work grueling work schedules anyway i wouldnt be surprised if thats a factor in divorce couples just dont have the time to work on themselves because they are so exhausted  as a kid movies portrayed jobs as being fun and great parts of our lives to be honest im just so disgusted in how adulthood works i feel like people arent living i feel like toxic work environments change their mental wellbeing work depression is real health deterioration due to a toxic work environment is real how can you expect someone to eat salads and healthy proteins if they have the most stressful job imaginable of course someone working a horrible work environment is going to go for the junk food how could they not how else could they cope  the deterioration of people begins and ends with their job of course you cant help certain health factors but seeing my friends age and deteriorate as much as they have is scary im only 29 and i have seen this in my other friends who are the same age it really makes me afraid for their future,eh4sfp

104,"I'm getting really sick and tired of the idea that I have to ""make something of myself""",in our hypercapitalist and socialdarwinist industrial production system making something of yourself is equivalent to obtaining a highprestige or highincome job title ideally both  nothing else about your life fundamentally matters and failing to obtain a highprestigehighincome career in a marketproduction context is equivalent to doing nothing with your life  this constant haranguing of how you need to make something of your life directed particularly at perceived labormarket underachievers is never directed at people in professional occupations lawyers doctors journalists investment bankers engineers etc even if the productservice they are offering is ethically questionable or shoddily madeperformed and even if the rest of that persons life is a complete train wreck multiple divorces kids they never see no hobbies or interests sitting on the couch watching soap operas during their free time popping happy pills to stay emotionally functional etc  but by god they have an amazing career their labor is readily exploitable and they consume like theres no tomorrow  theyve made it  on the other hand someone who has a close social circle lots of engaging hobbiesinterests eats well and exercises is emotionally stable is able to pay all their bills but has the gall to be satisfied with only working say a lowlevel retail job or another lowprestigelowincome occupation is automatically deemed a failure who needs to get off their ass and make something of themselves  the real tyranny for us capitalistsocietydwelling folks is the tyranny of the careertrack the tyranny of the platonic ideal perfect resume that constantly dangles like a sword of damocles over our heads and life arcs and the tyranny of all the attendant social expectations and consequences    the spontaneity and play of life ends where a proper career begins,ehdksf

110,Sick note,hey i need to rant about my workplace and i feel as if this would be the right place to post so around 8 weeks ago i started a new job in a food warehouse its 40 hours minimum per week 850 an hour and the warehouse is set at just above 0 degrees c its sucks its very physically and mentally demanding as one day i could be loading peoples shopping heavy af onto the trailers all day and the other i could be just simply removing the plastic bags from the boxes one after the other for 9 hours these past few weeks ive been really struggling to cope due to the nature of the job the people im surrounded by male dominated environment and my ongoing situation of my mental health im still in my probationary period however ive already had quite a few absences these absences have been times where i have shown up for work at 6am after waking up at 430am done a few hours of work and then got sent home by management due to panic attacks etc work are telling me that if i have one more absence i risk getting sacked  because of this i figured i could go to my local gp and get a sick note for 2 weeks for my depression so i can have some time to heal and think about future plans from a job perspective i mentioned this to my manager today and he said that this would affect my probationary period and i would most likely be sacked i asked if it would be the same if i had broken a bone and had to take some time off sick and he said yes  so here i am now crying everyday at work having panic attacks and not being able to perform at my best ability whilst wondering when they are going to sack me because of this i need this job i have bills to pay but at the same time i know im more important what do i even do at this point are we just going to be trapped like this forever,egfokw

129,A Marxist case against work,my previous post caused some confusion among users who i believe struggle to conceptualize a truly different society i replied to one comment with an argument i took from marx 1844 manuscripts in which he explains what it would entail to overcome alienation of labor i take alienated labor to correspond to or reveal the secret behind the common usage of the word work in our capitalist context and the comments on my posts reinforced this assumption as many users seem to envision socially useful labor under socialism to still consist in a duty we have towards the community perhaps in some way coerced ie a sacrifice of our time hence a labor that is alienated which they call work i want to argue that the goal of socialism is to overcome this form of labor completely so for whom it interests here is the comment  gt following marx i think we should distinguish between work as alienated labor and labor as such it is the nature of human beings to realize their own individuality and humanity through productive activity which we call labor under capitalism this activity is alienated because it is performed in accordance with forces and ends that are alien to us accumulation of capital and competition between capitalists we sacrifice a central part of our life and individuality in order to power a machine that not only stands apart from life but destroys it on a large scale the goal of socialism then is to return labor to its real purpose the creation and enrichment of life and humanity for marx the laborers under socialism labor voluntarily for the sake of the whole of humanity because they recognize humanity as part of themselves and at the same time as their own project their own creation the needs of everyone thus become their own needs in any case socialism should not only be understood as a reduction of work to allow people to have more time for their private hobbies but as the eventual overcoming of work as an activity that embodies an opposition between the personal and the social   naturally not everyone will agree with this anthropological characterization but i think socialists should at least be prepared to agree that humans have some capacity for reconciling personal and collective needs in this way without coercion marx cites love as an example of this human capacity for selflessness without selfsacrifice on that basis we can argue that automation allows us to reduce the amount of labor that needs to be performed in the collective interest to keep society running to the amount that would be voluntarily performed in a society where the individuals can rely on the community to satisfy their needs and where laboring for the community at least potentially contributes to personal fullfillment,ed0ry9

144,"As a very anti-work person, should I go for this (probably temporary) job taking into account these conditions?",i always hated fixed schedule  fixed place work i got more antiwork when time ago i temporarily tasted what passive income feels like i worked in a white collar office job briefly and it was  the definitive icing on the cake high hours more htan half an hour car commute so part of the paycheck went on gas plus work covered almost all day shit management shit pay the bosses were even more overworked than the employees terrible employees that were so proud of wearing formal attire to go to work while the pay was so shit that didnt allow one to live on their own you see it  im currently working on a project of my own at the cost of still not seeing benefits or if it will go well until done  lately i got a possible job offer another programming job but this time its like this  schedule is a mix of cons and pro 8 30 to 6 from monday to thursday because there is a hour break for lunch and half a hour free break basically higschoollike schedule so it eats quite some time but fridays are 8 to 3 with ability to work from home that day if nothing presencial is required also summertime is all days 8 to 3 you can also enter an hour early or an hour late and displace your schedule accordingly  ampx200b  cons  i have to move cities and abandon lots of things i got where i live this is probably the worst part for me  i am a huge night owl  ampx200b  pros  my middle manager is a friend of mine who would introduce me to the job and also my will be my flatmate sharing costs with me  zero dress codecorporate uppity culture  work is a 5 minute walk from home zero commute zero extra cost lunch break wont have to be spent on restaurants which cost more than home food just walk home eat and play videogames with friend or work on my project until its almost the entry hour  pay is very good in comparison to my living costs and habits i would be able to save around 1000 dollars every month after rent food bills and leisure compared to not being even able to miantain basic living with former jobs  ampx200b  since i tasted what is having money come to you passively without you doing nothing well having formerly worked in planting that seed i hated more the idea of working under a schedule undar a fixed salary and under management but  this seems like heaven compared to my previous office job and seems that it would help me a ton if i need fundings for my ongoing project  is this a good opportunity for such one as i,ef4hsp

147,I found another post in another forum describing our lives, first off i dont know many jobs that allow you to stroll in at 9am work begins at 8am meaning to be at your desk you need to be leaving the house by 730am if you plan on showering and eating breakfast at a normal pace or doing anything besides throwing clothes on and walking out of the door  youll be waking up at 630am or earlier depending on how much you try to get done before work     this also assumes you can leave at 730am and still get to work on time odds are if you live in a metro or have any reasonable commute you will be leaving at 700am or earlier meaning youll be waking up at 6     you arrive at work and sit at your desk whatever your task is i can promise it is not fulfilling you will not feel good about accomplishing anything that day because nothing of substance will be accomplished     at 1030am you will get your first 15 minute break assuming your employer recognizes dol labor practices you will either go outside and smoke or try to fix a mixmorning snack to keep your metabolism up despite sitting at a desk all day     as soon as 1200 hits you will race out of the building for lunch assuming you didnt spend the precious nonwork hours meal prepping and jam into the same crowded places within walking distance everyone else does you choose from the same menu you have a thousand times before you see all the same people who jam into the same restaurant you do a thousand times before you try to jam your food down so you have time to attempt to enjoy the brief few moments of respite with your phone or tablet  the screen being the tiny window that is only escape from the hell of white collar slavery     at 1pm you will return to your desk and work nonstop until 5pm with a single 15 minute break there will probably be at least one or more messages waiting for you when you get back because some dumbfuc er client called while you were trying to live the life of a normal human being     at 5pm you will jam yourself back into traffic and spend anywhere from 30m  1 hour trying to get either home to the gym or to essential places like the grocery store if youre able to get home by 530 consider yourself lucky assuming you do gym gt grocery you might as well consign yourself to hopefully getting home before 8pm     when you get home you will still have routine  to do  laundry cleaning up making food whatever else at best during the week youll have maybe 12 hours to do anything remotely recreational tv internet whatever assuming youre going for 8 hours of sleep you hit the bed at 10pm in anticipation of your alarm going off at 6am so you can do it all again     saturday will be your only real day ever to yourself its marred by the fact that trying to go out and do anything on saturday shoves you in with everyone else in the same boat  everythings crowded the roads are packed takes forever to get anywhere or do anything because of the people the day goes by in a blur and soon its sunday meaning you get to spend time prepping for 5 days back in the salt mines being a slave     the only two things your white collar job as an employee likely provides for you are a semidecent income and stability beyond that you are treated as a disposable commodity your work is all on paper or on a computer it will be rare if ever that your work directly produces anything tangible and useful for anyone  most notably yourself     the pay you receive will always be minuscule compared to the profit your labor yields for the company or owner while you are not on the hook for the ultimate responsibility if the business itself fails you will be held responsible by your boss for everything up until that point if you have an inbox you will live next to it  going so far to even have your work email pushed to your phone so you can reply at any time even on vacation     if you truly move up high enough and get into business admin the job subsumes your life you are permanently on call your inbox is flooded with so much  you could never possibly sort and read through every email note request message whatever you eventually get a secretary to help keep track of your schedule but its a schedule youve long since lost all control over youre drug from one meeting to the next placed in charge of a team of personalities ranging from apathetic high school dropout to overachieving brown noser who is gunning for your job next pay period     assuming you still have some kind of friends or a relationship on the side those too will eventually yield to the weight of the job     you wake up one day and youre 50 or 60something and you look in the mirror to find a shell where a human being used to be you look in the rear view mirror and see nothing     nothing was created nothing was destroyed a bunch of paper moved around your desk that you may or may not have touched it may or may not have had your name on it at the time you may have said something or advised on how something should be done  but you never did anything nothing that produced a tangible result it was all paper  some of it green paper with little numbers on it some of it paper with legal letterhead  but all of it nothing but an endless mountain of paper in the end     maybe youre rich by now maybe not depending on what track you took you could still be working for the same wage you were working for 1015 years ago doing the exact same thing or maybe by now you own the company and you and the company are the same thing the company is your identity and you are it the traits of the company are your own character traits if the company went under youd probably suicide because there would be nothing left of you you stop to ponder taking time off from running your company but realize that might as well be like trying to stop breathing     at your funeral few people if anyone will mention what your college major was or what your graduating gpa was or how many interviews you went through with boring questions to get that first position working the  job pushing paper few people if anyone will care if you wore a suit from goodwill or a suit from  to your last meeting few people if anyone will mention how many times you reached over across the bed to turn off your alarm clock at 559am dragged your ass to the sink and brushed your teeth in a daze to start the day after trying to actually live your life and stay up past 10pm     tldr in the end that is what a white collar job is a meaningless pointless souldestroying profession that amounts to next to nothing     for some it can make you rich if thats your thing but for most its a oneway ticket to a mediocre existence in front of a computer making an increasingly marginalized middleclass wage doing unfulfilling  that involves a bare minimum of critical thinking to accomplish a task that will yield no tangible result besides a piece of paper moving from the in bin to the out bin,eearqj

160,work-culture drains the soul and any life.,im not bashing having a job dont assume that right off the bat  but i worked with someone who is single lives in an apartment and works 4050 hours a week   he has no real hobbies outside of video games  and barely makes enough to pay for rent and groceries     i was talking with him so what do you do for fun i play video games or watch netflix i asked him if he goes on even personal trips nah i just stay home and watch netflix or ride by bike around the block   and that got me thinkingthis is what they want from usthey want us to become drones with no real personal life except consuming whatever tv show or game comes out   then work and make the rich even richer  again im not bashing having a job because it is vital and there are jobs pay a little less but they are better than doing retail or office work  everyone i talk to who works fulltime just seems like a shell of their former selves,edw2bp

163,Capitalism only value those with potential for exploitation,from the time a baby is born they are groomed to be subjects of exploitation school is the process of weeding out those that dont offer potential to be exploited and those that are deemed smart good students conscientious which is really code for people that will make a lot of money for the their bosses to exploit as a society we place way too much emphasis on being smart and being obedient hardworking following rules and generally being good at things that will create money for the capitalist bosses to enjoy   those that are deemed to not have enough potential to exploit and simply discarded and left by the wayside to pick up the pieces and try to survive on their own this includes old people who have given all their energy away and have none left to exploit disabled people artists free thinkers and anyone who just isnt able or willing to be exploited   this is why schools focus on the wrong subjects and prepare us for a life of servitude why they focus so much on getting good grades standardized tests these are indicators for the capitalists of who will be best to exploit   this is one of the reasons why our society is so fragmented why are communities our broken we place so much value on people based on where they work and how much money they make but we are all valuable we are all of equal value and we have to start treating each other like we all matter   thanks for listening to my rant,ee4249
164,Today I quit my seasonal job at Toys R Us by just not showing up.,not really sure what kind of interaction im looking for with this i guess i just need to vent to people aside from my mother who was not pleased with me   like any midtwenties person ive had a ton of shitty jobs but this was by far the worst im sure most of the reasons are not at all surprising to any of you but holy fuck fuck these people   1 they only gave us the legal minimum amount of breaks we worked 95 hours with one half hour break on the first day i asked to take my two fifteens and they laughed and said it wasnt priority we usually got our break 6 hours into our shift which is illegal where i live and meant we were all fucking starving by the time we got it   2 i worked in the backroom sometimes preparing items for shipment yesterday i was accused of using too much tape and was told it costs the company money upon seeing an apparently unsatisfactory packing job the supervisor threw the box across the room into our working area almost hitting my coworker   3 they fired a coworker with one day notice because she disagreed with another seasonal employee on something very inconsequential this woman has three kids and they fired her less than a week from christmas she told me explicitly it was a paycheck she was really counting on   4 they bag checked us at the end of every single shift i thought they were joking the first time we had to wait for a manager to do it too which meant we were sometimes waiting ten unpaid minutes for a manager to get to the door   5 our backroomstaff only emergency exits were consistently obstructed and blocked completely with shopping carts we didnt have a staff washroom and had to share with the hundreds of customers our store had everyday   theres a lot more but this isnt a throwaway and im scared of the confidentiality clause i signed in my contract but this is an okay summary   so today i just didnt show up fuck them and they didnt even call me to see if im alive im usually a cert reliable person so for all they know i was fucking dead in a ditch or something   in short fuck employers,edyl4q

169,Artificially Keeping up with Appearances,throwaway account first time poster been lurking for quite some time   so something happened today at work that finally left me boiling i am recent college graduate and work in a financial services company also work for clients basically im a new employee along with a whole other bunch of new hires   so we have something called billable hours where we get assigned a number of hours per week on a specific client since im a new worker im often left without work but still expected to be in the office for appearances anyway since this is a holiday week theres currently 10 of people actually in today and a few of my colleagues were told that they could work from home a few days this week if they had nothing going on  of course since i had nothing going on i was gonna just work from home since a lot were planning on doing that but then in this group app we have others were saying that cant wfh and have to be in the office regardless long story short this situation makes me realize that  there are so many yes men who basically conform and always show up to work just so that they look busy theyre so afraid of getting reprimanded for staying home even though a lot of their bosses are either in another location or at home themselves then they scare off others who say they are doing something else they were told to do from their own managers  these are the same chicks who are fake and act all nice to you but then after talk complete crap about you and gossip all day and they act like theyre the superior workers bc they are more involved  and do things just for appearances people claim that millennials and gen z value more flexible work but i sometimes feel like im one of the few here who represent those values  kinda ranted aimlessly but just wanted to share my sentiments,eeoxqk

186,Examination of a Summer Seasonal Worker's Pay,ive never been one to hide my pay rate from anyone  if the topic comes up i always tell people that i make 2200 an hour  after all on paper thats what im paid right  taxes and deductions notwithstanding i dont work a full year  i work in the asphalt industry which is only nominally productive for us between the months of march and december  this year we my fellow production laborer coworkers were hired back on the first of march  3 of the 7 workers at my plant were laid off the week before thanksgiving  my boss kept me on until the week before christmas  after looking back at my paystubs i came up with 43 normal work weeks  thats 9 weeks im not getting paid well for normal work but ill get into that in a moment  if i take the base rate and expand it to the normal 52 week year im only really earning on paper about 1777 an hour  not a terrible wage but im 28 and my boss boss wants me to make a career out of this  so seeing that i have some time on my hands now that im laid off lets take a look at the data  processing img xlpb02r5tm641  my salary based on my actual paychecks including overtime ot comes to 41006 weekly 78858  with deductions for medical and dental insurance that makes it 39175 weekly 75337  finally after taxes im bringing home 3092111 weekly 59464  comparatively some data from the us bureau of labor statistics states the following  weekly earnings based on age and ethnicityhttpswwwblsgovnewsreleasewkyengt03htm in 2019 put my white male ages 2554 bracket at 1070  the site is unclear if that number is after deductions  if it is im making just over half 55 of my bracket  if it isnt im doing a bit better at 74  alternatively the full time modeled wage estimateshttpswwwblsgovmweavghourlywagesforunionnonunionfulltimeparttimeworkershtm for production work in ma and nh 2018 is 2117 an hour  my paper wage 2200 hourly seems to be fair and my real wage 1883 after deductions before taxes or 1971 not shown in spreadsheet corrected for the seasonal work year isnt too far off  its also worth noting that my earnings are heavily boosted by overtime work  in 2019 i worked 118 hours overtime over a 52 week period that averages to be 227 hours per week  granted that isnt as much as some others in the production or construction fields but a fair wage should be achieved before overtime and any wages earned through overtime should be like a bonus in my opinion  not to mention that the vast majority of our ot comes early as in before our normal workday of 0700 to 1530  2 hours of ot means im waking up at 0330 to make it to work on time  with this data i was hoping to get an idea where i stood among the average american worker in my earnings  i guess i cant complain too much but i typically find myself living by calvins philosophyhttpsiimgurcom51qvilopng  the work itself is hazardous and strenuous and during the summer were pinned to the wall to meet production deadlines  on paper im a laborer but i function more as a laboratory technician performing complex chemical tests on our products to ensure they meet state requirements  i do have to back off a bit however as the work in late november through the end of the year is pretty easy  during the last week of work i only put in about 15 hours of real work in and the other 65 were spent either sitting around or doing busywork like sweeping  why did i post this to rantiwork   well mostly because im bored but alternatively to get some other opinions  am i in the right to think i should get a little more to make up for the time im not working in the winter  if i make a career out of this what is a satisfying wage to make  world population reviewhttpworldpopulationreviewcomstatesmassachusettspopulation puts massachusetts male earners with a bachelors degree at 73399 im only making 56 of that at best  not to mention my degree doesnt match my field that im currently getting experience in  i tried looking for new jobs in my area where my experience from this job comes into play but of the roughly 20 positions i applied for none replied back to me  positions where my degree is useful are few and far between and of the 4 positions available three were paid about 300 an hour less than my current rate and the one that did meet my criteria did not reply back  then there is my financial situation  im trying to repay student loans and tons of medical debt not to mention a new to me car payment because my 2004 junker shit the bed this august  most of my earnings are thrown out the window as soon as it comes in  although that isnt to say i dont have some expendable cash i also have some expensive habits i can use to kick  ive already come to terms that i probably wont be moving out of my parents place until my mid thirties  i encourage you guys to take a look at what youre earning and what you should be earning  i think its hard for a lot of people to understand that making a decent amount does not equal making the right amount  i hope to rekindle my job search this layoff season in hopes of finding a better position because ive seen the way my boss lives and my boss boss wants to put me there and im not sure if thats what i want to be for the rest of my career  notes about the spreadsheet   the first 4 paid weeks were only 8 hours of work per week which is because i was technically laid off  however sometimes there is a job that requires more than one worker at the plant and the one worker who is kept on over the lay off period needs assistance  also massachusetts unemployment insurance will continue to pay out if you only work 8 hours or less in a work week  the week of 0504 was the first week i was raised from 20 an hour to 22 an hour  i was out of work for the pay week of 0713 due to an injury i sustained at work  i was paid workers comp but i elected to keep it from the data because that doesnt reflect what my work payed out to me  ot  overtime   ut  undertime unpaid  during the week of 0921 we were paid out our remaining paid time off and it was added as ot to our paychecks  during the week of 1012 i was hospitalized and inpatient nonwork related and due to our paid time off getting paid out on 0921 i was not able to cover the days i was out  tldr i procured and calculated a bunch of data so i can whine about how im only making just over half of what my fellow male bachelors degree holding massachusetts counterparts earn even though i make 22 an hour on paper because im bored,ef6239

193,I found a post in another forum describing our lives, first off i dont know many jobs that allow you to stroll in at 9am work begins at 8am meaning to be at your desk you need to be leaving the house by 730am if you plan on showering and eating breakfast at a normal pace or doing anything besides throwing clothes on and walking out of the door  youll be waking up at 630am or earlier depending on how much you try to get done before work     this also assumes you can leave at 730am and still get to work on time odds are if you live in a metro or have any reasonable commute you will be leaving at 700am or earlier meaning youll be waking up at 6     you arrive at work and sit at your desk whatever your task is i can promise it is not fulfilling you will not feel good about accomplishing anything that day because nothing of substance will be accomplished     at 1030am you will get your first 15 minute break assuming your employer recognizes dol labor practices you will either go outside and smoke or try to fix a mixmorning snack to keep your metabolism up despite sitting at a desk all day     as soon as 1200 hits you will race out of the building for lunch assuming you didnt spend the precious nonwork hours meal prepping and jam into the same crowded places within walking distance everyone else does you choose from the same menu you have a thousand times before you see all the same people who jam into the same restaurant you do a thousand times before you try to jam your food down so you have time to attempt to enjoy the brief few moments of respite with your phone or tablet  the screen being the tiny window that is only escape from the hell of white collar slavery     at 1pm you will return to your desk and work nonstop until 5pm with a single 15 minute break there will probably be at least one or more messages waiting for you when you get back because some dumbfuc er client called while you were trying to live the life of a normal human being     at 5pm you will jam yourself back into traffic and spend anywhere from 30m  1 hour trying to get either home to the gym or to essential places like the grocery store if youre able to get home by 530 consider yourself lucky assuming you do gym gt grocery you might as well consign yourself to hopefully getting home before 8pm     when you get home you will still have routine  to do  laundry cleaning up making food whatever else at best during the week youll have maybe 12 hours to do anything remotely recreational tv internet whatever assuming youre going for 8 hours of sleep you hit the bed at 10pm in anticipation of your alarm going off at 6am so you can do it all again     saturday will be your only real day ever to yourself its marred by the fact that trying to go out and do anything on saturday shoves you in with everyone else in the same boat  everythings crowded the roads are packed takes forever to get anywhere or do anything because of the people the day goes by in a blur and soon its sunday meaning you get to spend time prepping for 5 days back in the salt mines being a slave     the only two things your white collar job as an employee likely provides for you are a semidecent income and stability beyond that you are treated as a disposable commodity your work is all on paper or on a computer it will be rare if ever that your work directly produces anything tangible and useful for anyone  most notably yourself     the pay you receive will always be minuscule compared to the profit your labor yields for the company or owner while you are not on the hook for the ultimate responsibility if the business itself fails you will be held responsible by your boss for everything up until that point if you have an inbox you will live next to it  going so far to even have your work email pushed to your phone so you can reply at any time even on vacation     if you truly move up high enough and get into business admin the job subsumes your life you are permanently on call your inbox is flooded with so much  you could never possibly sort and read through every email note request message whatever you eventually get a secretary to help keep track of your schedule but its a schedule youve long since lost all control over youre drug from one meeting to the next placed in charge of a team of personalities ranging from apathetic high school dropout to overachieving brown noser who is gunning for your job next pay period     assuming you still have some kind of friends or a relationship on the side those too will eventually yield to the weight of the job     you wake up one day and youre 50 or 60something and you look in the mirror to find a shell where a human being used to be you look in the rear view mirror and see nothing     nothing was created nothing was destroyed a bunch of paper moved around your desk that you may or may not have touched it may or may not have had your name on it at the time you may have said something or advised on how something should be done  but you never did anything nothing that produced a tangible result it was all paper  some of it green paper with little numbers on it some of it paper with legal letterhead  but all of it nothing but an endless mountain of paper in the end     maybe youre rich by now maybe not depending on what track you took you could still be working for the same wage you were working for 1015 years ago doing the exact same thing or maybe by now you own the company and you and the company are the same thing the company is your identity and you are it the traits of the company are your own character traits if the company went under youd probably suicide because there would be nothing left of you you stop to ponder taking time off from running your company but realize that might as well be like trying to stop breathing     at your funeral few people if anyone will mention what your college major was or what your graduating gpa was or how many interviews you went through with boring questions to get that first position working the  job pushing paper few people if anyone will care if you wore a suit from goodwill or a suit from  to your last meeting few people if anyone will mention how many times you reached over across the bed to turn off your alarm clock at 559am dragged your ass to the sink and brushed your teeth in a daze to start the day after trying to actually live your life and stay up past 10pm     tldr in the end that is what a white collar job is a meaningless pointless souldestroying profession that amounts to next to nothing     for some it can make you rich if thats your thing but for most its a oneway ticket to a mediocre existence in front of a computer making an increasingly marginalized middleclass wage doing unfulfilling  that involves a bare minimum of critical thinking to accomplish a task that will yield no tangible result besides a piece of paper moving from the in bin to the out bin,eeb02w

215,"We put ourselves through immense stress and pain to keep up the grind, losing all sense of pleasure in the process",i only recently entered my  but ive been having antiwork sentiment stirring in my head since around age 16 thinking about the futility keeps me up at night sometimes see even on christmas  ampx200b  ampx200b  as a sixteen year old girl i got my very first job performing and serving in a tourist trap train show think christmasholiday type gig i am autistic and have sensory as well as communicative issues i had my hair kept short and i didnt wear makeup i was also very quiet and only did well during performances rather than interactions with other coworkers they didnt like that i was different   ampx200b  ampx200b  ampx200b  it made things very difficult for me in the blistering cold or sweltering heat id get put on trains with no heating or air while the bosss daughter and her friends were put on the first class train everytime i remember one day i was a bit slow because i had been on the non ac car all day and it was the one day i had to work with the bosss daughter   ampx200b  ampx200b  she was very rude to me and made fun of me because i stumbled scolding me and huffing loudly about me i began to have dread everyday coming to work because of how my coworkers spoke to me and i could do absolutely nothing because nepotism   ampx200b  ampx200b  ampx200b  the final straw was when an older male coworker over 12 years older than me started flirting with me i was underaged and felt very uncomfortable reported it to management and told them if he wasnt removed from my shifts that i would walk away they told me i was just looking for excuses to quit i never went back  ampx200b  ampx200b  ampx200b  well as all of my fellow americans know you cant survive without a job and so i went hunting for more work i could get as a high school student unfortunately this meant fast food  ampx200b  ampx200b  boomers in addition to many whitecollar corporate workers who believe in the bootstraps mentality  will say that fast food and retail work is easy and is a necessary rung to climb on the ladder of resume boosting when you are a teenager  this could not be further than the truth  ampx200b  ampx200b  ampx200b  my coworkers knew i had a disability and would make retard jokes they would walk out to smoke cigarettes or pot while i was running the register all by myself and had barely worked there for a week i was worked far past the limit of what you should force a minor to work while receiving only one break for my entire 8 hour shift where they expected me to prepare and eat my dinner in 20 minutes  ampx200b  ampx200b  ampx200b  some days i would not eat because there was so much work to be done grueling manual work like moving heavy boxes scrubbing floors and toilets constantly on your feet and running around while customers screamed and yelled at you i was also the dish washer in addition to my other tasks assurancd i was very meticulous about cleanliness  i was told if i kept taking so long to do dishes and staying past my allotted shift to finish them that i would not get paid for that time  ampx200b  ampx200b  ampx200b  my coworkers took advantage of me they knew i drank the grind grind grind strong work ethic mentality and exploited it while hollering at me for accidentally putting one extra pinch of chicken on a sandwich because it would cost the company money everyone said this was unskilled low stress work but the amount of times i would accidentally make a minor mistake during a shift and get absolutely destroyed by my bosses or coworkers for it was astounding  ampx200b  ampx200b  ampx200b  i ended up leaving that job too because apparently i called out too much due to an influx of mentalphysical problems once again as a newly anointed adult i had to get a job once more while on a break semester from university time for retail the other menace of wage slavery  ampx200b  ampx200b  my retail experience gave me my first taste of wow 90 of jobs are absolutely useless that was a bitter pill to swallow that i had to be confined in what felt like prison for 8 hours a day conjuring the illusion of productivity even better was the fact that we werent allowed to sit down so you had to seem busy on the sales floor when there was no work to be done  ampx200b  ampx200b  managers would come up and yell at me because i wasnt watching people carefully enough who could potentially be stealing and i had a serious moral issue with those kinds of assumptions everyone at my store was a redneck antilgbt overwhelmingly trump supporting kind of character and it made my days at work pure misery because i simply was an outsider if someone was extremely creepy or controversial theyd just get moved to throwing the truck instead   ampx200b  ampx200b  i had to work at this job for around 7 months and it was absolutely hell for me i fell into the deepest depression ive had thus far because i was barely 18 years old no friends no life abusive bf and too exhausted from work to change anything about my situation i could barely care for myself coming home to cook or clean was like torture when id have to stand in the kitchen to prepare food after a shift the pain in my back was like someone had dipped a hot poker stick into a bed of flaming coals and scraped it up my spine  ampx200b  ampx200b  fast food and retail work destroyed my back legs and joints i still dont have a diagnosis for what is wrong with my body but work did it no favors i began to develop a serious disdain for working i went back to university and decided to pursue a stem field hoping and praying i would never be stuck in a physically demanding job again in my life   ampx200b  ampx200b  ampx200b  yet i found that another sort of stress existed not the stress on my body from standing and lifting all day but the stress of sitting at a desk doing fuckall and receiving no mental or physical stimulation whatsoever however it is seen as the absolute prize in america to grind for one of these positions it makes me feel ill and disillusioned with the world i live in i stopped feeling pleasure from most things because i didnt see the point in anything now  ampx200b  ampx200b  ampx200b  i worked in technical support part time last year during this time i believe my adhd and autism symptoms worsened because i was simply on my phone doing nothing all day at work and it shot my concentration all my coworkers would chat and have a great time socializing but i was always left out once again because im autistic and fail completely at the social games and expectations of workplace cordiality politics  ampx200b  ampx200b   i moved universities so i did not have this job for too long but i landed another temp technical job shortly after and it was the same song and dance except i kept leaving to go home early because i couldnt stand sitting in silence in a room for 8 hrs my boss gave me minimal guidance on what i was meant to be programming my coworkers ignored me and even accidentally hit me in the head with a ball because they did not see me sitting in the corner desk and i felt like the caged bird once more  ampx200b  ampx200b  after the job finished i felt guilty because i didnt work hard enough and barely accomplished anything our team had set out to achieve as i was too depressed to feel any passion for the grind any sense of pleasure i felt was long overshadowed by the constant mantra of resume building activities i was guided into applied behavioral analysis therapy to try to make me seem less autistic so that i could mask and have the persona of normality to stay in uni and land a job and the pain id shouldered from life and work stressors ive been told so many times that i just need to get over my physical pain and anxiety and autism and suck it up cause everybody has to work  ampx200b  ampx200b  ampx200b  i currently do volunteer research work and while id say its more fulfilling than previous occupations feels like my tasks have a real purpose  i still loathe work and find it dull meaningless in the grand scheme of things and unnecessary just a pissing contest of who can be more miserable and climb the ranks to a cushy 95 desk job with a cozy managerial position the fastest  ampx200b  ampx200b  ampx200b  recently i met someone online i fancied quite a lot and we started dating both of us are autistic both struggle with social norms and adjusting to adult life except my boyfriend excels at finding and keeping jobs his attitudes regarding work align perfectly with the societal narrative of grind till you cant anymore  ampx200b  ampx200b  i love my boyfriend dearly and it breaks my heart to see the sacrifices he makes for a career he is underpayed due to his disability expected to do a senior positions duties without a formal job title so they can justify paying him less and lets his workplace stomp all over his autonomy and his freedom to have an actual life  ampx200b  ampx200b  ampx200b  his job is mostly sitting at a desk all day and occasionally touching a spreadsheet the others at his work who are payed handsomely cannot even use the software and technology their positions require and make him labor for them because they are too lazy to open google and learn basic microsoft office knowledge  ampx200b  ampx200b  my partner wastes two hours of his life commuting everyday to a job that often assigns him no tasks and forces him to be unproductive all day ive seen him turn up to his job while being terribly ill or after a hospital visit all because it reflects my character poorly to be absent and i need them to know i am serious about work  ampx200b  ampx200b  our relationship is long distance which makes visiting often hard when you barely get any time off work even now he was working on christmas eve although he sees it as a bonus that he got to sit at home and refresh his email and be on call for one single day when his job has absolutely no reason to not let him work from home i get angry about unfair things in life like this when i rant to him that its insane that we live like this he tells me its just the way that things are it is the way of the world to work and we cant change this fact  ampx200b  ampx200b  ampx200b  i feel like once i gained this insight into what the world is really like and that working is an absolute explotive sham there is no way for me to return to my previous schools of thought i cant unlearn my conviction and dogmas related to anti work once again ive found myself sinking into depression slapstick workplace comedies like the office peep show it crowd etc make me feel ill can there really be more to life than this are the only thoughts i have while consuming meda like that nowadays  ampx200b  ampx200b  ampx200b  contemplating my future makes me insanely pessimistic and full of despair i plan to go to graduate school and have a career in researchacademia but ive struggled to hold any job since becoming sick ive been on more psychiatric medications than you can imagine and i still have no motivation or energy i fear the day i graduate university as i cant see myself trapped in the confines of a 40 hr work week rife with the extra shackles of a painful commute i cant handle 40 hrs but good luck finding a job that doesnt require it  ampx200b  ampx200b  ampx200b  even sitting here with the love of my life i have absolutely no hope because to live in america or most anywhere in the universeis to work my partner believes work gives him a purpose work merely gives me a sense of dread i cant find any work that seems tolerable to me i watched my boyfriend talk about science with stars in his eyes yet he is a whitecollar wage slave plugging at business spreadsheets   ampx200b  ampx200b  ampx200b  when i told him he should pursue his interests as he holds a bs in physical sciences he simply told me that most people ever gets a job in the field their degree is in its unreasonable no jobs exist or those that exist wont pay well or some other excuse i feel like there is something inherent that i lack merely because i dont have this mindset my ability to grind during wage slavery is gone i cannot be complacent with cubicles suits and ties office politics coffee runs and fucking excel spreadsheets  ampx200b  ampx200b  wish i didnt feel so lost in life all the time wish id stayed in the dark with blissful ignorance and never contemplated my disdain for modern societal expectations manistested in

251,The Planet is Literally Being Worked to Death,my main ethical gripe with modern work is that production is often just the depletion amp destruction of nature to sustain an unnaturally large population that may not plateau for about 80 years un medium projection we have more and more people working longer hours to produce goods from declining material stocks funded by monetary debt that masks physical depletion the masking effect is denied by cornucopians whove become so wrapped up in money theyve forgotten its origins  examples include the extraction of finite resources like fossil fuels along with decreasinglyrenewable timber stocks aquifers and of course overfishing just a fractional list this also explains the constant rush to deliver products on time vs only having to supply what small groups used to need youre working for the sake of too many others and it feels forced for a reason  also much of whats called hard work seems unnaturally hard andor dangerous no other species has to spend so much time keeping a vast infrastructure running 247 and most complaints about corporate control of our lives can be tied to this growthist cycle its easy to complain about the people at the top milking the biggest salaries but every worker is locked into the same resource feedingfrenzy  theres talk of green gdp ggdp replacing standard gdp which only measures money but invasive technologies like big wind are adding to ecosystem destruction in new ways rebranding the same old story much of whats called green is just new marketing angles with little chance of halting agw when the clarion call of job creation ends up destroying more of nature how is it true progress  the planet is crawling with more engineers and laborers like mosquitoes bleeding it dry literally poking holes with drilling and mining i see no moral purpose in making a naturewrecking economy bigger and bigger nor do i see intrinsic value in more complex gadgets to keep the system from crashing but thats exactly what much of the economy is and the financial sector both funds and feeds off that growth so theres no incentive to break the cycle,ecmw3m

331,Anyone else a long-term temp out there?,on 1231 my contract is up on the 3rd or 4th longtime job  not including the many small humiliating 2 weekers long enough to get a taste of wonderful at least on the outside offices and their perks while making minimum wage   i have been here 8 months and watched my boss hire employee after employee when i asked if he would convert me he said he wouldnt even consider it till january of this year thats how low value i am   i am in my early 30s this year another birthday passed and all i could think is  the women i went to school with are settled in long term careers probably making mid to high 5 figures and have never been without health insurance including girlfriends who temped in my city  in 2012   i know my flaws i come at 10 1015 and stay till 615630 its tolerated no matter how early i wake up  the sick thing is im so fucking tired and out of it i justgo slower and then spend the rest of the morning on bathroom trips once the coffee starts passing through thanks to ibs im an adult paranoid about being trapped on a subway and pissing myself or worse  it takes longer just for the glow of the computer while i check weather or email for my eyes to unblur   its ruined my life i know how fucking weak and stupid i sound i think so too my life now revolves around taking a shit and covering my acne in time to come at 10   thats enough to have rendered me unemployable  im not very attractive i am a nervous smiler but unlike the other offices i was in where the contempt from upper management was open this one seems to like me enough and more i have grown attached to my coworkers  they all know i am a temp except one or two i think its fucking humiliating i never told them i still was thats enough when these people are in their early 20s were hired out of college  as one should be as i never was losing 10 years to horrible menial jobs self employment and grad school in childhood ed so much unpaid work   i can picture these people looking at my timecards looking at the budget  even when my young direct supervisors were happy with my work and knew i worked hard the actual directors pass me over   in the 10 years since i have graduated from college ill admit it  i never learned a skill that is valuable enough to make me permanent i have no masters   when i interview for permanent jobs because my entire resume is  temp work  i wish i could describe the disgust the absolute confusion followed by phony smiles of repulsion i receive  from companies that hire temps often temps like me actually from companies that know they dont want to hire me but an hr person has to seem like theyre looking for candidates who call me in humiliate me and then dress me down even when i have the actual experience theyre looking for  i worked for a year as an intern with no pay part time just to get office experience this is now my third year as a temp its felt like 10 psychologically and physically it might as well be  i know im ugly and older and people can tell im not fresh from college   i never interned too stupid too ill and too poorly performing a student i took classes in summer and barely stayed afloat during the year i graduated with a 30 and didnt kill myself those are the two accomplishments i have to show for my entire worthless existence   in 2019 the horrible offices that offered my friends 12hour in 2012 now offer people like me14hour 15hour no benefits contracts lastingthree days two weeks a month six months with no hope of conversion thats when things work out and theres no abuse i shared a project with one coworker got blamed for her mistakes and was fired when she was  nobody sees me i watch the debates i bookmark links on the social divide on the public option on millennial downward economic mobilityand the truth is nobody gives two fucks about the long term unemployedunderemployed nobody in the political landscape  when you are a long term temp or an older longterm unemployed and thus unemployable  human garbage to employees especially of the unskilled or lower skilled kind  nobody sees you nobody gives a fuck about you youre bad youre garbage if you werent you wouldnt be a temp   day after day even when times are fat i think of the companies including the one before this  once again an erp softwaredata management project where i was fired and 20somethings fresh out of college were made an offer in six months my direct manager left the company the week before the contract ended   my direct managersupervisor did here too   it isnt just the untold and horrible humiliations of chatting up employees as they are  im not and befriending them trying not to think of their six figure salaries and the careers theyve had what they know who have been mentored and what they had the power to do  i have to smile and be nice to upper managers who have the utmost contempt for me go to industry events that have no effect on me   i drown in a sea of bad faith fear and contempt i have swallowed it and internalized it how can you not hate people who are employing you under conditions that prove unions are dead that exist with the understanding you dont deserve the most basic dignities of labor  all i have to show for my life is a college degree my great dream was to work for public advocacy  now my dream is a permanent office job with a path and health insurance not even that is in the future  i am the sole person responsible for salesforce in my office there are no mentors and no teammates to guide me my function is an afterthought   i live in awe of people who had stupid majors in college and now work for fortune 500 companies or  more amazingly  got hired in the field of their choice creative fields advocacy who are talented and competent   i think on some level i never pictured that for myself  i liked studying the work the successes and accomplishment and writing of others who were i wish i could describe how that feels too  i have no identity or life apart from being physically ground to dust by work and commuting and all things related to work really  shopping for work clothes and dress shoes and things that will make me less disgustinglooking to the men in my office going to my doctor for adult acne for the same i have not seen a psychiatrist for drugs in a year because i am on an addon and have no mental health coverage its so silly pursuing healthcare when you think about suicide 247 but hey i have to be employed until im actually ready to kill myself right  every day i think to myself i generate no revenue i have no use  to anybody when i walk through my city and imagine startups and glamorous media companies and prestigious massive multinational investment managementpe firmsi amfilth   there is the employed world  the chosen  and then there are people like me whom job creators see as actual garbage or temporary pieces of furniture they resent renting   when i was 19 i seriously thought of hanging myself because i couldnt picture getting through a workday i was so unhappy and so ill  now at 30 smiling into the faces of hiring managers whos withered smiles meet my own with barelyconcealed disgust and indifferent i think to myself  in my failures my weakness my stupidity my worthlessness if only to them  but whats the difference when these are the people that have power over my entire existence  i exceeded my worst nightmares   and the years pass and i hope to be hired or i update my resume fruitlessly knowing as soon as i explain the work was temp interviewers for jobs  including temp jobs  will mentally put my resume in the garbage   nobody sees me nobody gives a fuck and if youre out of college for a certain age or cant afford to go and have no valued experience or path to employment nobody gives a fuck about you either   obama made a great speech about labor urging congress to pass it  one of the things he said is you are not alone  but you are in capitalism you are in the sharing economy in the age of the lean office where trimming the fat means enabling the explosion of horrible staffing agencies that exist to get rich off of hopeless pieces of shit like me pocketing my wages my benefits while im expected to have a certain software experience be an expert on sales forecasting reporting despite never ever been shown anything but the work to do my own projects  low value menial  trained shittily instead of being trained to be kept or to acquire transferable skills and have a college degree to make 15hour with no health insurance and no retirement benefits  you tempcontractor  youre alone nobody in elected office thinks any of this is a problem at all   theyll cry and plead and fight one another to suckle jeff bezos cock with tax breaks so he can set gentrification of whatever city he sets up shop into overdrive and hire temps instead   sorry this is a book i hate myself because these people make me hate myself and because if i were stronger less worthless less stupid and less fucking weak  i would have enrolled in graduate school in the hopes of redeeming the years i blew as an undergrad tried to intern tried to finally gain the degree to be deemed useful   those of you who have english or anthro or history and are even steadily employed as admin in something like a finance office or different from your background

338,"Exercise: If government housing was available to all, would people choose their careers/jobs differently?",imagine if once reaching the age of 30 you get allocated a government house where rent is calculated as 25 percent of your income  the house is smalltomedium sized enough to comfortably house a small family wellinsulated and bare you dont choose exactly which house you get you state your desired area code and they try to assign a house in that area code otherwise they try the next nearest area code  1 you could either live in it forever but when you pass away they take the house back and pass it on to another citizen  2 or you can stay in it for as long as it takes to save up for your own house  3 if you want to move house butt stay on the system you have to give up your house to go back to private renting and put yourself back on the waiting list again with the new desired area code  do you think that the job market would be affected by this,ebxuta

369,Finding it impossible to continue BAU,hey friends little bit of context here im a wage slave who works in corporate security its a warm body position that pays better than anything ive previously worked sadly often times i get paid to do nothing more than surf the internet eat snacks and think about how absurd and backwards our society is   its a job i always looked for considering ive worked much harder for a lot less but my time outside of work is increasingly unfulfilled i spend a lot of time dreading having to return to the job and since im new to my area im struggling to meet like minded friendly people  the idea of continuing on at this job just so i can comfortably get to and from work and have shelter and the monotony my day to day prolonged seems absolutely insane so i did the only sane thing and reduced hours so that i could better cultivate my free time but so far it hasnt been nearly enough as ive been helping fill hours up through the holidays   sadly ive always wanted to work in the film industry but its filled with smoke and mirrors and i feared going into debt for a career with no guarantees i wanted to teach but the more i learn about this shady world the more i want to rebel against it now maybe thats the kind of teacher some of the youth needs right now i know id be able to help guide and inspire but its gonna take me years and possibly lots of money to get to the point where im qualified to teach literatureenglish at the high school level   but i cant stand just continuing on without trying to go for things that might actually make me feel like getting out of bed in the mornings its no good for the soul to be filled with so much cognitive dissonance like i know work is bad for me but i continue to go out of fear  i want to live out of a van actually utilize my time on enjoying all this world has to offer while im here i just cant feel great about slowly watching my savings wither away until im forced back into wage slavery with no better career options because ive been off the grid for a year or two if im lucky and my savings got me that far its just a temporary fix for the long term problem  life is starting to feel utterly hopeless   maybe i can freelance as i go sounds fun right everyone suggests it i mean but do they ever consider the catch 22 aspect of how you need experience to get jobs and how you cant get jobs with no experience or the gross personal marketing on social media thats attached with making it   i sound super defeatist right now so thanks for sticking with me this far truthfully i wish we could start a sustainable community where the members worked on projects within our goals for renovation make sure we all have proper shelter food water and then from there we would be free to work or not work as we see fit i want to work on music movies and art and i dont need a fucking profit as reason to do it   anyway 2020 is on the horizon and i feel like im years away from being where i want to be and it seems like everyday i read reports on how our time left is bottlenecking im ready to just head for the hills and plan as i go but somehow that feels like giving up itll be like im actively rooting for things to get worse or ill be forced to return to a life of mediocrity in wage slavery   one thing is clear business as usual is on its last legs for me  anyone relate have any sound advice all love to you guys in advance,e9ost3

430,Upper managers are they of any use at all?, 1st project i was part of at my job was a 100 success my supervisor and senior project manager had very little participation in the project as he argued with the original manager at the project who left and dumped the management to an engineer who by accident got a dual role of swe and manager my supervisor admitted  that this was the first project that had such success in my opinion this was because an actual engineer with technical background did the management also because the engineer was my age the project flowed in a  very relaxed way totally slacking off and doing all tasks on time we made all the decisions so we made them in a way that we did our lives easier while completing the project targets no pointless meetings no stressing out with appearance over technical details   2nd project we have a real manager as we should in the first one his only interest is looking good to the higher ups including the my supervisorsenior project manager  1 pointless meetings twice a week check  2 stressing over powerpoints to the point that i do more powerpoints or paper work for the project than tech check  3 having an opinion on technical aspect while clearly he doesnt even have the minimum background check  4 because of 3 we get into paths that are deadends and we have to work more check  5 i am suspecting that he dumps his work load on us on some of the paperwork check  6 moral of the team is low no one cares anymore everyone is doing the bare minimum i am considering in transferring officially to another project where the engineer from my first project does the management unofficially i work for that but because there is no much work for me there i do both  i wonder how the project will end up compared with my 1st one the director of the company has admitted that there are management problems however i believe that weird culture is mostly because of him,e956mt

435,How should I approach me quitting my job due to workplace bullying?, long story short for the last 3 weeks my boss did a 180 in her behaviour towards me and 100 excludes me from everything at first she wouldnt respond my texts about work so i mostly spoke to the secretary about things because she clearly didnt want to talk to me now that we are approaching the end of the year she didnt include me in secret santa only the other teachers i teach at a language school she didnt include my students nor told me about ice cream day something she does occasionally to celebrate holidays which is basically distributing ice cream to the students last tuesday she took me out of my class to lecture me about going to the secretary for things instead of her saying who is your boss me or her she was extremely hysteric and im very anxious so i started shaking in fear she told me we will have a serious conversation next week but i dont want to have a conversation i just wanna quit my job and never see her face again but she acts like she doesnt have time to talk to me im 100 sure that i want to quit but im also extremely anxious about the whole thing because she is very unpredictable how should i quit should i be direct and leave or should i adress her bullying should i schedule a time next week to make sure i finally quit or surprise her,ea8m8y
436,Finally quit my miserable detailing job,for the better part of a year ive been detailing cars and was promoted to a supervisor a few months ago ill admit at first i loved the job i just loved back to this place after years and was starting to make friendsmoney after being constantly broke and the freedom of it take a break whenever eat whenever just get the cars done problem is it just got worse and worse my mental health deteriorated for multiple reasons personal and general  my main issue was time yes we could take a break whenever but you could easily be coerced out of it by a busy car pile up i shouldve just left every time granted my bosses would have shit to say so no we didnt actually get to take a break whenever if its a weekend or a sale and believe me they keep buying cars youre fucked i have lost so much weight because i couldnt sit down for one meal despite running around for rig he hours a day and just to put the cherry on top a dealer will bring a ram 35 fucking 00 at 8 at night and if its new best believe youll have to do it if the manager doesnt want to be stuck with it the next morning because consequently youll have to pick up even more slack my grandmother is dying im only 19 and were in a fucking collapse time is precious next up was the social aspect most workers can relate too i work in a very male dominated field so sexual harassment was a given from the jump from bosses to dealers to mechanics groping lewd language uncomfortable stares and every person you talked to you knew it was just so they could fuck i have been explicitly asked to fuck in a car repeatedly by married men with kids despite purposefully showing no interest and whats worse is when they start rating the few girls that work there and how purely objectifying is i never tended to think about their opinions but hearing the shit theyd say behind me and other girls backs definitely took a toll on my self esteem my grandparents are pissed and im probably going to be kicked out but fuck this at least the guilt of tainting desert water for the sake of a small profit wont haunt me anymore,ea10r6

463,A Brief Discussion Between Manager and I,today my managernot owner of company who i do really really personally like sort of sat down and asked me that as part of the company i need to be more like the rest of the team and do more work in the southern region of our area we have an office in both the northern and southern part of the county and i live and work in the northern one   she told me everyone else sometimes has to go down there and drive crazy amounts 1 hours of unpaid time to do a teeny 30 mins of paid work its just part of the job   i responded to her with i understand what youre saying but unless its in my current contract for me to drive to those cities to do less than 3 hours of unpaid work i will not be going in the beginning of my time here at insert company i did that quite a lot and was not doing well financially i should not have been doing it then and will not be doing it now to which she sort of shrugged and accepted that   the more i think about it i have felt as though maybe i should have let up more then i remember that she and everyone else at that company as im the lower tier person but then remembered that everyone else there makes about 25 times as much as i do  they are asking me to do this because they are being extremely picky with hiring a badly needed new person to fully staff the company the lower tier person and i have been struggling for months with the workload and asking for someone else now im totally fine with what i told her today and am glad for standing up for my bank account and my personal time,eadzzn
464,"""Cutting Hours""",idiots i have posted here before and if anyone remembers me the highlight of my posts are that my job holds shitty 13hr pay over our heads all the time well i hate working but i had enough money to eat and save and give me a sliver of hope i was actually getting mandatory ot of 50ish hours for awhile but now as you all know they will be cutting hours as the big retailermanufacturing seasons end after black fridaythanksgivingchristmas and basically i went from a typical 50 hour week to 1220 hours what the fuck is that i am being paid poverty wages despite being a premium employer in this area and when i finally begin to get ahead on my finances they fuck me sideways thought about taking a second job again but i cant get myself to deal with the balancing shit because as anyone who has had a second job already knows it never works out the way they sell it to you usually ends in working an 810 hours day at job 1 just to go to job 2 for a 12 hour day 30 minutes after and you are expected to provide peak performance i am seriously thinking about moving back with one of my family members to 1up this situation im tired of these shitty low wage corporations forcing me to work when it benefits them and then bending me over and fucking me they know i live on my own and i wear shoes with holes in them and torn clothing and am usually frugal and they know by giving me 1220 hours they are fucking me sideways and they dont care thankfully i made stupid decisions when i was younger and purchased thousands of dollars of collectibles in a certain category not to be named and it was a dumb decision but i have been selling them online i have enough collectibles for it to literally probably take a couple years to sell and i actually have became frustrated lately because i make more money selling things online than i do at my actual day job the only problem is im not a resale kingpin and when my inventory runs out then thats all i have to sell i have proudly delivered subpar work at this workplace ever since being fucked around and forced to work ot and forced to stay after every night and forced to come in on days off ive just had it with this crapola i would love a 1220 hour work weekif i was being paid 50 an hour maybe one day this will be the normbut on the other hand maybe things are getting worse it definitely doesnt help when shitty 13 per hour is a premium and other fuckers would sprint to work my job which gives the company a lot of leverage to fuck you around,eaik8m

469,Bamboozled,im pretty sure my friend and her coworkers were tricked my friend works at a large hospital and were told to fill out a survey to gauge the level of morale of course since management treats them like secondclass citizens they said that morale is low which made the higherups look very bad so in response to all of this management makes my friend and her coworkers participate in some moralebuilding exercises this is also known as mandatory fun this includes bull shit slide show presentations quasireligious speeches the hospital is owned by a group which follows an offshoot of christianity and fun sing alongs because what grownass adult doesnt love singalongs anyways to make a long story shortin order to avoid having to go through this corporate reeducation again my friend and her coworkers lied on the follow up morale survey this in turn makes it look as though morale has improved thanks to the efforts of upper management even though this couldnt be further from the truth upon hearing about all of this i couldnt help but wonder if this was carefully orchestrated by my friends bosses from the get go and that they knew theyd lie on the followup morale survey in order to avoid having to go through all of that bull shit again just my theory let me know what you think,eafulv

572,The anti-work implications of early(ish) Pink Floyd,bear with me here ive been drinking because you know soulcrushing capitalist hellscape etc etc  ampx200b  so as a bit of introduction ive been listening to pink floyd since i was give or take one years old now in the early days this  was to quote my father to make me go to sleep obviously in those early formative years i wasnt listening to floyd so much as hearing the otherworldy dulcet tones merely lulled me to sleep rather than making me think despite that however the music of pink not to be confused with the mindless notes penned by a similar namesake with an  in place of an i has stuck with me for mostif not all reallyof my formative years including the present i have always been drawn to in particular the album animals in fact my favorite song of all their vast discography has been dogs from the selfsame album in my late teens this was largely due to the crashing juxtaposition of buildup and lull the delicate interplay of timbre and power that makes up in my opinion the best of pink floyd i appreciated then in some small way the poetry of the lyrics but they never really struck me the same way then as they do now  ampx200b  put simply dogs is a massive indictment against the necessity of being a company man if you investigate the lyrics its not even hard to decipher  you have to be trusted by the people that you lie to  so that when they turn their backs on you  youll get the chance to put the knife in like holy shit even when i was 17 this lyric hit me hard now that i actually work for corporate america its even more true more prescient or try this on for size deaf dumb and blind you just keep on pretending  that everyones expendable and noone has a real friend  and it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner  and everythings done under the sun  and you believe at heart everyones a killer ceaseless unending distrust of those you work with because they are your competition true alienation under the mode of production winners make the moneykeep hustling   ampx200b  more than just what happens in the sphere of work this song delves even into what happens in your social life beyond the job i direct you to this  yeah and in the end youll pack up fly down south  hide your head in the sand  just another sad old man  all alone and dying of cancer no matter how much of yourself you invest in your work no matter how devoted you are to the company you will die and more than that your unending preoccupation with being top of sales or whatever the fuck metric your company of choice chooses to push on you will inevitably end with an early death from stress overwork or a multitude of other maladies the song ends with these lines perhaps the most depressing and telling of all preceding instances who was only a stranger at home  who was ground down in the end  who was found dead on the phone  who was dragged down by the stone i probably dont even have to point this out for most of you who was only a stranger at home worklife balance what family wife kids parents et cetera et cetera ad infinitum meaningless in the face of surplus value production unimportant in the grand scheme of profit  ampx200b  jesus christ i havent even skimmed the surface of the catalog of this band money breathe time have a cigar welcome to the machine i could go on and on about the significance of this bands lyricism their message and beyond that their sound and yet most people who listen to them seem beyond the scope of thisin my opinionsupremely obvious interpretation they remain just another groovy band for your boomer uncles or fathers to masturbate over because of the fact that they play their own instruments no pink floyd is much more than that to me they are the beginnings however obtuse of an argument against the wageslavery regime of modern life that so many of us are held under the dominion of,e8n2b1

575,What Feminism Got Wrong,thesis second wave feminism with respect to its focus on womens right to work was a mistake granted it made sense at the time as having the right to be a slave to work was analogous to having the ability to support ones self outside of marriage an admirable goal however in hindsight the advocacy should have been directed at improving social services so that no one male or female young or old ablebodied or not ablebodied etc would ever have to forego adequate food clothing housing and medical care the inability of women at the time to see past the immediate unfairness of being denied many professional jobs led ironically to advocacy for something ie the right to work equally alongside men that only further oppressed them and that perpetuated the very capitalist system that oppresses 90 of the population men and women alike  indeed the results of more women in the workplace particularly in professional roles rather than roles they had filled historically such as teacher nurse secretary etc has contributed both to wage depression as the amount of available workers exploded whereas the amount of roles needing to be filled did not and to the tacit acceptance of the fact that it is unreasonable to expect to be able to raise a family on a single income today both spouses are expected to work their entire adult lives save a measly few months for maternity leave for the mother further women who leave the workforce for several years in order to devote time to raising their child often face considerable difficulty reintegrating should they choose to return commonly being forced to take lowerlevel roles than what they did before the arrival of the child  this post is not meant to be trite or a condemnation of feminist movements generally  rather this is an idea that recently occurred to me and one whose irony literally fighting for the right to work ie the right to be exploited i thought would be appreciated by this sub   interested in what others have to say,e8duus

661,Antiwork - what are the possible solutions?,recently  maybe because of the added attention to the subreddit  ive been seeing some grumblings about how this subreddit is just whiners who do not posit any solutions   i dont really see that as much of an issue this is the one place you can come and just spitball about how terrible the system is and i feel you should be able to do that no problem even if you dont have an alternative to work   in terms of actual practical solutions i am curious about what ideas people have to limitreduce or even completely scrap work some below that i have seen  universal basic income ubi this one has really gathered steam in the last few years with some feeling it will soon be essential the idea is that most existing social welfare would be scrapped and every person would receive a subsistence stipend no questions asked that would allow them to enjoy a basic living eg 1000 i was big on this idea but have moved away from it in recent years because it just seems like it would get gobbled up by landlords it doesnt seem like it can work without regulation   universal basic services i recently came across this idea and feel it would work better than ubi with this one industries covering basic human needs would be nationalisedheavily regulated to be affordable or free at point of service housing energy education health transport food so that every person will always have their basic needs met so if someone needs a sabbatical stress or mental health break they can without falling off the grid this would be a fairly hard thing to do as it leans too close to communism in peoples minds which is mostly demonised in society every other industry would still be in the private sector but it seems like it would be too hard for society to swallow   threefour day week reduced hours its not really clear why this hasnt already been done going to the five day week did not destroy the world so im not really sure why going to a three or four day week would with this idea a reduced working week at the same pay as the current full time weekcost of living would be the norm this would give people more rest leisure and chore time without diminishing their funds i feel like this would even boost the economy making us more productive and have time to enjoy amenities i mean if the high street is dying maybe its because we literally dont have the time to go to the shops high street shops were closed before i left for work and closed after i finished work,e61qb2

717,I got fired this friday,ok so basically i got fired from my very first job that ive been working in since april of 2019 i am currently in college 7am to 4pm depending how much work i have during the day and i start work at 410 to 6pm cleaning the college two hours a day and get paid 260 a month which for a very busy student is a great deal the job was quite boring and at times quite frustrating but since they moved me to a new section of the college ive been going downhill from there   they fired me because i lied about doing everything on my job but guess what i lied about mopping the floor as an art and graphics a levels student i get pretty fucking tired considering they put everything on my time table in the fucking morning which means i would lie about mopping just mopping however i did everything else perfectly but apparently i lied too often so they put me in restriction and did everything as they said but got angry that i lied about the timings im supposed to be in which room but the icing on the cake that got me fired is that i had an unauthorised person aka my friend on campus that was keeping me company waiting for me to finish he was a student at my college so i assumed it was ok but it wasnt and the only reason my boss found out about that is because a 69 bitch ass teacher snitched on me that bitch i even forgot that was a rule in the first place and all he did was waiting outside the room i was cleaning   the funny thing is that during the cleaning section all the doors of the college are open which means literally anyone could come in and cause trouble no security no nothing so heres safety hazard n 1   they also complained how i didnt hoover which in fact i did but the carpet is so old and so shit that literally 11 year old gum is everywhere in the room its disgusting   the thing that shocked me the most is how awful it feels to be fired it feels as if a close member of my family died it really discourages me from getting another job i never felt so shit about something like this i feel honestly betrayed not by my boss but by the teacher i thought they were my friend   fuck this college man,e4xnc9

719,The reason you are forced to toil,the purpose of war according to george orwellhttpsakamatwordpresscom20070731thepurposeofwaraccordingtogeorgeorwell1984  the primary aim of modern warfare is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living ever since the end of the nineteenth century the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society from the moment when the machine first made its appearance it was clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery and therefore to a great extent for human inequality had disappeared if the machine were used deliberately for that end hunger overwork dirt illiteracy and disease could be eliminated within a few generations and in fact without being used for any such purpose but by a sort of automatic process  by producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible not to distribute  the machine did raise the living standards of the average humand being very greatly over a period of about fifty years at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries but it was also clear that an allround increase in wealth threatened the destruction  indeed in some sense was the destruction  of a hierarchical society in a world in which everyone worked short hours had enough to eat lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator and possessed a motorcar or even an aeroplane the most obvious and perhaps the most important form of inequality would already have disappeared if it once became general wealth would confer no distinction it was possible no doubt to imagine a society in which wealth in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries should be evenly distributed while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste but in practice such a society could not long remain stable for if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves and when once they had done this they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no function and they would sweep it away in the long run a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance  to return to the agricultural past as some thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century dreamed of doing was not a practicable solution it conflicted with the tendency towards mechanization which had become quasiinstinctive throughout almost the whole world and moreover any country which remained industrially backward was helpless in a military sense and was bound to be dominated directly or indirectly by its more advanced rivals nor was it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses in poverty by restricting the output of goods this happened to a great extent during the final phase of capitalism roughly between 1920 and 1940 the economy of many countries was allowed to stagnate land went out of cultivation capital equipment was not added to great blocks of the population were prevented from working and kept half alive by state charity but this too entailed military weakness and since the privations it inflicted were obviously unnecessary it made opposition inevitable the problem was how to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the real wealth of the world goods must be produced but they must not be distributed and in practice the only way of achieving this was by continuous warfare the essential act of war is destruction not necessarily of human lives but of the products of human labour war is a way of shattering to pieces or pouring into the stratosphere or sinking in the depths of the sea materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable and hence in the long run too intelligent even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed a floating fortress for example has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargoships ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete never having brought any material benefit to anybody and with further enormous labours another floating fortress is built  in principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population in practice the needs of the population are always underestimated with the result that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life but this is looked on as an advantage it is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near the brink of hardship because a general state of scarcity increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one group and another by the standards of the early twentieth century even a member of the inner party lives an austere laborious kind of life

720,Being laid off has been a really nice vacation that I don't want to end,i needed some place to vent i worked in a technical field and i didnt hate my job entirely but i certainly resented the 40 hours a week being wasted on something i didnt care about     im an artist outside of work and im at a level where i can get a few paid gigs here and there doing what i love not enough to really sustain myself right now so the pay and benefits and stability of the full time gig were too good to have until my side gigs takes off more and hopefully i could turn that into something full time  im nearing 30 and still living with my parents so i thought with this stability of my job i can finally move out into an apartment and start being more independent i had finally selected an apartment i liked when i unexpectedly got the news that i was being laid off    it was a shitty thing to deal with at first but over time it became a really nice vacation i had enough saved up and was still living at home so expenses werent too bad i started seeing a therapist cause i actually had time for it i produced more art i got to do things on my schedule and its actually been super nice having the freedom  during this time i still interviewed for more jobs i was really hoping this layoff would be something that redirected me closer to working with my passion i found some job opportunities i got super excited about i put my best foot forward and put effort into showing how perfect i was for the job and they all rejected me it felt like shit to find a random super rare opportunity 10 minutes away from me doing exactly what i love and im good at and not even getting an offer those opportunities almost never happen and it almost felt divine the timing it of it all and yet nothing came of any of it  eventually i finally got an offer and you guessed it its basically doing the same technical work i was doing at my last job im starting it next week which means i also dont get to enjoy the holiday time and while itll be nice to have a paycheck and benefits againi really have no interest in going back     i really dont know what to do i feel trapped and unable to escape i worry about never realizing my passions fully i worry about how if i move out and become more independent how ill even have time for the things i want to do with my independence finding time for my art or having a family or having a pet because im too busy working 40 hours a week to realize all of those things i dont know how people are doing it or how they are affording it either     at least if i dont move out i can still keep saving a good chunk of my money and have time for art but then i worry about how im getting older and still in this same sort of adolescent place in my life while everyone i know is slowly getting married or having kids and somehow transitioning into being an adult whatever that means i worry about the life experiences im missing out on if i dont push myself in that direction    so idk sorry this was so long and thanks to anyone who reads it or gives me advice i just feel stuck both professionally and personally and wish there was an easy solution,e4kfd4
721,I dont know what to do,so i recently graduated college this year with pretty damn good cgpa thinking i would get hired my first day out of college how wrong i was  i applied to several jobs without any luck and stayed unemployed for nearly 6 months up until recently  i got a job as a trainee officer in a pretty big firm i had a primary interest in marketing and really wanted a simple desk job of sorts   the first couple of weeks went well typical 830 to 530 timings orientations and all that  however after that they put me into the field with a fucking 12 hour shift from 11am to 11pm at an outlet of the company  ill be honest when i first started the job i wasnt that happy either the only real thing i looked forward to everyday was when i would go to the gym around 730ish now i cant even do that and i feel completely miserable   this 12 hour shift thing is only temporary apparently most likely around 2 months but i cant even stand the thought of it still wake up go to work for 12 hours go home and sleep repeat  i also forgot to mention the commute is nearly 40 minutes oneway  am i overreacting with this being my first real job or is it something else,e50jff
722,"People face a lot of shit at work, it doesn't even make them productive for the CEOs. It's a lose-lose situation.",when i worked in a call center i remember getting many calls from customers who wanted me to do stuff that were against the companys policy they insisted they had the right to get these services and threatened me they would press charges if i wouldnt  check with the manager and give them what they wanted when i told them the manager says no they still argued with me they deserved these services and when they realised wouldnt get what they wanted they decided not to use our services   these calls wasted a lot of time and energy and eventually did not contribute to society anything they didnt even make the rich richer because the customers decided not to use our services   then what is it all good for,e5iytu
723,The job hunt sucks ass even when you're overqualified...,i wasnt having any luck with job openings that i was qualified for so i decided to look for roles where i was overqualified for the position its more important to me to have job where i just work normal hours have reasonable expectations more than just the standard 2 weeks vacation and maybe if im lucky something in the private sector instead of selling myself to the corporate world  this is now the third consecutive time i did the interviews only to be rejected and told in one way or another they either dont believe me when i say ill stick around and wont get bored or they think i have ulterior motives for wanting a job im overqualified for it fucking sucks welcome to capitalism where you cant have a job youre underqualified for but could easily learn and you cant have a job youre overqualified for its wonderful isnt it folks,e5b5ca

727,Getting Fired,tldr at the bottom   a little backstory   im currently working as a caregiver for adults with mental illness tbi and early onset dementia ive been at this facility basically since i graduated high school took a year off after graduation to fuck around then straight to work ive been here for about 5 years this is the only legit job ive had i worked for my ex husbands in laws for a few months before our marriage fell apart they own an auto shop worked some under the table stuff making ice cream cones for a family friends gas station babysitting house cleaning for ex in laws etc   yesterday i was working a 12 hour shift a coworker had a death in the family just before thanksgiving and i opted to take on some of her hours our administration says we are responsible for covering our own shifts i like my coworker and wanted to help her out in the middle of this shift my supervisor asks me to come into her office i always get a bit nervous as sometimes she calls me in to reprimand me for some bs but other times its to give me sweets or have me watch some yt video when she asked me to shut the door i knew it wasnt going to be a fun conversation i had assumed i had another complaint from a specific resident resident constantly complains about everyone but im his favorite the resident is often bored and uses it as a way to entertain himself were all very used to him doing this turns out it was a complaint from other people peer support cbrs social workers etc these people come in once sometimes twice a week to spend an hour to an hour and a half with their client the complaint read that i dont smile or interact with the residents what i smile fake as all hell but i force it ive got extreme rbf and im not going to be smiling every second of my shift i do interact with the residents there are often times when i dont speak at all though because the residents prefer to sit in their rooms vs in the common areas of the house where most of my time is spent i cannot force them out or to converse with me its useless trying to play board or card games with them ive tried endlessly these people come in for a few hours and assume that i just totally neglect the residents social needs and because of that ive been told that i need to make improvements within the next few weeks   ive been looking for another job since the beginning of october im just having a hell of a time finding anything decent without taking a pay cut i own a house so keeping up with my bills is difficult enough making less is only going to make it harder its to the point where im saying fuck it and willing to work any other pay grade just to get away from this place its toxic as hell and has been draining me for years i suffer from my own mental issues and theyre only getting worse ive started contemplating suicide more seriously havent made a plan though so ive decided that sunday my monday i wont be coming into work ill call in on friday probably get written up and i just simply dont care theyll fire me and im going to be terrified but incredibly grateful as much as i dont want to work for anyone else ever again the free time will make it easier for me to find something new something less stressful and harmful to my mental health   sorry if this seems all over the place but i seriously needed to get that out i spent all of last night crying im an angry crier and drinking myself to sleep thank you if you took the time to read it all  tldr my jobs firing me for not smiling or being interactive,e62584
728,Anti LinkedIn Social Media,hey antiwork so recently ive been putting a lot of thought into opening a small social media platform that resonates the message of this sub but on a much larger scale  in summary a work focused social platform without the pretentious bullshit of linkedin a platform that fosters real meaningful discussiondebate on the pros and cons of work culture today a platform where people can choose their identities similar to reddit and post their true unfiltered opinions about their jobs industryworklifebalancecompanycompensationcultureetc a platform away from greedy recruiters and corporate kiss ups a platform that also includes your regular memes  shit posts and the regular nuances of a social network   is this something you guys would potentially be interested in ive put a lot of thought into this but need help identifying whether the demand is there i know plenty of people that are tired of the pretentious bullshit found of linkedin but i guess im just a bit nervous on taking the next few steps ive got quite a few really good names for it too aha  and mods if this is not the right placemethod for me posting this please feel free to remove and ill have it reposted on the correct channel,e52td7
729,So glad I found this sub...,and people who share my sentiments i graduated with a masters in cs degree last year and got a job this past spring for a lot less money than id hoped for whatever staying at parents place and all right    god i never realized how much i could hate something until i started working the people at my job are surprisingly nice but i can feel my body slowly degrading away because of my job for whatever reason i could sit behind a laptop in the most fuckall posture for all of college for 10 hours a day playing video games but as soon as i do it for 8 hours at my job i develop the worst backshoulder pain known to man or at least a 24 yo me who should be in fairly good shape    ive lost about 10 pounds since starting this job despite my best efforts to try and keep up with the gym a lot of this summer was spent in a weed haze back when i could get legal carts from dispensaries a few states over because i just didnt want to deal with the reality of dragging myself up every day just to hurt more    the kicker is that when i got the job i was promised a performance review at 6 months for a potential raise because of my advanced degree my boss wanted me to tell hr everything id worked on so far which was basically just the projects hed given me never got any notice of anything past that    also this job has basically killed my motivation for doing any kind of coding outside of work 11 hours of my day roughly with commute is taken up leaving me with about 5 hours a day 4 if you count the process of getting up showering and looking presentable in the morning to do whatever my soul is slowly draining away and i have another 40 years of this to look forward to    anyways thats my intro rant gonna have to drag myself out of bed soon so i can contemplate driving my car into a tree on the interstate keep it real,e4yd2u
730,Work anxiety is effecting me on a personal level,im antiwork i dont care about my day job at all when im in the office in my seat im the most carefree person in the work  i do my assigned tasks at my own pace i do less than 1 hour daily of actual work i ignore most emails i avoid the yes man attitude my coworkers have i just dont care   im just not ready to quit it yet because the pay is very good and i can get away with a lot of stuff  but when i am home doing my personal business my day job affairs start abruptly popping in my mind and i get super anxious about it  it doesnt happen every day but still frequent enough to ruin my private free time  is there a way i can fix this,e5agvy
731,"I see no way out, it's terrifying",im 19 got 95 office job worked for 2 months now and i just cant imagine doing it all my life im basically shell of a person  the tasks that i do at work are not too hard for me and are generally okay however i cant stand the 8 hour working day crying before gouge to work crying when coming back from work and then being to exhausted to do anything but sleep also 40min commute each way  im planning on studying part time next year not from us part time like normal full time degree takes 3 years but you have to pay for it    so i need money to pay for studies and some travels but what after i dont want office 95 id rather die its killing every bit of motivation i had to get out of bed in the morning that was already hard enough probably depression but now it only got worse    how to get out of it im okay with working as in with doing some things but i detest having my time managed like that i hate sitting in office for 8 hours,e5cpzu
732,Employer explained everything to me in the first 10 minutes of front desk job and left me to fend for myself with a billion applications for the rest of the day,am i just being whiney i honestly dont think so ive had simpler jobs that trained me for a month and placed me with another employee so i could learn while they were doing the work  this is a front desk job im taking all the calls and booking appointments and signing stuff in and out and theres literally like 5 brand new applications i have to learn and be perfect at right off the bat because thats how we book appointments and keep up with the office customers come in and im floundering by myself at the front and i call my boss and shes telling me everything is there for me to find i just have to look while updating 5 different applications   i hate i here and its been a day is it too much to ask for even a week of training where i watch another person do the job and familiarize myself,e5gpl9

734,What inspire you to get into this profession?,when i was a student about to enroll into college i would often ask this unusual question to many professional workers such as doctors dentist office workers that i get to interact with about why they want to pursue into this career you would notice that all of them would lie to you and only share the positive when actually its the negative the positive i believe is only what their intentions and passions were when they were a child growing up because thats how we think for wanting to inspire the world but once they get into the workforce they will see the reality of how corrupted the particular industry really is,e5prn6

741,I love when people judge me for not working full time,whether its from my family my peers or my girlfriend im constantly receiving judgment for only working my 3035 hours a week at 12 an hour ive been searching for better work for years but being in ct without any sort of degree or useful skills is a death sentence   i used to let it get to me i used to beat myself up for settling on such a shitty job i climbed the corporate ladder as high as i could to be the front end supervisor but if i wanted to continue moving up id have to transfer to a new location this would mean a long commute along with approximately 50 more responsibility and hardly any raise i dont really mind my job though it sucks but it sucks marginally less than every other grocery store in my area   im constantly being pushed to do better to work harder for what all my basic needs are covered i pay plenty of bills ive got a roof above me but still im told daily that i need more i dont need shit ive learned to be more than happy with what i have to want anything more than what i have currently would just be greed   i put in my 35 hours and spend my remaining free time painting and being with my friends the only things that keep me sane anymore but thats not a valid way to spend my free time in the eyes of the public   so my advice to anyone reading this just stop caring stop trying to change how people view you because its a lost cause its an uphill battle trying to convince people that youre not actually a loser and all we can do is hope that they too see the light someday,e64ee1

743,At what point do I say enough is enough?,im not sure how to phrase this but im just graduated from college and i work in finance in the few short months of working ive realized i can complete my work within 23 hours where the rest of my time is spent getting frustrated with the lack of reasons as to why i should be there i really do not want to come off as entitled but sitting in a cubicle for 9 hours makes me want to shatter both of my kneecaps with a hammer its a depressing life and i cant cope with the fact this is seen as normal in society minimal human interaction minimal fresh air artificial lighting absolutely mind numbing theres got to be something more to life  i want to quit so bad this existential dread will be the death of me since companies would rather have asses in seats as opposed to efficiency is complete and utter bull,e60we6

748,Tales of office life: brown nosing &amp; forced fun,i hate my job waking up at 6am every morning fills me with dread and anxiety and i survive everyday by popping various pills that help ease the pain of a monotonous day at work however this job has an end i took this job so as i can live closer to my parents to move back in with temporarily and save enough money so that in about 6 months i can move abroad to where there are jobs related to my degree i still have slight hope that i wont be forever on the breadline and ill be able to have a nice lifestyle at some point i know ill always be a slave but maybe it wont be so bad if i can still have sometime to enjoy some of my life   this job i work now pays really poor i mean like just above minimum wage this part of the country really lacks skilled jobs so finding something that pays well takes time that i dont have now its coming upto christmas everyone is trying to push for all these different activities and this is now putting me over the edge colleagues of mine are trying to get everyone to put money in from my team to pay for a present for the boss because hes been so nice even though he gets paid more than us and is practically forced to be nice due to union rules its just a way for them to brown nose but im forced to take park i hate how people treat their job as a lifestyle like for example secret santa its just a waste of money to buy pointless things for people you dont know yet youre seen as anti teamwork etc if you dont partake and waste hard earned money on it   im just exhausted and want an easy life yet people put silly pressures on you to conform in their way,e5yaef

753,I finally have everything I’ve ever wanted but my soul is desperately unhappy,i was always a believer in being your own boss after a brief stint in 95 i realized it wasnt for me and became a serverblogger to supplement my dream of writing  3 years later i became a full time blogger and i was really happy except for one thing the money was extremely inconsistent some months i was flush but most of the time i was struggling   this financial struggle really hindered my marriage my husband was the sole provider most of the time to help me with my dream he supported me to no end and i love him for that but the power dynamics the resentment the lack of my contribution to the team almost made us divorce several times theres a bit more to it but we basically were not contributing financially on the same level and i felt very dependent on him  finally when a 95 opened up in a field im really good in i applied and got the job immediately i was very qualified and to be honest its not that bad i realize how good i have it and i should be grateful i also love the stability i kept my blogging job while doing this and for once in my life i actually have money im not always afraid and my husband and i arent strained anymore hes proud of my hard work and sees me as an equal now thanks to my contribution were happy together and i can finally buy something for myself once in awhile and not feel like im putting us behind   but the problem with this job and every other corporate type of job is that i just dont believe in it the quality of life the idea we all have to act and look a certain way the fake business banter the corporate american dream and selling things people dont need i work in the luxury field which means everyone has nice cars just bc they want to they dress in seersucker suits bc they feel like it and that vain and shallow materialism makes me sick to my stomach i feel like im compromising my morals and integrity   i should be happy im getting a new type of peace ive been yearning for but my soul is unhappy,e582cy

755,Overtime should not be mandatory,i recently found this sub so i thought i would come on here and vent about my jobovertime  ive been at my job for 12 years now one of the things we have to deal with there is mandatory overtime i used to have to work 6 days a week about 50 hours per week but then i took my current position 5 years ago which allows me to only work 5 days a week but i still have to put in mandatory overtime during those 5 days  i just wanted to say i think thats bs a 40 hour work week is bad enough and still barely allows us enough personal time since much of that time is spent doing errands sleeping getting ready for and then commuting to work i personally think that overtime should be strictly voluntary and that you should not be mandated to work more than 8 hours a day  i also personally think that overtime should be calculated by daily hours not weekly hours so if you work more than 8 hours in a day anything over that should be time and a half it doesnt seem fair that you could bust your butt working from the time you get up until the time you go to sleep and then possibly come down with an illness and need to call out sick so you dont even get extra compensation for those long hours you put in that day  plus at my job we dont even start getting time and a half until 425 hours instead of the usual 40 i thought for sure this was illegal so i previously did some research about overtime laws in my state and it turns out that its not since we get paid 30 minute breaks each day thats not counted toward hours worked some companies dont pay you for your breaks so i should probably be thankful however sometimes were so busy that we wont even take our full break if we take one at all thats what grinds my gears about it of course some people would say well take your break then this is exactly why i usually do take my break however some days i just know i am going to be there forever and would rather take the loss than have to stay there any longer than necessary i try to get my work done and get out of there as soon as possible thats another thing about my job we have a set time of when we need to be there but we dont get to just simply clock out at a certain time we each have an account list and the accounts must be done each day we have to stay until weve completed everything or else we will be reprimandedat risk of termination,e5ukhf
