9,Being 23 and in an Office Sucks,i just need to rant  i work at a small firm as an office manager temp and i think it has crushed me hopefully wont be here through the next year but who knows since its so small i see my bosses credit card statements and the invoices form the two other independent contractors that work as a financial director and analyst they all have a lot more money than me that in and of itself is not the problem my boss is constantly working the financial director is constantly working whatever  the fucking analyst who by the way is already well known to be completely socially inept crashed the computer the firm got him and is going to be given a new one now you may be thinking oh he just works that hard at his job fucking no he runs starcraft and shit on his work computer this computer that cost thousands of dollars that hes had for a year is breaking down because hes a dumb ass who made as much as i make in a year as his bonus and to top that off hes such a greedy fucker that we cant even get snacks for the office anymore because he steals them and takes them home and we go through them way to fast he constantly asks for them so i dont know if hes just too stupid to put it together that we dont get them anymore because of him or if he really just doesnt care and as im listening to a conference call saying they are waiting on files from him i walk in on him taking a fucking nap in the back of the office he makes at lease 5x more than me and is an incompetent sexist oblivious condescending ass his area of the office i think actually smells because its such a mess and leaves coffee cups out constantly im not his fucking assistant really i shouldnt be doing assistant work for anyone except the partners but its such a small office i cant say no  the financial director works hard but she treats me like im an idiot she is the most baby boomer of baby boomer people that refuses to call herself a baby boomer because at least shes smart enough to know what that connotation is i literally heard her say the phrases if itll affect profits they will not implement more environmentally friendly options and i would not sacrifice convenience for sustainability and billionaires being that rich gives me hope for myself im a musician and was telling her about the evil practices towards composers discovery was trying to implement they backed off btw and she says to my face shes thinking of investing in them and that if discovery can get these horrible new contracts pushed through theres nothing wrong with what they were doing i honestly thought all those things about baby boomers being so out of touch and only caring about profits and having no concern for the long term effects was exaggerated for memes but its all fucking true and im at a loss and to top that all off she thinks were the same because shes been taking classes over at a music school in the city while ive been playing and studying for 12 years over half my life but no she knows exactly how the music industry should work and how to play amazingly because how could there be anything i know more about than her its just made me convinced people over 50 like that need to be phased out of the economy if we have any chance of surviving theyre so sure their way of doing things is the only possible way but their way is what got us into the mess were in today  im sick of being the catch all for work people dont want to do i feel like my fucking brain is rotting away and not being used im sick of being around people that are ok with the way things are im sick of being around so many people who are so out of touch with the way things are im sick of this job and im sick of feeling stuck in it because it pay 3 better an hour than anything else i can even find on the internet i just want it to stop,evabd4

28,A thought that occurred to me,so a big talking point against life essentials food shelter healthcare clothing etc being considered human rights is if people dont need to sell their labor to survive society will collapse  butbasic life essentials arent the only things that cost money im willing to bet everyone in this sub has a hobby or at least something theyd like to have as a hobby if work wasnt so demanding everyone would love to travel or to learn or to spend time with their loved ones so if it was just essentials are free people would still work to afford things they dont technically need but that would make their lives happier  what would really change though is who holds the power bosses wouldnt get to just treat their employees like dogshit anymore because if they try their employees arent just going to think well this sucks but without this job ill starve theyll speak up or theyll quit  and competition for jobs wouldnt be so stiff because instead of one person working long hours itd probably be closer to a bunch of people working short shiftsafter all if money is just for nice to haves instead of essentials nobody is gonna work for eight solid hours five days a week  and i think thats why capitalists try to push the we need to make people work to survive narrative  i dont know where ubi or automation would fit into this but im also just word vomiting right now,evrwe0
29,Getting in significant debt for medical school,i was wondering what people would do in my situation i am 31 and currently going nowhere i graduated with a physics degree in 2015 i got top grades but nothing has worked out ive gotten close to getting on graduate schemes including a 3 year training course in medical physics which would have been a very good job but i got rejected  i applied to medicine in september for the third year in a row and have been offered an interview at one university but there is a catch  i have to pay the tuition fees myself as i have been offered an interview on an unfunded undergraduate course  in the uk there are two pathways into medicine  graduate entry funded 4 year accelerated courses  very competitive and undergraduate entry the standard 5 year course undergraduate entry is not funded if you already hold a degree so i will have to pay 36000  9k a year for the first four years the final year is funded and i would also have to take out 3500 a year student loans for living costs  i already owe 32000 in student loans so the living expenses will raise my debt to about 50000 to pay the tuition fees i would have to take out a bank loan of some sort totalling about 16000 the figures are probably more than this as i doubt i can live on 3500 a year  i just dont know what to do i could go to the interview but it would be very hard if i got an offer and then had to turn it down  i still live at home and my parents are on my case all the time now some family members told me to go into accounting but i have no interest in that and know i would be depressed for the rest of my working life i would rather work retail am i being a brat here my dad has a work to live attitude but i dont see the point i would rather not exist ive worked jobs i hated before crap minimum wage jobs where i was treated like dirt but i got through them because i knew it was temporary,eupxy1

53,From HATING Work to Millionaire in 2 Years, i know this is a clickbaity title but i need to get your attention for this one and i will make it as straight to the point as i can  1 you dont hate work   what you hate is slaving away for minimum wage doing meaningless tasks not getting the recognition you deserve getting told what to do from people that are not competent etc the list goes on and on and i know that from experience  i myself hated my job for 6 years until finally my employer gave me a huge favor and fired me now i am so grateful for what was at the time devastating to me i knew i was not happy at the place but i didnt have the courage to leave that decision was luckily took care of by a termination without notice  so now im finally free of the work i hated so much free of all the gossip between coworkers free of the shitty attitude of my boss and im not gonna lie it was a huge weight off my shoulders it felt greatfor a few weeks   after an initial period of relief i started to fall into a hole of meaningless day to day activities days filled with constant pleasure seeking like sleeping in everyday of the week drinking with friends watching youtube etc what i didnt know at the time was that seeking instant gratification was the opposite if what makes life truly livable  2 you want to work  even more you need to work you need to pick a challenging task get after it and feel great about your accomplishment if theres no real struggle in the beginning there is no real happiness in the end nature built that into us otherwise the human race would have never started to build shelter invented tools and made it this far  back to my story so im noch 2 months unemployed and i fail even worse compared to still having a job because of all the freetime or better because of freetime being wasted  so i started picking up tasks i wanted to do for a long time learning to play the ukulele read books working out meditation yoga etc i tried a lot of things and the more different things i tried i learned what i enjoy and what i am good at the amazing thing is that usually the things you enjoy you are good at and vice versa so through reading a few biographies about steve jobs elon musk philip knight richard branson i had the urge to try and see if a had what it takes to be an entrepreneur just for the reason to take a difficult task and dedicate a few hours everyday to see how far i can come the emphasize  is on everyday  the crazy thing is that it never felt like work it just felt like a puzzle or a game you try to complete i enjoyed doing it everyday it was not work although from the outside it sure looked like it  3 you want purpose  what if your current work was meaningful challenging rewarding diversified respected etc how would you feel about work you sure would not be antiwork would you   so the problem is not work the problem is that your work is not aligned with your core with what you truly want to do in life this can be being a teacher nutritionist personal trainer marketeer dog walker etc it doesnt matter what it is all what matters is that you find that thing or things you enjoy since you enjoy it you will be good at it and you will for sure find a way to use that activity to add value to other peoples life  they will be happy to pay for that activity  ampx200b  4 transform your negativity into positivity  how far has being negativ brought you in life for me it took me straight to depression and unemployment but you dont have to go all the way like it did you can use the energy of all that negativity and let it fuel your dream take all that hate anger feeling of injustice and put it towards trying out new things thats all im asking  i dont expect you to be a superstar in the next activity your trying nor do i want you to be demoralized after trying 1 or 20 activities you dont like you only need one thing that you truly enjoy with all your core  you are set for life you found your so called purpose  ampx200b  5 be grateful and dedicate 100  no matter how shitty your situation seems at this point there are always things to be grateful for even if its just that you are alive breath are able to experience this wonderful planet i know this kind sound silly but its crucial to remain grateful this will put you in a completely different state of mind a state where your mind is fully positive sees the solutions instead of the problems and is just fully committed to get you where you need to be   just trust the process of your inner being  ampx200b  to close to loop to my personal story after being unemployed 3 years i never worked a single day all i did was following my passion and purpose to deliver value as best as i could this was not only beneficial for my financials but even more important for my wellbeing i dont care about the money i make as long as i can continue doing what i love the money it just a side effect of you living up to your highest potential   ampx200b  and i know you have the potential to achieve everything you want  ampx200b  tldr   find a job you enjoy doing and you will never have to work a day in your life   mark twain  ampx200b  disclaimer  there is no catch no self promotion no newsletter nothing  all i want for you is to reach your potential without wasting more of your precious time if i can save one of you from the pain i experienced

61,It's Partially My Fault,i just discovered this sub and am thrilled you people exist   last year i quit my midsixfigure paying job left my city my apartment my life and moved up into the mountains several hours away from it all i did this because i was not only fed up with what work had become pointless useless empty but because i was in a powerful position implementing rules and structures that were only there to get people to work more so i could pay them less   i managed a team of 65 people and i worked together with my business partner to ensure they stayed at the company while paying them as little as we could but offering them as many bullshit tech industry freebies as we could to keep them engaged turns out millennials love snacks beer and gym memberships   i was part of the problem and simply quit one day because i didnt want to participate anymore i couldnt participate anymore i didnt have a name for what i felt it just felt wrong  now i fully understand i was lucky to have had 15 years of high paying work under my belt so i could leave without a plan and had the ability to not work while i figured out my next steps i now consult parttime and that gives me what i need  but ive spent a lot of time the past few months thinking about how sick the system is and what my role was in it i read bullshit jobs i began reading everything anand giridharadas wrote and spoke to former colleagues to learn about their perspectives of our industry  i suppose im sharing all of this because ive never shared it before my family friends and colleagues truly think im insane for walking away from it all ive been asked if i am struggling if i feel unwell if i need help  i just realized that the entire system is designed to keep people in the systemand thats it there are better ways for people to make money and get benefits and spend their time i dont believe all work needs to be abolished but that work needs to serve a purpose and not simply serve the rich eight hours a day shouldnt matter two weeks vacation is horseshit health insurance tied to your employer i cant even begin to talk about how fucked up that is  id like to contribute more of my knowledge to this group share news i see in the business world that frustrates me and give some insight into how and why people like me perpetuate a system that only makes us rich and everyone else a cog if im not welcome given my participation i understand but i look forward to following what everyone has to say,ewz1ms

71,Just a morning thoughts that I would like to share with you.,hello fellow idlers  i noticed that many of you are being hard on yourself you criticize capitalism applause but somehow you always end up being criticized by your parents and ending sentences with my lame ass cant do anything better or i dont know what else to do well lets go back couple tens of thousands years ago when we were just developing agriculture when we went to hunt beasts it wasnt every man for himself or 1 guy per 1 beast it was 10 guys with spears and 2 or 3 spears to slow or kill the animal so that all our families can eat the ones that hit could probably brag but i doubt that they would get 3x more meat it would be shared and all bellies would be full if you started hunting with your ancient father at the age of 7 you would be pro 10  15 years later  what do you do in todays schools 15 years of obedient learning stressful learning 80 things that you dont need or forget a year later then you decide as grown person to be as good as possible in one field and they charge you fortune dont care about your 15 previous years and they torture you again learning finding job to serve someone and you give them your life not just knowledge on the plate you find that rational no how is then being hard on yourself rational dont be  my family had to move from yugoslavia during 95 wars and we had to meet all kinds of people in belgrade serbia from government officials to people on miserable welfare do you really think that surgion knows alot he is good at his field of medicine and drives car thats all he couldnt buy apartment without my brothers assistance he cant repair car without my fathers assistance and we joke that changing a tire would require more assistance to him than he has in surgery room and he is in his mid 30s only people who know many jobs are the ones who had to work many jobs or were forced to learn because of 1 mad parent evolution doesnt work by burning neurons at the speed of light but rather doing what you are good at and focusing on what your genetics allows you society expects concentration from people with add and stand up comedy from people who are introverted or autistic  belgrade berlin or buffalo they are all insane we all know this doesnt work for anyone but 3  5 of 8 billion people and you still find place to blame yourself  go buy cheap land and grow vineyard sell half to others and experiment with wine with the other half dont like that buy a mini van and learn everything about some region then offer your full services on tourists sites and airpots you can become local safari experience depending where you choose save emergency money  small business money 10  30k and give it a try dont tell me that you wont try to change your life and buy yourself good chunk of a freedom for damn 20some k i will,ewkqyr

74,isn't it weird how people are afraid of machines taking jobs?,only a short while ago we dreamed of higher productivity lower working hours and less inequality   if industrialisation continues as it is then machines will soon replace many jobs and ramp up productivity with relatively lower cost in the long run  i hear a lot of people using this as a horror story of the future that the machines are coming for us and will take our jobs and make us all starve which is firstly unrealistic as a capitalist society would collapse as soon as the consumers all die off rich people cannot take money from themselves    it makes more sense then to assume that the advent of machines opens us up to not having to rely on a give and take society that we have in effect come close to achieving that long sought after goal of leisure and creativity if we establish renewable energy sources and place machines in control of our necessary faculties then we can feed everyone and allow those who once spent their days driving tractors to work on creating more and more advancements to those machines or perhaps to the food themselves   jobs are only necessary because we need money to buy the things we need to survive but place robots in charge of the unpleasant repetitive and unsafe jobs and there is no need to provide an incentive to work people will do what they wish to do  success will be measured by progress not profits you pick up food at no cost to anyone you find your place in society through your passion you work together with all of humanity to make the world a better place no robbery no insurance fraud just people working on the systems the protect us and provide for us they will not turn on us because they are an extension of ourselves   i do not have all the answers to what may or may not happen in the future but it seems obvious to me that we should work towards mechanising the world harnessing renewable energy and helping others   i am but one person alone evaluating a culture of capitalism that seeks to become rich in the short term and benefit from the material wealth that it provides we are afraid of losing our jobs of being poor and starving but if we could all lend a hand to each other and work together we could achieve a free society of progress and passion   obviously dont praise the employers that lay off millions of workers to replace them with machines but work towards your government giving everyone the right and ability to exist and make mechanisation both a possibility and a sustainable necessity in order for us to transition from human driven labour to robot driven labour we have to make it possible for humans to be replaced and that means sustainable services that help people gain upward momentum such as education shelter and food   your government may seem corrupt but it works for the people change the minds of those who fear a change in society and rally everyone together this is a three step process give people the ability to survive without jobs remove the jobs and replace them with renewable energy powered machines give people the resources they need for free and allow humans to reach their full potential   tldr robots are the answer not the problem your government and your employer is the problem  thanks for reading,ew3jti

94,Intergenerational bullshit,ive been thinking about how antiwork can be applicable to school growing up the importance of school was emphasized very heavily in my house my parents both grew up in a tiny east african country and were the children of subsistence farmers my dad now works at an organization in new york city thanks to the opportunities being educated afforded him so im not shitting on school entirely because i wouldnt be here typing this if my dad hadnt been lucky enough to receive an education however there are so many stupid negative ideas that get drilled into the heads of students some of which i saw through and some of which i didnt until recently   but if i dont get good grades then i wont get into a good school and if i dont get into a good school then i wont get a good job and then ill have a bad life   this was a common refrain among my classmates in the honors classes it was such bullshit and even the teachers would be charmed by this devotion to school for sake of having a good job and good life my friend and i find it funny that most of our peers who had that attitude didnt even end up going to prestigious schools like a lot of them went to state schools which is totally fine but i just find it ironic because they could have gotten there with half the effort i kinda feel bad for them because during high school they seriously neglected their mental and physical health and for what a socalled good life   while i never got swept up in thinking that the difference between an a and a b would determine the rest of my life i did absorb some of those harmful ideas that i have to be productive all the time to be worth something this idea was especially insidious for me because i have adhd and have struggled with being productive and focused my whole life i hated myself for not being able to be the perfect student and held myself to really high standards to basically punish myself in tenth grade i found an online community of really dedicated and organized students and would wish i could be more like them   things took a turn when i read a blog post from one of these students she was like twenty and she wrote about how she had spent the last semester working herself to the bone taking seven classes in one semester and working two jobs her health deteriorated to the point where she was fainting but the blog post wasnt about learning from that it was about how through her efforts she graduated early and got accepted to law school making her the youngest student there she said she was proud of herself for what she had done and its not like she isnt a seriously accomplished person but at what cost whats even scarier is that at the time that i read the post i wished i could be more like her looking back i can see how insane that was and its just so shocking to me   im nineteen now and im working to get past that productivity at all costs mindset im glad i never had the discipline to push myself to that level i feel really bad because my generation had to deal with a lot of pressure to succeed from a very young age i get that were lucky we dont have to be child laborers but its just insane how were inundated with this capitalist nonsense things are just so competitive these days and the middle class is getting smaller and smaller so i dont blame my peers for pushing themselves so hard its sad that a lot of us spent our youth working in preparation for a lifetime to be spent working ,ewpduj
95,Needed a couple of mental health days off from work - I hope my doctor's office can give me a note for that!,i teach parttime but for a company the only way they excuse absences is with a doctors note physically i am okay but mentally my anxiety has been an issue i need a couple of mental health days off from work and i am hoping my doctors office will give me that  i called to see if thats something they would do but the person on the phone just said i dont know youll just have to come in and see mental health is just as important as physical health yesterday i taught one class but had to cancel my others because i felt like i was fighting off a panic attack all through the first class  but due to the strict nature of teaching for the company i couldnt cancel i had to try my best and fake it through the entire class even though i felt like i couldnt breathe  i know i have a viable excuse it just sucks i have to go through so many hoops to prove myself plus the idea of being turned away by a doctor and possibly losing my job because of it is so disgusting,ewq4vj
96,Ridiculous Interview Today [Ranty/Long],im a recent college grad looking for a it job so i can finally make some money had an interview today the guy spends 40 minutes asking me a mix of standard corporate bs questions and overly personal questions including whos your best friend i dont have any friends what the hell does that have to do with a tech support job   ampx200b  i miss two questions since i didnt memorize the companys ceo and when it was founded and also didnt deliver a convincing sell near the end of the interview whatever the guy tells me that based on my resume that i can do the job but he asks all these questions to find a good fit whatever he then says that im on the borderline of being hired and that he wants to send me some info and have me do a skype presentation on it what the fuck a presentation on my own time for free hell no he asks what i think i tell him it sounds like unpaid work he says its not unpaid work since the company isnt profiting on it i refuse and he ends the interview  ampx200b  why is it not enough that i can do the job he literally said i could do the job why do employers insist on having you jump through as many hoops as humanly possible not to mention the salary was on the lower end since i dont have any prior experience he claims hes not trying to low ball me but he obviously is im so grateful to this community because you guys understand how bs this process can be ugh,ewy5qs

99,I’m not taking advantage of you just because I need to take time off sometimes.,please let me know if this is the wrong subreddit for this rant there are aspects of work that im realizing are so damaging to the human spirit  i work at a family owned business not my family as a healthcare provider hourly  there are a couple issues i run into 1 who is my boss owner or owners wife or both 2 i allegedly take too much time off which affects my availability for appointments i have only taken time off for doctor appointments illness and very occasional family events ie wedding and thanksgiving 3 i need to maintain my license by completing continuing education live webinars but apparently that is severely limiting even though its two hours per week and i offered to come in early or stay late  i dont like being treated like im taking advantage of them all the time i work my ass off but im not going to ignore my health problems just so i happen to be available at all hours and im not going to avoid continuing education because then i wouldnt be able to practice at all  im so irritated at the tone that implies im ungrateful or using them when they clearly have the position of power what scares me is that its like this no matter what every job has management that somehow does not understand the perspective of the worker and has lost what they used to know when they were in that position its all about production and sales then im expected to see things from the boss perspective when they dont attempt to see it from mine yes i know you want to stay in business but what short term thinking this is how im spending the hours of my life and its depressing and theres somehow no escape  im trying to be a good person and help people through my work but how on earth do people spend their life among ungrateful bosses and customers ive had varied advice accept that this is who they are try to compromise recognize that this is just for a period of time to build your resume  im pissed and lost how will things change,evqflh

140,My case: is this normal? Did I do the right thing?,so for context i am european and live in a poor european country even though unemployment rates having been hiting low values the salaries are very low with the average being around 900month while rent of a room in one of the major cities is around 400 month room not apartment   i graduated in pharmaceutical sciences 3 years ago and since then had several experiences pharmacy hated it then 6 months of call center jobs until i found something better 6 months in a consulting company that randomly fired half of the people they had hired because after 6 months they finally admited they precipitated and should have only had hired the people after getting the projects which then they didnt get then 3 months of unemployment 14 months of a research grant this was experience was good but research is quite unstable here you dont get social security protection one of my bosses was a bully and the other one was a great person but a bit too slow and maybe dement   so i decided to enroll in a programming bootcamp in fact i was applying to phds abroad but didnt get any so then i started doing another master in bioinformatics but the bootcamp opportunity came up and seemed good these bootcamps here cost around 60006500 for three months of full time training 8hday this one was organized by a human resources firm was free and they paid us a small monthly stipend it lasted 3 months but parttime 6hday and then after 3 months we would have a 6 months internship in a consulting firm during this period if we quit we would have to reimburse the human resources firm  in the end after that 36 period the company in which we interned would give us a contract and we would have to give preference to accept that contract or refrain from accepting a contract from competitors for a period of 3 months after the training also they said that the conditions offered by the company vary but on average most of them asked for a permanence period of 9 to 12 months in which if we quit we would have to pay back to the company the value of the training  so it seemed like a good deal and i took it  fast forward to the 3rd month of the training thus the last month of the theoretical training just before starting the 6 months internship the company of the internship invites us for a meeting and gives us a contract that we would have to sign now and that would force us to accept a contract after the 6 months of training whilst before we had to give preference but were not forced to and furthermore that contract would have a 24 month permanece clause me and some coworkers spoke out and declined to sign so everyone else 15 people declined to sign the human resources company had meetings with the other company and this time they call us to have individual meetings with which one of us to present the new proposal in this new proposal the permanence period decreased to 12 months but the work hours would be more and also wed still be forced to sign now and not after the internship this company is a multinantional consulting firm with a terrible reputation of making workers staying overtime more than the other consulting firms   i declined again to sign the contract i said i would like to do the internship with them but would only analyze the contract in the end of the internship like it had been initially told me and liked i have agreed upon and in the training contract i signed it only says i have to give preference to their contract in the end of the training they said if i dont sign i wont have the internship with them so i didnt sign because i dont like coercion   however this time of all the 15 people of my training only me and another one did not sign all the rest did  the salary is around 1200month which is a bit above the national average and its good because we only have a 9 month bootcamp but i just dont understand why they want so bad for us to sign now   i believe they want to trap people because when they realise during the internship they will have to work not 40hweek but 50hweek or more maybe in the end people would prefer not to sign with them and wait three months to free to search another job but they claim nobody will force you to work more than 50h because its illegal even though on online reviews i read comments of people who say they work 11h to 12hday and they also say the training is very expensive and thus they need to have assurance  during the internship well be getting less than half of what a junior does so i believe the training which i highly doubt costs what they claim it costs which is 10550 per person will be paid in those 6 months in any case even if they need more time to pay off the invesment why was i told in the beggining i would only have to sign after the internship and the average would be 912months  all my colleagues say they are satisfied and that this is the better offer possible all the rest are much worst i still felt i was being mislead and not treated with transparency and declined to sign was it a stupid move or did i do the right thing,etkns3
141,I complained about a lazy coworker and it backfired. Now what?,to summarize i work in a very disorganized team and after one person had quit i got their workload on top of mine my current work depends on what john one rank higher does when i got the position i noticed that i was being asked to do things that were not in my job description to give you an idea all others in the same rank as john have three projects and do reports that i depend on to enter information to databases john has one semi project where he enrolls patients and submits their biopsy requests after we get the biopsy reports i do a weekly presentation summary of results and update two databases in reality john should be doing all those things and i should only be responsible for database work   i tried to be very diplomatic and professional and tell my manager of what was happening my manager is non confrontational and wouldnt do anything i ended up expressing how i had too much work load to do the presentation so he would take it since the presentation had a treatment history part something only john and others in his rank should be doing and 100 not in my job description as expected john says he doesnt know how to do treatment history so i teach him how also not my job because im not supposed to be doing that part anyway and after he does it once he comes to me saying the main doctor sarah  responsible for the study wants the treatment history on the summaries i prepare i said ok so you gotta do the presentation before u do the summary so i can copy it and he casually says no i think you should do it and walks away   it rubbed me off wrong so i told my manager lets fall her patty again the day after patty says ok write me an email with this and ill figure it out turns out patty forwarded my email to the team lead abby and abby went to sarah and told her what i said about john word for word after i had already left work i get frantic calls from the big boss sarahs assistant and abby about coming to an urgent meeting since i was already out i called patty to ask what had happened and basically they called john and told him what i complained about word for word and were wanting me to come to the meeting basically they staged a confrontation instead of reminding him of his job description   now sarah wants to hire a new person to take over the study with john so i would be back to my older projects i guess i was semi fired lol john is upset  and according to patty denied everything i had claimed and the real kicker is that sarah said the parts john should be doing are easy and i had no right to complain about having to do it this is not the point this dude gets paid twice i do and its his literal job to do those parts not mine   so im stressed out and tense to say the lease i have a lazy coworker with a grudge and a boss who thinks im a slacker i regret saying anything and im scared ive gotten on her bad side and what if she will want me completely off the team before all this i was supposed to be taking two weeks off so im dreading coming back to this work environment with hostile people and dont know how im supposed to closely interact with them i was honestly expecting my manager patty to email him privately and explain what his job entails and what mine does but i knew she was non confrontational and she ended up making this ten times worse than it was   i know i made mistakes but the reaction i got is scaring the hell out of me what do you guys think will happen and what steps should i do besides looking for a lateral transfer before she fires me my fianc says im overreacting and i wont be fired but i honestly dont know any help appreciated thank you,etmlhs

I feel absolutely trapped.,since 17 ive had a handful of jobs all of which have lasted less than four months due to  surprise surprise  diagnosed depression and anxiety naturally however its my fault i cant hold down a job   ive felt suicidal multiple times but according to both my mum and her partner im not disciplined enough im nothing more than a snowflake it seems incapable of handling stress pressure etc etc i wanted to pursue university and study psychology but its just occurred to me that throughout ill have to work parttime on top of studies and as someone whos already struggling a week into a new job i just dont think im fit for this society   everyone suggests going to the gp but theyre absolutely useless and so are counsellors i cant even afford private therapy  that of which the nhs offers is terrible and the waiting lists are extensive ill be honest i just dont see myself making it past the age of 22 at this point and im aware of how incredibly morbid that sounds even more so i look forward to death and especially knowing ive control over when i can or cant take it  almost like a sense of relief which gets me through the day if something goes horribly wrong at least i can just kill myself  please dont tell me to seek help you and i know that other than this theres nothing and any argument which suggests otherwise was just created by the opponents to keep us in the mouse trap anyone remember mile durkheims study le suicide sort of feels like that doesnt it   apologies for being so incredibly depressing its well the depression,etux0z
173,I am an idiot. Dont make the same mistakes as me. Learn from my mistakes.,so i was told to post this here let me first establish a background before i talk about my performance review  background  i am a 31 year old guy i work as a software engineer in the last two years i decided to improve myself and give my 110 percent  to everything i do in life i achieved many big goals in my life due to my changed mindset and recently passed all the five dutch language exams to qualify for the nationality i also lost a lot of weight and i am on my way to gaining six pack abs still a long way to go but i have a flat stomach for the first time in years    i decided to apply the same principles everywhere including my work the cream rises to the top after all right   i have been killing myself for the last ten months i finish a task as quickly as possible and pickup the next without wasting time while some colleagues are waiting for the next day to pickup new tasks i pickup a new task as soon as i finish  if the tasks are finished in the sprint i pickup tasks from the next sprint in the current sprint i did more than three times the work compared to  other members of the team we are ahead of the planning as well not only that i offered to do every single team demo when other people didnt want to do it  few weeks ago there was a planning week at my company no one was doing work on the planning days i squeezed in 1620 hours of work in between those meetings  that was the reason that at the start of the sprint i had already finished most of the work  in the evenings i workout and read a nonfiction book to improve myself in the last two weeks i was so tired that i had no energy to workout or do anything my body was crushed with tiredness and in pain at the end of the day i tried reading books but my brain was blank and i couldnt retain anything   doctor and reactions from reddit  i posted on reddit about it and people told me to visit the doctor they also told me to tell my boss why i am doing this how can my boss know that i want a promotion   i went to the doctor and she told me that i have to care about my health if i continue like this i am on my way to a burnout she told me that i seem frustrated because people dont see my efforts she said that i should tell my boss how i feel  so i did people had told me to bring a list of my achievements to my boss and tell him why i deserve to get a promotionwhich backfired and probably cost me a good increment today  two months ago in one of my regular meetings with the boss i told him that i wanted a promotion i wanted to grow to a managerial role he told me i was not there yet he gave me reasons which he repeated today in the performance evaluation  performance review  so today was my performance review i was 1000 percent sure that i will get an excellent review if nothing else i would get a good increment right i am not getting a promotion but i should atleast get a decent raise here is his review in totalhe is a good guy he was never an asshole to me there were three people there me my boss and the account managerperson responsible for deciding my increment  boss so i think lovesprite thinks much higher of himself than i think of him he thinks he is herepoints very high but i think he is herepoints much much lower there are other dimensions to how i rate things and not only how much you deliver as an individual if we talk about work he delivers work on time with good quality he is doing well but two months ago we had a meeting which was the most useful meeting we had in the entire year we found the bottleneck for lovesprite personally i dont care if lovesprite is delivering 110 percent of the work i care more about the performance of the team he should have a team mindset he should not care about his performance as an individual he thinks of himself as a delivering machine when you have such a high opinion of yourself i think it can be dangerous i am looking for the correct word but maybe you start to resent your colleagues  account manager so how would you rate him in getting up to speed since starting the job last year  boss i would rate him average in getting up to speed i didnt hear anything extraordinary about that   account manager how would you rate his technical ability  boss i would not say its extraordinary i would say its between average and high  account manager how would you rate his participation in the teams  boss i think he participates well in our scrum events he also does the demos when people dont want to  account manager so if i want to summarize he works well delivers on time with good quality he needs to work on his team skills  bossyes so that is correct team is more important for me and he should try to pay attention to that  account managerwhat do you think about lovesprites ambitions he wants to be a manager  boss so he should decide if it will make him happy two months ago when he came to me about the promotion i asked him why he wanted to do it he is years away from that promotion but he should ask himself would he be happy seeing other people deliver a manager delivers very little there are many other jobs in the career path in a big company if you dont feel happy with something you shouldnt do it  reflecting back  so this was the result of my hard work in last year nothing extraordinary just average to high i was surprised that 90 percent of the conversation was focused on me not being a team player never mind that i got ill delivering 7080 percent of the stuff of the team never mind that i got so much stress to make sure that we are ahead of schedule never mind that i worked super hard to the point of burning out just so i would get noticed for a promotion its all about the team till you start performing bad then its about you and you will be fired   i am going to work like my colleagues now and the rest of this community give my 70 percent to the job and focus on my health i started getting lots of issues in the last year my memory has become horrible and i feel stressed and anxious all the time focus on yourself first and dont be an idiot like me,esw471

176,"My soul crushing experience, how I became antiwork",i was software developer for a large multi billion dollar company for about 7 years  ampx200b  i completed a project as the sole developer responsible for bringing in 560000 in revenue i  worked alone half of my weekends and averaging 60 hours per week while working on other projects i inquired about a raise i was currently paid 50000 a year i was told they can only bump it to 52000 my coworker is very cool she shared her salary to make sure i was getting paid right despite my coworker being newer less experienced and having less workload she got paid 65000 i was told i couldnt bring up salary until next review months away during my time i trained three different people every 6 months they post a list of promotion i noticed that all of the coworker i trained were promoted i still had the junior title while they were seniors  the mass layoffs happened 70 of our department gone my coworker was 8 months pregnant and got laid off she got denied cobra insurance to cover the birth of her child  they put me on a project of my lifetime a 15 million software contract with a firm to convert their old fortran w db2 system into a net w sql sever system the system reads documents processes and sends the info out to banks it was necessary for their business upkeep they only gave us 4 months to implement it it was the worst 4 months in my life let me count the ways  ampx200b  1 they only hired 3 developers including me 2 qa and 1 manager the complexity of the project required at least 8 developers i was the main developer since i started the project a month after the other two developers 2 we complained to pm and pms boss that we needed more people we told them that the go live wouldnt be possible with just three developers they just shrugged their shoulders and said we got to make do with what we got 3 one of the new requirements was to make the system read handwritten info on the documents with 90 accuracy this wasnt in the old system and apparently was a major selling point to win the contract we used some questionable commercial net library with licenses they had on ice it failed miserably and we were just told to fix it 4 they forgot to include the clients responsibility for doing some of the it work the client barely did any of this work and held us responsible for creating the databases installing software setting up the environments and the whole 9 yards us 3 were expected also do all of that on top of writing code  5 hours typically were 7 am to 11 pm 7 days a week in the last month it was 5 am to 11 pm 7 days a week pm designated 1 hour of and i shit you not family time  6 during final month pm sent wake up calls at around 5 am where i was to wake up and monitor the test system and make sure test system was processing normally then send a report 7 travel each month pm wanted itineraries so he will know exactly what times we will be available company is infamous for being late paying back expenses i had a 900 expense that took 2 months to pay back 8  company provided no version control server or ci for the project we couldnt use a public repo for obvious reasons 9 company was stupidly stingy on equipment laptops were early gen i5 8 gb and 5200 rpm hard drive with piss poor battery life the much better computers were reserved for managers who only used it for word excel and browser company dont provide remote test vms and expect devs to run test vms on your own machine using shady unverified windows os passed around in network drives 10 one of my coworkers sister had a wedding he had this on his calendar months in advance despite working a few hours on the wedding day he was chewed out for not being fully available this was on a saturday 11 that same coworker was out for a day because he fell so sick he had to go to the emergency room he was prescribed some medication that made him drowsy and mia for most of the day the pm was extremely angry bitching about him to me on the phone he went silent after he was told about it 12 the other coworker a much older guy and one of the nicest person i have met was frustrated by the lack of resources he noticed a guy on bench waiting to work on the project with the experience he tried to recruit him to work with us the pm found out yelled at him in front of everyone for doing her job for her brought him into the conference room and threaten his performance reviews tied to raises 13 this happened nearly every other day pm calls me and ask to do x feature and to release next day i told him that it will much longer than a day than he says thats not acceptable it needs to be next day we go back and forth i warned him that it will likely be broken because its rushed so i rushed the feature it breaks in several places surprise pikachu face why is it not working 14 nearly every day when i was on client site we worked in a conference room pm told us we couldnt leave until we push out a new build which is usually super late at night  15 i was yelled at in front of everyone because i was 10 minutes late to an impromptu phone call i was showering 16 product was broken since we were tired pissed overworked and understaffed clients saw the broken product what did the pm do tell the client its just a fluke and then tell the two testers to manually modify the data so that it appears working 17 pm did have a plan if release goes sideways  which it surely will and if clients extends the contract its called give up our thanksgiving christmas and new years vacation days to work on it  about a month in i see the writing on the wall i needed an exit plan i started interviewing for other positions i had four interviews that i was able to pass along as doctors appointment i failed each one miserably interviewing while deprived is no bueno   after the second month i cried every day i wanted to quit my mother had severe medical issues that left her in constant pain i had to take care of her needs and work was barely paying the bills already i was losing a lot of money because while i was away i had to have food and necessities delivered since she was unable to drive and rest of our family didnt give a fuck about me and my mother i was unable to expense that for reimbursement    i remember arriving to my hotel room at 10 pm with dozens and dozens of missed calls missed texts and emails i was seriously considering hanging myself in the closet to end all of the suffering if i was dead i didnt have to drag myself out of bed still half asleep at 5 am or put up with my bosss constant complaining that led me to my decision to put in my two weeks in right there without a job lined up   after i put in my two weeks in the pm and the pms boss decided to be nice offering gift cards and free meals they asked me at the very least to work an extra week i refused i was scheduled to travel my final week i said no because i had an interview lined up that week a load was lifted off my back  into month four and its time to release the product to production the product was unfinished broken and absolutely not ready for prime time we had a final intervention with the pm he said were going live whether we like it or not  release time we push the build to production it was slow clunky and put together with gum duct tape and spit not acceptable to the client and the testers couldnt fix data in the backend fast enough client threatened to sue pm calls everyone to book a flight immediately   the company i worked for has what they call a swat team  when things get rough they call in a bunch of senior developers and managers to rectify the situation   i had to work with one of them on my final week he was a guy who went to the us from bangladesh on a visa he told me sounded like he was about to cry that if he dont fix this then they will revoke his visa and send him back to bangladesh  i never felt so happy and free on my last day,eu183r

180,I want to tell you guys what I've been doing for the last 6 or 7 years. Working for an employer that gets it.,just want to start by saying in no way is this bragging or rubbing anything in i just want to share my story of how i have been living since i was 21 i just found this sub in which i share the sentiments exactly and i was lucky enough to find an employer who does as well without revealing exactly what i do or where i work i just wanted to post this as proof that a business can be profitable and successful while paying employees a livable wage and treating people like actual human beings  sorry about how long and rambley this will be but here we go  i never had a job interview to work where i do in fact i never even gave them a resume i met my employer at a bar and he was like hey you seem to know some things you want a job and that was literally it i fucking hate writing resumes and bullshitting my way through a cover letter just to make it look like i actually want to work where ever it is so skipping that whole soul destroying process was a dream i agreed immediately i was studying software engineering at the time because i thought i should get a real job after playing music for years and ended up dropping out a month after i got this job  i work 4 shifts a week 3 weeknights and one on the weekend during the day so every day except saturday i just do what ever i want go get lunch go for walks play xbox do gardening write music what ever and then go to work when it gets dark i also still have my saturday nights free to hang out with my friends who do the normal 95 as well  i get paid for 8 hours even though i dont think ive actually worked that long since the first year i was here and was still learning the ropes my boss knows this and doesnt give a shit he has the sentiment of well if youre done youre done no point of being here ive worked out a system where i can do what was originally 8 hours of work in 6 or less my boss still believes its 8 hours worth of work and just because im efficient at it that doesnt mean i should be paid less also if i have to come in to sort something out when im not scheduled for what ever reason even if its only for 5 minutes thats 3 hours pay for the trouble  i should also mention my boss also pays me pretty decently like im not earning big money but he could be paying me far less its more than enough to pay rent bills food and a bunch of leisure time aka the pub as long as the customers are happy and everything is getting done its cool he isnt hovering over my shoulder every two seconds in fact the last time i think i saw him we ran into each other at a music festival which he also gave me and my girlfriend free tickets to he works in a different location but its the same business ill send him a text or email if i need anything out of the ordinary and send him an email report every week of whats been going on which is pretty much fully automated now  we also have free reign over our schedules we only really require one or two people to be here at a time so if me and the other employees want time off we swap shifts around at our own leisure we do have a sort of unwritten rule that if you take a day off you have to take a future shift for who ever fills in when ever they ask but that isnt policy or anything we just do it like i went to canada for two months once came back and was filling in for people during football season all the time to make up for the extra time they put in so i could take a holiday no problem we all help each other out when it comes to things like this  also my boss has a zero tolerance ethic for shitty customers he says if they cause problems we are doing well enough that they are considered more trouble than what they are worth we have full permission to tell dickheads to kick rocks though in the 6 or so years ive been here that has only ever happened 3 or 4 times  now the downsides  the strange hours took a while to get used to my ex hated that most nights during the week i started work pretty much the same time she was finishing and regularly chewed me out for it my current partner has similar hours to me though so thats all good now but it was really stressful for a while and i was pretty lonely until i met more people that have similar free time to me and trust me there isnt many so this took a while lol  having so much free time means i spend way more money on keeping my self entertained than i really should i have barely any savings but thats not at the fault of what im paid i just always have to be doing something or else i get antsy and generally that costs money  and thats really it  my boss can do all that for us because he isnt greedy and your employer almost certainly can too they just dont all the employees where i work live relatively well and get way more time off than the average person it really is only because our boss isnt obsessed with money the company is making a profit he gets his cut he is happy with his income and isnt interested in making more and through that we get a much more relaxed work environment i really feel like this is close to how it should be for everyone maintaining productivity while keeping our humanity,esai1g

255,The Prisoner (Short Story),op here i just wrote this short story heavily inspired by the antiwork subreddit and philosophy and i thought yall might be interested and would be willing to give some feedback id like to know if yall think the naming gimmick was stupid or if the message was too heavy handed or just any critiques in general if this doesnt fit the type of content allowed on this subreddit thats totally fine this is my first short story  ampx200b  the prisoner wakes up filled with hatred the same way he does every morning his hatred is bitter and tinged with regret if he shared his bed with someone he might have lashed out at them who his hatred is targeted at he isnt sure after all he was the one who had set his alarm  the prisoner turns off his alarm and lays in bed gathering the willpower to start the day realistically he knows that the day will start with or without him but as long as he is still in his bed he can pretend that it wont he hates mornings but he knows everyone else does too and that comforts him  after a while his hatred fades into resignation and the prisoner leaves his bed to start getting ready after showering and dressing he goes to his fridge and wonders if he should eat breakfast after all he is hungry he decides against it eating this early always makes him feel sick a week ago he had tried eating some eggs and almost vomited or maybe it was a month ago time blends together when each day is indistinguishable    the prisoner and his car creep along the congested city street his eyes occasionally flicking towards the sensor that represents the temperature of the engine hes not sure what that sensor is called but he does know that if it reached the red hed be screwed that had happened to him once on his way to work he hadnt even noticed until the engine started making distressing noises he ended up being an hour late to work that day and was nearly brought to tears in front of his boss at the fear of losing his job that would be the death of me thinks the prisoner his heart twinging at that painful thought if he lost his job then  his eyes flick towards the sensor  who knows what would happen to him  he passes by city hall twice a day and the mild enjoyment he used to feel at seeing such a beautiful building has quickly faded into indifference a long time ago when his life as a working man was just beginning he would crane his head to catch a glimpse of the lofty lady liberty statue but now he would just stare at the street ahead occasionally flicking his eyes towards the sensor today though there is something new to see a small group of people holding signs maybe a dozen are just off the street in front of city hall one even has a megaphone and seems to be shouting about something the group are shaking their signs in agreement while a single police officer stands on the steps regarding them with contempt the prisoner wonders what they are all doing outside on a cold winter morning and on a work day no less  as he drives the prisoner reads some signs just to find something to think about most of the signs have something to do with rich people or taxes or something hes certain that money is involved one sign sticks out to him though because it simply reads free yourself the prisoner finds that extremely odd free himself he is free what is that sign insinuating no he doesnt like the sign at all or the woman holding it for that matter i am free thinks the prisoner more than just free his life was going great thank you very much he has a job that pays the bills and if he keeps working hard he might one day be promoted sure there werent many developments on the romantic side of things but who could spare the time to go on dates come to think of it a lot of his interests had fallen to the wayside in the past few years but what can you expect being a working man he used to go camping he remembered suddenly and would stare at the stars far away from the welllit nights of the city things could be much worse for him though no the prisoner reassures himself im very grateful for my lot in life those people with the signs are just troublemakers riling people up over nothing they should be grateful that things arent worse they should be grateful like him    the moment the prisoner sits at his desk he feels his mind numb and his eyes glaze thats a blessing though it makes the clock go faster he checks his work email then his mailbox and takes stock of his tasks for the day nothing out of the ordinary if he really tried he could finish it all by lunchtime but that would present a slew of problems he would rather just avoid if he finishes his work early his boss might give him more to do nothing important just time wasting he might have to reorganize their client files or digitize some old records and even if his boss didnt notice that he wasnt doing anything then he would be stuck without anything to do until 5 oclock he wouldnt even be able to check his personal email or read a book because they were always watching the security cameras and the employees screens to catch any time wasters having nothing to do was worse than the work at least when he was working time didnt warp turning minutes to hours and hours to lifetimes or at least it didnt warp as much no it was better to avoid all that and make his work last the whole day he wouldnt want to be a time waster  as he types at about half the speed he is capable of his mind returns to his past why hadnt he gone camping in the past few years it had made him so happy looking up at the endless night sky had always made him feel small but in a comforting way sure he was insignificant but he had the opportunity to catch a glimpse of the stunning unending universe look its the milky way what more could one want he was like an ant meeting god and his friends those were the best times of his life just him and his friends wasting time in the woods its been years since hed seen his friends theyd tried to meet up a few times over the years but the plans always fell through it seemed like nobody ever had time anymore or maybe nobody had the energy or the soul the prisoner feels a sense of loss anyway thats just what happens when you grow up you start working you move on to more important things and you lose touch with old friends happens to everybody  nearby footsteps bring the prisoner out of his line of thought he recognizes them as the short angry footsteps of his boss the warden   good morning warden says the prisoner  good morning prisoner says the warden could we chat for a minute  sure thing says the prisoner as if he has a choice  the warden begins pointing out the various flaws in some report that the prisoner cant even remember writing his paternalistic tone fails to cloak the ever present threat of termination and it is a threat if he was fired chances are he wouldnt be able to quickly find a job that paid enough for him to keep his apartment his savings were meager he would probably be evicted and then where could he go  ive talked to you about these kinds of simple mistakes before prisoner the warden sighs i hate these types of chats you know im your boss but im also your friend right  what says the prisoner startled out of his thoughts  were friends right prisoner   yeah of course warden  of course what  were friends  great remember always give 110 percent everyone at this company is family and you never want to let down your family  i hate you thinks the prisoner  i hear you says the prisoner    you know you shouldnt let him talk to you like that for that matter none of us should let him talk to us like that says the dissident poking at his salad with a plastic fork  hes our boss  so were all adults why should anyone have the right to talk to us like that did you hear how condescending he was prisoner this piece of paper is eggshell white and i specifically asked for ghost white one more screw up like this and i might just be forced to terminate you   the dissidents poor impression makes the prisoner laugh  hes an asshole but hes still our boss bosses are assholes its like a law of nature  it shouldnt be i mean why is it ok for him to treat us like that we are the ones who do all the real work in this company he treats us like were prisoners in a camp or something  the dissidents words remind the prisoner of the sign he had seen on his commute he starts to get irritated the dissident is his friend but sometimes it feels like he isnt grateful to have the job he did doesnt he know things could be a lot worse  youre just being dramatic we have it good you know we live in a free country and people all over the world have it a lot worse than us  do you feel free though  what do you mean  i mean do you feel like youre free  i am free says the prisoner  but do you feel like youre free do you enjoy life do you spend your days prancing through fields of flowers just reveling in your freedom the dissident started to get worked up no you spend your days the same as the rest of us doing pointless bullshit under the thumb of that wannabe tyrant and when you go home do you do something youre passionate about no you go back to your crappy apartment watch tv and wait for the next day to start because youre too goddamn burned out to do anything you love just like the rest of us the dissident stands up like hes giving a speech although nobody else in the break room is listening what good does it do to live in a free country if we all live bland passionless lives  shut the hell up hisses the prisoner it doesnt seem like anybody is listening but if somebody reported the dissidents behavior to the warden they would both be in big trouble you cant just going around saying anything you want like that some opinions have to be kept secret for your own safety besides the dissident is pissing him off doesnt he know that he should be grateful    the prisoner had finally left work and was driving home he wasnt feeling the relief that he normally did when the day was over though he couldnt stop thinking about what the dissident had said doesnt he know that there is no point in trying to change things people have to work if they want to live and if you want to work you have to do whatever your boss says with a smile and that is just the way things are and if you work harder than everybody else the prisoner tells himself then one day theyll recognize that and youll be rewarded thats how the world works his eyes flick towards the sensor  as he draws closer to city hall he sees something that fuels his anger the dozen or so sign holders from the morning had grown into a crowd of at least a hundred illuminated by street lights the single contemptuous policeman had become twenty wearing helmets and holding riot shields the police are stationed in between the front of city hall and the crowd of protesters the protesters are moving up the steps and towards the large entrance as a pack at the back of the crowd just off the side of the street he could see the woman from this morning holding the same sign free yourself  the prisoner feels a surge of rage who the fuck does she think she is he is free and he is happy the prisoners sweaty hands clutch the steering wheel his face twisting with rage that bitch doesnt know what shes talking about doesnt she know that people get what they deserve doesnt she know that things could be much worse doesnt she know that they could take away what little we have if we piss them off  that woman with the sign is just as bad as the dissident they should know better than to challenge the people who sign our checks   almost subconsciously the prisoner starts to turn his steering wheel towards the object of his rage soon he is swerving across lanes at the woman who has her face turned towards city hall within seconds his car would fly over the curb destroying the woman who dared to imply that the prisoner was wasting his life  free himself free himself from what he has a job he works hard and one day they will give him what he deserves there is nothing wrong with the system people just want to be given things that they havent earned   the woman turns around and screams paralyzed with fear as she sees the car barreling towards her she drops her sign while one of her friends tries to pull her out of the way its in vain they wont be fast enough  this woman and the dissident they believe the world is unfair they believe that were being taken advantage of they believe the game is rigged but thats not true it cant be if thats true then that means everything ive sacrificed my friends my love life my free time my happiness it was all for nothing it was all for nothing  at the last second the prisoners car changes course narrowly missing the woman his body is shaking uncontrollably and drenched in a cold sweat  what the fuck was i thinking the prisoner says to himself he starts driving normally again changing lanes to gain distance from the protesters  as his nerves slowly steady he tries to figure out what had come over him why had he done that he could have killed that woman and himself he couldnt quite remember what line of thought had led him to such a drastic course of action he ponders it for a few moments then shrugs when he cant find the memory  he glances up out of his windshield at the sky its already dark out winter days were especially short and he stayed a few hours late at work at the request of the warden no stars thats fine the prisoner is a working man his mind is on more important things after all the prisoner has work tomorrow,er2bgi

292,I snuck out of work last night just so I could work overtime without being scolded.,i dont even know if this is the right place to post this but i just had to tell somebody about this because its ridiculous  im currently on 4 projects but my boss has been prioritizing his favorite one to the point that im not allowed to work on the other three and now im severely behind on the others im getting a lot of pressure from other consultants and colleagues because theyre basically waiting on me to do my part  literally the only way to catch up is to work on them between other tasks at lunch etc but every time my boss has caught me working on them he calls me out because i should be spending my time on his favorite one he scolds me for not focusing on just the one he likes the most normally id just let it turn into his problem but my reputation is basically on the line if these others arent just as successful theyre all just as if not more critical to get done successfully  so last night after working a 10 hour day on his project i actually had to sneak out of work without letting him see so i could work from home and catch up on other stuff  the worst part about this is were not paid overtime and i know im only exacerbating the problem by probing to my company their staff is willing to work 70 hour weeks with no overtime pay because they dont know how to properly staff a company,erufpj

302,"I landed a dream job without any effort, but I’ll probably end up losing it...",basically i applied for a security job at a big company and got a better job because i looked presentable at an open hiring event i was also the only white one in the lobby and have the sneaking suspicion that it might have had something to do with it  i make 15 an hour just to drive around to different sites at my leisure and ask if they need anything sometimes they have uniforms for me to deliver but usually the guy on the shift before me the person who trained me takes care of that i just drive around and watch netflix or listen to music i get an hour paid lunch break but honestly nobody would know if i just sat there in a parking lot all day    heres the problem while training the manager and guy training me casually said that the procedure for when theres a sleeping guard is to take a picture of them and send it to the manager hed then fire them  tonight   on my third day alone in the car  i finally encountered that on my last site which ive heard is a problem site i drove up to a security car at this industrial place and inside was a sleeping older woman guard i knocked on the window and pretended not to notice awkwardly  and asked her if she needed any uniform stuff and went on to the guard shack to check on the other ones i feel bad for not saying that i wouldnt report it because shes probably losing sleep right now    id totally be fine with just not reporting anything and thats what im doing   but im worried that the boss will notice the discrepancy between the person who trained me the other shift amount of reports and mine im just hoping he wont notice  but i dont know  the other guy told me he caught 2 guards within the last couple of weeks,erqhk0

306,Practical solutions for people compelled by anti-work ideas,hello i just found this sub recently and have found a lot of the ideas here resonating with me but ive also come across a lot of defeatism and suicidal ideation   i wanted to start a thread where we can talk about practical realistic solutions to the serious problem of having to work   i will share what ive come across in my own life experience 14 years of work research and so on but im not trying to create a prescription for anyone here id rather start a discussion and see what ideas other people have  standard early retirement fire refers to financial independenceretire early  the most popular strategy for early retirement because of its perceived low risk is to amass a large amount of investments such that you can safely withdraw 3 from your nest egg almost indefinitely this is the most popular method advocated for in rfinancialindependence figure out how much you spend in a year then build up a nest egg such that you can cover your living expenses indefinitely   or you can create passive income which is income that one does not need to actively create through labor there are some debates about what this means some people consider buying investment properties to be passive income though of course there is a lot of labor and work involved with being a landlord unless you pass off your properties to a property management company even then there is work involved like paying taxes overseeing the higherlevel context of your real estate portfolio etc   there is also a strong community in rleanfire who are approaching the issues of rfinancialindependence by looking to retire early with a smaller amount of money such as saving up 300k and drawing the 3 or using superlowcostofliving arbitrage strategies by moving to countries or geographic locations with very low expenses for example there are places even in the us where a person can buy a house for 25k in decent shape in rural places   passive income  as aforementioned passive income generally refers to the automatic generation of capital that doesnt require labor there are quite a few ways to set up passive income or semipassive income all of which are fairly difficult and timeintensive can be risky and dont have guaranteed incomes few things in life have guaranteed outcomes anyway but  real estate  entrepreneurship starting a business  social media strategies like running ads on a youtube channel  i dont know im sure there are a lot more marrying into money or something like that cryptocurrencies and speculation etc   alternative work styles while this still includes work there are lots of alternatives to the corporate 85 hellscape this includes things like remote digital work like the digital nomadism movement seasonal work finding a career with serious vacations like teaching becoming a freelancer or independent consultant and so on all of this requires work but gives the individual a little more independence and autonomy   alternative living styles things like van living wwofing i dont know if people still call it this its basically working on a farm in a commune in exchange for food and board which sounds awful to me but its something if youre healthy and like being outdoors extreme minimalism freegan or hobostyle living how to drop out ideas by ran prieur becoming a monk feel free to add   finding a job you love this is probably a myth and is steeped in capitalist ideology but perhaps you could find employment that either does not make you want to drop off the face of the planet with some selfsearching and finding a job that matches well with your psychological disposition you could potentially find a position that is significantly less awful than what you are experiencing with your job now for me this meant switching from corporatenightmareland to academia which is better suited to my psyche   general personal finance it doesnt solve the systemic issues of having to work or the evils of global capitalism but learning how to budget and live on less than you earn can certainly help your mental health reduced stress reduced anxiety and can help move you in a direction toward the financial necessity of needing to work such as giving you the freedom to start a business or buy real estate with savings from what ive read in survey data about 50 of americans are only a 300 emergency away from bankruptcy this one is highly debated obviously people need to be paid more but people can also complete training and try to improve their position within reason either way educating yourself generally in personal finance can help with the pain of having to work daily and is probably the starting point for most people to create an escape route   thats about all i have for now i hope some other people will chime in with their ideas or strategies about their practical solutions for not having to work as it seems like it would benefit the sub and would give us something to talk about today   all the best,eqyy9a

313,The Prisoner (Short Story),op here i wrote this short story heavily influenced by the antiwork subreddit and philosophy and i thought yall might be interested and might be willing to give some feedback id like to know if yall think the naming gimmick was stupid or if the message was too heavy handed if this doesnt fit the type of content that this subreddit allows thats totally fine this is my first ever short story  ampx200b  the prisoner wakes up filled with hatred the same way he does every morning his hatred is bitter and tinged with regret if he shared his bed with someone he might have lashed out at them who his hatred is targeted at he isnt sure after all he was the one who had set his alarm  the prisoner turns off his alarm and lays in bed gathering the willpower to start the day realistically he knows that the day will start with or without him but as long as he is still in his bed he can pretend that it wont he hates mornings but he knows everyone else does too and that comforts him  after a while his hatred fades into resignation and the prisoner leaves his bed to start getting ready after showering and dressing he goes to his fridge and wonders if he should eat breakfast after all he is hungry he decides against it eating this early always makes him feel sick a week ago he had tried eating some eggs and almost vomited or maybe it was a month ago time blends together when each day is indistinguishable  the prisoner and his car creep along the congested city street his eyes occasionally flicking towards the sensor that represents the temperature of the engine hes not sure what that sensor is called but he does know that if it reached the red hed be screwed that had happened to him once on his way to work he hadnt even noticed until the engine started making distressing noises he ended up being an hour late to work that day and was nearly brought to tears in front of his boss at the fear of losing his job that would be the death of me thinks the prisoner his heart twinging at that painful thought if he lost his job then  his eyes flick towards the sensor  who knows what would happen to him  he passes by city hall twice a day and the mild enjoyment he used to feel at seeing such a beautiful building has quickly faded into indifference a long time ago when his life as a working man was just beginning he would crane his head to catch a glimpse of the lofty lady liberty statue but now he would just stare at the street ahead occasionally flicking his eyes towards the sensor today though there is something new to see a small group of people holding signs maybe a dozen are just off the street in front of city hall one even has a megaphone and seems to be shouting about something the group are shaking their signs in agreement while a single police officer stands on the steps regarding them with contempt the prisoner wonders what they are all doing outside on a cold winter morning and on a work day no less  as he drives the prisoner reads some signs just to find something to think about most of the signs have something to do with rich people or taxes or something hes certain that money is involved one sign sticks out to him though because it simply reads free yourself the prisoner finds that extremely odd free himself he is free what is that sign insinuating no he doesnt like the sign at all or the woman holding it for that matter i am free thinks the prisoner more than just free his life was going great thank you very much he has a job that pays the bills and if he keeps working hard he might one day be promoted sure there werent many developments on the romantic side of things but who could spare the time to go on dates come to think of it a lot of his interests had fallen to the wayside in the past few years but what can you expect being a working man he used to go camping he remembered suddenly and would stare at the stars far away from the welllit nights of the city things could be much worse for him though no the prisoner reassures himself im very grateful for my lot in life those people with the signs are just troublemakers riling people up over nothing they should be grateful that things arent worse they should be grateful like him  the moment the prisoner sits at his desk he feels his mind numb and his eyes glaze thats a blessing though it makes the clock go faster he checks his work email then his mailbox and takes stock of his tasks for the day nothing out of the ordinary if he really tried he could finish it all by lunchtime but that would present a slew of problems he would rather just avoid if he finishes his work early his boss might give him more to do nothing important just time wasting he might have to reorganize their client files or digitize some old records and even if his boss didnt notice that he wasnt doing anything then he would be stuck without anything to do until 5 oclock he wouldnt even be able to check his personal email or read a book because they were always watching the security cameras and the employees screens to catch any time wasters having nothing to do was worse than the work at least when he was working time didnt warp turning minutes to hours and hours to lifetimes or at least it didnt warp as much no it was better to avoid all that and make his work last the whole day he wouldnt want to be a time waster  as he types at about half the speed he is capable of his mind returns to his past why hadnt he gone camping in the past few years it had made him so happy looking up at the endless night sky had always made him feel small but in a comforting way sure he was insignificant but he had the opportunity to catch a glimpse of the stunning unending universe look its the milky way what more could one want he was like an ant meeting god and his friends those were the best times of his life just him and his friends wasting time in the woods its been years since hed seen his friends theyd tried to meet up a few times over the years but the plans always fell through it seemed like nobody ever had time anymore or maybe nobody had the energy or the soul the prisoner feels a sense of loss anyway thats just what happens when you grow up you start working you move on to more important things and you lose touch with old friends happens to everybody  nearby footsteps bring the prisoner out of his line of thought he recognizes them as the short angry footsteps of his boss the warden  good morning warden says the prisoner  good morning prisoner says the warden could we chat for a minute  sure thing says the prisoner as if he has a choice  the warden begins pointing out the various flaws in some report that the prisoner cant even remember writing his paternalistic tone fails to cloak the ever present threat of termination and it is a threat if he was fired chances are he wouldnt be able to quickly find a job that paid enough for him to keep his apartment his savings were meager he would probably be evicted and then where could he go  ive talked to you about these kinds of simple mistakes before prisoner the warden sighs i hate these types of chats you know im your boss but im also your friend right  what says the prisoner startled out of his thoughts  were friends right prisoner   yeah of course warden  of course what  were friends  great remember always give 110 percent everyone at this company is family and you never want to let down your family  i hate you thinks the prisoner  i hear you says the prisoner  you know you shouldnt let him talk to you like that for that matter none of us should let him talk to us like that says the dissident poking at his salad with a plastic fork  hes our boss  so were all adults why should anyone have the right to talk to us like that did you hear how condescending he was prisoner this piece of paper is eggshell white and i specifically asked for ghost white one more screw up like this and i might just be forced to terminate you  the dissidents poor impression makes the prisoner laugh  hes an asshole but hes still our boss bosses are assholes its like a law of nature  it shouldnt be i mean why is it ok for him to treat us like that we are the ones who do all the real work in this company he treats us like were prisoners in a camp or something  the dissidents words remind the prisoner of the sign he had seen on his commute he starts to get irritated the dissident is his friend but sometimes it feels like he isnt grateful to have the job he did doesnt he know things could be a lot worse  youre just being dramatic we have it good you know we live in a free country and people all over the world have it a lot worse than us  do you feel free though  what do you mean  i mean do you feel like youre free  i am free says the prisoner  but do you feel like youre free do you enjoy life do you spend your days prancing through fields of flowers just reveling in your freedom the dissident started to get worked up no you spend your days the same as the rest of us doing pointless bullshit under the thumb of that wannabe tyrant and when you go home do you do something youre passionate about no you go back to your crappy apartment watch tv and wait for the next day to start because youre too goddamn burned out to do anything you love just like the rest of us the dissident stands up like hes giving a speech although nobody else in the break room is listening what good does it do to live in a free country if we all live bland passionless lives  shut the hell up hisses the prisoner it doesnt seem like anybody is listening but if somebody reported the dissidents behavior to the warden they would both be in big trouble you cant just going around saying anything you want like that some opinions have to be kept secret for your own safety besides the dissident is pissing him off doesnt he know that he should be grateful  the prisoner had finally left work and was driving home he wasnt feeling the relief that he normally did when the day was over though he couldnt stop thinking about what the dissident had said doesnt he know that there is no point in trying to change things people have to work if they want to live and if you want to work you have to do whatever your boss says with a smile and that is just the way things are and if you work harder than everybody else the prisoner tells himself then one day theyll recognize that and youll be rewarded thats how the world works his eyes flick towards the sensor  as he draws closer to city hall he sees something that fuels his anger the dozen or so sign holders from the morning had grown into a crowd of at least a hundred illuminated by street lights the single contemptuous policeman had become twenty wearing helmets and holding riot shields the police are stationed in between the front of city hall and the crowd of protesters the protesters are moving up the steps and towards the large entrance as a pack at the back of the crowd just off the side of the street he could see the woman from this morning holding the same sign free yourself  the prisoner feels a surge of rage who the fuck does she think she is he is free and he is happy the prisoners sweaty hands clutch the steering wheel his face twisting with rage that bitch doesnt know what shes talking about doesnt she know that people get what they deserve doesnt she know that things could be much worse doesnt she know that they could take away what little we have if we piss them off  that woman with the sign is just as bad as the dissident they should know better than to challenge the people who sign our checks  almost subconsciously the prisoner starts to turn his steering wheel towards the object of his rage soon he is swerving across lanes at the woman who has her face turned towards city hall within seconds his car would fly over the curb destroying the woman who dared to imply that the prisoner was wasting his life  free himself free himself from what he has a job he works hard and one day they will give him what he deserves there is nothing wrong with the system people just want to be given things that they havent earned  the woman turns around and screams paralyzed with fear as she sees the car barreling towards her she drops her sign while one of her friends tries to pull her out of the way its in vain they wont be fast enough  this woman and the dissident they believe the world is unfair they believe that were being taken advantage of they believe the game is rigged but thats not true it cant be if thats true then that means everything ive sacrificed my friends my love life my free time my happiness it was all for nothing it was all for nothing  at the last second the prisoners car changes course narrowly missing the woman his body is shaking uncontrollably and drenched in a cold sweat  what the fuck was i thinking the prisoner says to himself he starts driving normally again changing lanes to gain distance from the protesters  as his nerves slowly steady he tries to figure out what had come over him why had he done that he could have killed that woman and himself he couldnt quite remember what line of thought had led him to such a drastic course of action he ponders it for a few moments then shrugs when he cant find the memory  he glances up out of his windshield at the sky its already dark out winter days were especially short and he stayed a few hours late at work at the request of the warden no stars thats fine the prisoner is a working man his mind is on more important things after all the prisoner has work tomorrow,er1ywq

338,I'm not depressed. It's my lack of freedom.,so as an mtf i had to get my letter of diagnosis so i could start hrt while discussing things with my therapist i started talking about some of my internal thoughts and dialogues  and as helpful as she has been shes very set on me getting on antidepressants this bothers me a lot because im very attuned with my inner mind and have spent a lot of time self reflecting  i know where my depression symptoms come from and its the fact that living in this world is like a constant battle nearly every part of my day is spent actively going against my true nature  i dont want a fucking pill thatll alter my brain to be more comfortable with this because its not just me when i try to defer to google i get stats like  more than 25million american adults are on antidepressants  or 1 in 6 americans are on antidepressants  or more than a third of american adults are on medication related to depression  and im sure these numbers would be even higher if more people could afford healthcare and were given the chance to try to get help  but at what point do we stop and think weather there is really that many people with chemical imbalances in their brains or maybe its that humans havent spent the last 300000 years of evolution to exist in this system that were forced to abide by today   i think its the latter  i know why im depressed and its because im terrified of financial instability its because the only options i have are  work my dangerous hard labor exhausting job for barely decent pay  work an easier less dangerous and stressful job for worthless pay probably still way more stressful than necessary  or take out impossible to pay off student loans and maybe get the job i want which would still be barely decent pay  all of these options by the way still keep me locked in the 40 hour work week where i have no real control over my time  so you know what  im calling bullshit on this depression epidemic or whatever the fuck you want to call it  this is a result of people being forced to commit suicide of their personality and ambitions in order to serve the system in the hope of having some smidgeon of financial security,eqt5q7

347,"Well, this is it.",hello all brace yourselves for a post of venting and a part of my lifes story  i have had a bunch of thoughts lately about life maybe this isnt the right place for it but for me it seems a better place than any for me to post or maybe vent ive never been one to think that im depressed or in need of help i also have a feeling in the back of my mind that i have to for whatever reason justify my lifestyle  i went through all the normal things like school work social life typical blah blah school and work overlapped most towards my senior year in high school since i was a straight f student literally almost failed everything and was always told i never applied myself which to be completely honest is absolutely not true i was hardly ever motivated i didnt have it in me i just wanted to get out of there so bad especially having been held back my freshman year making it a 5 year high school run   moving on from my high school i had literally no desire to continue schooling i also had no idea what i was going to do to survive in adulthood but for some reason i wasnt anxious about it i really didnt care and still dont to this day about missing out on college so i went into retail while still living with my mom and went from there after that i got a pharmacy tech job that lasted 7 years then bought a house at 24 years old then went to be a medical technician delivered hospital beds etc then a shredit driver working the downtown city route nightmare especially in a decent sized truck the money was great and helping me definitely start paying off some of my debt from spending too much on music gear lol   something happened though i feel like i snapped one day once i would never have quit a job without another lined up things began to change while at shredit i started losing it with the 60 hour work weeks and the constant feeling of thinking why am i spending my time making this money and not being able to enjoy it oh wait society expects people to be a drones for 60 years and then have their fun from what i can tell most people i was around were workaholics so id ask them what they were going to do when they retired the depressing thing was theyd always say they didnt want to that theyd have no clue what to do if they didnt have work to do  after leaving shredit i left to work closer to my house at a local call center for a pharmaceutical company i maybe lasted 5 weeks through the training i overestimated my ability to multitask and when i finally got on the first live call it was a nightmare to me everything they trained me to do wasnt what the call pertained to i started feeling immediately overwhelmed and stressed i felt so trapped because how am i going to pay my bills i applied to other companies that were way less stressful they would see my resume with pharmacy tech med tech shredit driver not that those are prestigious just more difficult than regular retail and tell me that i was overqualified to work at retail im legit not bragging the titles are more prestigious then it sounds  here is where i am now though i landed a job at a health food grocery store i get in there trying to do my be as available and helpful you can be to the employer and my peers things were fine for a time met plenty of nice people and would say i had the best direct boss id ever had however certain things wore down over time like usual the company starts imposing quotas on things that were ridiculous and just generally making things worse for employees like ive experienced at all my jobs i started getting interested in doordash and other gig economy jobs did a few and didnt mind doing it fast forward to a few months after i start i had told my boss to update my schedule since he volunteered me to another store for a day however since 3 people had control of my schedule it never got changed and me being lazy like i am i didnt mark it down either i woke up to a phone call the day i was suppose to be at the other store a 30 minute drive away everything flashed before me my life my jobs all the bs i decided to not answer it and shut it off i really do feel bad for my former coworkers there but i seriously couldnt take the rat race anymore   here is where things turn for me in a good way i realized that i had to give the gig economy a try at least so i did more and more deliveries still didnt make enough i contemplated on selling the house and trying to either van life it or buy an rv to live in my mom panicked and offered to help me figure things out so with the massive help from my stepfather and mother we renovated a room in my house and turned it into an airbnb i have been running it for a month now and have had enough guests to be able to pay my entire monthly mortgage by itself now i just drive and host i have literally never in my life been happier i can be a lazy mofo and not give a damn i hardly set alarms anymore i go to sleep randomly sometimes i wake up at 11am other days i sleep in til 5pm thats right 5pm because that is what i want to do  how can i pay all my bills just doing food delivery apps and guest hosting apps i keep my stuff as low as i can i never want to have kids nothing against them just not for me i never want to get married and i am pretty sure i bought my house in a buyers market my brother is a project manager for at a major company and cant even afford homes where i live now you know why he chose to get married chose to get a degree and when the marriage didnt work out because she wanted to talk to some other dudes they had to sell the house they just bought taking a massive hit  my point is i didnt go to college i live the midwest low cost of living no kids no wife i live in my own basement partially finished play video games smoke weed watch dumbass shows play guitar record music deliver food on the time of my own choosing i honestly feel like i am retired now in a weird way i will have walked away from all this owning a small business being my own boss no debt other than my mortgage paid off car i own everything i really even ever wanted every day still i always have this feeling that i am getting away with something like i am breaking the law or something i honestly believe that this is all the things that society has told me lingering in my head hopefully it will go away one day and i can fully embrace leaving the rat race  ampx200b  tldr kept costs low bought a house with the money i saved from working at 13 an hour for 7 years in a buyers market in the midwest no wife no kids only debt is from the mortgage now i am using a room in the house to basically finance my entire mortgage i basically just chill all day and dont give a shit about anything anymore or at least im working on it,es88ql

352,How To STOP WORKING FOREVER IMMEDIATELY With The Freedom Dividend.,i posted this in the official andrew yang subreddit and although this is a different subreddit i wanted to get other thoughts about this too this is a thought experiment i think is viable enough that i will try it out with four or five buddies that i have if andrew yang is elected president  andrew yangs campaign revolves most centrally around implementing ubi or the freedom dividend as he calls it of 1000 dollars a month for everyone in the united states over age 18 now im sure that this policy is great for bringing everyone up to just under the poverty limit and he believes that it will still encourage people to work to financially better themselves he does reference various studies regarding hours worked with or without ubi and it shows that there is little to no difference but i can rebuttal against these fairly easily with these arguments 1 the people who were given ubi knew that it was a limited time ordeal and not guaranteed over an entire lifetime they had to continue to work in order to financially support themselves after the ubi trial was over 2 there havent been any ubi trials done with an entire country meaning that all of the inhabitants of that country receive a ubi if this was the case i am almost certain there would be a good number of people who also thought about doing what i am about to describe and would be able to never work another day in there lives given that the ubi is a lifetime guarantee onto the step  by  step process  step 1 gather 4 buddies together you need people that you can trust you can even live with a special other and invite another couple to get to 4 total people with 18 years of age  step 2 look for an apartment with 2 bedrooms depending on who you are living with buddies  special other  another couple the number of bedrooms may vary i found multiple listings for 4 bedroom apartments for up to 2000 dollars with most being around the 1000 dollar to 1500 dollar range in my area  step 3 pool all of your money together and do some budgeting the more people involved in this method the less budgeting you will need to do it all depends on the goals of the group for instance if i had 4 buddies together we would receive a collective 4000 dollars a month using a 4 bedroom apartment at 1500 dollars a month as a example we would be left with 2500 dollars factoring in food expenses and most other amenities take off an additional 750 dollars a month leaving us with 1750 dollars a month to do whatever we want with i would personally invest it somewhere to grow it safely probably in an index fund but i could just as well spend all month partying with my buddies or playing video games i never need to work again if for example i dont like my buddies all that well we can live separately as with most of the houses i examined the bedrooms were separated off from each other no need to interact with each other if we dont particularly enjoy each others company for whatever reason again this method works better with more people for instance instead of 4 buddies i could have 8 an 8 bedroom apartment i found in my area costs 3000 dollars a month 8 buddies get a total of 8000 dollars a month with the freedom dividend so after rent we are left with 5000 dollars a month factoring in food and other amenities and we are left with 3500 dollars a month to do whatever we want to with no need to work more people in a group  more overall savings more overall savings  more potential growth through investments 3500 dollars a month invested well can quickly make a fortune so not only do you not need to work or do anything economically productive at all you are potentially also getting significantly richer through investments and whatever compounding interest you do  again this may be viable for a specific group of people i for one absolutely hate working and if i had the chance like the one andrew yang is giving me i would quit immediately and no amount of money offered to me would change my mind the fact that i am also very frugal and generally anti  materialism  consumerism only helps me in this scenario i am wondering if anyone else plans to do this on this subreddit like i am if andrew yang is elected president and passes the freedom dividend what are your thoughts on this,erkb9u

360,Excellent succinct summation of the last 40 years of corporate and CEO/Elite treason,linkhttpcluborlovblogspotcom201908resurrectingamericaneconomyhtml  donald trump has recently ordered us corporations to move production out of china and into the us easier said than doneor rather undone moving production to china and in case of it to india allowed us corporations to benefit from the large wage differential and an easier regulatory environment in order to be more profitable they spent these excess profits by buying back their own stock paying generous dividends to their shareholders and using their artificially inflated stock prices to justify exorbitant executive salaries and bonuses  along the way they impoverished american workers by depriving them of gainful deployment eroded the skill base of the american population and perhaps most importantly destroyed demand for their products because more and more americans could no longer afford them as these trends played out making china prosperous and the us increasingly distressed and impoverished with close to 100 million workingage people permanently jobless us corporations could no longer profit from their offshored production to the same extent and so they took advantage of low interest rates to borrow huge sums of money and use it to continue buying back their own shares paying dividends and continuing with the exorbitant executive compensation  by now many of the major us corporations are financial zombies waiting for an uptick in interest rates to drive them into bankruptcy and it is these zombies that are being tasked with bringing production back to the us good luck with that which is to say it is highly unlikely that such an effort could possibly succeed but even if it could succeed would it solve the problemwhich is that the us is gradually degenerating into a bankrupt third world country perhaps not because you see the entire theory of making america great again is based on a fallacywhich is that china became the worlds largest economy by purchasing power and the worlds factory simply by virtue of the fact that american corporations offshored production to it,er0eml

362,Here's a story from my retail days that I think you'll enjoy: The time I organized a worker's revolt and won.,when i was younger i worked as an assistant manager for a local outlet of a large sporting goods company once a year we would have a weeklong sidewalk sale and it was a gruelling week shifts started at 7am and ended past 11pm to save money the district sales manager hired the minimum amount of staff and paid them minimum wages plus it was august so it was hot and humid outside which is where we spent the bulk of the day  so heres the first kicker as an assistant manager i was under contract so despite working 75 hours in one week i was only getting paid my normal wages the parttime hires were forced to leave their day early to avoid overtime so at the end of every day it was just me and the manager and our third key we were all miserable and exhausted for the record the manager and third key were both work until you die types and constantly complained that the young parttimers were lazy which was not true at all   however the long shitty week was due to end on labour day which is a national holiday and a much needed day off everyone was looking forward to it the weekend before the big boss came to see how things were doing and he inquired about how much it would cost to pay the fines for being open on a holiday versus the money we would make in sales the fine was a laughable amount so mister big boss decided that we would be working that day instead  when i was told this news i almost became delirious and i made a decision that i still congratulate myself for today despite the entire staff being told that we will be open i quietly went to every single part time employee their average age was 16 i was 18 and told them that there was a change in plans and that in reality we would be closed i made it clear that tomorrow morning they could stay in bed and spend the day with their families they were a little suspicious but i reassured them saying if they call you tell them i gave you the day off and that you wont be coming in because you made plans with your family also they arent going to fire all of you just me  come monday nobody showed up including yours truly around 830am i got a panicked call from my douchebag sales manager asking whether or not it was true that i gave everyone the day off i said yes and that i wasnt planning on showing up either i was promptly fired but they had to cancel the day because they were only four employees  take that corporate assholes,erey9p

367,The managerial/owner classes and “free stuff” (Semi-rant),back in september i along with two others from my department at work were unceremoniously transferred to a different department at the time management explained that there was not enough demand for work in our department to justify our staying on  this despite the fact that there was never a shortage of work to go around  as the departmental move allowed me to work from home i semireluctantly accepted the new position  fastforward to today when i receive an email from my old boss because my old department is now horrendously understaffed  and who could have ever predicted that am i right  im now expected to pitch in on my down time to help them on an ongoing basis  i will not be receiving an increase in my wages for this extra work  this is a story repeated over and over again in latecapitalist america working people are expected to take on ever more labor work ever longer hours and ever increase their productivity for the same or less pay and it should therefore be abundantly clear to anyone paying attention that its the managerial and owner classes who really want free stuff  free manhours free labor and free output they want it from you and me and they know that they can take it because  by and large  we have no other choice but to accept their terms  by contrast the free stuff that we want is nothing more than our fair share of what is being taken from us and we want you to have yours too,eq9owj

Basically the first thing he said to me when I called him was that he hopes to get better soon so he could get back to work.,he is the most hard working person i know he leaves the house at 7 am drives an hour to the next city and often comes home after 10pm its not rare that he works on saturdays as well he has 4 weeks of vacation per year and rarely takes all of it the overtime he works is probably more than the regular time his colleagues work in the morning he is the first one in the office in the evening he is the last one to leave he is the head of two projects at once and gets payed a fraction of what he should get now he is in the hospital hooked to two infusions and a machine that watches his oxygen levels and he is worrying about missing work fuck this society,eo1zaf

381,I just had to share this. This is why corporations have such incompetent management,so i work at amazon and ive avoided taking on any more responsibility at the job because management is just one big clique of assholes and they dont give me enough hours to want to do more work   there was an internal job posting for a position we call a lane monitor basically your an associate who does whatever the fuck you were already doing but management can come tap you on the shoulder and ask you to run a specific lane while they do something else fuck around with their friends in the back i dont mind doing this since i wont have to put up with the other assholes and i get to do the same job ive been doing basically just with more power  theres also an opening for a trainer so im taking a risk applying as they might try to get me to do that but ill get more hours so i guess its not all that bad now we get into the meat of the story  i went to hr to get the application and they have this white chick thats fairly new i included her race because most of the complaints about her come from all the minorities in the building but she could just be an asshole i dont know i asked her for one of the applications and her ass snapped at me with attitude you cant get one right now i knew this was a lie because a good acquaintance of mine held the position before getting promoted and theyve been begging people for the last week or 2 to apply i was seconds away from walking off before another manager lady walked up and cut her off saying hi awesometjgreen the applications are over there sweety and she pointed me in the right direction all while hr bitch gave a look of shock and anger all twisted into one  now this manager lady for some unknown reason is really nice to me shes a raging bitch as well ive seen her write people up and turn all red over the slightest of mistakes yet whenever she comes by to check my work pretend shes working shes super polite and talks about her family and shit  if it werent for her stepping in i wouldnt even be able to apply for the shitty job this is why greedy corporations deserve to fail they only promote their friends or people they like regardless of who they are or what skills they bring to the table i wouldnt be surprised if after i turn this shit in and wait i see some bootlicker get the position and we have to deal with him or her fucking up everything they just promoted some dude to our logistics team directing the trucks and shit and hes literally been fucking that up for weeks since he basically has no experience on the job,eojgdr

suppose you could say i was the black sheep in my family  both my parents were academic   my father was a scientist my mother a journalist my older sister became an architect  i found school uninspiring and didnt really apply myself i did enough to get by  i really just enjoyed playing football soccer kayaking judo swimming cycling and long distance running  looking back on my life i suppose growing up i was really keen to make my parents happy   as a result i chose a path in life that was based on what i thought others expected of me both by my family and society   the subjects i studied at 17 or 18 years old were based on what my father considered to be appropriate or suitable and as a result i found it really difficult to pay attention and really commit to studying  it was the same story when i went to university i really just went because that is what i thought i was supposed to do  i therefore didnt have much enthusiasm and i felt massively unfulfilled and this would continue throughout the next 15 plus years of my life   ampx200b  by 17 or 18 years old i had pretty much abandoned sport and started smoking weed daily  soon enough i became partial to a wake and bake and would indulge in hippy speedballs   i would miss class smoke weed in lunch break and before exams  once i had graduated and was working i continued to smoke weed most days   over time i found myself in bars three or four times a week and developed a weekly cocaine habit london is the cocaine capital of europe  i was bouncing around aimlessly i was uncertain and indecisive with no clear vision of what i wanted for my life   reflecting on my life to date i have worked in a whole host of different jobs ive done graveyard shift litter picking after festivals worked in retail as a waiter for charities community centres social enterprises ngos branding agencies and tech agencies  ive been sacked made redundant or the funding for my role ran out the last role i had the company went into liquidation   by this time i realised that this was not a coincidence   ampx200b  i became frustrated was in self doubt and didnt know where to go i slumped into an unemployment depression  there was a pattern emerging here i found myself in this constant cycle of working in jobs that didnt fulfill me  i asked myself a series of questions   was i really supposed to just get another job that i hated and continue resenting my life  was i really just supposed to get a job so i could get paid perhaps get a mortgage   and go on the occasional holiday  is this what life was really about   i was depressed at being unemployed but equally depressed at the thought of returning to work in an industry that left me unmotivated and uninspired  inside i knew i was capable of something i just didnt know wtf it was  i continued applying for jobs had interviews and was rejected each time  ampx200b  after a few months i stopped looking  my attention slowly began to focus in a new direction   i had stumbled across this guy called dandapani on youtube hes a hindu priest philosopher and spiritual coach who works with athletes and ceos in the us   i watched a video of his and he said do not seek happiness pursue a life were the byproduct is happiness  this really resonated with me this is what i needed to do  i wanted this life where the byproduct was happiness  i remember being in my flat and brainstorming   what are the three or four most important things to me  what kind of life or lifestyle would make me happy  if i could build this life or lifestyle what would it look like  how would it make me feel  i proceeded to redefine who i was   i simplified my life and focused all my time and energy on the three or four key things that really mattered to me   my physical and mental wellbeing was top of that list   i resumed the things i loved doing in my youth  i started running again i took up yoga and was kickboxing four times a week i later entered a kickboxing competition   the kickboxing competition put me in a situation where i needed to do everything within my circle of influence a reference from the stephen covey book  the 7 habits of highly effective people to ensure i didnt get the sht kicked out of me  this was one of a handful of books that triggered dramatic changes in my lifehttpspreviewredditlqonz8xp2ya41jpgwidth322ampformatpjpgampautowebpamps0523b6522e88f553a757fde844e478d1a053f498  ampx200b  having this challenge in front of me made me stop drinking smoking and taking drugs  i noticed the significant improvements in me and i never went back to drinking smoking to taking drugs after that  i became increasingly curious and developed a real passion for learning and reading   with the time i had i began reading more an interest in psychology philosophy and personal development emerged organically  i expect part of this was because i was doing things on my terms and i was doing things that interested me for a change  initially i said i would give myself three months off but my period of unemployment lasted about ten months  ampx200b  i spent the money i had saved since the age of 21  it was supposed to have been the deposit for a mortgage  it was tens of thousands of pounds  some people would have considered that a waste of money my father was one of them   from the outside he saw me unemployed for all that time and assumed i was wasting my life away   to me it was the best investment i could have made with my life  that money bought me time i used that time to invest in myself which enabled me to discover and develop my passion  ampx200b  i was willing to sacrifice everything in order to find my true purpose in life  i realised that possessions a house money holidays and material things meant nothing to me unless is was totally fulfilled  my savings were depleted but i had achieved the fulfilment and happiness that dandapani had spoken of and had started to take control of my life  id abandoned my self destructive lifestyle moved away from toxic people i had truly redefined who i was  i now found great comfort in my own company i spent my time meditating reflecting on life and in the company of books  having made this transition i asked myself    how can i earn an income from this lifestyle  how could i make enough money to survive doing the things i love  i looked back on my past and what i was doing with my life   it seemed to make sense to me to retrain as a personal trainer and pursue a career in personal development as a life coach  this would give me the opportunity to help others to achieve the results they want to see both in their personal and professional lives  i realised that it would be difficult in the sense that i was starting again from scratch with no contacts and jumping into unknown territory  but i looked back on my past and reflected on how i would look on this in the future  this was a unique opportunity for me to finally pursue my truth  i had also come to the realisation that money meant nothing unless i was totally fulfilled  at that point i realised i needed to take

400,"How I bounced out of an unemployment depression, developed my passion and took steps to earn a living doing what I love - Tips and resources to help others to do the same..",growing up i suppose you could say i was the black sheep in my family  both my parents were academic   my father was a scientist my mother a journalist my older sister became an architect  i found school uninspiring and didnt really apply myself i did enough to get by  i really just enjoyed playing football soccer kayaking judo swimming cycling and long distance running  looking back on my life i suppose growing up i was really keen to make my parents happy   as a result i chose a path in life that was based on what i thought others expected of me both by my family and society   the subjects i studied at 17 or 18 years old were based on what my father considered to be appropriate or suitable and as a result i found it really difficult to pay attention and really commit to studying  it was the same story when i went to university i really just went because that is what i thought i was supposed to do  i therefore didnt have much enthusiasm and i felt massively unfulfilled and this would continue throughout the next 15 plus years of my life   ampx200b  by 17 or 18 years old i had pretty much abandoned sport and started smoking weed daily  soon enough i became partial to a wake and bake and would indulge in hippy speedballs   i would miss class smoke weed in lunch break and before exams  once i had graduated and was working i continued to smoke weed most days   over time i found myself in bars three or four times a week and developed a weekly cocaine habit london is the cocaine capital of europe  i was bouncing around aimlessly i was uncertain and indecisive with no clear vision of what i wanted for my life   reflecting on my life to date i have worked in a whole host of different jobs ive done graveyard shift litter picking after festivals worked in retail as a waiter for charities community centres social enterprises ngos branding agencies and tech agencies  ive been sacked made redundant or the funding for my role ran out the last role i had the company went into liquidation   by this time i realised that this was not a coincidence   ampx200b  i became frustrated was in self doubt and didnt know where to go i slumped into an unemployment depression  there was a pattern emerging here i found myself in this constant cycle of working in jobs that didnt fulfill me  i asked myself a series of questions   was i really supposed to just get another job that i hated and continue resenting my life  was i really just supposed to get a job so i could get paid perhaps get a mortgage   and go on the occasional holiday  is this what life was really about   i was depressed at being unemployed but equally depressed at the thought of returning to work in an industry that left me unmotivated and uninspired  inside i knew i was capable of something i just didnt know wtf it was  i continued applying for jobs had interviews and was rejected each time  ampx200b  after a few months i stopped looking  my attention slowly began to focus in a new direction   i had stumbled across this guy called dandapani on youtube hes a hindu priest philosopher and spiritual coach who works with athletes and ceos in the us   i watched a video of his and he said do not seek happiness pursue a life were the byproduct is happiness  this really resonated with me this is what i needed to do  i wanted this life where the byproduct was happiness  i remember being in my flat and brainstorming   what are the three or four most important things to me  what kind of life or lifestyle would make me happy  if i could build this life or lifestyle what would it look like  how would it make me feel  i proceeded to redefine my life   i simplified my life and focused all my time and energy on the three or four key things that really mattered to me   my physical and mental wellbeing was top of that list   i resumed the things i loved doing in my youth  i started running again i took up yoga and was kickboxing four times a week i later entered a kickboxing competition   the kickboxing competition put me in a situation where i needed to do everything within my circle of influence a reference from the stephen covey book  the 7 habits of highly effective people to ensure i didnt get the sht kicked out of me  ampx200b  imgyg70dxbf5ya41 this was one of a handful of books that provoked dramatic changes in my life  ampx200b  having this challenge in front of me made me stop drinking smoking and taking drugs  i noticed the significant improvements in me and i never went back to drinking smoking to taking drugs after that  i became increasingly curious and developed a real passion for learning and reading   with the time i had i began reading more an interest in psychology philosophy and personal development emerged organically  i expect part of this was because i was doing things on my terms and i was doing things that interested me for a change  initially i said i would give myself three months off but my period of unemployment lasted about ten months  ampx200b  i spent the money i had saved since the age of 21  it was supposed to have been the deposit for a mortgage  it was tens of thousands of pounds  some people would have considered that a waste of money my father was one of them   from the outside he saw me unemployed for all that time and assumed i was wasting my life away   to me it was the best investment i could have made with my life  that money bought me time i used that time to invest in myself which enabled me to discover and develop my passion  ampx200b  i was willing to sacrifice everything in order to find my true purpose in life  i realised that possessions a house money holidays and material things meant nothing to me unless is was totally fulfilled  my savings were depleted but i had achieved the fulfillment and happiness that dandapani had spoken of and had started to take control of my life  id abandoned my self destructive lifestyle moved away from toxic people i had truly redefined who i was  i now found great comfort in my own company i spent my time meditating reflecting on life and in the company of books  having made this transition i asked myself    how can i earn an income from this lifestyle  how could i make enough money to survive doing the things i love  i looked back on my past and what i was doing with my life   it seemed to make sense for me to retrain as a personal trainer and pursue a career in personal development as a life coach  this would give me the opportunity to help others to achieve the results they want to see both in their personal and professional lives  i realised that it would be difficult in the sense that i was starting again from scratch i would have no contacts and no clients in the industry and would be on an entry level salary if i worked in a gym  but i looked back on my past and reflected on how i would look on this in the future  this was a unique opportunity for me to finally pursue my truth  i had also come to the realisation that money meant nothing unless i was totally fulfilled  at that point i realised i needed to take the jump  looking back on this period of unemployment i realised there were specific things that i did almost unconsciously that helped

420,Organizing For A Work-Optional Tomorrow,ive been lurking on this sub for a few months now and im finding it equal parts cathartic and frustrating i feel like were collectively on the cusp of some greater good but i dont know that were anywhere closer to actually doing something about it  in many ways i count myself very lucky i have what many people would consider a very comfortable job doing something that i usually enjoy but so many other people arent this lucky and even i have times when id rather be doing something else for a while it frustrates and angers me that virtually no one has the freedom to simply take a few months to focus on some particular hobby or to take a chance on some new potential career all because taking those opportunities comes with incredible potential risk in our society  its 2020 and were just starting to realize that work should not define us were more than a job i firmly and deeply believe that not everybody has to work and i look forward to the day when automation has made more free time for more people but man getting from here to ther is going to be messy as hell and im not real excited about that all you have to do is be honest about this stuff on social media and watch the backlash to know that a large portion of the population is not ready to hear this truth  so what do we do about it how do we educate and advocate for ourselves i lean pretty left but i think theres an opportunity here to rally around freedom from work without tying ourselves to any particular political party or political movement i dont think you need to be a socialist to see this stuff even a diehard capitalist can be convinced that in a modern economy there can be more individual freedom from tying work to the ability to simply live a modest decent life  anyway i would love to hear what other people think about this do you have experience doing political organization and advocacy what do you think  to quote bob black workers of the world relax,epnw15

438,What percentage of current jobs do you think could be automated if that was REALLY the clear intent of civilization?,setting aside for the moment the myriad of arbitrary nonsensical destructive bullshit time wasting jobs that only exist in current society to circulate the abstraction of money and so from a tangible and rational point of view ought not to exist at all to begin with i have a question for you all  if the deliberate and explicit aim of modern human civilization was to abolish any need for work performed by humans  by utilizing the best of available technology and applying our knowledge with a razor sharp focus on deliberate maximum automation  what percentage of truly necessary work relative to the work done today do you think would actually be left over   my estimate  around 15 percent perhaps maximum would be left unable to be automated with advanced robotics today and of course through time as technology and knowledge moves forward we would eventually get it even lower than that  now that means that if 15 percent of work is left over to be done and the human species shares that remaining work based also on level of training knowhow and fields of interest etc then the work time per week for human beings would of course be significantly less to say the least   what are your estimates i mean there are many in depth books going all the way back to 1833 about moving away from any human beings having to work anymore to be allowed to be alive  due to the increasing capacity to automate drudgery so many social thinkers scientists engineers etc have talked about this for decades and even centuries by now even though its mostly not mainstream most people have no clue about the capacity for humans to overcome the need for most work where do you think we are at in 2020 technologically if not restricted by a fundamentally insane society and economic paradigm based on utter nonsense,eop48w

478,People who work in a job on/off pattern are you any happier?,i always wondered if something like the merchant navy would be vastly superior to the typical 40 a week slog for people who hate work in this scenario you would work on a two months ontwo months off pattern so in that two months on that would suck as you are basically completely tied to the job even if you have downtime it will be limited to what you can do at your job however its not like the the typical 40 hour 95 leaves the evenings that free you would still be restrained in the fact that you need to be up the next day etc   also with this shift pattern when those two months are up then you get two months no working completely to yourself to do whatever the hell you want   you would essentially only be working half the year,epl4tu

613,Mods Respond to Survey Feedback,hey yall as always thank you so much for your continued participation and support of this subreddit we make this survey twice a year not only so we know who is using this subreddit for their benefit but also so we can have your feedback and thus improve  we got lots of thank yous which is really sweet much appreciate that  heres some feedback and suggestions we thought notable   free talk friday  gti think a regular share your misery  solidarity thread would be nice  according to the survey roughly 30 of the users miss the weekly free talk friday thread while 68 dont care either way so we decided to bring it back automod will post and pin a thread every week from now on     why do we care  gtthanks for putting this together and reading the responses  you care more about my feedback than anyone ive ever worked with  and  gtmaking a poll shows youre quite serious about the quality of the subreddit  not saying thats bad or good but i sort of assumed this was the fruit of someones shitty work day  is there any goal or agenda youre trying to accomplish  the main reason we do these surveyspolls is that uonedayitwillbedaisy is bit of a data nerd but yeah we really do care about the quality of the subreddit as for a goal well the goal is to reduce folks workload feelings of isolation in hating work and maybe some day ending work itself this survey helps us towards that by improving this sub as a platform for those goals     election  gtim not american  sorry about the americentrism in this survey editors note i take all the blame for badly written questions we should try to always generalize and make our questions as accessible as possible and if theres any way for us to do this in the future let us know     free speech  gttry to not suppress free speech  no freeze peaches here sorry the subreddit has rules it is heavily moderated and we plan to keep it this way we know this is a pretty stone cold response but there isnt much else to say we arent the government and therefore dont have any obligation to the 1st amendment     positivity  gtit would be cool if there was more discussion and solidarity in this sub although i agree with the premise 100 i find browsing it to be depressing  and  gtpeople whine a lot could do with some positivity  and  gtplease dont let this subreddit turn into another rcollapsehttpswwwredditcomrcollapse  comment by uabolishwork   this sub does have a propensity for depressing news and though we as mods try to uplift some positive threads eg people getting out of the rat race people quitting their jobs and feeling great people trying to build worker solidarity the negative tends to outweigh the positive this is something we are well aware of but have mixed opinions on some of us think the negativity is important in of itself ie its not whining and thats dismissive but that the human psyche can often overplay the   negative to the detriment of the positive part of us rectifying that will be to put in weekly free friday chats which will hopefully get more discussion and more positivity well also try to pin threads we think are awesome antiwork threads that highlight the positivity that can be inherent in the movement  as for rcollapsehttpswwwredditcomrcollapse i think theres some genuine risk of doomer talk getting a hold of the sub but similar to my other point i think mods have enough tools in their arsenal to combat that push i also think there is much more general negativity towards capitalism and the state then about all of us needing to build emergency shelters fallout basements and gather water bottles and canned foods thats my perspective and experience though maybe someone else has more to say  comment by uonedayitwillbedaisy    i dont like the life sucks and we cant do much about it vibe of some posts and comments but i dont have to like everything on the subreddit probably the best way to bring some positivity to rantiwork is to share things that inspire you and upvote stuff you wanna see more of    ampx200b   solidarity  gti love this place but we have to watch out that we fight together against work rather than fight each other ive seen a lot of fighting between physical labourers and office workers each insisting that they have it the worst we need solidarity with each other  yup lets not fight each other      more demographic stuff  gtmore demographic stuff like race marital status age and sexuality would be cool to see  noted we asked about age in january 2019httpswwwredditcomrantiworkcommentsapywufsurveyresults and july 2019httpswwwredditcomrantiworkcommentscei8ppsurveyresults both with similar results it should give you an idea of how old the antiworker is on average     reposts  gti see a lot of reposts as in the front page of antiwork will often have duplicates  for the record we remove lots of reposts almost every day sometimes we allow duplicates within a short time span because for some reason the second post often gets a lot more attention and it doesnt make sense to remove the first one the best way to help us deal with reposts is to report them     privacy  gtif possible maybe dont use google surveys  ok that ones from the survey we did in july last year i honestly forgot to look for a good alternative so to make up for that i wanna ask you to check out privacytoolsiohttpswwwprivacytoolsio a site that provides services tools and knowledge to protect your privacy against global mass surveillance basically it tells you why you should use firefox rather than chrome and what alternatives there are to twitter gmail whatsapp etc     book club  gta book club not joking like a monthly book the subreddit could read and comment on if they chose  not the first time this was suggested were currently busy with other stuff eg this survey expanding the faq etc but well keep the book club thing on our todo list hey if you wanna organize and guide a reading group please contact us,ensfll

619,"Being a so called ""freakin' adult""",i watched this video on yt about how to become a musician some good advice some not so good opinions about people being entirely responsible for their lot in life for reference httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvejamyg6tq4u  in any case what got my curiosity going was how it ties in with the way people get  so irate when they talk about being a grown up as a way to dismiss massive inequities under the neoliberal system what does it matter to you if someone isnt grown up why get so angry i believe this rage comes from the fact that the persons world view is undermined by those who fail to adapt to the system those who are unable to thrive are the spectres of the systems barbarism there are things one can legitimately get angry about for example climate change deniers because our survival as a species is at stake but if someone lives on the doleat home etc what is it to anyone why get annoyed i dont care if someone is on benefits i feel bad for them if anything but not angry   telling someone to grow up or be an adult with the attendant statements about the real world suck it up et al are just ways to make the individual responsible for societys failures its massively ironic that society cannot accept responsibility for its own flaws yet passes the buck onto the individual and makes this somehow a virtue to be solely answerable to oneself tell that to people who are born with a disability in poverty in a bad situation or just have no luck due to the randomness of existence there is a long list of societal failures things that were once considered as values and which often involved prejudice and persecutionenslavement against one group or another if anything i define adulthood as hypocrisy i seldom see adults behaving as such but more like ignorant and cowardly liars im not saying it isnt good to be independent and so on but considering how fucked the world is we shouldnt be hard on ourselves if we dont measure up to what society dictates as a successful adult considering society itself is devouring itself due to its contradictions,emhq9c

637,Shoutout to all the people who have had to work jobs that limit your time spent in the bathroom. :),shoutout to everyone else too on here while im at it but the title is specifically because of a job i had a couple years ago at a telemarketing company  we had 45 minutes of time allotted for being away from the phones at this company this included your 30 minute lunch break   so wed have 15 minutes all day to use the bathroom walk to the kitchen for a snack or drink or literally anything that would remove you from the phones  the best part was that this was timed from your phone at your desk so you would set the timer in your phone and walk away which would be tracked by your team lead that sat at the end of the aisle   due to digestive issues pooping by itself usually takes 12 minutes sometimes i can get it done in under 8 if i force everything out and grow a couple hemorrhoids   so most days i would have 3 minutes left if i pooped at work this would give me 3 minutes to grab a drink at the water fountain or just grab a snack from the vending machine   and of course management said oh dont worry about going over the 45 minutes as long as its not a pattern its okay  but guess who pooped too many times at work and was considered for making it a pattern of taking 50 minutes worth of breaks including the 30 minute lunch at work this guy   never got fired for it but got a couple critical performance reviews from my managers which was a healthy boost in anxiety   i quit after 4 months being tracked for your breaks is my least favorite part of working   my next job did the same thing at first but the team i worked with was really small so it didnt affect me as much this new boss confronted me about taking too many breaks so i told him that if hes concerned about me using the bathroom too often i will be sure to send him photos of the toilet after i use it but before flushing so that he can make sure i am using my time diligently ive actually had a friend send pictures of his diarrhea to his boss before because he was afraid his manager wouldnt believe him he said that hell trust my judgment instead,enp518

712,My idea on how change can be achieved,i dont believe voting for the right political party can work not because ethical political parties dont exist but because the wealthy people who control the current unethical parties are too powerful to let someone they dont like thanks charge   i dont have proof to support that there are powerful people who decide who gets to be president and who gets to pass laws i just believe it from what i see the few times someone who has honourable ethos actually becomes president they are either killed taken down by other means or the changes they made are reverted as soon as they step down those who control the world have the power to put the people they want in the government and they also have power over through other means like corrupted judges police and military higher ups etc  if someone has proof or indication that the above isnt true they are welcome to enlighten me  back to my point the basis of their power is money through vast wealth they control almost everything except other wealthy people  so in my head the only real way to counteract their wealth is with wealth wealthy individuals with honourable ethos needs to group up and push their own agenda push their own candidates for presidents etc they can also focus on using their wealth to improve humanity wellbeing in other ways like nonprofit humanitarian aid fighting climate change etc  wealthy people with honourable ethos might sound impossible for some people but i dont think thats true again i dont have proof i just feel its actually impossible that there arent any ethical corporations that treat their workers as best as they can ask yourself if you were the wealthy owner of a business would you not treat your employees as best as you could i know i would i cant be the only one  also dont forget we live in an era where a lot of people make loads of money from youtube blogs etc ways that dont have workers to take advantage of  so if you ask me you should probably focus on achieving wealth and using it to better our world although personal exploration expression and freedom do come first so try to build wealth in a way that fulfills you and thats probably the best way to achieve wealth   i understand that we live in suffocating times but i believe there also more opportunities than ever  thanks for reading,ektnuh

731,This subreddit is my gold.,i come here regularly to know im not alone  i dont believe life who we are is the sum of being a slave to an employer or a benefit system  it is absolute bullshit to force people into work when a significant proportion of the population were born into a situation where they never had to care about it because they were born into money  what ive learnt is there are also a lot of highly paid 60 hour workers who are just as stupid as forcing everyone to do pointless work once you get past a certain income level you could chuck it in shove your money in savings and live off of that  does the queen work no does anyone in the royal family in the uk really work no not like forced to and thats simply an accident of birth  fuck this life of the rich trying to make you suck their assholes to make them feel better about themselves  find yourself find your dreams keep speaking your truth  great reading everything you all post  something for thought surely with all the riches the rich own if they really thought about it if they really wanted to that could give what would be a relatively small amount to them to someone to live without being forced to work they wouldnt even have to give it  they could make the interest from it in a bank account and give it to someone who wasnt born into their situation itd be no sniff to them with all the money in the world and resources we have im sure this could be done if people accepted a basic standard of living and a few niceties get rid of greed live from only what you need pool together for cheaper food help each other find the cheapest deals this would all be possible with a caring loving society that wants to flourish and help everyone follow their best path  also animals they dont work they hunt for food thats it were animals really yes were expected to follow rules laws most people rarely do this and its only these that hold them accountable the rich dont follow rules or laws their money helps them stay clear of them or buy their way out of it when they fuck up  capitalism is bullshit we need some serious changes in life for starters booting out all the narccistics and rich dickheads who go about encouraging this system because it makes them feel good about themselves thats all it is  when the world starts to become about good character rather than just making money the right people will be around to make the world better and we can ostracise the people who have no morals who dont give a damn its clear most of the rich dont give one because remember they need the poor to be rich  i would seriously like to start a uk group with meetups i really struggle with my own personal struggles daily so this may be a push for me we need to see some siginifcant changes in this lifetime to stop the suicide rate  but honestly im starting to think its on purpose were overpopulated and if youve ever read anything about narccistic abuse well thats what they want if youre poor struggling not finding ways to be happy then the rich get off on you dying stay alive find ways forward best find ways to find you be above this system that defines you and who you are by a paycheck and a job and find a way to be happy that will piss them off the most  to be clear i believe in keeping busy doing things you love being productive and helping others when you can i believe in doing these in a way that best supports you not being exhausted keeping fit and healthy and not being forced in a kafka esque way to do its unnatural and disgusting to expect another human being to do anything really productive with a finger and a camera pointed at them all day scrutinising them for the benefit of the ego of another i also believe in the value and serenity of doing nothing  keep being awesome,ek3kh0

747,It's a small thing but...,i work for a large wellknown christian charity although not christian myself which makes every official meeting awkward as fuck because were expected to participate in prayers and devotionals also being a bi butch woman when this charity is well known for their transphobia and homophobia is fun im a groundskeeper i enjoy the work my supervisor is a pretty decent understanding guy with a thorough dislike for the shit that comes with capitalism hes straight up told me to prioritize myself over this company because no company will care for my health   but without fail im consistently getting fucked over by his boss the supervisor for our department and the same department at another building who has no real conception of what our building needs we all consistently get dicked around by him endlessly  so in this last week he moved one of our two custodians to the other building decided we only need one custodian when 2 could barely manage to stay on top of everything and told us that we as a department need to share the remaining custodial responsibilities shit sucks but alright   with that change they decided to list a job posting for a second maintenance person despite our current guy having pretty much everything covered another change that makes 0 fucking sense but im not the big boss so what the hell do i know   as a groundskeeper im responsible for snow removal which means i need to be here before the building opens in order to clear the entrances and parking lots previously i was in at 7 but the maintenance guy made an issue because he has young kids and is a single father so he needs to be home when theyre off school i get bumped to coming in at 8 which makes my job harder when the maintenance guy doesnt help with snow but i understand and dont have an issue helping him out  i come in today though to find that im now working the custodial shift 9306 which means parking lots wont be cleared entrances might be but were most likely gonna be getting complaints because things arent done in time and despite everything those complaints will be reflecting on me directly with the added bonus of working the custodial evening shift 1930 on fridays and covering friday events which were supposed to alternate covering but ive been working every one of them for months  today ive been assigned cleaning duties on top of snow removal the maintenance guy is doing his usual stuff so the whole sharing custodial duties is yet to happen  i suspect that rather than actually sharing these duties theyre being pushed onto me and when the new maintenance person is hired theyll be taking over snow removal mainly and itll be pretty likely that the new person is a guy just statistically speaking so ive been corralled into being a custodian by the looks of it without so much as a do you mind helping out  the other day the maintenance guy said to me that itll be good if you do more cleaning snow removal is hard especially for a female this will make it easy on you nevermind the fact that ive been doing an excellent job imo of staying on top of this massive property with very little help despite the fact that hes supposed to help me i dont really want to make a stink about this comment he and i get along well aside from this english isnt his first language and he comes from a very traditional country trying to explain why benevolent sexism is an issue is hard normally with these added factors i think itll just lead to an argument that i dont feel like having not to mention cleaning isnt fucking easy   im not making an issue of the shift change yet tbf i did ask my supervisor if he could change my shift because driving in rush hour doubles my drive time which i cant afford the gas for but if i start being told to do more custodial im going to make an issue aside from the maintenance guys comment no one has said anything about me being female making me better at cleaning lmao he should see my house hed change his mind but i feel as though its being heavily implied and im being pushed out of my position and into custodial because im female  on top of all this they pay minimum wage andor far below the average for these positions most people who work here end up using the services they provide to low income people im consistently short every month and during christmas they had the audacity to all but demand we volunteer for their charity drive because thats where they make all their money all this while my big boss can afford to go to europe for a month but were supposed to grit our teeth and be grateful that we work for a company with such a great mission to help the poor they sell us this idea and ill admit for a while i was proud to help out but now i realized that the more people who use their services the more grants they can qualify for theyre keeping us in poverty so they can continue making the big bucks  im going for surgery at the end of the month ill be off for two months for recovery my province is in a pretty big recession and just lost a shit ton of jobs thanks to our new shit head corporate shill government my plan was to find a new job in that time but its looking more and more like ill be stuck here these bastards dont even offer short term disability i was told my sick days are my insurance which is great and all for someone who never gets sick thats not me  i dont know if i should even bother making an issue about this or not because if i bring up how sexist it is to force the only woman doing a mans job as the previous custodian described my position into cleaning they can wriggle out of it pretty easy because nothing was directly said about it  sorry for the rant im angry and have nowhere to turn my bf is tired of hearing about this shit,ekw4op

767,Notice how workplaces want to make the most out of the working day yet only give you the least amount of annual leaves?,i made a similar comment to this a few weeks ago to an askreddit post but unfortunately didnt get any traction nobody else really contributed lol this is probably quite flawed but hope you can see what i mean  so anyway to elaborate on the title in many countries there is typically law that specifies the minimum number of hours an employee must work per week to be considered fulltime as well as a maximum number of hours worked before overtime pay comes into play in the us if you work 30 hours per week apparently the irs considers you a full time employee and the department of labor requires overtime pay for any work over 40 hours  same goes for annual leave theres usually a law on the minimum number of days an employee must be granted every year something between 1020 days for a lot of countries  heres the thing notice how pretty much all places of work requires you to work 8 hours everyday for a total of 40 hours per week yet youre only granted the minimum number of annual leaves per year   the places we work for are willing get away with as much as they can on us i bet you if we didnt get overtime pay until after 10 hours while still getting paid the same amount as when we work 8 most companies wont hesitate to make 10hour days the standard number of hours we must work everyday  of course im not talking about all companies there are probably few great ones that grant 6 hour work days with 40hour workweek pay as well as being very generous with their annual leaves but i think i have a better chance of dating that cute girl i saw at the mall if i asked her out as soon as i meet her than finding a company like that,ekjqe2

771,Tech Companies are the worst.,im currently working at a major site for a major tech company if you search cringe post history youll know which one dont want to post it here  and a ton of their practices are absolutely horrible  for starters they literally have employee segregation everywhere between full time employees and contractors the full time employees are actually told they are better than us and they act accordingly most offices ive worked in the past have very loose rules on things but not here let me list a few   1 food left in common areas is for employees only if you are seen eating it you can be fired   2 areas of the building are off limits to use to contractors but yet im a contractor and work in the room im not allowed to use   3 any social club after work event party etc is for full time employees only  4 no benefits whatsoever i tried to apply for my contract companies insurance but it was actually 25 of my income for insurance that wasnt good  5 and this is my biggest gripe the company shuts down for the last 2 weeks of december and all non salary employees loose 2 weeks of pay for the holidays making paying bills incredibly difficult for 75 of their employees  im sorry for the rant but these companies are getting away legally with these practices and its awful,ekh7gx

786,Do you believe in the power of high quality education in prestigious universities?,i had been on a trip to oxford last week and took a tour of some of the colleges over there  pretty amazing architecture libraries and some world class museums around  as oxford attracts the best talent from across the world i was having mixed thoughts about feeling envious on one hand that i attended a mediocre college with mediocre experoences and relief on the other hand that leaving aside taking so much debt to study in these colleges working hard day and night for a couple of years and only ending up to work for the capitalists is not something i would be keen to do  very few people from these top colleges have an entrepreneurial bent of mind who start their own ventures or enjoy what they do while most end up working in jobs of course with much fatter pay packages  would you choose attending such prestigious colleges and embark on higher education knowing for a fact that you would still be a cog in the wheel of wage slavery maybe a higher package for a few years will help you retire earlier or would you not be interested to fall in the  enticement of studying so hard and would rather just graduate from anywhere maybe you believe degrees are just a piece of paper and ultimately you cannot buy freedom no matter where you graduate from,eiijty

795,40 hours work week is a lie (rant),so you hear the eight hours for work eight hours for rest and eight hours for what you will thrown around for here and there as if the 40 hour work week is the optimal balance between work and leisure but it doesnt account for a few things    8 hours sleep every night disturbed sleep i might add due to being woken by an alarm clock    25 hours of spare time before work with a cloud of anxiety hanging over them    35 hours going to and from work    8 hour work day   11514 hours a day are dedicated to or else ruined by work so you might as well really just strike the whole work week off as work that leaves the weekends where 12 hours of rest might sound reasonable since cmon im not using a fucking alarm clock on my time off   that leaves 24 hours of spare time in a 104 hour week subtracted the amount of sleep from 168 80 hours for work 24 hours for me   then you have the too short weekend that only serves your job where you spend the saturday recovering from the work week and the sunday preparing for the next one   and when i asked my boss if it was possible to work part time i get something along the lines of the union doesnt permit it,eix75i

799,Age 37. Some perspective and lessons learned.,i have experienced it all over a dozen jobs 3 different career paths hunger cold homelessness clinical depression loss and years of isolation all of this with aspergers  i have learned some truths that those who have not experienced my situation do not first of all work is not optional unless you are born into money most jobs involve working only to make enough to pay rent food commute and selfmaintenance which means absolutely nothing left for anything else  work in 2019 is more akin to slavery for most people on earth most countries have more vacant homes than they do homeless people you can google that and most countries produce more food than can be consumed by people  yet the world is still made to struggle the rich are slowly increasing their life expectancy while average people die at the same ages they did 20 years ago all governments are actively consolidating power over their citizens to make them better and more desperate workers healthcare is closely tied to your job almost everywhere your boss is allowed to tell you what you can and cannot say and what you can and cannot do in your personal life outside of work people get fired for it all the time especially social networking  it starts with schools schools force kids to get out of bed early in the morning against their will and then sit in a facility all day being told what to do and learning subservience and giving up control of their days to other people preparing them for a lifetime of servitude to the 1  37 years on this earth most of those years either in forced training school or employed and this is my takeaway,eiji0s
