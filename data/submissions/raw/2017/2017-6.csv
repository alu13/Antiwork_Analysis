Hell, I might even be able to tolerate it if it wasn't for the fact that most of my work's worth goes to some rich asshole at the top...I think it is horribly degrading...

Honestly, how do people get this brainwashed - how can't they see that they're being exploited - why do they pride themselves on being serfs: it has to be some kind of Stockholm syndrome...",False,6h6jxi,TurinTurambar499,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/6h6jxi/brainwashed_people/,10,32

8,Anyone interested in working together to help spread awareness?,"Hey all,
 

So, for quite a while I’ve been disillusioned with the status quo when it comes to western, capitalistic based politics and frequently I see on my own social media, many right and far right leaning propaganda, viral videos and images that I don’t believe tell a balanced story and focus on economic theories I find that are deeply flawed (such as trickle down economics).
 

I’ve started to sketch a bit of a road map of a collective that we can form, to help generate our own succinct content that can be easily consumed that can help spread awareness of alternatives to the right and far right economic and social policies. The goal is the creation of mature, non-gimmicky content that helps spur independent thought, action and pressure on various elected officials.
 

**The focus will be on:**

Viral images spread via social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc).
Videos created and uploaded (Youtube, Facebook videos).
Curation and generation of discussion.
 

**Will this be in support of a particular political ideology, party or government system?**

Not specifically however the focus will be on primarily left leaning policies. I understand that this is a wide spectrum and the left doesn’t agree on everything and with the evolution of politics that there isn’t even a clearly defined left and right. However there are many core tenets such as: wealth equality, redistributive economic policies, egalitarianism, universal healthcare, strong &amp; independent public education, pro environment policy, and so on.
 

**What kind of people are we looking for?**

Anyone interested in the cause will be able to help even if it’s just contribution to the discussions and feedback. In particular, those with specific skill sets - including graphic design, website design, copywriting skills, etc.
 

**How will we stay in contact?**

Primarily through an invite only Discord server.


**Interested?**

If getting involved in something like this is of interest to you, please send me a DM telling me a little about yourself and we can go from there
