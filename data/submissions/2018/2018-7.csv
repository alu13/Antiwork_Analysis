6,"Don't you hate this kind of ""arguments""?","I'm talking about those arguments that sound lefty but are not more than a continuation of the exchange-value society and commodification of human lives. For example, when debating access to healthcare or education, most would say you ""deserve it"" because you ""produce"", instead of arguing in favour of it as a basic right of every human being, therefore just reproducing the logic of productive and unproductive labour, or the disciplining of human lives for capital's sake, as a ""permit"" to ask for use-values. Even when defending inmigrants, the left is prone to say ""but they are workers too"" or ""they pay taxes too"", which is just missing the point.

This reproduction of the work-ethic and abstract labour power sickens me. Maybe I'm just an idealist, but I know we can go further than just criticize distribution or exploitation of the working class, we should strive to criticize the basis of our society, our mode of producing and thinking about labour and our lives too. This is the big challenge today more than ever, and with the decline of formal work, it will be the debate to come and to win.",False,8y2jzf,Krasnyy_yug,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/8y2jzf/dont_you_hate_this_kind_of_arguments/,11,54
7,Riding free...,"When I was unemployed, despite being poor, at least I had my bike.

I used to spend hours riding through the woods, feeling free, feeling free of the BS constraints of work.

Now I'm working a BS job that involves packing chicken produce, I feel f*cking lost.

Maybe I should just give it all up, and live a life as a hobo. 

Or maybe live a life of crime, and risk my freedom despite being a 'hoodlum'?

15,ANTI-WORK AS A RADICAL TRADITION,"""As part of the Liberation School of Los Angeles summer 2018 set of classes we will be facilitating a study/discussion group on ***anti-work***.  We are sharing a guided reading list. We cut things into excerpts  because the class will be soon, next week on July 12th. But links to  whole texts are in the reading list.

***Anti-work*** is a topic which has  re-gained interest in the broader radical milieu though it is an idea  that is often misunderstood and misinterpreted. With this class we hope  to shed light on the historical and theoretical origins of ***anti-work***. We will see how ***anti-work*** arose  as a part of the broader anti-capitalist movement, with its own  post-left anarchist and anti-state communist variations. Link to .pdf  below.""
