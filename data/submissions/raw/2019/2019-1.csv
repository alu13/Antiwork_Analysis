0,Pieces of paper are more valuable than human life.,"I refuse to work for food, water &amp; shelter as they are basic human needs. It's like working in exchange for air.

I'll be in the streets dying to overexposure as apparently that is by default what we're worth. I accept it. 

We're expected to give about 40+ hours a week to a society that literally think you don't deserve *water* unless you have pieces of paper.

I guess smart people choose not to reproduce so we have an entire society of brainless scumbags who think they're normal. 

some quotes... 

""It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society."" - Jiddu Krishnamurti

“The real hopeless victims of mental illness are to be found among those who appear to be most normal. ""Many of them are normal because they are so well adjusted to our mode of existence, because their human voice has been silenced so early in their lives, that they do not even struggle or suffer or develop symptoms as the neurotic does."" They are normal not in what may be called the absolute sense of the word; they are normal only in relation to a profoundly abnormal society. Their perfect adjustment to that abnormal society is a measure of their mental sickness. These millions of abnormally normal people, living without fuss in a society to which, if they were fully human beings, they ought not to be adjusted.” ― Aldous Huxley

7,Punching in and out now.,"I work in a typical office environment, and as of 2019 office employees are being required to punch in and out on a new time clock system. I understand that many places already do this, especially in factory or shift settings but I find it demeaning and unnecessary for office work. I think it's annoying and causes employees unnecessary stress, for example it pressures people to do things like drive dangerously in traffic in order to be on time. It erodes trust in the workplace, and it is a far cry from the best measure of productivity. It in fact (in my opinion) probably makes employees less productive, because they're now focused on fulfilling their time constraints, feel less autonomous, and therefore less happy. It just boils down to treating employees like professionals. My time shouldn't be watched like a hawk.

13,My boss found my $40 of missing tip money and now wants it back.,"Hey guys. I work at a pizza/coffee joint in a small gas station. It’s hell on earth and the only reason I stay is because of the tips. The other night, while closing, I lost $40 out of my apron. I searched the entire store and figure it was gone for good. This really really sucked considering I’m saving up for moving and and a big trip this summer and $40, to me, is a lot of money. I was so excited the next morning when I asked my coworker if they had saw it and she said yes, and in turn, asked my manager where it was. She put it in a baggie inside of her desk. I was the only one who worked the night before, by the way, and instead of asking me if I lost the $40, she just put it away.  . The bag had two twenty’s and like, $0.25-$0.50 in change. I didn’t remember having the change, but I figured if it was in the bag, I must’ve left it there too. I took the whole thing. This morning I wake up to multiple messages from my manager asking me where I put the change that was in the bag. She said since I took the $0.50ish, she wanted me to return the entire amount because she needed it for a deposit.  I think she’s pissed off because she wasn’t planning on giving me my money in the first place. What do I do? Should I return the money?

15,"Being a temp blows, and my current situation is why the work force pisses me off. (Long post)","Hey there. I'm typing this on mobile late evening. Apologies if there are typos or if I use weird phrases in this post. Its been that kind of day.

So to start off, I hope you are having a great day/night. Whether you are starting a shift, in the middle of it, or doing some overtime, I wish the best possible outcome for you.

I was fired from a retail job I held for two years. Happened a few months ago. Hated the place, yet I met great people. Since then I applied for some positions, recieved some call backs for some interviews, but nothing stuck. With no luck, I found myself one day walking into a temp agency desperate for a job.

This agency was pretty good. Pleasant people that assisted me well, and they found me instant work at first in a foam factory. Great place actually. I struggled a bit, not gonna lie. But I felt comfortable there.

Well, unfortunately one day I receive a text from my agency not to return to said factory. Could be multiple reasons. Being a temp, it can happen. Yet at the same time I just feel like they let me go because the night before I was doing really bad. New product, new way of handling it, and it took me all night to figure out a strategy that worked for me. I asked for help, was told ""just keep at it"", then thought I figured out  what to do by the end.

So time passes and I'm offered a position at another factory. Nice pay but long hours. Whatever, I'll take it. I'm nervous though because I've heard about this place before, and not in a good way. It was established in my small city about 6 years ago, and every time I've thought or heard about this place, I'm repelled by it. Just not my cup of tea. But who knows right? Might as well try.

I hear nothing back about the interview for a week. I call the agency again. Position was taken. Not sad about it. So what else do they have? Well, they suggest a few options that really dont sound appealing, and the last suggestion is a training session at the same place. Guess I'll take it.

Thanks for reading this far, I'll wrap up soon. I'm at this factory currently and let me tell ya, this place is so stupid. Disorganized, with drama and supervisors picking favorites off the bat. Some machines are great, and some are very not. I'm usually in the cold warehouse section, and I despise the cold. Could I move? Yeah, but other machines are pure ass.

Now I'm a young guy that has the same mindset as this sub. Fuck work, and how it's set up. Fuck these hours, and how long they are. Fuck these dicks who dont make it easy to be here. Fuck these breaks that dont even last twenty minutes. Just fuck it.

So, what's the point of this post? I work at 6 in the morning. It's almost midnight, and my hip area is bothering me to where I can't sleep. I've taken some aid and tried stretching it out and it's still bugging me. It's minor, so nothing crazy. I dont want to go in today Reddit. Yesterday was already garbage. My work already stated they need all available employees to go in and I said I would, but I'm really tempted to not go.

My family is counting on me to continue this job. My girlfriend is counting on me. I can afford to miss a day. I just feel guilty as fuck. I hate how the workforce is set up because when you feel ill in any way, you are forced to go to get that paycheck. Its agony, and just like you, I would do anything to not be in this vicious cycle.

Alright, end time! My questions are: 1. Should I say fuck it and call in? 2. Should I ask the agency if there are other job opportunities? 3. Have you had an instance where something was bothering you enough to not work, minor or major, and how did you feel? I'm going to attempt to sleep now, so feel free to comment, and I'll do an edit later.

22,[Discussion] Whats the correct choice of action for people like us to take?,"**TL;DR: Is it better to survive while hating life working, or is it better to risk your life and have the potential of a happy one while not working?**

&amp;#x200B;

In an ideal world we would each set out to accomplish the things we desire in life according to what we believe. Unfortunately we do not live in an ideal society and as such, in order to keep on subsisting on this dying planet, the vast majority of people must subject themselves to ""voluntary"" work in exchange for money to purchase poisoned food and overpriced shelter.

&amp;#x200B;

I am writing this post because this is a very dilemma I am facing currently. After living off of savings for a couple of months the accounts are running dry. **For some reason or another, the system has failed to indoctrinate within the people reading this post a strong desire to work and as such we are stuck with a moral dilemma:**

&amp;#x200B;

* On one hand, we throw ourselves into the great and unstoppable machine that humanity has built, giving up what little spirit we have left in exchange for the bare minimum monetarily and the ability to breath the very air you have to pollute on your way to work. **Choosing this option essentially means giving up your spirit in order to survive.**

&amp;#x200B;

* On the other hand, we forsake all that has been given to us in while keeping our spirit and mental sanity. We show we aren't afraid to fight for something that truly matters to us and hopefully encourage others to do the same. That or we just starve to death on the streets. **Choosing this option essentially means giving up your comfort  in order to have the potential to not just survive, but thrive.**

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know what you all think, **why are you doing what you are doing now over the other?** Either way it seems to me either option holds considerable weight as to what our lives will become. I look forward to discussing with you all in the comments!

23,A babysitter for adults,"Backstory: 22 year old Manager at a popular fast food restaurant in Texas

TL;DR: Hard work is bullshit and I’m quitting my job.

I don’t truly have a problem with working, I kinda like the idea of dedicating myself and working with a team. I enjoy that lemming nonsense even if it is kind of stupid. Plus I like learning about my coworkers and employees, most of them are great people but lack the ability to get any upward economic movement.

That’s kinda what I want to talk about, the employees. These guys and girls work twice as hard as me and get no where near the pay. How is that fair? My job is basically to make sure that don’t screw up and to handle the angry consumers of our food. So basically I’m a babysitter for these people, and they definitely don’t need me. Yet I get paid almost 15hr and they get paid 8-9 an hour.

Plus I have to fight my fellow managers to get my guys hours, but they have the same problem. All of their employees need more money and that means they need to work longer hours. I mean these people have kids to feed and rent to pay how is it the companies place to get in their way because they want to save a percentage on labor costs?

I mean I do work 50-60 hours a week, but most of that is spent on my phone. Plus I earned my position basically off the back of my social skills, it had nothing to do with how hard I work. 

At the end of the day, these people work hard, are stuck in a cycle of completely depending on this job to survive and I just don’t feel right about it. How could I? They deserve better then what they have.

The moment attention is brought to how hypocritical such a “well known part of work” is to the puritanical work ethic we demand from every member of society, cognitive dissonance sets in. 

So, to sum things up, we will gladly shame and shun any member of society that isn’t earning a paycheck, while simultaneously nodding in agreement that most of the time we spend at work is “trying to look busy”.

54,I worked myself into a heart attack at 44. Then they fired me and now at 48 I’m trying to fight my way back into a cubicle. What the fuck have I become?,"First: I’ve been looking for this sub forever.  Thank fucking God there’s somewhere people can speak sanely about our sick obsession with work.

So a few years ago I scheduled a 2 week break between jobs.  I had the heart attack in that interim, so there was no short term disability of any kind, no help at all in fact.  Then I had to get out of bed 10 days later and start a new job because I was afraid they’d rescind the offer if they knew.  Background: I have a family that depends on me, or I’d have fucked off out of the workforce long ago.

I work in an office job, one of those fields you’re expected to live at your desk.  Not unsurprisingly I can’t work like I did before (i.e. I’m dead by 6, even though I lie in my car and nap instead of lunch) so they wind up building this case for “underperformance,” bounce me with no severance.  The past two years of unemployment have just about killed my marriage.  The only jobs outside of my field I can get at my age pay around $15 an hour, which barely puts a dent in my monthly nut, chiefly mortgage and health insurance.  Nobody will hire me in my field: too old, damaged goods.

If it weren’t for my kids I’d definitely check out.  Some nights I’m so agitated and depressed I sit in my garage with a shotgun in my mouth: I think it reassures me that escape is close by, which makes it easier to get up and go through the motions the next day.

Anyway, nice to be here on the sub.  ",False,akw8c3,jackykarkovice,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/akw8c3/i_worked_myself_into_a_heart_attack_at_44_then/,41,1
55,The result of being antiwork and having no jobs for many years...,"There are many reasons for me being anti work.The most important reason is the place I live with the longest working hours per week in this world.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 1X years old,I consider ""working"" is a very evil thing because my parents often hit me after their boss bullied them.(But they were asshole even without a job.)

&amp;#x200B;

I am 25-30 now,the only thing I ""worked"" for was volunteer work.The problem is ...I looks different with most people at my age,most strangers consider I am 5-7 years old younger than my actual age.Many people had a job for many years at my age...looks ...old for me.

&amp;#x200B;

And I feel workers are somehow corrupted in their mind...most of them in here just keeping to selling BAD stuff in Paul Fussell's standard and try to force everyone to buy them.

56,Why does it have to be this way for me and for people like me?,"Unluckily i'm not dead  yet even though i much rather not be alive but it's much more easier for me to cling onto reality and survive then it is for me to purchase a deadly weapon and inflict self-harm upon myself. You can say if i really wanted to die i would do it and maybe you""re right but i really don't want to live either. I hope that makes sense.  And look im not really looking for pity either i genuinely just want someone to maybe help explain or change my perspective. Not everything needs to be in concrete or in the actbecause the abstract is a good place for a thinker like me. 

Maybe in the not so distant future some guy will read a post like this and realize there's somebody out there that understands what they're going through.  Perhaps there's no rhyme and reason, that im just a  series of unfortunate events, etc.  I'm  not good at anything really, everything is a struggle even the most basic things everybody typically knows how to do, thats why finding a job is humiliating because even if i get one i wont be good at it anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have any desire to work  like most people but i can't tolerate it at all either. I'm lazy i guess everything feels like too much effort for me. Everything feels like im going to fail so i just rather give up. Like hours in i start getting overwhelmed with dread or hopelessness, that you know nothing matters. I quit one of my jobs mostly because i was so lonely it felt suffocating just to be around others.  Every second on the clock too becomes suffocating and to top it off you know you arent even getting payed a living wage.  Is that really normal? If it is then maybe i  need drugs to not have a breakdown  because in those hopeless moments i felt homelessness was better and i know homelessness isn't  a good thing but i just couldn't stand the humiliation.  Sticking with it or manning up in that situation would put a hamper on my health and i just don't know how i could keep my composure with that kind of pressure day in and day out.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps maybe if i was thrust-ed into homelessness i would think otherwise but its  more likely i would just sink into a more hopeless state than i already am. And  to know this is really reality for the rest of your life brings me to the edge. How my only realistic escape of it is suicide or death. A lot of times i just get overwhelmed with boredom too and feel like there's nothing worth living for.

&amp;#x200B;

And i get it work must be done, nothing is free,  life is better than its ever been blah blah,blah but i find it awfully too difficult so maybe i shouldn't exist you know? If i don't have any desire to really work hard or survive then whats the point why be alive you know? I don't really understand why its so difficult to find a job either. For certain jobs that are more prestige i understand but why are entry jobs so far and few between. How am i not supposed to feel hopeless and just keep applying? Is that even a natural reaction anyways  to a constant or assumed rejection or is it just an artificial one? 

&amp;#x200B;

I hate happy people too and people in relationships largely because i envy them.  I don't understand how people think life is worth living with a 9-5 maybe that's normal idk. I feel like im just a defect you know that somethings wrong with me  compared to those people.  Doesn't seem like there's much of an uproar or maybe people just hide it or find ways of tolerating it but i can't i'm not like them i want to fight back against the system even if it's completely utterly hopeless. I just don't belong in this world i think the world is better off without me anyways i wish somebody or anything would kill me gracefully.  Save me the pain of existing.

2. [believe that I am entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Nothing more. I also

up to me to make the best of them.

4. Do not “follow my passion.” I bring it with me. I believe that any job can be done with
passion and enthusiasm.

resolved to learn as much as I can from whatever source is available to me. I will never stop
learning, and understand that library cards are free.

for my shortcomings or the challenges I face. And I will never accept the credit for something I
didn’t do.

of. Understand the world is not fair, and I'm of with that. Do not resent the success of others.

choose to be lazy. Some choose to sleep in. I choose to work my butt off.

87,"I finally quit my job, and I could t be more relieved.","First of all, sorry for any formatting or grammar issues to come, I’m on mobile and currently still at work for my last few hours. 

Things have been building up for some time, mostly with the store owner just being a real bitch and not treating any employees right. She’s been a stay at home mom forever and has no idea how to actually treat people like employees rather than kids. Usually this entails yelling at us for any mistake to be made or belittling us and making us feel worthless rather than using it as a learning opportunity. Originally her husband ran the store and put in 50+ hours a week of unpaid labor to try to stay afloat. Unfortunately, he had to fall back on a more corporate job, making about 400k a year to build back from their debt. So the plan was for his wife to come in since she technically is the other owner, only things just got worse when she came on about 5 or 6 months ago. 

She began only coming in for a few hours a day to eventually being there less than a week what I would work in a day. On top of that she would come in much later than she scheduled herself and leave early to pick up her kids from school so they wouldn’t be home alone, both of her kids were in high school and could very much take care of themselves. Most problems could very easily be traced back up to her, and instead of owning up to it, she turned it around and blamed it on us and belittled us and just treated us like kids. 

There’s many many more good stories and just ridiculous things that she would do that made it seem more like a written out reality show rather than a failing business. Anyway, everything accumulated up to the past week or so. A customer had come in and made a large purchase that ended up being a fraudulent charge. Of course since I was in the store at the time it was my fault. And that’s what she would tell you, that I was incompetent and untrustworthy in the store. Yet she continued to have me open and run the store on my own. In reality, I had practiced all security checks I was taught, check to make sure the ID matched the card and run the transaction, which is what I did. The kicker is that she was actually in the store watching the customer and noticed how suspicious he seemed, but she still decided to leave early before any purchase was made. She also berated me for how much she told me not to do transactions like that and to check more security things and be more suspicious. Which first of all is complete bs, I was never taught anything more than checking ID, and second of all she wasn’t in the store enough to even “teach” me anything like that, like she even had any business experience in the first place. 

So today I decided to just hand in my 2 week notice since I was planning on going back to school soon anyway. After handing it in and telling her why I guess she couldn’t stand the idea that I would quit before she could fire me, so she told me today would actually be my last day. I’m not sure if that counts as quoting or being fired but either way I’m still happy to not have to come back tomorrow or ever again. 

The kicker is that she wants me to stay to finish my shift for then next few hours. As you can tell I’m doing that by writing this and looking for some freelance work online. 

Today I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. And for the first time in a while I feel, happy. 


There’s many more stories I could tell of how ridiculous she was as an owner and a person, usually racist tirades or trying to find ways to dig herself out of problems she created to try and not look like the cause of them in the first place.

**I can change these rules whenever I want and enforce them however I please as best I see fit for this subreddit.**

The moderator....

I've noticed this in multiple support boards (or outwardly support boards) on reddit.

This boards aren't actually support spaces. Technical support boards, like r/unemployment, have unresponsive moderators.

They're created under the terms of moderators who don't actually sympathize with bad apples (someone in r/unemployed messaged me privately telling me to do footcam model stuff, and then called me a loser).

The moderator of that sub frequently sides with the rando asshole who comes in to brag about earning 100k at their great office and gives the same shitty, nasty, condescending advice about the bad attitudes that are evidence on reddit, when people are discussing things in terms they typically don't in real life. It's all the same and they're all of the same mindset - intellectually shallow, banally, casually evil, and contemptuous of anything but idiotic ""advice"" that doesn't apply to people who are far out enough in a problem.

The world is full of mentally shallow low grade sociopaths, probably in every board - but there's a high rate of them among moderators.

The fact that venting is discouraged on the rules of a board entitled r/unemployed might be the most bizarre detail, since real long term unemployment (or employment, probably of the humiliating kind) comes with emotional burdens, even after all advice has been dispensed.

It's grotesque and bizarre to me as to why someone would moderate this at all; how much real ""advice"" can be given for a long term problem on a message board, short of someone giving a person an actual job or a cure?",False,agz8v7,sewdeficient,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/agz8v7/how_many_of_you_have_ever_posted_in_runemployed/,5,1

91,Frustrated,"Apologies in advance for the length and the rant. I'm just feel like I've reached my breaking point with capitalism having its foot firmly planted on my throat. I don't even know where to start with how angry and depressed work has made me. Not just my current job, but the idea of working 40+ hours period just to be granted the ""privilege"" of barely scraping by and surviving while the rich get to live it up simply because they were lucky enough to be born into wealth or screwed enough people over to achieve it. 

I work for local government and have been for the last 6 years (in various departments, all of which suck). The pay is already shit and then they take out 11% for a retirement we may not even see. I have a chronic illness that's managable with meds but I have to work full-time to receive healthcare coverage because I live in the ultra civilized and advanced country of America (which I hate; my health shouldn't be contingent on my fucking employment status). The job itself is mind-numbingly dull: I sit in a cubicle all day and do maybe 4 hours worth of work and the rest of the time I have to ""look busy"" because God forbid anyone work less than 40 hours a week even if there's no work to be done. I have trouble sleeping Monday-Thursday but on weekends I sleep like a baby (wonder why /s) and when it's time for me to get up and face another 10+ hour day (including getting ready to go to this place I hate being and my commute) I honestly find myself wishing I'd died in my sleep. I despise waking up before the sun has even risen so that I can spend my day being miserable. 

I hate having to come here and pretend I don't loathe every second. I hate spending more time doing someone else's inane busy work than I spend on myself. I hate that I see my coworkers more than my family and friends. I hate that when I get home I feel so physically and emotionally drained that I can't even work on my passion; that I don't even have the energy to exercise and keep myself healthy. All I want to do after a soul-numbing day in this cubicle is smoke a blunt, eat unhealthy food (because it feels like the only highlight of my day), and pass out while watching some banal program on Netflix or Hulu. I hate that Americans have been so indoctrinated and brainwashed that they think this is an okay, normal way to live. I hate that my supervisor felt the need to put me on a disciplinary plan because I occassionally clock in at 8:01 instead of 8:00 on the fucking dot (we literally had a meeting where we went over ""20 occurrences"" I had and over half of them were me clocking in 1-4 minutes after 8:00!!!! LIKE I DON'T SPEND 9 FUCKING HOURS HERE DOING THE STUPID BULLSHIT YOU ASSIGN THAT I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT!), but it's no problem if I clock in a minute or two EARLY (because who gives a fuck about MY time as the employee, right?). I hate having to pretend I give a fuck about trivial ass bullshit that I'm in no way invested in.

I write, shoot, and edit films/web series. I like doing narrative work. I have no problem spending 8-12 hours on a set for nothing because I love doing it, but lately anything film-related has felt like an extra chore. I feel like I get no enjoyment out of it anymore. I can't branch out and work for myself as a videographer because the things I would make money shooting (weddings and events) I HATE so it would just be another form of prison. I just want to shoot and edit my own stories. I want to finish the novel I'm working on. I want to focus on my health and have the energy to make nutritious meals and workout. I want to better myself, but I feel like I'm trapped in this neverending cycle of bitterness and depression. I've tried therapy. I've been on four different antidepressants. I'm convinced that the problem isn't with ME; I don't think I have a chemical imbalance. I think the system is just fucked. And it drives me insane how when I talk about this to friends and family they just kind of... have accepted that this is life even though they're all just as tired and drained as I am. Where is the outrage? 

I can't stand how wages are stagnant but it costs more and more to live. I'm living with my parents because I can barely cover my bills on what I make. So that makes me feel great as a grown man. A while ago my mom told me that when she and my dad initially got married they didn't plan on having any kids and then they changed their mind. And I've found myself resenting them for that. Like why would you bring me into this world to be worked to death and unfulfilled?! I wish they would've just stuck to the original plan or at least just waited and only had my younger brother because I'm not built for this bullshit. And I'm tired of everyone saying to ""look at the bright side"" or ""be more positive"" or ""your life is what you make it"" and all the rest of that lying motivation porn. Being more ""positive"" is nothing more than lying to yourself to get through a shitty existence and I'm incapable of doing that... it's like telling me to laugh at a movie that I don't find funny. Sure, I can do it, but it won't be genuine. 

I'm considering going to grad school but the thought of working full-time on top of classes and having absolutely no time to myself feels so daunting. Plus I would go for counseling/therapy (for more money and flexible hours) but then I feel like I'd have to peddle all that ""be positive"" shit that never worked for me. How can I counsel people using methods I don't believe actually work?

Tuesday night I played a favorite sad song of mine and cried for like half an hour. I don't want to be alive anymore and I'm only 31. The only things that keep me from killing myself are my nephew (and upcoming niece) and the fact that I don't want to fail at that and then end up in an even worse position. It just wears me down that I'm spending my youth toiling away instead of finding fulfillment. This morning I woke up three hours before my alarm and couldn't get back to sleep because I knew this shit was looming. Five 8 hour days (and it's only 8 if you're lucky smh) and TWO DAYS to recuperate is dismal. I feel like you have to choose between bettering yourself or decompressing and actually relaxing on your off time; feels like there isn't enough time to do both. So it's either work all week and then grind more for your own personal goals when you're off and never really get any relaxation or relax and make no personal progress.

Even just working 6 hour days or only 3-4 days a week would be better than this. I just need more of a fucking BALANCE. I don't see how work/life balance exists when we spend so. much. fucking. time at work or doing work-related things. Why must we ALL start at exactly 8:00 a.m.? Why do we all have to be herded into this box where we HAVE to get up at 5:30 in the morning and fight traffic to get to work by 8:00? I hate that those are the universal hours because we aren't all the same! It's just really been grinding me down lately and I needed to vent somewhere I would be understood.

Basically, a ton of our policies changed this year (from a weaker benefits plan, to less PTO, and now mandatory clocking in/out) and I can't stand my boss (simply put, just an all around bad supervisor, is vindictive, untrustworthy, treats me like a secretary) and everyone who works here is a boomer. I make around ~41k a year.

""We are asking that all agents be present on January 21 2019 to facilitate an exercise that we are doing to aid in managing the call volume....we will be meeting with you to discuss same.""

No where in this fucking email does it state that we are required to do any overtime nor did anyone meet with me to tell me about it.

108,"Mental health issues, partly from work.","I have a issue. A big one. I always had this anti-work attitude for some reason and it is literally killing me by now. I got mental health issues from it or my anti-work stance comes from them, I am not quite sure how this correlation works for me, but lately I think a lot about killing myself and I started to self-harm after more than 5 or 6 years without doing it. A lot of this anger I compensate it comes from my mum.

My mum thinks I don't want to work, but actually I'd be happy if I had a brain like everyone else, being able to work and somehow be happy would be much simpler, but I can't. I was NEET for almost 2 years and started working. During this time I hardly ever was depressed or felt bad, everyhing backfired when I started to work. I don't do much outside of the weekend anymore and I hate it. I used to have a lot of interests and activities before, now I don't. Well, I still have but don't have the time to do them. I literally do nothing monday-thursday, sometimes I go to a bar and drink until I can't stand anymore and forget that the weekend will end in 2 days and spend the next days rehearsing with my bands, just to fall back to suicidal tendencies on mondays. It has been getting much worse in the last weeks too, before it was somewhat bearable but it takes on a whole new level now. For example, when I cut or burned myself in school I usually felt bad afterwards, now I don't give a shit for a while, think about doing it again and cry like a little baby for 2 minutes because I feel like a total failure and alone.

What definitely does not help is the lack of support from my parents. Some quotes of my mum ""Only people like you, who don't wanna work are worthless.""

110,Absolute hell hole: The realities of working a bullshit job,"I feel as though I’m about to have a full-blown mental breakdown… So, I figure that writing everything down might be cathartic in a way… I’m generally a very happy person, bubbly, lively and outgoing. I studied marketing in University (a decision I now regret) because I believed that it would lead me into a creative career where I could use my brain and writing skills.

Flash forward to today: I’m working in Marketing in a foreign country, which seems exotic and cool at first blush. However, this country is known for its very conservative (boring) work culture. I was ‘lucky’ enough to land this job when I first arrived here because they were seeking someone with an American background and high-level English skills. When I arrived for the interview, I was shocked by how bland, drab, and beige the office setting was- no decorations on the wall, no meeting rooms, just an open-concept office with floor to ceiling beige/grey. However, during the interview I was told how progressive and innovative the company was. This company is a supposed leader in the technology and computer industry. I figured that perhaps the company culture itself was a bit livelier than the beige surroundings…

A year later, I struggle to muster up the strength and motivation to wake up each morning and get ready for work. I sometimes weep at the breakfast table, absolutely dreading the 8 hours and 45 minutes of intense boredom which await me. I literally count down the minutes until I can clock out in the evenings. Having to sit in silence for so many hours each day is torture, I feel like a factory farm pig locked in a gestation crate. The paradox is that my body and mind are completely exhausted after a long day of doing nothing. I can’t even summon the energy to work on side projects or anything creative once I get home. 

My colleagues are all very much into their jobs, completely engrossed in their mundane day-to-day tasks, enthusiastically editing spreadsheets and typing away on clunky keyboards. Most people have spent their entire careers working for this company, so they’ve been brainwashed to believe that everything that happens here is normal. Every decision must be approved by upper-management, even for insignificant things (i.e., needing a new notebook from the supply cabinet). Maybe it’s the culture differences which cause the most strife, but I have never worked in such a boring, soulless environment. 

On top of this, I am a migraine sufferer and since I spend hours staring into a screen, my migraines have become increasingly worse and more frequent. I also fear that the artificial fluorescent lighting does not help the matter either. I have requested to work remotely a few days out of the week, but the request was denied because I don’t work in Sales. 

Perhaps the most misery-inducing aspect of the job is that overall attitude of most people who work here. Most are stuck up and only criticize and complain. Working in group projects is dreadful as you will be outright scolded and embarrassed for any slight error while praise and encouragement fall by the wayside. You could do 99/100 things correct, but the one thing that is wrong is instantly noticed with the top managers copied in on the subsequent email.

I absolutely despise my counterpart on my team. She is so negative and pessimistic and makes every day an absolute hellish experience. I have spoken with my boss about her attitude and he completely agreed, stating that I’m not the only one who has told him about it. Unfortunately, she will not be moved out of my department as she is a kiss-ass and accrues exorbitant hours of overtime because she makes herself look busy. 

Overall, I cannot believe the constant hell I experience on a day-to-day basis. I’m sure most of you can relate to this…

Sorry for the long rant, but honestly, I feel a bit better by letting this out.

112,Are families the main reason for people/workers/slaves to not think critically about their situation?,"It seems to me that, people do not refrain from their work neither physically of mentally due to the fact they NEED to provide for their families.. They simply cannot get out of the treadmill because they have to sustain their relatives. 

It's possible to sum it up with the fact that they have no time to think properly, no time to imagine a a different world than this one that they (we) live. Being watching the clock all the time, having to adjust your daily life to fullfill the necessity of the place where you work (company or employer) makes a working person unable to have new experiences, go to other places, meet different people, having deep conversations, use the imagination, learn new things, between other things which would make one to reason about this situation. Sum it up with the fact that everyone around is doing it.

 Sum it up with the fact that most of the people who work with you ,or people in general around you, do not have anything against this entire situation due to the same factors as you.

Sum it up with the media and the ""common sense"" saying that the state in which your life is is your fault, and that you must work more and study more to make your life and  your relatives/family life better.

Sum it up with your desires of consumption/status which are being fed in you since you are a kid.

Being a Antinatalist, I clearly believe that all the pieces fit together. Like, we are told to follow that same path: grow up, study, have work, have a FAMILY, retire (if it is possible), die, and let your children do the same as you, either by your example or because the society in general forces it in their mind. 

After having children, because ""you"" have done it so without thinking about the world which you are putting this child (I am assuming it, since it seems like most of the cases are like this, sorry if I am offending someone with it), you are gonna be a slave of it, because you MUST work to provide and protect it. 

Now, there is no way out... If, luckily,there was any kind of criticism of our way of life and the system who rule us, it should be shut down because one who has a family to provide, should not have time to entertain such kind of thoughts, such is this system which is gonna make a ""living"" for them, and for you.

116,Responsible for mistakes of coworkers?,"I am financial controller and I prepare analysis on the basis of the input data. Input data was not correct (clerk did not change price) so the analysis was also not correct. One manager who is responsible for the calculation of the price told me that I am responsible because I did not notice the price was not OK even though he is the one who prepares calculations and he did not send new price to the clerk. Manager also takes a look in the analysis every month so I asked him why he did not notice the price was not OK. He said that it seemed to him something was not right but he did not bother.

&amp;#x200B;

I really hate that, I feel guilty now. Do you think it was my responsibility to check for every price if it was OK? I think I can't check every input data and even if I would check it I would have no calculation to compare to since manager did the calculation.

Maybe this is a stereotype about hospitals? Or maybe they aren’t as bad as I think they are?

I don’t know. I’m just terrified about work consuming my life, especially since I wanna do a lot of things when I’m older (Travel the world, start a nonprofit animal rescue, etc.) 

I’m mainly going into radiology cause science is the only subject I enjoy, and I don’t really want to be in the technology, engineering, or mathematics part of STEM, so I decided to go towards the doctor root. 

I do enjoy the fine arts and taking care of animals, but they don’t pay well at all. I came from a poor family, so I irrationally worry about even being in a job that only pays $50,000 a year (even though I know that’s a good/decent amount!!)

133,Honestly guys what options are there to earn money outside the 9-5?,"Hi guys. To be honest with you my life has been an utter mess the last few years or so.

Long story very short: I’m in my early 20s.  Had a very senior well paid job that I was ‘lucky’ to get (given my age) and after some years quit because despite the money and ‘status’ beyond that fuck the imprisoning 9-5, I’m still young I don’t wanna die here let’s try get out of it. 

Fast forward a few years basically tried to make passive income, no success. 

Always suffered with anxiety and depression and because of my now stronger than ever anguish, start making music again (which I did for years as a teen). 

Really believed that I could make a life doing that (no, I’m not saying I ever thought I could attain commercial success but at least feel fulfilled/purposeful/true to who I am) but to be honest music is hard and I wonder if I really am cut out of it OR if this is just a woe is me type plea. I look at other natural born musicians and don’t feel my reasons are as natural or pure as there’s, to be honest with myself (and after a year of music and writing and thinking about ‘my craft’ literally 24 fucking hours a day, I’m just concluding this today, so it’s hard t swallow but it feels freeing as I was struggling with the music and pushing myself to do it, to ‘make it’ when it just felt off). 

So my question is what the fuck else can I do?

Oh and also I have a girl I love and that loves me too but because I’m so fucking unstable I can’t promise here I would stay by her indefinitely and give her such commitment. 

So I’m basically aimless, broke, alone, 25 years old where my friends are getting married and buying their first properties, and my dad kicked me out the house because he’s just not happy with my decisions (appearance and tattoos I’ve started getting). 

I’m sorry to give my life story. I just couldn’t think of better people to share it with perhaps for some advice. 

I am glad I never took the safe road, sure. But I just have nothing or no aim to show. That’s hard. ",False,agy6vn,xnx2018,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/agy6vn/honestly_guys_what_options_are_there_to_earn/,28,1
134,"""She will be mised... She wouldn't want us to get behind in our work""","This happened many years ago but it still upsets me.

It was my first real job after college for a well known company; we'll call it Cube Farm, Inc.  We often had to work mandatory overtime because their salespeople over-promised what could reasonably be done.  Furthermore, our sister offices were unionized and their employees could not be forced to work OT.  Therefore, if the other offices got behind in their work, they would make us work their accouts because we had no protections in our Southern state.  Yes, we got time and a half, but it gets tiresome doing 5-16 hours of mandatory OT every week because of management's poor planning.  I didn't have children at the time and lived 5 minutes away and it was brutal for me; I felt bad people with small children and/or long commutes.

 One of the long time supervisors was brutally murdered on a Sunday morning; we'll call her Jane. Jane was also pregnant and her boyfriend allegedly killed her, but no one was ever charged in her death as far as I know.  Jane worked there for at least 10 years and had a large presence.  People were understandably upset. After the funeral arrangements were made public, the director of the department gathered everyone together and said the following: 

""Jane was a valuable member of our team and she will be missed.  Unfortunately, her family chose to schedule her funeral in the middle of the week.  Many supervisors  and I will be going to the funeral, so the company's presence will be felt.  So it's not necessary for you all to go.  Jane would not have wanted us to get behind in our work....but if you must go, please know that you will NOT be granted PTO, that you must make up your time from the funeral AND if you do not complete your OT, you will face consequences.""

She tried to seem sympathetic but she failed miserably.  I couldn't believe how cold she was.  I didn't go to the funeral because I didn't know Jane that well.  Most of my department did go anyway, so they had to make up about four hours of regular work in addition whatever OT we had that week. 

Of course, Jane's desk was quickly cleaned off and her job was posted the next week.  ",False,ajc348,secretacct0099887,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ajc348/she_will_be_mised_she_wouldnt_want_us_to_get/,27,1

141,Not working as someone about to finish school is impossible. Any ideas about any routes I can take to be happy?,"Hi, r/antiwork. I'm a 17 year old sixth form student in the UK who is set to finish in June. There was a point where I was convinced that I was going to go to university (I got AAB last year, it's not like I'm not capable), but nothing stuck - I can't imagine dedicating myself and 30k of my future savings to a career that I don't even know I'll enjoy and that'll dominate my life. So, the plan is to just get any old job once I finish, and earn while I plan my next move. Thing is... I'm not sure what my next move is going to be. I need advice.

Seasonal work has piqued my interest, as I can't stomach the idea of full-time work with heavily regulated holidays. I've been looking into things such as outdoor instruction (e.g. ski instructor), as it appeals to my interests and isn't an office job. A more 'professional' version of that that I've heard of is getting a contract-based job, such as nursing, and taking off with the money you've saved for a few months.

My skills are all pretty much all creativity oriented. Language is my main strength, and I'm very artistic... but picking a job based on what you love isn't necessarily the route to go down, even though it can make things easier. I just want to end up in a place where I earn enough to achieve my goals (such as travelling), but in a way that doesn't drive me crazy and that doesn't suck away all my time.

I'm sure I'll think of something, but I'd really appreciate any tips. What's a good way of avoiding the corporate grind, yet still living a good life? What ways of earning can I pursue that fall in line with my antiwork mentality? I'll take any suggestions - deviating from the norm means doing the unorthodox. I have ideas, sure, but it's hard for me to make a decision. I'm naive and an overthinker by nature and trying to avoid the status quo doesn't exactly have a handbook. At least I have Reddit!

172,"I’m 21 and have never been employed, I’m currently trying to get a job but I have mixed feelings and worries.","So I’ll give some background information that’s relevant to the “world of work”. I live in central Scotland. 

I’ve always been kind of slow, ever since I was young. It took me longer to learn and catch up with things like English and Maths when I was young (I still hate maths). I’m not sure if it’s anything to do with me being born premature, or just that I fell asleep a lot in class when I was a young child. I eventually got support throughout my early years, but when I hit high school I was left on my own. I mostly did ok, but maths was still a struggle. English was better. I was decently academic however and passed all my subjects, some of them with tops marks, mainly Cookery and Art. It hit hard when exams and grades started flying my way halfway through high school. People were talking about grades/levels/exams and I had no clue. I still managed to pass my subjects, but it took me longer to catch on. 

I never really knew what I wanted to do when I left school, so I just went with the flow. I continued Art and Design because it was my best subject in school. That was the wrong choice. I ended up dropping out halfway through because I didn’t know where I was going career wise. Everyone else had future plans for further education and careers and I had no clue. I dropped out in December 2015 and did nothing up until applying for a bakery course. I thought I’d try bakery since I was good at cookery. I made the same mistake. At the start of 2017, I applied for Universal Credit and got accepted. I was very scared and lacked knowledge when it came to trying to find and get work. I was so used to living with my parents and depending on them that I didn’t want to work. I was scared and I didn’t feel grown up enough yet. Fast forward to August I tried a business course because I felt like it was a “sensible” choice. I could get some good knowledge out of that and get a decent career right? Wrong. I left after two weeks of being there. It was not for me at all. 

From then until now, I’ve been on several programs to help with my anxiety and unreadiness for work. My anxiety has dropped moderately but it still exists. I am much more open to working now, but I still have my fears. What job *really* suits me? Will I actually be able to do it? Can I handle it? Will I be paid enough? What if I keep failing, just like I did with my college courses. What if I never find work and I end up becoming homeless or too dependant on my parents. I currently have a partner who works full time and is paid well. I’d love to be able to move out, but I still have my fears about work. I’m 21 and I’ve never been employed. I know people look down on me for it but I genuinely want to work now, I’m just worried that I won’t be able to do it.

Now in my third job and it's hitting new peaks.


What surprises me more is how many of my friends that I've made at different stages in my life have been hit by it too. People that I'd never expect started to complain about the system we've got. We're all stuck in this trap of not being paid enough and having to deal with stupidly high rent prices just to make profit for people that were born at the right time. It's relentless. Why shouldn't we give up? By the time those that hold us down die their children will have been taught their ways and the cycle will continue. There's no escaping, and even if there was, the easiest way out is to be holding other people down. We complain at each other as we wake up before the sun rises and crawl towards our positions, begging for a way out but without good fortune there won't be one.

178,"Working ruins my health, mood, well being, creativity, vision.","Before I was working I had like a month free, It was mushroom season, it was glorious, I lived so free! Somedays I woke up early in the morning because I was so excited to barefoot around and hunt for mushrooms my family could eat later for dinner, thats probably the best feeling. Also I have been outside alot and my vision was slowly improving, about 1.5 diopters in 3 months, because I was active focusing on distance vision alot. Btw my vision goes kinda hand in hand with my mood, good vision = good mood. Now that I have been working for a couple of months my vision has gotten worse again, my health is fucked, im tired, I don't feel good, im just down all the time and and coming up for air constantly.

My question is now that I have some money whats the best way to go on about this? Sure I can take alot of months off and live really good, but then i'll be broke again and forced into another job. So how can I think more long term? I might want to escape this sistem but that would mean moving out my parents house, getting a plot of land somewhere, build something on it and hope noone finds me and kicks me out. Grow mostly my own food and try to keep expenses to a bare minimum... That would mean I would need to work like 4-5 months of the year. Maybe I should get some animals or just do something that produces an income on that land and maybe im good. But damn land with building perment costs so much.... I probably wont afford it in like few years. I mean land used for farming is muuuch cheaper but If I built anything on it it better be hidden really well because it's illegal.

181,"Burned out, suicidal and about to snap","I'm seriously burned out at work, which I've been at for two years now. It's a robotic job that's heavily monitored for productivity, and very tedious. I've mastered everything to know about it, so I just sit there for 8 hours a day basically plugged into the computer churning jobs out. Automation has been making progress but is still a while away from taking away this job (which rightly should be done by robots). It's a job which also isn't conductive to socialising, unfortunately, which would at least lighten the feeling of oppression a bit.

The burnout has made me depressed and suicidal. I presented to the psych ward two months ago. Been able to access psych help but it is very slow and not much progress. And the antidepressants, well, I stopped them because they gave me insomnia and caused me to be exhausted, which made my life twice as hard as it should be. 

I successfully got off alcohol last year (chronic alcoholic) but now I'm drinking heavily again because I just hate my job. I feel trapped. I need that job, with its shit pay, to afford my rent and power and food. Tempted to quit next week.

I can no longer accept cuts in my pay because I simply finished a job too quick and told to go home. I can't accept a bully manager or one micromanaging 15 minutes of a so called ""flexible schedule"". I won't accept coworkers being ridiculed by others. I will not work one minute over if not getting paid for that minute. I lost my naive and innocent outlook.

I sort of knew it all before or else I wouldn't have held off working until my late 20s. I lived in a bubble of family and college for a long time. I dreaded the thought of typical work, but I still entered workforce with a optimistic outlook. I did the minimum wage restaurant job, did commission sales at retail, stocked shelves, physical labor ""manly"" jobs, drove here and there, did the 9-5 at a pretencious educational facility, etc..

188,Do any of you feel allergic to society because you can't find peace with work? Are any of you older than 30 that find yourselves here?,"I don't even have boredom as an excuse, though that's obvious.

In two years, I was fired from several temp jobs; superfluous for some; late; unlucky. 

In two, bosses just decided I was stupid, no matter what I did. In one of them, I know anxiety made me dumb. In another, a younger teammate fucked up shared assignments; I was blamed. It was that simple. My employer actively encouraged and condoned bullying too. 

If any of you are underemployed or you're another living joke of a grad with the ""useless"" degree whose entire life has no value you might know what I'm talking about.

I think the worst thing is, I'm a quiet, awkward, low stamina person. I'm not unfriendly but I garble. There are moments in interviews or conversing with others where I viscerally feel sweaty and twitch with anxiety/fatigue while smiling.

That's enough. 

That, and course, coming into work being too old to be as low value as you are.

I am antiwork for many reasons but I think the incredible hostility to training if you are not ""chosen"" is the worst of them. 

That and the 8:30-6 schedule, which...it's humiliating and an admission like a crime. I physically can't do it without wanting to kill myself every day. 

That's enough to be totally unemployable in most of America and most jobs, frankly. It's also enough if you don't have a lenient boss  to be deemed a bad apple. 

It's funny - that's my big vice. 

In the office where I was blamed for every mistake a young, nasty, bratty coworker made and treated like a fucking imbecile even when I did more than my share of a project correctly, my bosses fell in live with a literal ex convict who harassed me repeatedly and gossiped ruthlessly. 

If you relate I'm listening. I'm venting here because the despair and anxiety while I recover is like the perpetual need to vomit up my own...self. Past. Life. 

If I were likable, attractive, and the sort of person that could actually be trained through failure/problem solving - the ideal way to grow as an employee...I would still dislike this. I would still think capitalism is a fucking evil scam, especially now, a threat to citizen well-being and democracy. A poisonous con where human beings are commanded to compete with machines as you travel down the ladder and abused on that basis. Humiliated. Expected to do three jobs under one title for 1/3 the salary of what they would have earned - with training! - before the recession. 

But I could hide. I might foster a little personhood for myself. 

This is my entire life, especially I am very, very old (30) and still treated as entry level with no real way to gain new skill (continuing ed courses are treated as shit and worse....some of us really need a classroom/someone to ask questions of).

I even went as far as directly expressing my concern to the State Manager about this ""cluster"" only to have nothing done about it; I expected at least a workplace counselor.

I strongly believe there's a case negligence in duty of care but have no idea on what steps to take to have it investigated. I know there are others that still work there that are having to deal with similar issues as myself because of how this business operates and I want people to know.

197,What makes you hate work? What were you doing before you came to this sub? How many of you have experienced unemployment?,"I'll be frank, I'm probably older than a lot of you.

I graduated ten years ago, spent many years in grad school and getting paid minimum wage and burnt out before I could finish my degree. I was in early childhood, held in contempt even more than other teaching. 

I was steered into it when I was batshit crazy by a parent who panicked and also...was and remains psychologically abusive. 

I am ashamed of my entire life. The last time I felt like any ""self"" I had got a voice during my day to day life or felt equal with other people - and close - was high school. 

My college degree is useless. The real sick joke is that in the years since, I can see that even the side employable skills like Excel were offered to business school students at my alma mater...they sure as fuck weren't in my major, even though I was in the social sciences and took a stats class (all since forgotten and my weak point). 

I'm...pretty dumb. And I accept it. I think of myself as somewhat thoughtful emotionally. It's not a virtue valued socially, it's not interesting, and it's not employable.

Coding is employable. Being really strong quantitatively is employable everywhere. Being able to grasp a mathematical concept, knowing how to invest, being able to turn b.s. into...that's employable.


I never had that acumen but I'm not particularly good at anything else. 

Society and all of happiness is based off of living up to others' designations of your worth. It goes beyond capitalism, but I am completely ill-suited to capitalism, especially now. I am not physically hearty, for a skilled trade; I think jobs that require people to be off their feet for more than two hours are literally torture. (Nurses might have to endure that, but there is no reason someone working in retail shouldn't get a stool.)

Even if it's inevitable a lot of jobs will suck because the demand for certain skills change - it is too embarrassing to admit that about yourself. 

- I hate that nothing I can do is valued enough even for me to be trained or kept around, something I wonder if any of you experience. I'm not just anti work because work sucks - I'm anti work because I don't belong anywhere, in a capitalistic society. 

It wasn't for lack of effort but the effort came too late and it's flawed.

- I hate the stench unemployment carries. It is beyond humiliating being a contractor and having nothing but that on a resume - insulted by the same sorts of recruiters you enrich - when you are out of school. In 2018, my temp experience is comparable to a criminal record. If they were internships, and I were 22, it might be different. I have had recruiter after recruiter tell me I'm a piece of garbage after milking my resume for leads or wasting my time with interviews and then never calling back. 

Even when I think, ""hey, this was real work for *someone*""...each time I look for work again (and I'll have to) - I don't have a resume. If your experience isn't valued, your resume is a list of sins and failures. A confession. 

- I hate...the ageism I feel burning on me. I have no time left. My health is shit  - it feels like a roadblock to getting a salesforce cert or studying to get into a bootcamp or an MBA (ha); I am anxious and just *can't do it*. I can't even begin.

If I have get in what I worry about is failure. 

The only jobs I can get are worthless, benefit-less, come with no security whatsoever (even less than so many perm jobs), and pay shit. This year for the first time the simple effect of sitting in a frigid office and a shit chair left me with back, shoulder and hand pain I spent all week with. It's frightening - I know what a privilege it is to sit.

- I hate the 9-5. 8:30-6:30. 8-6, with a mandatory, unpaid lunch. 
In America, unless you're a programmer, if you can't do that schedule and you haven't earned the right to come in later, you're a fucking lowlife. And honestly, even 10 can be rough, depending on your commute. 

My boss tolerated me coming in at 10:15; I stayed late. She hated it and I get why. It meant she didn't invest in me, and even though she told me otherwise, it made me easy to fire with the other four people let go from a team of ten. She gave me nine months. I'm still grateful but I know I'm back at square one. I'm horrified at my own physical weakness. 

Waking up, being cognizant, pushing through the mix of fatigue, loneliness, anxiety, and unfocusedness (that guiding this post) to put on makeup, drink coffee, shit, pee fifty times, and sweatily jog to the subway (and deal with any fun surprises with that) - it is the worst part of working to me. The fucking worst. 


I hate that my biological clock puts me to sleep at 1am, wakes me up at 11am, and makes the 9-6 schedule an actual physical torture. If I say that out loud anywhere (maybe eve here) - you're told you're a weak, lazy piece of shit with no character. 

...I don't think I am. But in a system where other people are told the workday starts at 9am, and they can do that...of course I feel like one. I'm made one. 

- I hate the fucking indignity of the open office. The paranoia. Everyone can watch you be slighted. And you can watch how people that are valued are treated. Totally unable to relax, to glower. I felt myself being watched every time I got up to drink coffee and pee.

- I hate how much of work is social performance. I realize constant, grinding fatigue makes small talk and just retaining information so much harder. 

Choosing to come in for the later shifts when given the option and even then inevitably being late - five minutes, ten minutes, fifteen minutes- makes me seem like a criminal, and makes me feel like one. I get it - it's important to be on time. 

The longer I stay in a job, going to sleep in pain and waking up in more pain, the harder it was. That actually is humiliating.

Needless to say, 90% of the misery is based off the sheer physical expectation attached to work in capitalism. 

- And finally - I hate the loneliness of work.

198,"My Job Requires Unpaid Weekly ""Meetings""","For context, I live in Canada. 

Anyway I started this job about 3 months ago, full time, $17/h, benefits, not bad. Except now my supervisor is making mandatory unpaid meetings every Thursday morning. So now I have to be up an extra 30 minutes early for a shift that was already early to begin with so I can basically volunteer my time to listen to things that could easily be said in an email. 

Recently I joked to my coworkers that I was going to put that on my resume under ""Volunteered Work"" and they all started saying how my generation (I'm the youngest there) had a bad work ethic and that I was just lazy. Does it make me lazy for not wanting to give up my recreational time to go to bed early so I can work for free? I have a family, friends, things to do outside of work. Even if it's one day a week why should I give all that up when I'm already at my workplace 40 hours a week? In my opinion it's only work if you get paid for it.

I don't love or even like my job by any means, it's just what I could get for the time being, and I don't plan on working there forever so I'm not going to say anything to my boss. The business is fairly small so it's not like upper management doesn't know and isnt okay about it. I just wanted to see what other people thought about this.

199,A Rant From a 22 Year Old,"Hey everyone, I'm new to this sub but these are ideas I've agreed with for as long as I can remember. I have actually thought about work and ""progress"" a lot since then and these are a few things I've come to the conclusion of (so far). I'm really open minded and open to discussion on any of them!

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary: True progression is not being achieved currently, due to crab in a bucket mentality, and lack of knowledge as to other options. Movements like what this subreddit promotes will help heal the people and make the world a much better place.**

&amp;#x200B;

* We are not *truly* progressing as a society even with all of our hours we are putting in.
   * Contrary to what I've heard before, having more children is not progression as a species. Living longer lives is not necessarily progression either. What does it matter if you live for 70 years? Especially after 50+ of those years spending 5/7 days for someone else? By the time you have any amount of money saved up and can stop working your body is already one leg in the grave, not to mention your mind. 
   * We essentially live until we get to the point that we lose our minds and then are subject to relentless marketing (infomercials, gambling, alcohol). More and more people are being born into this system and see absolutely none of the good stuff when its good, but still have to experience all of the bad when its bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

* People are usually bitter to you if you do not work and they do.
   * I just came back home after being on the road for a couple of months. I've been having car trouble and because of the holidays I haven't been able to get my car in the shop for a while, so I'm staying at my parents place (on the floor.) My mother and father have an oddly strong work ethic considering how they are when they are off of work, but for a bit of background ever since I've turned 16 they've been hounding me to get a job so I could buy stuff even though I had just about everything I could ever need.  They make a crazy amount of money yet growing up I remember they would always say how they couldn't buy stuff because we were living paycheck to paycheck. My dad wakes up at 4 and then gets ready and after his commute he gets to work at 7. He usually comes home around 6 and then proceeds to get drunk. 
      * In this little anecdote (which I've also had confirmed to me by asking my friends about their parents) I'm trying to say how it's obvious they are both unhappy and in need of some form of escape, yet they think work is the only way forward. If work really was good, where would the yelling come from? Where would the alcoholism, divorce rate, and drug use rate (including prescription) come from? 

&amp;#x200B;

* People expect work to be unpleasant.
   * Of course, at some points work can be hard, and uncomfortable. This is the process of growth and it would be just as wrong to do something that didn't make you a little bit uncomfortable. And at the end of the day work is still *work,* but for some reason it really doesn't sit right with me to have a real person working a completely unproductive job. It's essentially a mental prison where you get to distract your mind from your shitty life in exchange to be able to go home after confinement to relax and stuff yourself to get some energy for the next day. Think of all of the time for art and social interaction and searching for meaning we could have if we just worked less? It's a lot harder to be impatient when you actually have an abundance of time and patience is something everybody could work on.

&amp;#x200B;

* For men especially and  increasingly for women, a lot of people will think less of you if you work an ""unprestigious"" job. 
   * I'm really happy right now. I have a beautiful girlfriend, I've been on a roadtrip for a while and just working minimally for food, and I've been getting a lot of time for all the things I love (reading, writing, making friends). Yet on at least two occasions people have criticized my life decisions because they aren't societally ideal (no college, no job, no desire for success). And don't get me wrong, I respect the opinion of each of these people and have been looking to see how I can improve, but I can tell these aren't the happiest people. It's a common thing I've noticed, people give you weird looks if you are ever walking around and smiling or laughing. People go like ""Why the fuck is that guy so happy?"" It's a polarizing thing but unhappy people tend to create more unhappy people in my experience. Because of that I have always tried my hardest to be as positive and kind as possible to everyone I meet and to not let any negative person drag me down. People are deeply sad right now even if not obvious, movements like these are going to be what hopefully starts the healing of our countries spirit.

A final little note:

&amp;#x200B;

This is probably not the coherent, I didn't write this with any structure in mind so excuse the rambling bits but I hope the message rings clear. Work is increasingly becoming less and less of the answer as our work moves away from directly satisfying survival needs. We find no great long term joy in being a grocery clerk bagger. What we find joy in is making a deep connection, teaching someone or being taught, finding love, having a family.

203,Being lied to by older generations,"So I had a bit of a fight with my mother yesterday, both of my parents are late Baby Boomers/early Gen X, and I wrote out why I've been angry for months to them. Essentially, stating that I've been lied to: having a college degree is necessary to get a good job and setting yourself apart, that working hard and playing by the rules will reap rewards, that staying loyal to a company will benefit me.

&amp;#x200B;

But it's all a lie, or a scam at least. Sure, you need an education to be proficient in certain fields, but with the amount of debt you accrue will put you back years before you can save up, invest, or work on building yourself. As degrees become more common, it is harder to market yourself as different, so it comes to networking-which I feel benefits people who are already rich or with social capital. I'm not fond of networking either: it is forced and fake from my experience. And that doesn't even guarantee you anything. Staying loyal to a company doesn't mean much nowadays, pay raises aren't as high as they used to be, wages are stagnant compared to the standard of living, and you sometimes will be stuck with retail/fast food jobs for college graduates. That's not even considering jobs may force you to start part time and earn your way to full time or that even entry-level jobs require years of experience in the field to even be considered.

&amp;#x200B;

And their response, to be hopeful and keep my head up. That my life will turn around. That my generation struggles with being patient and feeling we are owed something. But things are worse and continue to get worse. People my age are starting to get on their feet and be independent in their 30s while previous generations could start in their early 20s with less debt and a higher wage considering inflation. I just feel stuck in my current situation because it will take several years before I can comfortably say I can live on my own-which I crave because I like being independent.

I was hired on as their social media marketer and to revamp their website- At first I really liked the job,  because it was different than my horrible and draining service job.

She would only pay $10 an hour, which is $1.75 under minimum wage, She always flaked on meetings and often changed due dates that had been agreed upon for months( Looking back, I realized she’d always flake out on payment schedules. She’d pay me for craft and trade shows, but she only paid me twice in six months for t online work) I was supposed to travel to a major trade show with her at the end of this month, and she wanted me to make a full wholesale catalogue for said show. We agreed on the 15th of January for completion. I had finally taken photos of ALL of her stock, did inventory, etc, and started to put the book together. I couldn’t find any free programs and she told me that I would have to pay the $45 myself for the software. Big red flag. I told her I couldn’t afford to do that. She said she’d pay but she wanted it done by Tuesday. This women that I thought was my friend refused to give me even a one day extension, despite knowing I also work full time.

210,Alan Watts - What if money was no object?,,False,adscjo,RollRollParry,https://youtu.be/hNT7ObhMHas,2,1
211,Short text from Alan Watts,"...""So this goes very deep into us. It goes deep, deep, deep into a problem we have about guilt. I wonder often if there's any relationship between guilt and gold - that the love of money is the root of evil. It's a very true saying. Because you see I was saying yesterday that the difference between having a job and having a vocation is that a job is some unpleasant work you do in order to make money, with the sole purpose of making money. And there are plenty of jobs because there is still a certain amount of dirty work that nobody wants to do and that therefore they will pay someone to do it. There is essentially less and less of that, that kind of work because of mechanization. But if you do a job, if you do a job with the sole purpose of making money, you are absurd. Because if money becomes the goal, and it does when you work that way, you begin increasingly to confuse it with happiness - or with pleasure.

Yes, one can take a whole handful of crisp dollar bills and practically water your mouth over them. But this is a kind of person who is confused, like a Pavlov dog, who salivates on the wrong bell! It goes back you see to the ancient guilt that if you don't work you have no right to eat; that if there are others in the world who don't have enough to eat, you shouldn't enjoy your dinner even though you have no possible means of conveying the food to them. And while it is true that we are all one human family and that every individual involves every other individual... while it is true therefore we should do something about changing the situation."" ~Alan Watts...",False,acilz6,rook11111,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/acilz6/short_text_from_alan_watts/,9,1

The truth is - I'm an older millennial. 

I'm supposed to be senior in a career; I never started one. I graduated into the recession and a series of fear-based decisions means I am a perpetual temp...if I'm lucky. My psychological and physical health get worse; I live in perpetual fear of being without health coverage (I am poor enough to have state insurance this year). I live in fear of tripping the wire. 

Even in an essay like this, I feel invisible. I would kill to be 25 and making 50k a year and paralyzed by errands. 

I am, from shitty, minimum-wage jobs where a snitty, shitty recruiter a decade my junior pockets half of my wages and my benefits so an employer can cut me loose in six months.

Anyhoo - https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work?utm_source=dynamic&amp;utm_campaign=bffbbuzzfeedreader&amp;ref=bffbbuzzfeedreader


I think it covers anxiety about work, image, and how those are linked very well. I think about both constantly.

The importance of working in American life just as part of a social narrative is something that has tormented me for a long time and she talks about it eloquently here too. 

Some key paragraphs, after she talks about social media and the exhortation to ""brand"" oneself - 

""the more work we do, the more efficient we’ve proven ourselves to be, the worse our jobs become: lower pay, worse benefits, less job security. Our efficiency hasn’t bucked wage stagnation; our steadfastness hasn’t made us more valuable. If anything, our commitment to work, no matter how exploitative, has simply encouraged and facilitated our exploitation. We put up with companies treating us poorly because we don’t see another option. We don’t quit. We internalize that we’re not striving hard enough. And we get a second gig. 

[...]

One of the ways to think through the mechanics of millennial burnout is by looking closely at the various objects and industries our generation has supposedly “killed.” We’ve “killed” diamonds because we’re getting married later (or not at all), and if or when we do, it’s rare for one partner to have the financial stability to set aside the traditional two months’ salary for a diamond engagement ring. We’re killing antiques, opting instead for “fast furniture” — not because we hate our grandparents’ old items, but because we’re chasing stable employment across the country, and lugging old furniture and fragile china costs money that we don’t have. We’ve exchanged sit-down casual dining (Applebee’s, TGI Fridays) for fast casual (Chipotle et al.) because if we’re gonna pay for something, it should either be an experience worth waiting in line for (Cronuts! World-famous BBQ! Momofuku!) or efficient as hell.

Even the trends millennials have popularized — like athleisure — speak to our self-optimization. Yoga pants might look sloppy to your mom, but they’re efficient: You can transition seamlessly from an exercise class to a Skype meeting to child pickup. We use Fresh Direct and Amazon because the time they save allows us to do more work.

This is why the fundamental criticism of millennials — that we’re lazy and entitled — is so frustrating: We hustle so hard that we’ve figured out how to avoid wasting time eating meals and are called entitled for asking for fair compensation and benefits like working remotely (so we can live in affordable cities), adequate health care, or 401(k)s (so we can theoretically stop working at some point before the day we die). We’re called whiny for talking frankly about just how much we do work, or how exhausted we are by it. But because overworking for less money isn’t always visible — because job hunting now means trawling LinkedIn, because “overtime” now means replying to emails in bed — the extent of our labor is often ignored, or degraded.""

It's long but good.

213,Just read this AntiWork post and I have a few question regarding the comments and such,"Just found this post (linked below) and I decided to read all he comments to see what it’s all about. I recently finished a MacroEconomics course so naturally this topic relates closely to what I just finished studying.

The point the OP seems to be trying to make is that when , the buying power of a group of people increases by way of an increase in wages, the buying power of those who did not receive the same increase percentage-wise will actually decrease. According to the MacroEconomic standards, this is because at $X/hr, Mr. Johnny Appleseed can afford product A at $D. But if Mr. Johnny Appleseed’s wages increase to $Y/hr, he could still afford product A at $D with much more leftover.

Or at least, that’s how you think it would work. See, the producers of product A have workers too. They have minimum wage workers who also had their wages raised to $Y/hr. And it’s not like product A is some super valuable and desirable product. Just because people can buy more of it doesn’t necessarily mean that they will. So the money to cover the cost of paying higher salaries has to come from somewhere, and more often then not, that money comes in the form of an increase in prices. So product A is longer being sold at price $D, it is now sold at price $F. So now, the people who were making $X/hr and could only afford so much of product A at price $D are now making $Y/hr and and afford about the same amount of product A as before when it’s sold at price $F.

Meanwhile Mrs. Jane Doe over here who saw no change whatsoever to her salary of $Z/hr now has to purchase product A at price $F instead of $D. Her buying power is now worth less than before because the price increased but the wages did not because the employer couldn’t afford it. They already have other minimum wage employees and those mandatory raises are nearly bankrupting the company. They can’t afford to give raises that match the inflation in prices, so those who were making $Z/hr now have less buying power altogether.

Apply this same process to the entire economy, from grocery stores to to the housing market, and that’s basically how inflation works.

All of that seems to be specifically what the OP was trying to argue, regardless of how eloquent he was or wasn’t. I do also see the side of those corporations whose CEO’s hoard moneys away like a squirrel with nuts. They should be recirculating the money they make to increase the economy’s success in growing. I 100% agree. However, we cannot force then to do so anymore than we can force our neighbors to spend their own savings just to boost the economy. Unfortunately, if we want to see change, we have to be the change ourselves.

My question now is: Even though wage increases are good things, is there a better way to bring about wage increases than forcing employers to pay them? I ask this because in some cases, employers have had to fire other employees just to keep doors open and some have even gone bankrupt already. The place I work at is struggling already and I actually fear for my job at this point. The large corporations who are hedge funded can handle all of this, but small family-owned business are suffering hard because they can’t employees enough people to maintain there businesses.

That’s all folks.

Although it was caused by many things, I can say without a doubt that the main culprit was **jobs**. Solely being seen as a tool, constantly being disrespected, my life outside of work (better known as: **MY REAL LIFE**) not being taken seriously, being threatened and talked down to, getting injured from the job and once again not being taken seriously, being surrounded by fakers and masks, the list goes on...I had put up with these things for so long that eventually I came to just view them as ""normal"", and the ""adult life"".

I had been caged. 

The job was all I thought about, my life wasn't even mine anymore. I was always worried about what ~~my wannabe masters~~  the managers/supervisors/employees thought of me. Doing absolutely ridiculous and degrading things just for the sake of trying to get them to think well of me. In my worthless pursuit for their ""love"", I had totally lost myself. 

My passions: gone. 

My joy: gone.

My happiness: gone.

My loves: gone.

My peace: gone.

My creativity: gone.

My ambitions: gone.

My life: gone

My self: gone.

But my ""loyalty"" and ""dedication"" to these jobs stayed. Coincidence? I don't believe so. 

The system is built to slowly make jobs all human beings think about. Who cares about all that other stuff in your life? It's not going to make your employer richer. You are just a tool, a pawn in the game.

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed that no matter how kind I tried to be with the people at these jobs, the end result was the still the same. They didn't think any higher of me and they still repeated the same behavior at the end of the day.  But, like the fool I was I just blamed myself for that. I would call myself a loser and that I should take the blame. I mean, the job was everything to me, and the people there were the greatest ever. If they still looked down on me, then that means I must be a total failure...

&amp;#x200B;

# NO.

&amp;#x200B;

The exact day that I left that job, I swear to you all that the light had finally started its fight against the darkness. It amazes me to this day that that was all I needed to open my eyes, a detachment. I began realizing EVERYTHING about how foolish I was. I realized that those people were not my friends, I realized that I was my own person, I realized that I was free, I realized what life really was. And thankfully, I began remembering everything about myself. I reclaimed everything, from my passions, to my old friends, to my hobbies, to my favorite TV shows! I got myself back! 

And now, two years later, it's only gotten better. I now know that jobs are simply a means of getting money. That is it. I don't invest any feelings, passion, or attachment of any sort into them. If I'm there, I do only what the job entails, treat people with basic levels of respect, and get out of there. Nothing more. I keep my life defended from every job, never allowing them to trespass into it. Honestly, if I'm not clocked in, my mind is completely void of all things related to a job. I will never allow them to control me again.

The reason being that my life is literally everything. It's all I have, and there's no way that I'm going to let it be tainted because of a few greedy individuals who only care about how much work I can do for them at the end of the day.

To all of you reading, I encourage you to do the same. Reclaim your mind, and your life. Stop calling days that you're not being used your ""days off"", these are just your days. Stop calling your nights of comfort in your home and space ""work nights"" and filling your mind with dread related to a job; don't even give them that power over you. And stop going to a job expecting to find your life's purpose or ""second home""; I can't imagine someone ever finding those things in a place they're only at for money :) 

&amp;#x200B;

Your life is yours!

I've told my family that I hate the idea of working and don't want a typical 9-5 job but they all think I'm mad or just lazy and lack motivation. Why would I have motivation to waste my entire life working for people who don't care about me? I just want to be free to do what I want. But you can't do much without money. I don't want to live at home for the rest of my life, but I don't know what else to do instead. I do graphic design so freelancing is an option, but even the thought of that sounds depressing to me. I just feel stuck.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3dvvep/misery\_in\_terms\_of\_40\_hour\_work\_week/](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3dvvep/misery_in_terms_of_40_hour_work_week/)

&gt;You and me, I think we're the exact fucking same.  
I have an hour long commute. I have to wake up at 5 am, leave at 6 am, and be in by 7. I leave at 3 pm, and make it home at 4. I have to go to bed at 9 pm in order to wake up the next day not feeling like tired shit because the human body is a disgustingly inefficient thing.  
The instant I get home at 4:30 pm, my mind goes into timer mode. I start counting the hours, the minutes, sometimes even the seconds. I have exactly four and a half hours to do things I want to do before I have to go back to the slog the next day. I need to cram that time with as much of the things I want to do as possible.  
My weekends are the same. I wake up, and I start counting. Saturdays are less of a problem usually because I can wake up when I want and go to sleep whenever I want, but it's still there casting a shadow over everything. I get one day. One day out of seven where I don't feel stressed about waking up when I have to and sleeping when I have to. And when Saturday starts, I have twelve or fourteen or sixteen hours before Sunday. When Sunday starts, I have until 9 pm until my weekend is over.  
When the forty-hour work week starts to get to you like it does to me, you start feeling stifled for time, and the paycheck you receive starts feeling worthless, because it's not like you can use that money to buy the time back.  
This is your life, ending one hour, one minute, one second at a time, for forty hours a week. Maybe even more.  
If anyone asks you out, whether it's your SO or your friends, your parents, anyone, even if your relationships with them are happy and healthy, your brain can't help but make an automatic calculation. How much of my time will this take? How much will I have left until I have to go back to work? And when even the slightest thing goes wrong--if you forgot to get something at the store, if there's traffic, if someone makes a mistake and costs you more time, you start to resent it. You resent that delay, and the people who caused that delay, for wasting the precious free time you have, and every hour, every minute, every second that slips away is time that you don't get to spend doing the things you want to do.  
Things you used to enjoy no longer provide the same fulfillment, because you can't stop that clock. You can't stop counting the hours, the minutes, the seconds. Even if you're enjoying yourself, even if you're having a blast and accomplishing a lot, even if at the end of the day you feel like a champion who is closer to your dream, that shadow is there, telling you that *you only have this many hours, this many minutes, this many seconds left until you go back*. Like a guillotine slowly inching its way towards your neck. And when you're having fun, that realization causes you to get jerked back into the real world.  
Hey, fucker. Have a good time? I hope you did, because it's another forty hours until you can even start to get it back. Now start lifting, jackass. Your life doesn't become yours until we say it does.  
My job doesn't suck. The work is nothing special, if a little tiring, but it's not murdering me. I work at a good company, my co workers are good people, my boss is a pretty understanding guy who always tries to be fair and helps out whenever he can. My pay isn't anything stellar but it's liveable, and some people would envy having it ($20 an hour).  
But I get the sense that I'd feel like this with the vast majority of work. Forty hour work weeks, no matter what, get tedious, become meaningless, burn me out. The only way I can avoid it is to not work a day in my life--to do a job that I love. But how many people get jobs they love? How many people get paid liveable wages, enough to have a room and food, doing what they love? How many people even *know* what it is that they love to even pursue it in the first place?  
The fact that the starving artist is a running joke in America--someone going hungry trying to do what they love--is the cruel reality. And the fact that we're okay with it and point and laugh with everyone else, even fake laughter, is the cruelest reality imaginable.  
You want to do what you love? Fuck you. That's not how the real fucking world works, shitheel. Now hop to it, you've got forty hours of work to do, and if you want to fucking eat, you better fucking do it.  
I'm reminded of that movie *In Time*, starring Justin Timberlake. It's a movie about a dystopian future where money has no more meaning, and people trade time. A coffee might cost thirty seconds, a cab fare might cost two minutes, a high quality mountain bicycle might be four months, a new sedan might be nine years.  
There's a watch everyone has embedded in their arm that tells them how much time they have, and when the number reaches zero, they die. Some people have hundreds of years of time. Some people live minute to minute.  
That's what I feel like. That some people have the rest of their lives to look forward to, with their 90 years of time, and here I am, scraping by with only a few hours on my clock every day before the clock hits zero and I die.  
And in America, you can't talk to anyone about it. Nobody at all. Not really. Because even if some individual people might sympathize and wish they had less working hours alongside you, society will think of you as a lazy piece of shit who just wants to mooch off of others. All because you're not willing to surrender forty hours a week, one hundred and sixty hours a month, one thousand nine hundred and twenty hours a year for a paycheck. And you have to convince yourself that you need this paycheck, that you need this money in order to not get fucked in the ass by taxes and bills. You try, you try so *hard* to justify it. You need this money. You need to give up these forty hours to live. This is necessary. You try.  
But it doesn't work. Not really. Not until it's too late.  
I've been trying to search for a job where I can work from a home office. But for someone like me, there's no options. Everything requires more schooling, more experience, and getting schooling or experience requires time and money I don't have and can't get. And even then, I've only been at this job for a few months. I can't quit yet because I need to stay long enough for it to look good on my resume.  
I know drugs will make it worse. Alcohol will make it worse. The most I can do is try to anesthetize myself with the activities that I used to like, activities that used to give my life meaning and purpose. I used to enjoy these things, but now the most these things can give me--these things I used to love and enjoy--is a distraction. A temporary illusion that I'm not miserable, which wears off at 9 pm every day.

240,The perspective of a teenager who's discovering the reality of jobs,"A little bit of context: I'm 18, finished high school in 2017, I'm currently a student and I'm not from the US (I'm from Argentina) I come from a family where no one works 8 hours or more a day and everyone has at least a month of vacations. My mom works at a school 5 hours a day with two-months vacations. She has like 10 free days (besides sick days) My dad would be the exception  because he's a trucker so when he travels he pretty much works all day, but he also gets to spend months without working. No one close works at a private company (maybe because there aren't many where I live), they either work for the government or are independent, and they don't experience much stress. I used to go to school for 4 hours a day, and had almost four months of vacation, not to mention that there were plenty of ""missed days"". It was pretty cool and I loved to spend my time pursuing my hobbies and doing things I enjoyed. 

For most of my life I imagined work as something you did for 4-5 hours a day with at least one month of vacation. But some time ago I was at university and looked at the IT job offers (out of curiosity, because I luckily don't need a job) for private companies, and all of them were a 9 to 6 (with one hour of lunch). Not only that, but the vacation offered was only two-weeks long in most cases. I investigated more on the internet about people working at such companies, and some people mentioned working extra hours, or being called about work-related stuff when they're at home. I was shocked. I discovered that this is pretty much the norm at most private companies in my country. And now that I'm paying more attention to people mentioning jobs on Reddit, it's almost always a 9 to 5 job, and usually at companies. I also keep hearing about it in movies and videos, reading about in articles. I thought ""how is this just considered the normal thing to do?"" I'm starting to think this is even more common in the U.S., maybe it's because you have a lot of companies there, and companies tend to have that type of schedule? How rare are part-time jobs there? 

I feel like I discovered a part of the adult world I was unaware of before, and it's honestly sad. How do people even find time to do all house chores, hang out with friends/S.O, go to the gym, pursue a hobby, etc? Maybe for young single people it's doable, but I can't imagine how people with kids find enough time. 

I guess a lot of people would call me naive or spoiled by complaining about this, but I really can't imagine myself being at work from 9 to 6. Unless you're extremely passionate about what you do, it doesn't seem good. I actually mentioned it to my parents and they agreed that it's too much. My mom even adviced me to avoid full-time jobs. I just hope I can find part-time jobs, since I don't think not working is an option. 

 I agree with the ideas presented in this subreddit, it would better if we had an option not to work at all, but I think that if most people could at least work less hours and in better environments, it would much more bearable and there would be much less stress. Some people may be happy working, and that's ok, but I don't think it's what we're ALL meant to do. Some people may even like working +8 hours a day, and it's ok, but I definitely don't think we should all do it. Everyone has different rhythms, different tastes, different needs, and it doesn't make sense to try to force everyone into the same type of life.

241,Paying it forward - work from home job UK residents only.,"Hi all. Wanted to contribute something cuz there's no way I would hold information if it could help other people if they are suffering. 

I'm basically working a job from home, so it's UK based only and yes you will have to send documents to prove that. 

Anyway, you can work 4 or 6 hours per day and it's super easy work (you just call up people and ask them questions and 70% are happy to take part, no one is rude to you, you're not selling anything) where you can pretty easily earn about £14-15 an hour. Only commitment is you must work 3 days a week and it's mainly evening work so work 5-9pm.

I won't lie it's not life fulfilling but it's definitely not like 99% of the other soul sucking bollocks I've ever had to do. It won't make you 'rich' money wise but it will do if you consider time a more valuable asset and not whoring yourself out too hard to achieve it. 

It's the best I've found for now anyway. 

If anyone is interested in the details please just message below and PM me too so I don't miss it. I'm happy to share the details if it helps someone who's struggling and needs such a change.

243,Adding my ramble to the mix,"I took a degree in archaeology that, while I don't regret it, it's considered useless since it can't be used for profit unless I assist oil and gas in destroying the environment, and destroying historical sites. Non O&amp;G jobs only open up if you have a masters and if someone dies/retires so I don't have much of a chance, and I can't afford a masters nor did I get good enough marks or have enough experience. 

I've spent 4 years at this dead end job unrelated to my degree, being absolutely shit on by all but one manager, working my ass off while I'm told to be grateful for a $1 raise above minimum wage after 4 fucking years. I do the work of 2-3 people because no one else will, or I spend the slow days here staring at a fucking screen, wasting my time, when I could be at home doing shit that actually matters to me. I'm exhausted with nothing to show for it, because all my money goes to basic needs, and helping my family not end up homeless. 

I've hated every job I've had prior to this. I try to change jobs and I get absolutely no call backs. Everything requires you to pay through the fucking nose for certifications for apprenticeships, when what they'd teach you in school is what they're supposed to be teaching as part of an apprenticeship. I'm so fucking sick of having to pay an atrocious amount just to be able to work to make money to pay off those debts.

But I'm at the point now where I'm questioning what the point is, when I'll undoubtedly hate that next job eventually too, and to get out of this system I'd have to work my ass off to save to be able to afford something like starting a commune or something

I feel so stuck and I have no idea how to get out of this, short of suicide. Everything is so fake, and I'm constantly wondering why I can't just be a happy little consumer, eagerly earning my pittance wages so I can buy the next cool thing. The people who surround me are happy with that. It's to the point I don't even want to see my friends because I'm fed up with the discussion of ""what should I buy next?"" by my rich friends, and the determination my poor friends have to achieve that. No one considers that there might be something better. And everyone is too afraid of change to try to work at it. 

I'm so tired of humans devaluing anything that doesn't make profit. I'm tired of the fakeness of our society. I'm tired of these oil and gas rednecks that I have to live with corrupting everything. The yellow vest movement started here, and I was eager to join, until it turned out to be neo Nazis thinking its a world wide anti immigrant movement and an opportunity to push a pipeline down our throats. They're incapable of comprehending anything beyond their next dirty dollar.

There's no point to this post. I come to work every day and slowly get angrier as I waste my time being told to try to make the most profit I can while selling an essential medical device. It makes me fucking sick. 

Tell me how you got out of this shit pile. Or how you plan to. Or just tell me something to take my mind off the constant internal screaming that consumes me daily. ",False,adwuum,cassious64,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/adwuum/adding_my_ramble_to_the_mix/,4,1

Like many of you I graduated college and just feel like one in a million...like I’ll never be content. My view of this whole job this is that people just waste their life working and they will never have enough money. Myself, I can’t imagine working at one place for 20 or even 50 years...the longest I’ve held a job (and still going is just over a year). I have a hard time dealing with the bs. Like I work so hard and I pull my weight but other people show up late or don’t do anything and still get the same wage. I feel like there are so many jobs out there that are just “made up” for consumerism... I wish I could have a nomadic lifestyle like they did in the late 1880s. They worked in communities with these jobs that had meaning, they helped each other. They didn’t work like a dog. And then the whole revolution of the assembly line came in and ruined it all.

I feel so depressed and burnt out from working 50 hours a week walking 11 miles a day but I have so much debt from school. How can I turn this mind set around? I feel like I can’t work for these people who don’t appreciate me. I don’t know what to do anymore...I’m not lazy, that not what I’m trying to say but this whole working isn’t it for me.

New to this subreddit, so please let me know if I am breaking any rules.

As some background, I graduated college with an engineering degree last June. I have always been very hard on myself and expected near perfection in my schooling. I started working in said industry in August and I'm having a REAL tough time with... Well idk, but something about work. Idk if I'm just having trouble adjusting to the 9-5 lifestyle (which I hate, but I don't really see other options for now), or if I dislike the industry, or possibly that my depression is the root of me not liking my job.

Lately, I've been very depressed and I am finding it hard to get through even a single day of work without breaking down. I still put way to much pressure on myself to perform at work, which causes me to feel like I'm failing, which makes me more depressed, which makes me feel like I'm failing even more, etc.

277,The Gig Economy and Work,"I feel particularly motivated today to write a piece on the so-called, *Gig Economy.* Three words: Don't. Fall. For. It. I am desperate to find some kind of work soon because I need to do big things like pay rent and utilities and put food on the table so I am part of the typical demographic that companies like UberEats, GrubHub, Postmates, and others go after. They make promises of 16-18 dollars per hour which are just patently false. They make claims about being able to work whenever you want, on your schedule and time. They tout one of the benefits as being self-employed. Let's break this down a little bit further to discover the lies of respective marketing departments.

1. Self-employment: You're not actually self-employed but you're an independent contractor. You still want to carry some form of worker's compensation so if you get injured, you're taken care of. In a real self-employment situation, you would be able to set the rates at which you're willing to work. The Gig Economy sends you a job and there is no negotiating the rate at which you'll be compensated. It is a set rate at which you must take. You risk having your contract terminated if you accept a job and then cancel later. You also become the subject of gamification in which the company gives you meaningless donkey and carrot incentives which add up to scraps when compared to what the company has made at your expense.
2. 16-18 dollars per hour: Factor in the cost of gasoline, insurances (commercial insurance and workman's comp), wear and tear on your car, and you might actually be earning **less than minimum wage**. The 16-18 dollar range they quote is predicated on having no business expenses. Clever bastard from hell marketers.
3. Work Whenever You Want: No, that's not necessarily true either. You need to work when the demand is high for a service. If you work when demand is low, you're in a net loss situation.

You're better off working a terrible minimum wage job than in the gig economy. Just don't do it. ",False,acw346,IAmThe11,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/acw346/the_gig_economy_and_work/,15,1
