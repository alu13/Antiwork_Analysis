0,"[PA, USA] 3/4 rant, 1/4 advice: My restaurant is forcing a 30 hour weekly minimum or else you're terminated.",my state has recently entered the green phase  so the tgichilibees i work at reopened with less than half capacity  the gm is slowly bringing people back for dine-in  but has said that because the company received ppp money  servers must work a minimum of 30 hours per week  3 10-hour days minimum  regardless of business  no one has seen any real evidence that this is actually the case  rather it's likely corporate lying to us to ensure that the servers who work cannot file for partial benefits  i just think it's insane that i didn't even work that many hours before covid  but i have to suck it up or i lose this shitty ass job  shitty ass health insurance  and my uc benefits   that pua changed my life  man  i could pay for healthcare medicine without worry and provide for my mom without a thought    so what  a quarter of the staff works for a mystery amount of money each day at the restaurant and the other 75  gets to keep collecting till it runs out  why even act like it's a choice  if i decline your shitty offer of shitty work for shit money  i lose not only the pua money that actually pays the bills  but i lose the job too  why even pretend it's an option  once i got that phone call  i knew i was fucked  no matter how busy the restaurant could possibly be  it will still pay less than uc  let's not pretend anyone would choose to go back for less money dealing with cooped-up karens and kyles all day   it just seems like a way to make sure employees can t file for partial benefits  basically my job is saying that even if it's a dead shift  you gotta stick around for no cash  sales aren t always high for dine-in right now  so i m sure my coworkers would be able to file and receive partial unemployment if it weren t for the 30 hours minimum bullshit  i know i'm beating a dead horse on this sub because everyone who posts here says the same  but this pandemic has clearly highlighted the fact that you have to choose between you and your family's health or your livelihood or  get fucked  two american freedoms  the freedom to work or the freedom to starve  i hope y'all stay safe  healthy  and fed  any advice for my situation sanity would be appreciated  thanks  guys ,hi5n8k
1,Anybody got injured at work and now permanently disabled?,it s pathetic that i worked so hard at my last job  fedex package handler  basically slave labor and ended fucking up my back up after having to work 6 day weeks for a month  i felt like the more i was there the more i couldn t leave after putting up with it for over a year and now i realize i got used like i was nothing and now i have hardly nothing to show for it  well a mere  1100 left but that doesn t matter to me i d rather have a fully functioning fucking back again but obviously i m probably fucked for life after already dealing with this for over a year now being disabled and can t even get out the house now  sure it s my fault for picking up those boxes that lead me to hurting my back  but it wouldn t have happened to begin with if i wasn t constantly being told to work harder and harder and faster and faster  now i m living with severe backpain that s pushing me to suicide  seriously learn from my mistake and don t push yourself when someone tells you to  fuck everything ,hhfagj

3,"So many people do not understand that there are people who simply cannot work. My dad thinks his brother quit his job bc he didn’t like it just before “randomly” suffering a mental breakdown. In reality, he’s undiagnosed autistic, had worked his previous job for 30 years &amp; couldn’t cope.",my father also thinks that people can get food stamps  ssi  and medicaid simply by quitting their job  this is exactly the kind of bullshit ideology that divides disabled and or poor people from the working class  so many working people see themselves as martyrs for allegedly voluntarily poor and disabled people ,hhquv4

5,Its sad how people who get work get corrupted,just something i  unfortunately  had to observe twice now  i had two friends who claimed to hate work  they pretty much thought like anyone on this sub does  both got work because they basically were forced to and both slowly developed into your usual wageslave    it started slowly  first they where complaining about how much they hate it  then they started with  im only doing it for the money  i will quit this job as soon as i have enough  a while later it went on to  i kinda like it tbh  its nice to be needed and do your part for society  thats when you know its too late  because both started to say shit like  you should try to work at least part-time too  its cool to have more money  and lowkey insulting me with  its better than getting money for doing nothing  which is a sure sign that they feel  better  than people who are unemployed  its sad  really  im still in touch with one of them and sometimes he says it sucks being a wageslave  yet he wont quit the job without any real reason  i guess he either says it because he thinks thats what i want to hear or he simply gave in and does what people expect him to do  it sucks either way to lose friends over petty shit like that  its not like i mind people working  but stop insulting people who dont want to work  especially not when they are your friends ,hgqy3n

8,Why am I still miserable,tldr  i gotta escape the gaslighting of capitalism just out of highschool and i feel like i've been working towards an antiwork life for a long time  been working for a few years doing part time gigs but now that it's summer pandemic i feel so much pressure to go full 40   ot  it's the culture of my workplace  everyone in the warehouse constantly asks me why i'm still working 24 hour weeks and i'm sick of the shit  ive found a lifestyle that doesn't require a lot  i'll be moving into a cheap cooperative living situation in a month  and won't have a car to pay for  i feel like ive succeeded in finding the lifestyle that i want to live and yet  i feel like shit  i feel absolutely worthless for not going full time  i'm wasting my free time before school starts when i could be making more money  grinding 60 hour weeks to make more money  it's ludicrous and if i had any self respect whatsoever i wouldn't feel this way and yet  i'm stuck in this shame spiral of working part time  feeling shitty about it  not changing  feeling shittier  not that i would be happy full time  i did it for a few weeks before going back to part  it's no different  just less time to work on actually important things and a fatter minimum wage check  not worth dealing with the sexist boss  shitty air quality  possible infection  and mormons for another 16 hours a week  i get that capitalism brainwashes you but how the fuck do you fully wake up ,hiiokl

19,I know this sounds dumb as fuck but I genuinely believe memes are the key to understanding how we can collectively 'hack' The System (and prove money is a lie),we are a connected world  in 2020 more than ever    we are an absurd word  in 2020 more than ever   where are you reading this from  probably very far from  here  and yet i'm  there  in your mind  now  the inescapable and global grasp of the  internet  and our eternal engagement with it through the smartphone has been a pivotal  r evolutionary shift in human history  one more significant than our discovery of fire  agriculture  steel  or the combustion engine  we have yet to scratch the surface of its potential and power  and the deeper implications of its existence and what that reveals about us - the internet is the genesis of a global communal awakening and awareness of hidden connection   the internet and modern constantly connected culture has allowed us to act as a sort of rudimentary hive-mind  our access to  and saturation of information  media  and communication is both  constant   and   instant  - it is now  possible  to share our thoughts with almost everybody there is - our friends and family  their friends and family  people we don't know and never will  people in another country  and people who may not even share the same language as us - a single sentence spat out into the ether can potentially reach billions of people on the planet in a matter of minutes   you  me  and everybody else has a form of direct access to nearly every other human consciousness on this planet - what could we possibly use that for    memes  of course   to crowdsource the question of 'what is  good '  because that is what lies at the centre of all belief and action   the fact that we have seemingly become ever more divisive and politically polarized is therefore not to be tutted at  wished away or met with calls for civility  but rather acknowledged as the  only way  in which an outcome - truth - can be arrived at  copy itself  spread  and propagate to the point where its opposite seems wholly and utterly absurd   advocates for either a progressive or conservative approach to policy can not compromise  not  because the facts are in disagreement  although that is true  but because what comes  before  the facts is not agreed upon  that is  the way the world is structured and ordered  or  the way the world is  which itself always acts as the background for an ideology rather than the reverse  the idiom  'seeing is believing'  is true backwards as well  perhaps even more convincingly -   believing is seeing  and this is evident now more than ever   i m going to make some statements that are broad and general  but ones i feel are fairly common and often subconscious  these are not meant to be statements of   fact  only associations to get us to think about how we reach the conclusion of  fact    the relationship between progressivism and conservatism is like the relationship between masculine and feminine which is like the relationship between individual and community   consider this disharmony between two opposing  or complementary   principles as essentially the basis of all philosophical  and thus political  thought  also consider opposing principles as really a  single thing  as opposites always exist only in relation to each other  this admittedly sounds a lot like some meaningless new-age woo  but i think most of us can and do recognize the basic and fundamental necessity of this tension between opposites   we see what our minds project and what our contexts allow - we frame the world in the language we have at our disposal and what words  mean  is not something static and  in  the word itself  but something dynamic  unique to us specifically in the way we  relate  to that word   language has an implicit kind of magical quality - by that i mean much like an imagined casting of a spell  it is widely assumed that speaking the right words in the right combination  and order  can influence and compel people to act  and this action is the source of social change  this is why great orators have possessed great influence over the course of history - someone must be able to give  power  to an idea that can move masses to act as a single unified force of nature   language is itself inherently biased  limited  and divisive -  black lives matter  means absolutely nothing until it is interpreted and language is always loaded with prejudice  even and perhaps especially when great care is taken to make sure it is not  there is always a fundamental aspect of loss from translating a feeling to a thought to any  thing  else  even when the path is as seemingly direct as from thought to speech    have you ever known  exactly  what to say but been unable to get the words out properly in the moment    have you ever written and rewritten something multiple times because the exact  feeling  you re trying to capture just isn t there    as much as language is the primary way we communicate  ironically it just as often obfuscates and confuses because the kind of language we have available to us directly determines how we understand and conceptualize the world  and ourselves  it is not a matter of merely being  peterson-ianly   precise  in our speech  because precision is meaningless if the principles that precede it are incompatible   how many proponents of any ideology have  actually  read and engaged with its foundational or supporting texts    probably very few   how many have absorbed bits and pieces through their specific context - language  culture  family  friends  media  and digital memes   probably almost everybody   you simply can't exist in 2020 and not intuitively just  know  what a meme is  even those that exist totally cut-off from the online sphere would get the picture with some examples  most typically we think of images like  this https imgur com sc1nbl7  or  this https imgur com yw2quqt  but these are just some examples of the modern  digital meme and don't begin to even scratch the surface of just  exactly  what a meme is and why the answer to that might be really fucking important   for example  a picture doesn't need any text to be a meme  similarly  a picture can be  only  text and still be a meme  a phrase can be a meme  or even  a single word https vignette wikia nocookie net simpsons images c c3 d 27oh jpg revision latest cb 20141226214635  a  sound https en wikipedia org wiki wilhelm scream   symbols https en wikipedia org wiki cool s media file 22cool s 22 svg  the structure of the building you're in and the design of the device you're reading this from are memetic artifacts  musical subgenres  fashion and style trends  social patterns and institutions including family  marriage  property  law  crime and punishment - even complex ideologies - religious  political  and philosophical  all actually inseparable and arguably the same thing  - are essentially very nuanced and enduring memetic conversations that span hundreds and thousands of years   human behaviour is memetic - a product of pattern  repetition  and context rather than a series of conscious  choices  we make at every moment - this is not to suggest we are totally bound and determined by fate  only that we are bound and determined to act in accordance with our own character - we are not  something  responsible for our decisions  we  are  our decisions  and for that we bear responsibility    can you imagine donald trump acting like anything else besides a caricature of pure petulance   that s his role to play - his constitution  if it weren't he would be someone else  and here lies the crucial error that pervades all levels of society   i think the belief that he  or you  or i  make decisions  is quite backwards - it s partly a product of the language we use to speak about ourselves and the world - a confusion of the symbol with the actual thing - and partly just our basic instincts  it's plainly obvious that i am aware and can consider many possibilities and outcomes and think rather abstractly about present  past  and future  so it only seems to follow that i  must  exert some basic influence over the course of my life  but i think if we really examine that thought there s no good reason to assume that s true and necessarily follows  we might  feel  that it does  but perhaps that is a sign to be skeptical of our most basic assumptions   i find little distinction between  me  and  my choices  - i  am  those choices  not a separate entity in the pilot's seat of my skull that  chooses  - that stands separate  considers  and then finally pulls the lever that corresponds with the  choice i ve made   those last three words are superfluous - to me they all reference a single thing - a localized  happening  from my specific perspective   this idea is naturally unpalatable as it seems to absolve one of all responsibility  for both wrongdoing and ownership of good acts and artistic creations  but i think this is nothing more than a knee-jerk reaction to protect our sense of  i  as something distinct and in control  as to accept the opposite comes with a great and terrifying sense of powerlessness  this terror is multiplied further when coupled with the additional quality of randomness  and the ordinary and pervasive accepted fact of our free will  is an attempt to reconcile this powerlessness with our instinctive desire to be in control  even when faced constantly with the reality of circumstance where one life is destroyed based not on any decision or choice it was able to make  but the simple act of existing at the wrong point in time and space and colliding with the wrong other does nothing to dissuade us of this familiar and comfortable illusion   responsibility is not something we  take  it is what we  are  by sheer virtue of being   memes and the repetition of pattern connects us to something far greater than any single one of us - our  collective  human ideas about value  function  purpose  and their relation with each other - memes are a portal to the sum total of all human knowledge  experience  and feeling - memes are threads sewn into the fabric of the tapestry of reality  connecting us to the past  present  future  each other  and something totally separate - something unspeakable that yet demands to be spoken of - something that can be glimpsed only for a moment and reflected only as a fragment   you may have felt it when engaged in something everyday and ordinary  yet struck as if for the very first time by the majesty and totality of all there is - all experience happening right now  billions of distinct and separate simultaneous  happenings  - connections - disconnected only by virtue of the limitations of our own collective conceptions of what is real  what is true  and what is possible   what  is  possible   it is possible then to understand  humanity  not as an abstracted collection of billions of separate individuals  but as a single   unique happening of organism environment  that can act with that awareness of unity and underlying connection   we currently insist on persisting in an ordering of society that enriches only a small handful that have fallen to the top through nothing other than circumstance and who insist this  must  be the natural ordering of the world simply because it is the current ordering of it    can we really trust those who wield inordinate amounts of power to fairly consider how it might be meted out differently  is the fate of society directly tied to the fate of the billionaire class  or to the current institutions of governance and policing   we are meant to believe and accept that this is just  the way the world is    as far as i see it  society bears little proof of functioning properly  anywhere  as long as we define  properly  as for the common good of all people  if we instead understand  properly  as to the obscene and perverted benefit of a small few at the expense of everybody else  then it is functioning tremendously properly  and will only continue to do so until we put a stop to it   from where is authority and power actually derived   the primary source is our shared belief that these institutional structures are legitimate and just - and they are so long as we believe it    the secondary source is the ability and willingness of these structures to respond violently if we do not accept the first   violence is of course the most powerful and persuasive avenue of acquiring and maintaining power  both literal violent action and indirect violence inflicted and facilitated by a system of organization that regards the principle of one's right to hoard obscene amounts of wealth as higher and more just than an attempt to provide the basic material necessities of life for all people   that is the basic moral principle that serves as the keystone of the structure of our society  as it is currently ordered   to preserve life violence may sometimes be necessary  but violence can be avoided memetically - you cannot put a bullet in a concept and it s just as futile  and a bit if a moral grey area  to do the same to those who espouse  exemplify  or believe it  violence can be lessened with the correct memetic foundations to underpin our collective conceptions of 'self'  'other'  and 'world' and the reciprocal nature of those three things - violence is given power by distinction and separation  but that power can be neutered partly by understanding that not only are we ourself  we are also every other self  too   individualism is too often championed by those who don't understand the distinction between it and selfishness  and this error acts as the basic foundation for an entire wing of belief that insists  value  is directly related to money and money alone and  everything  can be spoken about in terms of its equivalent and assumed value in us dollars  one of many currencies that can in an instant become almost worthless due to nothing other than our shared confidence  or lack thereof  in it   so  if memes are the true catalyst of human action and social change  can we then  meme ourselves  into a better reality  can we  together  engineer  build  or construct a meme to spread and transform our shared  collective  un conscious and the ideas that follow about not only what is true   but what is possible   i think a good place to start is to understand the  illusory and mutable nature of money and wealth  their direct relationship with power  authority  and control and the distribution of these things  money is a real  thing  that performs a necessary  function  but our shared understanding of it holds real power over its form  and in this way we can collectively shape and alter that power it commands over our lives through a collective psychic exercise   we can't function without money  but we absolutely can function with a new way of distributing it in hopes of lessening  not eliminating  the amount of suffering directly related to poverty and the misery that flows from that   google   how many billionaires exist  - answer  2095    2095 problems   let's look at just one   does jeff bezos really have billions of an actual  tangible currency  or is his currency really in the form of power and influence  as represented  by money   is the standard work-week from monday to friday or monday to thursday    whatever the answer  is it because this is simply  the way the world is  or might  the way the world is  be directly shaped by our collective ideas about it   wars are no longer waged on an actual battlefield - our modern war is a psychic and spiritual one  set in the space of the collective human  un conscious  and the targets of annihilation are not only people but possibilities - the target is  truth  and the creation of truth as it serves the manufacturer - we are in an era of memetic warfare and unless we can understand that and figure out how to turn it against itself  the collective human spirit will be swallowed whole  outlived by the last piece of manufactured shit we can sell for a dollar    2095 problems and 1 crucial error  stands between us and a better society  and building that society is as simple as believing in and spreading the right memes   we can meme ourselves better  but only together   if you can believe that's true  it is ,hiq9db

34,I haven’t done any work in a week and despite trying to work my brain has completely shut down,i m working remote and have been for a while  i have to keep this vague since i m pretty sure my coworkers are on to me and they also reddit lol  so i m not sure when i shut down completely  maybe tuesday  i was going along well enough for a while    i think what really gets to me is the constant emails and messages checking on me  i m in training at this job so i don t really have my own work yet  i m just learning at the moment  we also have daily reports on our  progress  which i find incredibly draining    i feel like there is a sky high expectation  i need a license to even be allowed to do my own work  which i do not have yet  therefore  it s not like i m robbing the company of time by not getting my stuff done since there is nothing to be done until i pass my tests  i think that s about 3 months away when i m out of training    i guess i don t really feel terrible about not working but i do feel scared i could lose my job  it would be really bad since i m only 2-3 years into my career at 24  and i do not have a ton of savings yet  it would be a struggle for sure    i also feel kind of lazy and like i m worthless for not being able to get myself to do anything  i made a serious effort the last 2 days and i got nowhere  i maybe did 1-3 hours of work at a slow place the last two days  i work slow since i m still figuring it all out    i don t really know what to do so i can get my productivity high enough to not compromise my job  pretty soon my boss will start asking specific questions about the training projects i should ve completed  even though i do not like this job  i need it at least for now  i just have to hang on long enough to leave for something better  am i a terrible person  help ,hgckk3

38,Being forced to look for a job when there are no jobs,today  my mother i were talking about how the world is becoming increasingly shittier each day  she told me that i need to stop watching reading depressing news and spend my time looking for jobs and focusing on my online classes  i tell her that such a task is easier said than done because nearly half of the usa has become unemployed from all the shit going on and job prospects are very minimal   she tells me that the only thing stopping me from getting a job is my ''negative attitude'' and i would probably find a job if i was only more positive   there are no words to describe just how much i despise people who act like my mother in this situation  being positive cannot and will not change the current state of the american job market or anything for that matter but she doesn't understand that  she thinks i'm just not trying    my father believes that jobs are abundant because trump said so and the loss of jobs is a lie made up by the democrats who also apparently manufactured coronavirus solely to get trump out of office   like most people here  i hate work  i hate looking for a job but i need the money but it doesn't help when i have too insane boomers trying to encourage me with their nonsense ,hj2l90

46,My experience of a four-day workweek,i've been a long time visitor to this subreddit  and thought you all might be interested to hear what my short-term experience of working a four-day week has been     amp x200b   i applied to do a four-day-week when i started my current job  last year  my manager refused it  saying i was  too useful  to lose for a day a week  despite it being offered to me at interview  so  when my dept did nothing about social distancing measures etc  through covid  i saw my chance and got hr to approve a condensation of my hours  about a month ago     amp x200b   the reaction to my move to a 4-day-week  from my colleagues  has been one of jealousy and general disaproval  i would say  my manager acted as if i were being given a huge gift  as he signed the form grudgingly  and another colleague asked  if i was going to be doing this much longer  as if it were temporary  the trouble is  you see  i've taken on a lot of responsibilities that should be theirs  and by now being absent for a day a week  their shortcomings are plainer to see  i have not once been thanked for staying very late to get things done  in the hospital i work in  for the months before  there's certainly a distrust of me working these new hours  and as it's still new  i feel i'm having to  prove  that working these hours are effective to everybody    amp x200b   from a working point of view  i am way more organised doing these hours  i supervise people  well  more orchestrate than supervise - i fight their side  not the manager's battles downwards  and so i can catch up on emails and calls before anybody else is even in  organise the work for the day and then spend my day helping others as opposed to chasing my own problems up  my ten-hour day feels a lot more effective than my 8-hour-days    amp x200b   from a personal point a view  the ten hour days feel long  i work 7-5  with a rushed 30 min lunch break somewhere in the middle  i'm an early-riser anyway  so that early start isn't bad for me  my commute is 1 hour each way  so not having to do that on a friday feels good  as is saving me fuel  on my work days  it really does feel like i get home  cook dinner  wash up and go to bed - those 4 days are a write-off    amp x200b   but the three-days off  guys  oh  it's been fantastic  i spend my friday recovering  as i used to on a saturday  i get to visit more local shops  amp  markets at a leisurely pace  away from the weekend crowds  i get my chores done  my wind-down from work efficacy mode occurs  meaning by saturday  the day is mine to do what i want  it's a mental freedom that i'd forgotten  i still get the sunday scaries  but now i have a day to truly enjoy my weekend  i hope that the four-day week is adopted  but that third day is variable for everybody  so they too can experience this     amp x200b   my advice is  if you can do this  or if you have to push to get this  do it     amp x200b   tl dr  i've worked a 4-day-week for about a month now  my colleagues manager are suspicious  but i'm more organised  amp  effective at work  and feel a lot more balanced in my personal life  work writes off those 4 days  but lets you truly have  personal time  would recommend ,hgrjvh

50,Has Yuri Besmenov been debunked?,basically alot of anti communists hawks use him as a  checkmate communists  people say that he says that there is a communist conspiracy  he says was the head of the soviet newspaper in the cold war  he says he was a kgb agent and that psychological warfare is being done to the west the psyop process he described is basically this he says that that demoralization happens first he says the communists attack the moral ideas of the country and then after that destabilization happens  then crisis happens and then normalization happens  they get everyone used to having a big brother government  i think using him as a trump card sidesteps the economic debate entirely  i heard that he was actually a ukrainian dissident that was a agent from the pentagon but i couldn't find anything to back it up  i don't want to hear anything debunking him from a skeptic perspective  i think conspiracy theories are true most of the time  i don't think stuff like this discredits all the good information about exposing conspiracies  i do like g edward griffin to even though he did the interview in the 80s  he has exposed the federal reserve ,hgolkp

work   gt    what is the bombing of a judge  the kidnapping of an industrialist        the hanging of a politician  the shooting of a cop        the looting of a supermarket  the burning of a commissioner s office        the stoning of a journalist        the heckling of an intellectual  the thrashing of an artist        in the face of the deadly alienation of our existence        the much too early sound of the alarm clock        the traffic jam on the expressway        the goods for sale lined up on the shelves   the alarm clock disrupts your sleep again   as always  much too early   you drag yourself from the warmth of your bed to the bathroom for a shower  a shave and a shit  then run down to the kitchen where you wash  down a pastry or  if you have the time  some toast and eggs with a cup of coffee  then you rush out the door to battle traffic jams or crowds in the subway until you arrive  at work  where your day is spent in tasks not of your choosing  in compulsory association with others involved in related tasks  the primary aim of which is the continued reproduction of the social relationships that constrain you to survive in this manner    but this is not all  in compensation  you receive a wage  a sum of money that  after paying rent and bills  you must take out to shopping centers to buy food  clothes  various necessities and entertainment  though this is considered your  free time  as opposed to  work time  it too is compulsory activity that only secondarily guarantees your survival  its primary purpose again being to reproduce the current social order  and for most people  moments free of these constraints are fewer and fewer    according to the ruling ideology of this society  this existence is the result of a social contract between equals   equals before the law that is  the worker  it is said  contracts to sell her labor to the boss for a mutually agreed upon wage  but can a contract be considered free and equal when one side holds all the power    if we look at this contract more closely  it becomes clear that it is no contract at all  but the most extreme and violent extortion  this is currently exposed most blatantly at the margins of capitalist society where people who have lived for centuries  or  in some cases  millennia  on their own terms find their capacity to determine the conditions of their existence ripped away by the bulldozers  chainsaws  mining equipment and so on of the world s rulers  but it is a process that has been going on for centuries  a process involving blatant  large-scale theft of land and life sanctioned and carried out by the ruling class  bereft of the means for determining the conditions of their own existence  the exploited cannot be said  in honesty  to be contracting freely and equally with their exploiters  it is clearly a case of blackmail    and what are the terms of this blackmail  the exploited are forced to sell the time of their life to their exploiters in exchange for survival  and this is the real tragedy of work  the social order of work is based on the imposed opposition between life and survival  the question of how one will get by suppresses that of how one wants to live  and in time this all seems natural and one narrows one s dreams and desires to the things that money can buy    however  the conditions of the world of work do not just apply to those with jobs  one can easily see how the unemployed searching for a job from fear of homelessness and hunger is caught up in the world of work   but the same holds for the recipient of state aid whose survival depends  on the existence of the assistance bureaucracy  and even for those for whom the avoidance of getting a job has become such a priority that  one s decisions come to center around scams  shoplifting  dumpster  diving   all the various ways to  get by  without a job  in other words  activities that could be fine means for supporting a life  project become ends in themselves  making mere survival one s life  project  how  really  does his differ from a job    but what is the real basis of the power behind this extortion that is the world of work  of course  there are laws and courts  police and military forces  fines and prisons  the fear of hunger and homelessness    all very real and significant aspects of domination  but even the state s force of arms can only succeed in carrying out its task because people submit  and here is the real basis of all domination   the submission of the slaves  their decision to accept the security of known misery and servitude rather than risk the unknown of freedom  their willingness to accept a guaranteed but colorless survival in exchange  for the possibility of truly living that offers no guarantees    so in order to put an end to one s slavery  to move beyond the limits of merely getting by  it is necessary to make a decision to refuse to submit  it is necessary to begin to reappropriate one s life here and now  such a project inevitably places one in conflict with the entire social order of work  so the project of reappropriating one s existence must also be the project of destroying work  to clarify  when i say   work  i do not mean the activity by which one creates the means of one s existence  which ideally would never be separate from simply living  but rather a social relationship that transforms this activity into a sphere separate from one s life and places it in the service of the ruling order so that the activity  in fact  ceases to have any direct relationship to the creation of one s existence  but rather only maintains it in the realm of mere survival  at whatever level of consumption  through a series of mediations of which property  money and commodity exchange are among the most significant  this is the world we must destroy in the process of taking back our lives  and the necessity of this destruction makes the project of the reappropriation of our lives one with the projects of insurrection and social revolution ,hirsqs

68,I don't know what to do anymore...,i work a simple desk job since about 2 years  i chose this because of stable hours and because i was kinda burning out from my last job at a hostel  being a manager  i was too overwhelmed at 20 years to do that job  so i left   now time has passed and i work in a completely different field  i couldn't even describe what we as a company do  it simply doesn't matter to me   my coworkers are significantly older than me and that's a big reason why they are so  loyal  to their job  they do over hours even if they don't get payed for them  personally  i value my private life more than just a job  so i frankly don't care about staying any later than i have to  there are exceptions  but mostly i just leave asap    nobody understands my feelings  i can't talk to noone about this  my boyfriend likes his job and wants to build up a successful career in his field  which is fine  but he just doesn't understand how it is when you don't have a  corporate mind  i couldn't care less about my company    my parents always just say  almost noone loves their job  but everyone has to work  so you just have to suck it up  it's not going to be different anywhere  every job has its downsides    and i agree  but it just still doesn't feel right to me   i just came to the conclusion that i don't see myself pursuing a career  i don't want to climb up the ladder  i was a manager and i couldn't handle the stress  and frankly  the money is not worth the hassle for me     my boss had a review talk with me some months ago and he asked me what position i could imagine myself in and i honestly couldn't answer the question    he was like   you surely don't want to stay on the same spot forever right   i didn't answer anything  but the more i think about it  i don't want to work towards more responsibility and even more work  if you ask me  the next best thing would be to cut my work hours and start working part time so i have more time for my hobbies   i feel like this option is always just laid out to woman with children   sorry for making no fucking sense  i just had to get it out  couldn't wait for my therapist appointment anymore  i don't know what i want  if money wasn't a thing    tl dr i don't like my job  but i need money to finance my hobbies  boss wants me to go further in my  career  whilst i would like to cut down to part time ,hitwrf
69,I cant live like this and I am scared.,long story short  i was a really bright kid till highschool  turns out i was being tested for adhd and autism but my incredibly uninformed dad shut it down and never told me about it because it didnt want a 'retarded daughter'    i can not function in a daily work environment  people dont understand my personality and even at 28 years old i normaly end up bullied covertly or completely ousted  completing tasks is a hit or miss  somedays i am incredibly efficient   other days just the noise of the florescent lighting is physically painful and i have to pretend i'm fine till my shift is over  i have wept in my car because it hurts so much to leave my daughters to come to this work place that contributes no good to the world   very recently i've began to seek treatment and i had this relaxation that i'm not lazy or stupid or an underachiever  the world just isnt built for people who think like i do  i know a lot about a lot of things and i can apply that knowledge if left the fuck alone but the moment i have to meet a regiment written by someone else i crumble    i feel like there are work environments that could allow me to really prosper but you need a very expensive degree and a big ol' sack of privilege to obtain it  i have a desire to be productive and to do things with my time that help others  i wish my job could be teaching people about animals or nature    i don't know how much longer i can sustain this  i have two daughters under the age of four  an eviction notice  it doesn't make sense to me how i can absolutely stretch myself to my mental  emotional and physical limits and still not be able to make rent ,hgpdql

71,Why do we devote so much goddamn mental energy to this bullshit?,i m just leaving my job headed home after staying late  most of that stay wasn t even for work  i fucked up  a few months ago i didn t do something for a client and no one noticed until now    well no one noticed period except for me and i spent way too much time trying to weigh whether the risk of someone finding out and chewing me out at some point in the future  which would be more difficult to explain  was worth the risk of telling the dude what happened and getting chewed out tomorrow  spent way too fucking long just ruminating over which way to go just paralyzed in fear and anxiety of what exactly   why the fuck do i care so goddamn much about this shit  some wealthy company has to do a little more paperwork to get some bills paid  the person who s in charge of that client looks  unprofessional  for not having everything together and what about me  i get chewed out for making a mistake  as if that hasn t happened before  i m not going to get fired i don t think  and even if i were the worst thing that happens is my ego hurts  i m fortunate enough to have money saved to get me through a few month  but i spent a whole hour typing up an email and not sending it then finally sending it after so much stress and i can t even relax    i just wish i could stop caring about this whole bullshit  i can t stop caring about the most meaningless shit in the big picture because  why exactly  is this just work culture or am i crazy  why do i care so much about what these people do who i fucking hate  it s absolutely madness either way ,hj1hvm
72,the myth of sisyphus,given the sad wage slavery  that we work more than have time for ourselves and the never ending cycle it is albert camus' opinion that because of how absurd this all is you must be happy  once you understand the absurdity of your task  the only logical response is to be happy  if you didnt understand how it works  the logical response would be contempt but when you understand how unimportant and absurd it all is and because its eternal you have to be happy  accepting your fate will remove your contempt and hate   what do you guys think about this  i recently read the myth of sisyphus and i dont quite agree with it although i see how its kind of true too,hisedb

80,Any Advice?,tl dr i am autistic and live with fibromyalgia  anxiety depression and chronic pain  so a lot of jobs are just off limits to me  anything that requires too much physical exertion floors me - bar work  most customer service roles  there are very few things i'm actually passionate about and of the few jobs that excite me the majority of them are unmanageable with respect to my conditions  and the rest are just really hard to break into  i'd love to be an author  for example but can't find the energy or motivation to finish my book  would love to work in healthcare but its unsafe and impractical for sick people and colleagues  every time i've had any kind of job in the past my mental health has taken a rapid decline and i've become more suicidal than normal to the point where its almost unbearable  i don't know what to do any more and i feel like my life isn't worth living half the time because i'm either working and depressed and suicidal because i spend all my time doing something i hate and then dont have the energy to do anything i enjoy or i'm depressed and suicidal because i can't do simple things like pay my rent on government benefits or do fun things like go out to eat or any of the things i actively enjoy doing because they all cost money i don't have because i'm unemployed but at the same time working makes me just want to kill myself  i struggle with organizational issues  planning  faking interest in things i don't care about etc  as well as my productivity can obviously change day to day depending on my conditions and concentration etc which doesnt go down well with anyone and its horrible to live like this i don't know how to fix it but i've always felt this way i remember telling my parents at 8 years old i never ever wanted a career because all it did was take up time away from things that i actually wanted to do  i've always seen things so differently because i see how much easier it could be and my brain can't understand why anyone would ever work a 40 hour week or how anyone could make money loving what they do  i don't have any goals any more or any real purpose despite having third level education  long story - chose the wrong degree hated myself and it the whole time  graduated anyway  changed my mind on what i wanted to do  started new healthcare degree  dropped out of my healthcare degree due to my own health and am now stuck  i feel like such a burden on everyone who cares about me and i feel like i'm never going to find something i love to do or that i could even tolerate that i'm both physically and mentally able to handle  i'm just so lost but i can't afford to exist and i dont know what else to do  i've tried to speak to careers advisors in the past and nobody has been helpful in any way and i'm just so tired of this already at 25 i don't think i can keep going like this much longer does anyone else feel this way  i feel so useless and hopeless and its horrible i dont know what to do  i feel like a massive disappointment to everyone who knows and cares about me because i was so smart in school and everything and i could have gone places but here i am sick and disabled and demotivated with no goals i'm just the walking family disappointment and it haunts me  i just found this community and i don't really know why i'm posting this but i feel like you guys might understand  does anyone else ever feel like i do  any advice  sorry ,hh0duw

99,"Had a breakdown because of my career (long post, question at the end)",  last thursday i  m28  had a complete breakdown   i was sitting at my desk staring at my screen  just another day doing work and i had a thought pry it s way to the front   all of my dreams are dead  i m stuck in a job i hate and causes me endless stress  to pay off bills  debt  and rent all for the rest of my life  i have no hope  i have nothing to look forward to  why do i bother   it s not the first time i felt that way and won t be the last  i m not entirely sure why  but on this particular day it hit me much harder  to the point where the rest of my day was demolished while i tried to restore a semblance of normal life   i have been struggling for a long time  on the outside things appear to be fine  i have  what appears  to be a great job at a desirable company with all the benefits and i get to work from home right now    before i go further i want to let you know  i get these are tough times and there are millions unemployed right now without the benefits i have  without jobs  medical insurance  millions struggling way worse  i fully acknowledge it   i always hear  you re lucky to have a job   be grateful  be fortunate that i get to sacrifice my time  my health  for someone else s profit  money can be recuperated  time is gone forever  i will never be as young as i am now   i knew early on in life that i was going to struggle in the modern workplace  growing up there were plenty of topics and fields that  interested  me  things that i felt were cool and i wanted to learn about  the problem was that i definitively knew there wasn t anything that i felt was worth giving up 40 hours a week  of course  looking back that thought is even more painful  as i m often giving up much more time than that every week  but i digress   even now i struggle to come up with hobbies and activities that i can do for 8-9 hours consistently with complete focus  even things i m passionate about are often put aside after some time  otherwise i just feel drained  exhausted  i need a break from them  a change of pace  usually that means going outside for a walk  taking a nap  or just doing something else while i recharge   but not work  not my career  that requires 110   hah  focus  commitment  dedication  i have to throw a smile on and pretend everything is ok  otherwise i m  a downer  or  not a teamplayer  i have to be a robot that s on  always-productive and cheery  mode  i m not allowed to let people know that i m an individual struggling with depression  struggling with the thought of working the rest of my life    there s a quote that cropped up recently  it s from a 2007 game  think what you want about the game  the story  or it s message  but the quote really struck a cord with me    a man chooses  a slave obeys   throughout my life i ve made choices that i  thought  were mine  but looking back i m not so sure      i chose to work hard and get good grades    i chose to go to a specific college    i chose a major  not because i wanted to  but because it was one of the  reasonable options     i chose to get a job  to chase down a career   i chose to follow the safe path  to let go of my dreams  and passions  to forfeit my childhood aspirations   but was it really a choice    i don t know about others  but for me it certainly felt like there were no other options  no other paths to follow  i remember asking many times why we had to work everyday and give up huge portions of our lives to our careers     that s just the way life is    i hate that answer  always have  always will  and i have zero power to change it   of course  there are those that say  well go get a new job  or  it could always be worse  i concede that maybe getting a new job will reset my personal doomsday clock  for a little bit  but the deck is still stacked  the game is still rigged   a choice between two different sets of handcuffs isn t an acceptable choice in my mind  and i m still going to be resentful that i m forced to make that decision   so what are my choices  what options do i have to break free   i m not sure that i have any  i ve thought long and hard about how to break out of this predicament  but without any fundamental changes  i always circle back to my handcuffs  carving and selling myself for a profit  either as an employee working for someone else  or on my own   the choice is a deception  i am still a slave  i just get to choose the poison that kills me   and if i don t want to choose  then i get to look forward to     homelessness    starvation    the world falling apart and burning us alive    some disease rotting me from the inside out  covid or something worse down the line     etc   oh and for those of you

107,Socialists should give conspiracy theories another chance part 2,in my last post my point was that the correct information on what conspiracies are happening is good for socialists to know and that the idea of a controlling elite that controls the institutions on this world is actually compatible with the ideas on the nwo elite from a socialist perspective  it is also important to take away the nwo's power  maybe even more important than getting rid of capitalism  i know most conspiracy people do not look communism in a favorable light  i was heavily capitalist in thinking  noncompete  badmouseproductions  thefinnishbolshevik and the movie psywar really changed my persepctive    in my original post i talked about how false flags have been used against communists for a very ling time  operation gladio was a series of false flags in europe that were blamed on communists  in psywar the movie it makes the point that the wealthy have always found ways to conspire to keep the masses from taking their stuff  making everyone in america temporarily embarrassed millionaires  distracting people with political football issues and putting many other ideas into the american people's heads has made america very accepting of capitalism    the first main counter arguments i got was the one argument that has flown around in the last two years  it basically says that conspiracy theories give too simplistic of answers to complex problems  this is not entirely false  but it is mistaken to extend a pattern thinking every societal mystery that is not understood has to be complex  society can be simple  complex or a certain combination of both  what has happened on earth with the nwo having so much power is basically the world taking on a mostly simple way of being   i also was told that conspiracy theories are not worth it because of all the crap theories  separating the false from the true is a little bit of a hassle  but is not unworth the effort  there is way more than a kernel of truth in the conspiracy information  just because alot of people cry wolf about wolves doesn't mean there are not real wolves that are being called out  on r conspiracy yesterday and earlier today there is alot of good stuff on there  the right wing politics has went down   one of the biggest arguments i give for 9 11 truth is that a trillion dollars went missing  on 9 10 donald rumsfeld talked about it  on 9 11 the are of the pentagon that got hit had the office that was investigating the missing trilion dollars    on oklahoma city truth  there is a video i constantly link that proves multiple bombs were in the building  the video has excerpts from 3 live news reports  they talk constantly about multiple explosions and how multiple bombs were found  i always talk about terrence yeakey who was there  he knew a false flag happened and he was going to talk  but they killed him and falsely ruled his death a suicide  his family has come out saying this  hoppy heidelberg was on the grand jury investigating this and he has come out about how the process was rigged   i know alot of people here see pizzagate as a right wing crank story  but one thing that exposes that more is going on is tony and john podesta's art collection  as well as jimmy alefantis's art collection  they have all sorts of paintings of kids being embarrassed in bathrooms  epstein who didn't kill himself was part of a larger ring  prince andrew was a part of it and you can see in his interview that he was lying   alot of socialist people will think that getting more money is the most important goal the elite have  but if you look into it  the desire for power over people is a desire of theirs  and it even extends beyond that  most of the elite are sadistic themselves  they are the true archetype of evil ,hh02g6
108,this subs kinda disappointing sometimes.,rarely do people question work  jobs  or society system based around jobs and wage labor  it's just people bitching about their own jobs and acting like individual bosses are the problem or worse--acting like they're weird or crazy for not wanting to work  i'm antiwork because 9-5's haven't existed for most of human history and this entire system is bullshit that alienates us from actually living  i wanna know what people think about various antiwork philosophies because there are a lot   but no one ever wants to analyze the structures that force us to have jobs or discuss alternative systems  even if people disagree about the fine points  but here it's always   i hate my individual job  should i quit my job  my boss sucks but i'm not gonna question the need for bosses or jobs  lame ,hgcuxc

113,Just sharing antiwork stories,i just wanted to share a story of my mate and coworker  one of the few people at work who i actually care about  my mate was working for a little bit over a year at the company  not working too hard but definitely not slacking  he has a great connection with a lot of people and someone you could always laugh with   but when he went op for review they said  if you keep on going like you do now  i am not sure if your contract will be renewed  to which he answered   well  i will save you the hassle of the choice  i am not planning to renew it anyway    so he had still  5 months left on his contract while everybody already knew he was going to quit  a month after that talk  he received a mail from his supervisor  who was sitting in the office right fucking next to him  that he should stop slacking and work harder  no face to face  just an email to send this message across  right at the time when he was having a shitty week due to the loss of a pet  which was also well known   so my mate decided he was done  left his work phone and computer and just left the building like a boss without saying anything  send a mail to his supervisor the next day saying  yeah i ain't coming back no more   unfortunately  i was not there to witness it  but hell this happened a month ago and i am still writing this with a smile on the face  mainly because i know that he also left with a smile on his face ,hirm0y

121,MONEY ISN'T EVEN FUCKING REAL LMAO,we are a connected world  in 2020 more than ever    we are an absurd word  in 2020 more than ever   where are you reading this from  probably very far from  here  and yet i'm  there  in your mind  now  the inescapable and global grasp of the  internet  and our eternal engagement with it through the smartphone has been a pivotal  r evolutionary shift in human history  one more significant than our discovery of fire  agriculture  steel  or the combustion engine  we have yet to scratch the surface of its potential and power  and the deeper implications of its existence and what that reveals about us - the internet is the genesis of a global communal awakening and awareness of hidden connection   the internet and modern constantly connected culture has allowed us to act as a sort of rudimentary hive-mind  our access to  and saturation of information  media  and communication is both  constant   and   instant  - it is now  possible  to share our thoughts with almost everybody there is - our friends and family  their friends and family  people we don't know and never will  people in another country  and people who may not even share the same language as us - a single sentence spat out into the ether can potentially reach billions of people on the planet in a matter of minutes   you  me  and everybody else has a form of direct access to nearly every other human consciousness on this planet - what could we possibly use that for    memes  of course   to crowdsource the question of 'what is  good '  because that is what lies at the centre of all belief and action   the fact that we have seemingly become ever more divisive and politically polarized is therefore not to be tutted at  wished away or met with calls for civility  but rather acknowledged as the  only way  in which an outcome - truth - can be arrived at  copy itself  spread  and propagate to the point where its opposite seems wholly and utterly absurd   advocates for either a progressive or conservative approach to policy can not compromise  not  because the facts are in disagreement  although that is true  but because what comes  before  the facts is not agreed upon  that is  the way the world is structured and ordered  or  the way the world is  which itself always acts as the background for an ideology rather than the reverse  the idiom  'seeing is believing'  is true backwards as well  perhaps even more convincingly -   believing is seeing  and this is evident now more than ever   i m going to make some statements that are broad and general  but ones i feel are fairly common and often subconscious  these are not meant to be statements of   fact  only associations to get us to think about how we reach the conclusion of  fact    the relationship between progressivism and conservatism is like the relationship between masculine and feminine which is like the relationship between individual and community   consider this disharmony between two opposing  or complementary   principles as essentially the basis of all philosophical  and thus political  thought  also consider opposing principles as really a  single thing  as opposites always exist only in relation to each other  this admittedly sounds a lot like some meaningless new-age woo  but i think most of us can and do recognize the basic and fundamental necessity of this tension between opposites   we see what our minds project and what our contexts allow - we frame the world in the language we have at our disposal and what words  mean  is not something static and  in  the word itself  but something dynamic  unique to us specifically in the way we  relate  to that word   language has an implicit kind of magical quality - by that i mean much like an imagined casting of a spell  it is widely assumed that speaking the right words in the right combination  and order  can influence and compel people to act  and this action is the source of social change  this is why great orators have possessed great influence over the course of history - someone must be able to give  power  to an idea that can move masses to act as a single unified force of nature   language is itself inherently biased  limited  and divisive -  black lives matter  means absolutely nothing until it is interpreted and language is always loaded with prejudice  even and perhaps especially when great care is taken to make sure it is not  there is always a fundamental aspect of loss from translating a feeling to a thought to any  thing  else  even when the path is as seemingly direct as from thought to speech    have you ever known  exactly  what to say but been unable to get the words out properly in the moment    have you ever written and rewritten something multiple times because the exact  feeling  you re trying to capture just isn t there    as much as language is the primary way we communicate  ironically it just as often obfuscates and confuses because the kind of language we have available to us directly determines how we understand and conceptualize the world  and ourselves  it is not a matter of merely being  peterson-ianly   precise  in our speech  because precision is meaningless if the principles that precede it are incompatible   how many proponents of any ideology have  actually  read and engaged with its foundational or supporting texts    probably very few   how many have absorbed bits and pieces through their specific context - language  culture  family  friends  media  and digital memes   probably almost everybody   you simply can't exist in 2020 and not intuitively just  know  what a meme is  even those that exist totally cut-off from the online sphere would get the picture with some examples  most typically we think of images like  this https imgur com sc1nbl7  or  this https imgur com yw2quqt  but these are just some examples of the modern  digital meme and don't begin to even scratch the surface of just  exactly  what a meme is and why the answer to that might be really fucking important   for example  a picture doesn't need any text to be a meme  similarly  a picture can be  only  text and still be a meme  a phrase can be a meme  or even  a single word https vignette wikia nocookie net simpsons images c c3 d 27oh jpg revision latest cb 20141226214635  a  sound https en wikipedia org wiki wilhelm scream   symbols https en wikipedia org wiki cool s media file 22cool s 22 svg  the structure of the building you're in and the design of the device you're reading this from are memetic artifacts  musical subgenres  fashion and style trends  social patterns and institutions including family  marriage  property  law  crime and punishment - even complex ideologies - religious  political  and philosophical  all actually inseparable and arguably the same thing  - are essentially very nuanced and enduring memetic conversations that span hundreds and thousands of years   human behaviour is memetic - a product of pattern  repetition  and context rather than a series of conscious  choices  we make at every moment - this is not to suggest we are totally bound and determined by fate  only that we are bound and determined to act in accordance with our own character - we are not  something  responsible for our decisions  we  are  our decisions  and for that we bear responsibility    can you imagine donald trump acting like anything else besides a caricature of pure petulance   that s his role to play - his constitution  if it weren't he would be someone else  and here lies the crucial error that pervades all levels of society   i think the belief that he  or you  or i  make decisions  is quite backwards - it s partly a product of the language we use to speak about ourselves and the world - a confusion of the symbol with the actual thing - and partly just our basic instincts  it's plainly obvious that i am aware and can consider many possibilities and outcomes and think rather abstractly about present  past  and future  so it only seems to follow that i  must  exert some basic influence over the course of my life  but i think if we really examine that thought there s no good reason to assume that s true and necessarily follows  we might  feel  that it does  but perhaps that is a sign to be skeptical of our most basic assumptions   i find little distinction between  me  and  my choices  - i  am  those choices  not a separate entity in the pilot's seat of my skull that  chooses  - that stands separate  considers  and then finally pulls the lever that corresponds with the  choice' i ve made   those last three words are superfluous - to me they all reference a single thing - a localized  happening  from my specific perspective   this idea is naturally unpalatable as it seems to absolve one of all responsibility  for both wrongdoing and ownership of good acts and artistic creations  but i think this is nothing more than a knee-jerk reaction to protect our sense of  i  as something distinct and in control  as to accept the opposite comes with a great and terrifying sense of powerlessness  this terror is multiplied further when coupled with the additional quality of randomness  and the ordinary and pervasive accepted fact of our free will  is an attempt to reconcile this powerlessness with our instinctive desire to be in control  even when faced constantly with the reality of circumstance where one life is destroyed based not on any decision or choice it was able to make  but the simple act of existing at the wrong point in time and space and colliding with the wrong other does nothing to dissuade us of this familiar and comfortable illusion   responsibility is not something we  take  it is what we  are  by sheer virtue of being   memes and the repetition of pattern connects us to something far greater than any single one of us - our  collective  human ideas about value  function  purpose  and their relation with each other - memes are a portal to the sum total of all human knowledge  experience  and feeling - memes are threads sewn into the fabric of the tapestry of reality  connecting us to the past  present  future  each other  and something totally separate - something unspeakable that yet demands to be spoken of - something that can be glimpsed only for a moment and reflected only as a fragment   you may have felt it when engaged in something everyday and ordinary  yet struck as if for the very first time by the majesty and totality of all there is - all experience happening right now  billions of distinct and separate simultaneous  happenings  - connections - disconnected only by virtue of the limitations of our own collective conceptions of what is real  what is true  and what is possible   what  is  possible   it is possible then to understand  humanity  not as an abstracted collection of billions of separate individuals  but as a single   unique happening of organism environment  that can act with that awareness of unity and underlying connection   we currently insist on persisting in an ordering of society that enriches only a small handful that have fallen to the top through nothing other than circumstance and who insist this  must  be the natural ordering of the world simply because it is the current ordering of it    can we really trust those who wield inordinate amounts of power to fairly consider how it might be meted out differently  is the fate of society directly tied to the fate of the billionaire class  or to the current institutions of governance and policing   we are meant to believe and accept that this is just  the way the world is    as far as i see it  society bears little proof of functioning properly  anywhere  as long as we define  properly  as for the common good of all people  if we instead understand  properly  as to the obscene and perverted benefit of a small few at the expense of everybody else  then it is functioning tremendously properly  and will only continue to do so until we put a stop to it   from where is authority and power actually derived   the primary source is our shared belief that these institutional structures are legitimate and just - and they are so long as we believe it    the secondary source is the ability and willingness of these structures to respond violently if we do not accept the first   violence is of course the most powerful and persuasive avenue of acquiring and maintaining power  both literal violent action and indirect violence inflicted and facilitated by a system of organization that regards the principle of one's right to hoard obscene amounts of wealth as higher and more just than an attempt to provide the basic material necessities of life for all people   that is the basic moral principle that serves as the keystone of the structure of our society  as it is currently ordered   to preserve life violence may sometimes be necessary  but violence can be avoided memetically - you cannot put a bullet in a concept and it s just as futile  and a bit if a moral grey area  to do the same to those who espouse  exemplify  or believe it  violence can be lessened with the correct memetic foundations to underpin our collective conceptions of 'self'  'other'  and 'world' and the reciprocal nature of those three things - violence is given power by distinction and separation  but that power can be neutered partly by understanding that not only are we ourself  we are also every other self  too   individualism is too often championed by those who don't understand the distinction between it and selfishness  and this error acts as the basic foundation for an entire wing of belief that insists  value  is directly related to money and money alone and  everything  can be spoken about in terms of its equivalent and assumed value in us dollars  one of many currencies that can in an instant become almost worthless due to nothing other than our shared confidence  or lack thereof  in it   so  if memes are the true catalyst of human action and social change  can we then  meme ourselves  into a better reality  can we  together  engineer  build  or construct a meme to spread and transform our shared  collective  un conscious and the ideas that follow about not only what is true   but what is possible   i think a good place to start is to understand the  illusory and mutable nature of money and wealth  their direct relationship with power  authority  and control and the distribution of these things  money is a real  thing  that performs a necessary  function  but our shared understanding of it holds real power over its form  and in this way we can collectively shape and alter that power it commands over our lives through a collective psychic exercise   we can't function without money  but we absolutely can function with a new way of distributing it in hopes of lessening  not eliminating  the amount of suffering directly related to poverty and the misery that flows from that   google   how many billionaires exist  - answer  2095    2095 problems   let's look at just one   does jeff bezos really have billions of an actual  tangible currency  or is his currency really in the form of power and influence  as represented  by money   is the standard work-week from monday to friday or monday to thursday    whatever the answer  is it because this is simply  the way the world is  or might  the way the world is  be directly shaped by our collective ideas about it   wars are no longer waged on an actual battlefield - our modern war is a psychic and spiritual one  set in the space of the collective human  un conscious  and the targets of annihilation are not only people but possibilities - the target is  truth  and the creation of truth as it serves the manufacturer - we are in an era of memetic warfare and unless we can understand that and figure out how to turn it against itself  the collective human spirit will be swallowed whole  outlived by the last piece of manufactured shit we can sell for a dollar    2095 problems and 1 crucial error  stands between us and a better society  and building that society is as simple as believing in and spreading the right memes   we can meme ourselves better  but only together   if you can believe that's true  it is ,hgsh9b

134,I DID IT! I QUIT MY JOB!, i finally did it  ive been working this healthcare facility for 3 years in the kitchen and tonight today at 1am i quit  i did it via text message to my hr  manager  and supervisor but i did it   please dont tell me that it was unprofessional they did plenty worse     i started this job in the kitchen 3 years ago at 9  an hour  44 hours a week  thats right 44 hours a week  but as part time  no benefits  no healthcare     gone through a new manager every year  same old  were a family and i promise to fix everything   procedes to f ck up everything worse   one of my manger actually told me to my face  people like you dont deserve to be working in my kitchen  after working there for only a week   im openly trans  gay and autistic         i never know my work work schedule for the next week until the very last day of current schedule   half my coworkers are part of one family  current  now old  boss is friend of said family and makes one of them supervisor  we had never had a supervisor until then   and new family supervisor call out everything no matter how small towards non-family   but family can do no harm  ever        now under the newest  family  ruled boss shifts get rearranged  1st shift gets an extra person and less overall work  and second shift gets the same amount of people but with more work     one of the bosses family members hates my guts for some unknown reason  i try my best to get with people or straight up avoid them  and is allowed to scream at me  and even threaten violence against me  i tell supervisor  nothing happens  i tell manager  nothing happens  i tell hr  nothing happens  i have to go all the way the building admin and their higher up to stop this  and when it finally stops that person is still allowed to work on the same shift as me   i have worked same shift longer before them or any of the family had even started the jobs     after 3 years im still making 9  an hour while i know for a fact that the new family are making more  bosses even bragged about bonoues they got for staying under budget  by taking food away from they elderly    so in these three years ive worked at this place  ive worked 40 hours a week  minimum  but still on paper part time until 4 months ago when corporate finally caught  it  hr finnaly puts me on full time with healthcare  yay right  wrong   two times a day  five times a week i washed dishes for roughly 100 elderly people  that means the dirty  flighty  bacteria filled  virus infested  disgusting dish water filled with food that has been in 100 peoples mouths  everyday  twice a day  without healthcare  and i wonder why i got so sick all the time      now over the past month my supervisor who makes the schedule has reduced my hours to 30 hours a week   without my knowledge or permission  and when i confronted them they gave some bs excuss of of the covid 19 has us pushing hours back  wtf no we are still working the same hours     now im part of the nation guard  and on multiple ocassions my boss has called  or rather has tried to call me in while im at my unit  in uniform   asking me to leave early to help them   now i gave my manager  my supervisor  hr  and building admin my yearly drill schedule far in advance  but they still try to blame me for not warning them that i have drill  when they have my drill for the whole year in paperwork and email  and i tell them every month     now with this covid-19 going on many units across the country have been doing work from home online work instead of going to the unit in person  this still requires me to be busy at my computer for 8-9 hours and calling in and doing classes over the phone and all that nonsense  but my hr askes me to my face to do it while at work  hr asked me to work both my nation guard and my kitchen work at the same time  as at least half my nation guard hours are during times im usually at work  aka ng time is 8am to 4pm and work hours are 11am to 7pm     that happened last week  now this week  my work week starts on saturdays   ive had to go do someone elses job for the past 4 days in a row  so that one person can go  help  the 1st shift on side of the builing when serving food  which means giving one side 4 people duing lunch hour  but yet the same side serving the same ammount of people with the same amount of time given only gets 3 people     so this all basically means that i have to go do someones else's job so they can do nothing f and this all puts my an hour behind on all my work for the entire day  which means i have to stay over an hour   this trend of me having to do someones else's job started after i went to corporate and had them fix my hours so i get my 40 to keep my new full time and healthcare  come to find out the supervisor was the one telling the cook to tell me to go there job  the same supervisor that does my schedule       all ive ever wanted was to do my job  my job  not someone elses  i just want to work 40 hours a week or hell even less  just so long as i can support myself  i live in a very rural region but my rent is the cheapest i could find over the past 4 years of living here and still takes up 40  of my monthly pay     for the past 3 days ive come home and cried  and tonight i came home and drank  ive never been drunk  at most ive been buzzed twice  im almost 30  so drinking has never even been on my list of things to do  but ive finnaly been pushed over the egde and i drank propably a thirdish of a wine cooler and honestly the hours of 8pm to 1am are a total blurr  im still buzzeed as of writing all this so at least someone could know my pain to the full   im ok now and have poured all that was leftover into the sink  and never plan to do that again     and much more   tl dr my job was bad over the past 3 years that tonight sent me over and i got drunk for the first time in life  then i sobered up and quit my job via text at 1am ,hevw2j

144,Yesterday I Got The Call To Go Back and I've Felt Like Absolute Shit Since,i've had a pit in my stomach since yesterday morning   got the call to come back from furlough on monday after 15 weeks   i really don't know how i'm going to manage     i was told i'd be out until the first week of september  but there's been a  big turn around  in business      the most ridiculous part about this  is my company has been pushing  slow  production startup  i work in manufacturing  safety first  volunteers only for the summer     now  fair is fair   my company did do a few decent things     during the 2nd week of march  they decided to voluntarily shutdown for a two week period  with full pay for employees    during that time period  the state ordered a non-essential shutdown   the company didn't try to bs their way into pretending they were essential  they let us keep our vacation and sick time without paying it out  and they let us keep our health insurance  granted with double payments when we go back      once the non-essential order ended in may  it was going to be all volunteers and small shifts for the whole summer     they had no issues getting volunteers  because they promised a four day work week  with the fifth day being able to claim ui from the state   plus  you would still get the  600 a week from the cares act      but then a couple weeks ago they started to realize that they were getting a ton of orders   we make fucking sports equipment   a specific type   and it's one of the only sports people are playing right now      well  all of a sudden that  employee safety  went out the window     back to five days a week immediately starting next week   all employees mandatory back to work   ot reestablished  both voluntary and mandatory  possible six day work weeks until we  catch up     all of those volunteers were expecting an extra  600 a week until august  now they're not getting it      these have been the best 15 weeks of my life in i don't know how long   my parents forced me to start working full-time during the summers when i was 16 years old  and part time during the school year   i got fucked out of a lot of normal high school and college summer activities because they had me working manual labor jobs from 7am to 3pm everyday     this was going to be my first summer off in  eighteen fucking years       i have fixed up my house  i've fixed up my yard  i've got a big garden going  i've read over 30 books  i've been learning french  i'm learning to play the saxophone again  i started painting i've really been fucking happy      i don't know how the fuck i can go back to work     and the thing is  my job wouldn't be that bad if it wasn't for the corporate bullshit   like most large companies  i can't stand the  fakeness  of it   it literally sickens me   the pretending to care about every employee and their well being and the morons i work with who believe it   monday is a federal holiday   guess what  mandatory full shift on saturday   and what do these idiots coworkers say   well the company has to make money and they need the product   nothing we can do about it     not to mention the low level supervisors i'm sorry  team leaders  gotta use that bs term to make employees feel more comfortable    getting my fucking ass ridden even when i'm working hard      oh  you were suppose to make 200 of these products today why did you only make 198 you had to use the bathroom   well obviously you were on your phone or fooling around   fucking excuse me   i'm 34 years old   who the fuck are you to talk to me like that   i had to take a shit  like every other person does   i'm pretty sure every time i walk by your office  you're leaning back in your chair on your fucking phone   who is calling you out   or   i saw you were at the punch out clock at 11 minutes of the hour you know that employees can't line up until 10 minutes on the hour   yes  i know that every single clock we have up shows a different time  and yes i know we will suspend you even if you just lift your cell phone slightly from your pocket to see the actual time but i'm going to have write you up   fucking hell the juvenile and childish treatment you get and the way you're spoken down to     maybe some of you will disagree  but i could probably fucking deal with my job on an  ok  level if it wasn't for bullshit like that      fuck     i just wanted a summer off ,hfc9jn

148,The quarantine has made me realize that I don’t really want to go back to work.,where i m from the quarantine isn t fully over yet  as an intern i m in a particular condition in regards to employment  and the team where i work has been slowly going back to work but the interns  and a lot of other people  haven t yet  i ve been lucky enough that i ve been paid the full 3 months that we ve been in quarantine   and you know what makes it just how clear how anti-work i ve turned recently  is that i actually like this job  i could see myself working there  it s 6 hours a day  5 days a week and they pay well   but ever since i started i started working here i've been thinking about just how much unnecessary labour we do  as much as i like my job and in it s needed in context  i ve felt that what i do is ultimately meaningless  plus there s no shortage of shitty coworkers that i have to deal with  and that all rolls up into a nice ball of anti-work sentiment i ve developed over time  after less than 2 years of entering the workforce as a  professional   i ve been working since i was around 16  but it was just under the table money   i do want to work  but not for profit and under the threat of homelessness and starvation and not for someone else  i want to work for myself  for those around me and for the good of humanity  and i want to have a satisfactory life  i don t want to spend the rest of my days in uneventful safety   it s just so hard to fight back against that little voice of internalized capitalism that says  you re not worthy unless you re being productive  you need economic safety and stability  etc  and i ve been considering going to college again to study something with which i can help people  plus i love learning stuff overall   i absolutely love my field of study  and i am good at it  it s just a little self-indulgent  which is fine  i love it  it s good for my mental health and i ve been doing it for my own enjoyment without it having generated me any income for years now and i don t plan to stop  it s for me  but in the context of work it just isn t all that gratifying and it even feels vapid   i do some volunteer work which is how i got the internship in the first place  and my internship tasks blended a bit with my volunteer work and i just felt so discouraged for a moment just thinking about going back to work   and idk i m just ranting at this point  this isn't meant to be particularly insightful  i just wanted to share this with other who i know feel simmilarly  and i ve realized that i could honestly just go the rest of my life without working  and instead balancing my own enjoyment with the impetus i feel for helping humanity ,he10v3

151,Biological existence is a dictatorship - all living organisms are fundamentally slaves,we are also economic slaves to money and work  submit to labor in exchange for a paycheck or starve to death on the street - due to having no purchasing power and thus  in this current system  no right to life   most people in the modern world are not able to 'go live in the woods' and make that function they lack those skills so it is a gun to the head scenario with no alternatives for the vast majority   and even if you are willing to work for money to pay for rent and food - but are unable to obtain employment you will starve to death on the street  despite being willing to slave away to maintain your futile temporary existence   you may indeed even be one of those rare people who genuinely enjoys your job work career  that does not however change the fact that you still do have to do it  and you will starve on the streets if you did not do it  or found some other work in exchange for a paycheck in case you quit the current occupation to substitute in some other source of monetary income   people that  love their jobs and are genuinely fulfilled by it and see it as meaningful and engaging  are no different from samuel jackson's character in django unchained - a slave who enjoys being a slave and likes his slave master  you can be a slave who finds it acceptable and even enjoyable or you can despise it with every ounce of your being and resent it to the ultimate degree  but both are equally slaves   now in a similar sense we are biological slaves  we must eat  we must drink  we must maintain a certain body temperature  we must breathe oxygen etc   now you may say   well i enjoy eating  i enjoy drinking  i enjoy seeking out a comfortable body temperature  i enjoy breathing i love fresh air  i like that things are like that   ok - but that does not change the fact that you indeed are a slave to all of that  you have to do those things or you suffer and die  you may be happy with that situation and somehow find it justifiable and acceptable that you are a monetary slave and a biological slave and you can make peace with it or maybe even find it to be just and proper that this is the state of affairs  that this is how things are   but you are a slave though  and so is quite literally every single living organism that does or has ever existed on this planet - until they eventually died anyways despite any efforts they ever made ,hed97q

161,Stuck with people who refuse to understand,i'm 24  been living with my parents in my childhood home for almost a year now  along with my two brothers as of   april  i'm working at a small local market garden which i enjoy  i'd still rather be spending most of my time on other things and would prefer to not hand over most of my labour value to my boss  but it's better than anything else i've done  my parents are  concerned about my future  i am trying to keep an eye out for a small camper van to move into so i can live rent-free on unemployment for a while and finally gtfo of this town  but my dad is against this idea  since he insists that it's somehow more of a burden to maintain and repair a camper than it is to burn half your paycheque every month on a single room in a basement suite somewhere  they are convinced that the best course of action would be for me to go back to school and then somehow immediately land a high-paying job  that you can tolerate  upon graduation  someone can feel free to let me know if this is even reasonably possible anymore  because to me it seems completely out of touch and on par with  just go into the building  give them a resume  and ask for an interview   on top of this  i'm pretty convinced there is virtually no job that i can  tolerate  because the entire concept of wage labour as a precondition of subsistence -- that we are expected to spend 40  hours a week toiling on  often completely useless  tasks just to prove that we are worthy of warmth and calories -- completely and utterly disgusts me to my core  and that's before the whole exploitation of labour value thing  they can't seem to understand that i would much rather scrape by in a van  posting music on the internet and maybe selling custom tee shirts than spend half my waking hours completely disassociating just so i can give half my money to a parasitic dirtbag in exchange for permission to live in a building they own    oh and my dad shames me for smoking weed   tl dr  stuck with my complacent  brainwashed parents who are trying to push me towards the same boring bs life path that they took back in the 80s when job stability  moderately affordable rent  livable entry-level wages  and degrees that carried more weight than the paper they were printed on actually existed  they think i am entitled for trying to explain why that life path is not really that viable anymore  and i wouldn't be particularly interested in it if i was  they have completely bought in ,hffxph

170,People need to be very careful hoping the U.S. goes to a permanent work from home culture., tl dr  careful wishing  wfh is going to possibly lead to 50-60 hour work weeks with no ot and no pay increases  it could also spur law changes leading to the 777  be ready at 7  sign off at 7  all 7 days  with availability 24 7   i think the real argument going on in the u s  is whether the 40 hr workweek needs to be re-evaluated   initial panic  if they can t see you and demand you do more than what they hired you for  their long term game is screwed   but  in the end  the worker will get screwed no matter what   this leads to meetings with  strategists  and hr   before you know it  lobbyists are influencing congress to roll back ot  fmla  etc  leading to the 777  report at 7  sign off at 7  all 7 days and be available 24 7   frankly  i d go in for 3 days a week or just let me wfh 4  come in one    this is a slippery slope wfh  employers will eventually want you to work at all hours and they ll probably add a lot more assignments to your plate knowing that you have all the time in the world to get it done at home  no commute  that s 2 more hours for the company   they forget that s before 8 all of a sudden it s work time  so i think a lot of people should be really careful about getting permanent wfh  doing some kind of hybrid system to just remind the boss that you are a person hired to do 40 hours worth of work not 90 hours worth of work because they ll expect you to juggle being home while working all the time   personally  i see the idea of ot being a thing of the past for wfh   instead of 40 hour weeks  why not 50 or 60 since there are no commutes  no lunch runs  no rush home to family needs  ah  but no pay increases  they ve been  generous  allowing you to wfh   careful ,hfxoea

196,Unions are *not* the answer.,the left-communist theoretician paul mattick explains it as follows   https www marxists org archive mattick-paul 1975 lebel htm   gt parliamentary parties and trade unions lose their limited effectiveness when it is no longer possible to combine an improvement of workers  living standards with a progressive expansion of capital  under conditions which preclude a sufficient capitalist accumulation  that is  under conditions of economic crisis  the reformist activities of political parties and trade unions cease to be operative and these organisations abstain from their supposed functions  as they would now endanger the capitalist system itself   they will rather try to help sustain the system  up to the point of directly sabotaging the workers aspirations for better living and working conditions  they will help capitalism overcome its crisis at the expense of the workers  in such a situation  the workers  unwilling to submit to the dictates of capital  are forced to resort to activities not sanctioned by official labor organisations  to so-called wildcat strikes  factory occupations and other form of direct actions outside the control of the established labor organisations  these self-determined activities  with their temporary council structure  indicate the possibility of their radical application under arising revolutionary situations  replacing the traditional organisational forms  which have become a hindrance for both the struggle for immediate needs and for revolutionary goals   the union form cannot transcend capital  because it relies on it for it's own legitimacy  it  requires  dues-paying members and a bureaucratic link to capital  this holds good even of genuinely radical outfits like the iww   what  in my view  would be more revolutionary would be a group that organized  against  the workplace  rather than inside of it  which taught workers how to  drop out  of the system sustainably ,hew12z

198,Living on welfare can be a choice and it doesn't mean that one is lazy or doesn't want to work. How living on welfare allows me to give more to my community.,i'm not living in the us but in one or those european social democracy with a generous welfare state and i thank life every day that i was born here  unfortunately  here too the people on welfare are often ridiculed as lazy  entitled by those who have a full time job   here is why living on welfare can be a choice of life   living on welfare allows me to spend more time working on my non-profit organization which focuses on helping organizing cultural activities and events in the community as well as helping those in need  single parents  the unemployed  children with special needs  etc   we organize all sorts of events year round where the people living here can gather and get to know each other and socialize  which as a result created a closer more social community  we organize everything from dinners to barbecues to concerts to promoting local artists to sport activities such as treks and football matches to craft workshops  etc   of course  as a non-profit we benefit from donations by residents as well as subsidies from the government without which none of these would be possible  but that's not the point   we went from being a community where no one talked to their neighbors  where some kids would drop out of school  where there was some petty crime issues  nothing bad  just theft and the like  to being a living breathing community where the people all know each other and watch out for their neighbors  the petty crime has disappeared and far fewer kids drop out of school   i'm not talking credit for any of it  i'd just like people to recognize and to admit that communities benefit from having events and activities organized where anyone can join  to have a social non-profit looking out for the needy in the community and to do their best to help them  none of which would be possible without welfare  because i'd have to work 40h a week and would come back home too tired to do anything   and i'm not earning a cent from the donations or subsidies  the surplus is systemically reinvested into the community  i'm only getting my welfare check and that's it ,hdpc50

226,Entrepreneurship not the answer?,warning  long post  thank you for reading if you so    i just found this subreddit a few weeks ago and i ve never felt more understood  i ve worked a variety of jobs over the years ranging from physical labor to desk jobs to a brief stint in self-employment  i m currently working a desk job  and the last few months working remotely have genuinely saved my sanity    i keep trying to formulate some plot to make money to be able to quit and not be reliant on another job  but i ve run circles in my mind for almost 2 years now because of the dilemmas i see from every side  for example   - when i had my own business i was working 14 hour days  and even though it paid off handsomely i was the most miserable and mentally unwell as i had likely ever been  however  i did feel a sense of accomplishment at the end for  weathering the storm  and in retrospect the pain didn t seem so bad  although i know it was because i was crying   having panic attacks every day for a month    - at any job i ve had either physical or mental i ve been miserable after about month 3 when the honeymoon phase and excitement from leaving my last job started to wear off  i ve always seen so many flaws in every job from the treatment to the authorities to the actual tasks  for a long time i thought there was something wrong with me because i couldn t find contentment and then i went into convincing myself that i had to find some form of business ownership again or entrepreneurship    - however  the problem is that i have very strong moral issues with much of entrepreneurship  in regards to consumerism  materialism  and capitalism  i hate how marketing is constantly shoving every person  place  and thing down my throat and it physically disgusts me to think of doing that to others for my own sake  but i m getting so depressed and miserable over the years that i keep going back and forth between selling out for the sake of getting money to be able to get  out of the rat race  part of me just always thinks  i should just do absolutely whatever i have to do to make my own life and situation better and then once i have enough money i can retire and work on the writing  art  hobbies  etc  i really want to  the sad part is  i ve even tried to on several occasions  i ve tried to sell a product  sell myself as a personal brand or  coach  come up with some new concept or idea and i just feel so phony and fake  i feel like such a sham and am gritting my teeth the whole time until i eventually just stop after a little while- hence i never stick with it or put in a real enough effort to actually have success with it  and in a way  it s almost like i psychologically don t believe i would be successful or would deserve that success because of how morally unaligned i would be with those pursuits    basically i m just wondering  does anyone have any true  solution  or advice  because even being my own boss or entrepreneurship is beginning to seem like a crock of shit too  i want to be a writer   artist essentially  but even a lot of those types end up falling into what i feel like is  selling out  by selling dumb merch  more consumerism  more commercialization of art  i don t find it wrong to make money off of your art  but i do feel like there hits a certain point where it becomes a cash grab  i just want to make enough money to survive  and help my family  i don t need a lot or want to be greedy  i just am so tired and drained thinking of wasting my entire life supporting causes i don t believe in and working jobs i absolutely hate  i think there are also ways of being an  ethical     conscious  entrepreneur or business owner  but i m struggling to find a way    thanks for reading if you did  hopefully one of you might relate  i wish you all the best  as always ,hdgsxy

232,If life matters...,black lives matter  white lives matter  if all life matters the governments should move to allow it to flourish rather than pushing peoples lives to their limit with long working hours  poor pay and conditions along with higher costs for food an housing   the business is not there for the people so let governments choose to support life rather than work ,heafr7
233,Is depression just a chemical imbalance?,this might be unpopular  but when i go on the depression subreddit and most people talk about their problems  the  positive answers  always go on in elaborate detail about how one s brain is physically and individually dysfunctional and lacking the chemical balances that make normal people  normal   i am in no way a medical expert  but can t they at least imagine that there can actually be a factor  our society  that contributes to depression  or even causes the chemical imbalance  or do we ignore that possibility because that idea is too much to accept ,hf8rdx
234,It's disturbing how much black history is married to corporate greed...,this seems off-topic at first glance  i promise it is not   i've been trying to learn more about  blacklifematters recently as i've always just been content to sit on the  alllifematters bench and avoid the discomfort of learning more  to start this process i listend to the podcast 1619 and watched 13th on netflix   to start with  selling humans to get land or goods  the original proof that  corporations run on blood   but it continues through today  i strongly encourage anyone who hasn't watched them  to do so  even if you're ignoring the racism you can look at  the system  that feed politics  corporate greed or the devaluing all human life   i was already anti-work before these things  very much anti-corporation and anti-politics  that's probably why i was so observant of them for these past four hundred years  it was honestly concerning to me that this has been basically going on  in different forms  for as long as it has  we just have computers now ,hfd47i
235,It feels like I'm in the Matrix and way too few people have woken up,yesterday i've had a chat with a buddy of mine who's actually a really smart guy  he voiced his opinion on the pandemic and work from home situation  stating that he doesn't like it at all since he cannot be as productive as he would've normally been  i am still astonished by this   how can someone actually feel bad that he is not productive  this is stockholm syndrome at its finest   in what horrible world are we living that employers and companies have managed to instill this feeling of guilt into their employees so that they feel bad about not making enough profit for his bosses       i just had to get this out of me and this felt like the right place to do it ,hexu31

237,Sacrificing dream to earn money is new normal? Should I give up in my dream and pursue to earn money??,i am a 21 y o indian  and i don't really want to work  i want to travel and live a vagabond lifestyle but due to my culture and society and stigma of working class  i have no other option that to find a job once i graduate from my college  i'll be too soon    what should u do if you were in my position and don't want to work and want to live your life by doing what you like  i mean i know money is important but it doesn't mean i should sacrifice what i want from life  it's nothing like some glamourous dream like to have a mansion a car or a huge bank balance  all i want is to roam around exploring stuff and actually enjoy my life rather than spending it on pointless vicious cycle of working class ,hewxoj

239,We Can Protect the Economy From Pandemics. Why Didn't We? What's next? Asteroid Insurance?,interesting business article  i posted it here as i think it is ironic that capitalism's approach to mitigating economic effects of a pandemic is to productize it and profit from it  the article is basically about pandemic insurance  i like wired  but disappointed that they would herald this approach to what should be a humanitarian solution  not a let's sell some insurance and make a buck solution  we already pay unemployment insurance  we pay social security insurance  we sock away money in ira's  hopefully we do that  and now they want us to pay for pandemic insurance  i always thought technological advancement was  at least ideally or partially  to free laborers from tedious jobs that a machine could do so that those laborers could pursue education or art or other past times to better themselves and learn or study instead of having to work more than half of our lives just to put food on the table ,hej34e
240,Former boss who fired me a year ago sent an email pretending to offer me “per diem work.” I was such an awful employee yet he wants me back? Interesting!,just to be clear  i know he s 100  the greediest and most litigious bastard i have ever known  i know this is a ruse to make me disqualify for unemployment because he doesn t want to pay the teeny tiny tax increase that will come from what i ve collected so far   i m honestly not even sure if refusing not responding to this would disqualify me  because i m pretty sure that it has to have actual details of the job spelled out  also  i m not sure how the cares  no work search requirement  affects the whole  you must take any job offered to you  deal  but i haven t actually dropped below my normal hours this month and probably will not again  i m not really even that worried about it  it s just a great example of how fucked the system is  oh and when he fired me  he offered one day of pay   3 months of health insurance  in exchange for not filing for unemployment  which was essentially illegal of him to do    anyway  this is the email he sent me    hope this finds you well i got a notice from the unemployment of folks that you were collecting uc and they charge my from the fund that i had paid into  if necessary for me to cover a possible staff absence are you available for perdiem work please let me know thanks    sic  on the whole damn thing because he can t even bother to take the time to type complete sentences or use punctuation  he dictates emails and sends them 100  as-is ,hegq9d

244,The thought of going back to my overbearing coworker makes me ill,i had only been at my job a few months before lockdown began  uk  and in that time i grew to loathe the other person in my department  let s call her mary    mary is in her forty s  mary cannot work a computer  she cannot figure out how to open emails  she cannot work word  mary believes because i can do these things i am a technological genius  all day every day mary will interrupt me  demanding i stop what i m doing and help her  i try to teach her things  but she refuses  on one occasion putting her fingers in her ears and saying  look i m no good with this sort of thing  it s easier this way  we re allowed to have headphones in at work to listen to low level music  and one day i noticed that i was not able to get through a whole song without being interrupted and having to pause it   i made the mistake of giving mary my number when i started  her requests extended into the weekend  however these were not work related  she would text asking me things like how to share a post on facebook  how to unfriend someone  and even explain what twitter was    i have mentioned this to management  i was quite passive at first because i was new and didn t want to start my new job by complaining about someone  managements response was along the lines of  well she s been here a long time  it s just who she is  they didn t seem concerned that mary was preventing me from doing the job they paid me for    working at home has led to me being much more productive  mainly because i can actually do my job without her driving me crazy  but even then  she would use messenger to contact me and ask for help  and some of these matters would not even be work related  she once called saying she had just purchased a laptop and wanted me to set it up for her over the phone    work started letting us come back part time  they only wanted us to come in once a week basically to show our faces and start getting back into the swing of having a routine  the day we could go in was our choice  mary immediately called me  i m going in on tuesdays  i decided i was going in on thursdays  mary text me asking where i was on her day  and when i didn t reply immediately she called me repeatedly until i answered  saying that she felt it would be better if i came in when she was in as we would  work better as a team  in other words   come in so you can do my work as well as your own   work have now announced we are to return full time at the beginning of july  i don t want to go back  the thought of putting up with mary again almost makes me cry  i want to look for another job  but jobs in my field are scarce in my area of the uk and it took me a long time to find this one ,hfizst
245,Just had my car REPOd because of my job struggles - any advice would be extremely helpful,so  before this whole coronavirus situation happened  i was working happily as an uber driver making about  2 000- 3 000 a month  but then everything went to hell and it was no longer a viable work option  i stopped being able to pay off my bills and switched to shipt to try and make the money i needed  for the most part it was working well  not nearly as well but it was enough to make some money  i ended up getting lazy  though  and stopped working for a week and a half or so from mental exhaustion  plus i was enjoying spending time with my best friend online as much as possible   i was going to go back to working super hard with shipt  12  hour days plus uber afterward for whatever crowd i could pull in to make extra income  but went to my car today and found it missing  i knew i was behind on payments and called the company that handles my payments and they confirmed it was repod  now i have to come up with anywhere between  1 200- 1 500  of which i could maybe do like  500 right now  in order to get my car back  they told me on the phone that it would cost  300- 500 in repo fees and i'm about  900 behind on my actual car payment  i could maybe negotiate it down with them when they open tomorrow but i am not sure by how much or if i can get my car back at all  i might have to take out a payday advance loan  despite how dangerous that can be  and assuming i can even get that to work with my currently very terrible credit  but other than that i'm currently not sure what to do   does anyone have any advice at all  i'm on the verge of a severe anxiety attack from this happening today and recognize that it is  in good part  my own fault for not working harder  but i need to get through this somehow otherwise i'll have literally no way to make money and  soon after that  no place to live for me or my roommate who is relying on my portion of the rent ,he4tvo

248,Housing costs are disproportional and the largest weight on workers and society,housing costs and rent continually rise and is  disporportionally the largest expense for the working class  people can always adjust their source of food  limit the use of utilities  take public transit  or wear used handed down clothing to cut costs  housing on the other hand will typically take the largest portion out of your income and the continued pressure of the rent mortgage bring due is always looming above your head    sometimes i wonder what society would look like if the cost of housing was more aligned with other usual expenses  i imagine that people would feel more secure  happier  take more risks in business ventures  learn or try new skills  or quit the job they hate to try something else that maybe doesn't pay as much  the threat of potentially being kicked out onto the streets keeps people in the continual rat-race cycle to maintain having some form of a sanctuary despite the increasing cost   rant,he9ip1

251,WHY the system is so screwed,so much anger at the status quo  so many sad lives  so much hopelessness here  but at least put the blame where it belongs - financial corruption in washington  especially of congress  especially by big money  corporate and otherwiise  sorry  this turned into a rant  please read it anyway   an example  universities  the left and  the educational establishment have colluded to jack tuitions for their own benefit  brutally fuck students to the wall  even for a lifetime  they also created a false cover story promoted by the press  mostly corporate shills  that increasing college costs are what drive tuition upward  try  access to easy money  why on earth would a business whose only real production cost is maintaining buildings and grounds have huge increases in expenses   universities ignore a huge conflict of interest by conning students into taking out loans from which the school gets the proceeds - an absolutely outrageous violation of their public trust as educators of young people  that is why tuition has gone berserk - no  brakes from tthe market  everyone on the inside gets loads of money  including the dept  of education    the universities waste that money on fattening the adults who live in the system - worthless degrees  idiotic courses taught by idiotic professors  bureaucrats who make a living off the diversity scam  a-hole deans and administrators who spend their days suppressing the first amendment  federal compliance officers  etc   the truth is the educrats have created a phenomenal source of dirty money  supporting a vast  rotten financial base that keeps a privileged class insulated from the world outside - hidden behind lies that promote them as a force for social justice    take a close look at illegal immigration and you will see a similar corrupt structure  i wish the folks on here would understand that is a big reason why they are stuck in low paying  demeaning jobs    that is the reality of social engineering and reliance on government  not of capitalism  so are obamacare and venezuela  the biggest issue in front of the us is stopping the flow of corrupt money  corporate and otherwise  to congress  which creates such schemes and allows its members many ways to cash in personally  hillary clinton and joe biden are two corrupt politicos who have received billions in corrupt money by selling out the public - both acceptable as candidates for the us presidency    it is the people stuck on the lowest rungs who suffer the most   think about it ,he7fdm
252,Existential depression because of work,i'm glad i found this subreddit  i knew there must've been more people like me that feel existential depression on sundays or in general  i think it's the ultimate human tragedy that we only get one chance at life  atheistically  and we literally spend it working it away making someone else rich  and by the time we're allowed to stop we're already old and frail  ready to die  i think about how human existence was meant to be spent exploring the greater mysteries of life  trying to connect with nature through transcendentalism  but here we are - in the middle of a pandemic that is being downplayed by politicians bough by corporate overlords just so they can explore those same mysteries at the expense of human capital hoarding their riches  the depravity of our modern condition is that we were born into this broken social contract under the guise of civility and progress when it fact this is just an incredibly unfair food chain  the rich eat the poor  basically  sure  we are sentient beings that enjoy things no other species enjoy  like comfort  hedonism  consumerism  etc  but  is it really worth it  though  i think we'd be happier with underdeveloped human ingenuity - sometimes watching a sunset at beach knowing you don't have to worry about anything is way better than getting that new pair of grails or that latest smartphone that has a much smoother and seamless processing power to give even more of your identity away to the powers that be  i think our species was meant to be kept in eternal captivity  as if we are paying for past  cosmic crimes against existence  here i am working my life away at a place i hate  making someone else rich that has no regards for my health and wellbeing during this pandemic and i can't even quit because i need the societal construct of money to live  this is the closest thing to a hell that exists  i wonder sometimes if then the reward we get at the end of our lives is just nonexistence - the fact that we will form part of an eternal emptiness  blackness devoid of all human angst and joy ,hdytib

273,The Dead Horse Theory,the dead horse theory  the trial wisdom the dakota indians  passed on from generation to generation  says that    when you discover that you are riding a dead horse  the best strategy is to dismount   however  in mode business  education and government  a whole  range offer more advanced strategics often employed  such as   a buying a stronger whip   2  changing riders  3   threatening the horse with termination 4  pointing a committee to study the horse  jaw 25  arranging to visit other countries to see s how others ride dead horses  5 6 lowering the standards that dead horses can be included 7  he-cassilying the dead horse as  giving impaired  b  firing outside contractors to  side the dead horse  9  caressing several hero increase the speed  10  providing additional funding and or training to increase the deadhorse's performance  11  going a productivity study to see if lighter riders would improve the dead horse's performance 12  declaring that as the dead horse does not have been  its less costly  carries lower over head  and therefore contributes substantially more to the bottom line of the economy than do some other horses  19  he-writing the expected performance requirements fall horses  44  promoting the dead horse to a supervisors position of hiring anotherhorse                                    ,he4p3c
274,The hiring process is actual trash,i've been applying to some jobs  i need some money  and i like to create and help people  i've got a degree and do everything  right  when it comes to applying - and it's never enough    i googled this phenomena  out of curiosity  and the overwhelming majority of results are in - you are always to blame  and the company  well  you're just not good enough for them    resume looks nice  you interviewed well - but you don't have a social media presence and that cost you the job  sorry   you don't  network  enough  anxiety  introvert  very niche for the market  oof  that's a you problem  this other guy has way more friends from college so he got the job   speaking of college - you went  right  because you need a degree for this  10 hr phone job  oh you have a degree  well you also need this license which costs another  1000  and 3 months of your time  you have all that  damn  you're overqualified   this isn't just a vent post  it's alarming that so many people are unemployed for no reason  pre-virus  and are then blamed for their unemployment or even shamed for it  it's frustrating when companies complain about having no qualified applicants when they throw away 80  of resumes immediately  and it's insane to add more and more to the list of job requirements to the point of intruding on your personal life for them to pay you peanuts and call it kindness  the litany of  job help  sites listing dozens of reasons you are at fault for your unemployment is honestly hilarious - how could a writer be so tone deaf    i'm always reminded of how much i dislike work culture when i start looking for money again ,hdm10g
275,Careers that aren't bullshit?,hi there guys  finally read bullshit jobs by david graeber  one of my favourite reads ever  but it did make me realise my job as a data analyst for consumer debt where i shit out charts for my boss' 'new and efficient consumer tranches and segments' is largely bullshit  the impact it has on society is at best nothing and at worst probably pernicious  i want out   nothing made me realise that more than this morning while cleaning out my cellar while i was preparing to move house  i had my headphones on listening to podcast and turned a dusty mouldy mess into something aesthetically pleasing  i've long thought about how nice it would be to be a postman  just walking around with headphones in all day dropping mail  or a teacher or a plumber because those jobs actually do something for people    is there any resource that i can use to find the non bullshit jobs and career fields  i want out ,hfpjsu
276,I’m new and I’d love to hear your anti-work related thoughts,so whenever i start talking to people about the fact that we made up most jobs  and it s absolute bullshit jobs  mostly to keep pockets full  people think i m off my rocker and that i m just looking for excuses to freeload  but the more i investigate  the crazier the system seems  i m finding it increasingly difficult to pretend like anything matters outside of taking care of animals and nature who provides for us and loving each other being together building communities laughter isn t that all that matters  so what are some of your best arguments or insights to support anti-work ,h9pdw8
277,"Can't believe there's other people who think this stuff about work , I thought I was alone (rant)",i've been thinking this way about work ever since i got my first job at 15 and had a complete breakdown because i felt so bad for the people who worked at my job and were adults and had been doing it for years  it was working at a farm doing packaging stuff  at like 20 i called my mom sobbing because i was working a job that was  ruining my life  not because it was particularly bad  but because it took all my time and i was a young person trying to be free in the world and i was already trapped in this horrible cycle of work to live  live to work  but she didn't get it  and i felt so ashamed for being weak that i blame my depression and anxiety on other things so that people would understand  i just feel like  how did we all accept that working is what makes you a valuable human being and if you don't do it then you are not worth shit  it's horrible  and the thing is  if working wasn't absolutely required  i'd definitely do some of it anyways  just to help society  i'd gladly do it  but the way we have like limited what kind of jobs each person does means that everything is outsourced and each person is relegated to one form of contribution and i think it just ruins all our humanity and all our community potential connections  because when someone needs my help or something if i'm already working 40 hours a week  i'm way more likely to say  that's not my job   anytime i've criticized working culture in my life people have made fun of me like i'm stupid and just don't understand economics  which is partly true  i don't understand economics  it was because i was like what is job creation  if there is a job to be done  shouldn't it already be there  why are we creating it  but i know that humans are miserable and that should matter   i also think the people at the top are miserable  because they've bought in with their very lives and energy and time into this system that makes us all relate to one another in terms of money and production value  they're just rich enough to not be outwardly miserable  but i think this shit erodes your spirit and your ability to connect with other people    there has to be a different way to live  and  i hate that being part of the working class takes away your ability to explore art and ideas and have a forum to like discuss them and be seen and heard about your ideas about the world  you can still do these things obviously by yourself  but it just feels like there is no one who gives a shit about my feelings because if my feelings were correct i would have ascended the magical structure already  like why do we care about celebrities thoughts on things they have no background in  just because they are rich and famous we should listen to what they think about dieting  or about education  or child care  etc    this has been a rant  but i was really relieved to find some people who think that the concept of working your life away for someone else is crazy  thanks for existing ,h9vsad

281,Ever since I started working again I feel tired and unmotivated. Has anyone else had this issue?,i recently got a new job after a stretch of unemployment  and it actually one of the better minimum wageslave jobs   the thing is that i have lost all motivation to  do  anything  i have been playing games with friends less  focusing on school applications less  and just doing less stuff  i feel tired and drained  even on my off days  and completely uninterested in doing anything   the thing is i was so miserable at my previous jobs that i genuinely cannot remember if i had a motivation issue with them  so i was wondering if anyone else has had a similar issue ,h9wvsj
282,Ways to keep myself on track,hi guys  i'm a sixth from student who has a part time work at a super market  i hate sixth form  the only benefit is i don't have any friends or a place to go so i am constantly reminded of the terribleness of it  and the system it's trying to put me in  however i'm a very anxious person  we've been off because of the virus  but today i'm re attending and i'm anxious my anxiety is going to put me back in the terrible mindset i had before all this  the smoke and mirrors of being told unis the way  i'm saving to kick off a nomadic self sufficient path at the moment  is there any resources  books  people  mantras  anything you guys have that keeps you from falling into the capitalist echo chamber while your held down  i want to drop out  as my existence is depressing atm  my work is a mentally and unrewarding physically exhausting  and at sixth form i bounce between old classrooms trying to find space and having no one to talk to  and am under judgement from people who hold very different beliefs  i can't  and have seen that this can be one of two things  a time to fall int old habbits  or prove my strength agianst the system ,hbazop
283,It's so sad that all my talks with my family are me answering their questions about work,like its how we relate to each other  when they update me on my brother its about how his job is going  it's never about him  it's about the company  and when they talk to me it's always about when will i go back to work  and i'm like eh i don't care i'm having a good time not being there and they are like  we thought you wouldn't do well without a job  and then i can literally be like i'm doing great but they don't believe it  and still want me to get back to work  it's like these companies like have taken over our very personalities and connections  so many of my friends from hs when i see or talk to them its about work and i try to talk about other stuff but like they just aren't separable from their jobs  it makes me feel like such a loser for still working an hourly wage job when some of my friends have like salary jobs  because i don't really want to share about my work as if it's like part of some long career journey  it's just what i do to survive  i guess we just chose different paths  but it's like were getting further and further apart and i'm scared one day we wont be able to relate to each other at all  how sad is that ,hahsf6
284,Work is increasing everyone's shifts by 2 hours because of coronavirus yet we still only get a 20 minute break.,i'm honestly so angry about this  my work is reopening soon and they've decided to put us into 'bubbles' so the same staff work together and if someone in one bubble gets infected they don't spread it to everyone    so now we're all doing 10 hour shifts for the foreseeable future  no choice  no apology and no extension of the pitiful 20 minute break that we should apparently be so grateful to have because its paid    i'm so stupid  i really thought this pandemic might improve working conditions but clearly it's just going to make them even more intolerable    i hated my job anyway so this is just the icing on the shit cake ,h9qnbc
285,"I'm just not a big fan of acting ""professional"" at work. It's so two faced.",of course there has to be some sort of professionalism and rules set otherwise people could act however they wanted  still i feel like a phony superficial robot who can't express how they feel at times  i'm just holding it all in and suppressing any real  feelings i had  i know i'm not the only one  i know there's plenty of people who are hiding their true feelings in fear of getting in trouble  once work is over then it's like this huge weight is taken off your shoulder    you can be who you want to be and that just doesn't serenate well with me  why do you think so many people vent after work  because they have to hold it in and can only talk about their true feelings when the boss isn't there  it's always  omg  bill is such a complete asshole  he's so hard to work with  i know it depends on company culture and usually good work environments let you be free but this is something i notice ,hb1hwr
286,I work for a caryoonishly evil corporation and I don't know what to do,please let me know if this is the wrong sub for this  but i'm horrified and i don't know what to do  the company i work for is a for-profit care home  it is straight up evil  here is a brief list of what i have seen since starting  one month ago    - life-threatening mismanagement and subsequent blaming of employees for corporate fuck ups  meaning clients lives were at risk because of policy  and employees were blamed for issues they tried to bring to the company's attention for a full year    - consistently asking people to work 16 hour shifts and not giving overtime  unless asked directly    - withholding money needed to buy clients food  clothing  and other essentials   - withholding client's personal funds for months at a time   - consistently paying fewer hours on pay stubs than were worked  i was paid  300   the  1000 i was owed this pay period  and when i asked my coworker who to contact she just said  oh  they do that a lot    there's so  much  more  but i can't go into detail because of client confidentiality agreements  so i feel utterly trapped  i'm considering being a whistleblower  but i'm terrified ,ha6b3d
287,18 and unsure of what to do,i don t know if i m anti-work or not  i ve been working for the past 2 years  16-18  and after a while of being at the job  second job due to being forced to quit the first  i just don t feel the spark to come in  sure  i ll do the job to the best of my abilities but after a while i just begin to cut corners on my end so i do the bare minimum  lately i ve been hearing about all of these things that  conspiracy theorists  say will happen  such as the covid vaccine  etc  and it makes me think  i don t want to be controlled by the government  and i don t want to be stuck in debt if i do go to community college  10k approximately for 2 years  i don t really have any skills  and i m an anxious person socially most of the time  i m a female and my dream goal is to be a housewife  but i know i need to make money to live and move out sometime soon  as living with my parents is horrendous for my mental health    i want to know how i can find skills that are profitable  my interests include cooking  dancing  fashion  photography  editing writing  cleaning organizing   side note  i do sex work on reddit  this is a side account  which makes some money  but not nearly enough  my mental health also affects how much sex work i do on here  so it s not a feasible income at all ,hbja6v
288,Job forcing me into resigning because I'm having childcare issues due to covid and wanted to extend my leave. Said if I didn't come in today they'd be willing to accept my resignation.,what do i do here  i've been a long time lurker on this sub  i'm only upset because there will be no money coming in  i was a new employee at this job and hadn't finished my probationary period  the issue may be that the childcare issue i'm having isn't due to a biological child  it's a step child    but my partner is sick and the family would woukd watch the child aren't available at this time ,h9o3hj

299,"We need to break the economy of slavery, once and for all",the problem is too many people believe that a slavery based system is the only way to make things work    the problem is the slave system has been in effect from the early days of where there is registry of a civilization    capitalism simply changed the style of slavery  instead of directly threatening people and using physical force and deliberate mechanisms to make the slave work  now we have psychological schemes that make people believe that the right thing to do is to be a good slave    one of the basic concepts is to switch the idea of slave-work to  career  and to  be professional  instead of the physical punishment a lazy or rebel slave would have  now there is the psychological punishment  where the person is regarded as unworthy  valueless  despicable  deplorable  a loser  a waste of space  a self-absorbed parasite  a free loader  an enemy of society  a diseased  a ' jobless  person is not a person  and the vast majority of people hold that type of view    even if an individual is a helpful person  a person that actually does things that would be considered  work  if they were performed under an official contract  but there's no paycheck  the person is viewed as useless  if you simply go about helping people  doing lots of work  but has no official  career  you would be seen as a bump  a drifter  a hippie  but if you have an official job with a monthly paycheck doing nothing  you'd be regarded as a productive member of society   also  in many jobs  the amount of money the person needs in order to be eligible to participate in that kind of work  social position  can be equivalent to the actual pay the person is getting  therefore the person's salary is used only to maintain her as a functional worker  basically  the money they get serves to pay for the lifestyle attached to the job position  that is the very dynamic of slavery  the slave has what is necessary to properly perform their daily functions  i'm not disputing that life quality has greatly improved to most people  and that real slavery with violent punishment was much worse and a horrible thing  but the social dynamics are still prevalent today ,hcglhv

303,A fork in the road.,hello all  just found this community and really connected with the ideas i have been reading about here    i am a 28yo nurse  i have been working for about three years in nursing and i m halfway through my masters degree    some back story  my dad passed away a few years ago and he spent his entire life working 80 hours a week until his last few years where he actually got to live a life he enjoyed  then he died    that shit changed me  i realized how fragile life is and how much i did not want to do what he did  because of this i have been studying the fire movement  if you haven t heard of this its financial independence retire early  basically how can you best save and invest your assets to retire at a younger than normal age  this post isn t about investing strategy  but is a tool i plan to employ    anyhow  i m starting up my school again in the fall and i have two more years until i graduate  my masters degree will come with a considerable pay raise  but i can t honestly say that i m excited to do the job  i can t honestly say that i like or love my job that i have right now  that s not to say that i m not good at it  i m actually pretty damn good at nursing  but i got pushed into the career field by well intentioned parents    i do have special moments that i will cherish forever  and i am thankful for those  but by and large i view my job as a way to earn income and nothing more  i am proud of what i can do to save someone s life and i am very thankful for the opportunities that i have had because of nursing  but it is a job  philosophically  i don t understand how someone could love something that they have to do  i need to work to earn money  by definition  i am not acting upon my own volition  i am in the sense that i chose the job but you essentially have a list of options that you must choose from  you don t get to choose to throw away the list entirely  all in all  i want to throw the list away  i want to quit working by becoming financially independent  i m not sure if i should invest another two years into education and 15 grand  it will bump up my pay considerably  but i m not sure i can handle the stress of it anyhow  the problem is is i m so far deep into it i might as well finish and at least have the degree  who knows  maybe i ll love what i can do with my masters  or is that just another dream the system wants me to believe  after all  i wouldn t be getting my masters if it didn t give me a pay raise    i figure this will be the place to ask this type of question  i m new here i appreciate any thoughts you can share ,hbsy42

306,"Alexander Berkman, ""What is Communist Anarchism?: Will Communist Anarchism Work?"" (1929)", but what will you do with the lazy man  the man who does not want to work  inquires your friend   that is an interesting question  and you will probably be very much surprised when   say that there is really no such thing as laziness  that we call a lazy man is generally a square man in a round hole  that is  the right man in the wrong place  and you will always find that when a fellow is in the wrong place  he will be efficient or swiftness  for so-called laziness and a good deal of inefficiency are merely fitness  displacement  of you are compelled to do the thing you are united for by your inclinations or temperament  you will be efficient at it  if you are forced to do work you are not interested in  you will be lazy at it  ,hafhh0

308,"Investing: To play the game of capitalism, or not?",this is something i've been thinking about a lot lately  to opt for the  invest most of your income so that your money goes to work for you  strategy  you're essentially betting on the stability of capitalism for the next few decades at minimum  it's also in a way immoral if you're a hard leftist and thus consider all capital as theft  but at the same time i can't really blame anyone for playing the game  that's how you succeed in capitalism after all   my question is is this even a good idea  are we reasonably sure that capitalism won't be overthrown within our lifetimes  would you be willing to accept that in the event of a socialist revolution  your entire stock account will be null and void and you'd basically have to start over  thus making all those resources poured into investment kind of pointless ,hbxpxi

310,The Opposite of Having too Many Work Hours,i see a lot of posts here talking about how their bosses make them sit around for 8 hour days doing nothing  when the job they re paid to do could be done in half the time  but what about the opposite of that    i work in retail  where every job description is ended with  and more tasks as assigned  i could work here 24 7 and still not get done all the work that should be done to keep this god forsaken store at a good level  but the people who work themselves into the ground running around doing as much as possible get paid just as much as the people who chat all day ,hcmpzj

314,What are your thoughts on feminism?,if i were a woman  i would not want to work 40 hours a week  i would prefer to stay home and take care of the children and cook and clean  all of these tasks do'nt add up to the time spent on a job including getting ready and commuting   cooking and cleaning can be done in 2 hours  meal prep to save time  vacuums  swiffers  dish washers etc make household tasks quick and easy leaving more time to spend with the children    theres no boss  do everything in pajamas  play music  watch spongebob with the kids  that seems like a much better life than going to work everyday  i find it hard to believe that women would give that up to go work a job    if i were a woman i would not want to be equal to a man if it means working a 9 to 5  i rather not have to work  ironically women have given up what seems a better deal in the pursuit of equality    anyhow these are just my thoughts  what do you think ,h9p1z9

318,Only 2 Months Into My First Job,and i can say that this is without a doubt one of the worst experiences of my life thus far  it's fucked up my mental health just as it was starting to improve and my entire life has become about work  when i'm off i have no energy to enjoy any of the things i used to or to even write my book which is what i got the job to fund in the first place  there is never a moment now that i'm not anxious because my next shift is always right around the corner  all of this just for money  a concept that i don't even agree with  who the hell thought selling the extremely limited amount of time of our one chance at existence for some bullshit imagined value was a good idea  the worst part about all this though is that i'm only 19 and have an entire lifetime of this bs left if i want to live a  normal  life alongside everyone i know and love  i've been seriously contemplating becoming a vagabond or monk or anything really because i refuse to waste my one chance at life like this  i'd rather die right now than live the rest of my life as a wage slave ,h9l55e

321,How long do you think it's going to be before employers start including the deep and dark webs into their background searches on prospective employees?,of course it will never happen  you say  it's an unconscionable invasion of privacy and a gross breach of the sacred and implicit but endangered separation of work and personal spaces  but keep this in mind  at least 25 states have passed laws preventing employers from asking for  demanding  coercing  etc  employees to provide passwords or access to social media accounts  such as facebook and twitter   those laws are there for a reason  they weren't developed by forward-thinking legislators taking proactive steps to prevent this from happening  they were responding to employers who were actually doing this  facebook went live in 2004  it became available to everyone in 2006  remember  prior to that  you had to have a school email address associated with a participating college or university  i recall the first news articles about the practice of employers asking for the social media passwords of prospective employees appearing in 2008 or 2009 or so  facebook reported 500 million users in july 2010   think about that level of ubiquity  more people than lived in the united states were on facebook  and suddenly  an entire country's worth of people's social networks were the subject of scrutiny by their employers  who you were friends with  what they said  what you said  about whom you said it  your political opinions  your sexual orientation  facebook was a window into all of that data  and employers were predicating people's ability to earn a living on access to that window   after numerous breaches and scandals  and all sorts of individual travails  no doubt  we have all learned a big lesson about privacy  we have developed a certain cultural understanding about how social media ought to be used  how to curate our image and how to adjust privacy settings in order to create different virtual social spaces with different functions and different levels of intimacy   but there's still a way into that window  and  if they did it once before  do you suppose that our employers wouldn't try again to gain access to it   when you get an alert about how experian or target or your bank or  yeah  even linkedin got hacked and your data ended up on the deep and or dark web  you're usually offered some complimentary credit monitoring service as a means of apologizing  just in case some bad actors get a hold of your accounts and start opening credit cards or running pump-and-dump scams in your name  but nothing comes of it  and  eventually  you forget it ever happened   your data isn't being abused because there probably just aren't any buyers to whom its worthwhile  most cybercriminals are motivated by monetary aims  and your data is  potentially  the means to that end  your emails probably aren't exciting enough and your bank account probably isn't big enough for anyone to put the work in to extract that information from you   but what if that information became valuable in and of itself  what if there was an actor out there who was interested not in converting that information into money  but just in seeing it as it is  what if there was a large organization with funds enough to invest in acquiring that information and examining it in order to predict people's behaviors  to gauge their opinions  to see if associating with them poses any reputational risk  that's what a background check is  right  when you go to take out a loan or get a new job or rent an apartment  this is the kind of information that people want to know about you   so  if someone gets a hold of this data and uses your name  your email address  your driver's license number  your social security number  etc  they can use that data and the data that you have freely provided them to track the movements that you previously thought were invisible  what you say on reddit  the beer you drink  what kind of porn you watch  your opinions on abortion  what kind of medication you take  what kinds of books you read  where you shop  what you buy   some of this information will be available to people who want it without even having to break a law  they won't have to hack an account or buy a password  all it is going to take is a username  in most cases  just one search for that unique callsign that you use could turn up dozens of sites where you have made comments  uploaded photos or left reviews  everything that we do online leaves behind an artifact  and if someone knows what to look for  those artifacts are breadcrumbs that will lead them right to your window   and  as for someone being able to purchase your password and use it to climb through that window  take their shoes off and really feel the carpet in your house between their toes  metaphorically  speaking  of course  i think there is actually a lot of opportunity for large  powerful  well-funded organizations to take advantage of their resources to affect changes in legislation such that obtaining our passwords will be either outright legal or associated with repercussions that are so minor as to be negligible   the primary piece of legislation that covers passwords and accounts is the computer fraud and abuse act  cfaa  which was originally passed in 1984 and primarily to provide protection for businesses from monetary damages  it's 35 years old  it's been amended a number of times  most recently in 2010  but given the rate that our technologies and the way that we use them change  i think it's safe to say that the law  in this case  was written to regulate a reality that doesn't exist anymore   do you remember that spate of headlines that said you were going to go to federal prison for using your brother's girlfriend's friend's hbo password to watch game of thrones  well  that was the result of the court decision over a cfaa revealing that the law is not well-defined  the united states v  nosal was a trial about a guy who started his own business and hired former coworkers to obtain information on his behalf from his former employer  the implication in the decision was that  if by violating a terms of service by sharing a password opens you up to federal prosecution under the cfaa  then everyone who shares their netflix password is committing a federal crime   but that seems excessive  netflix clearly isn't suffering much from password sharing practices  it reports billions of dollars in revenue hundreds of millions in profit every year and it doesn't pay any taxes   the problem is that if and when the cfaa is amended or replaced with legislation that clarifies what constitutes  defrauding traffics  by using passwords to achieve access without or in excess of the authorization granted to a user by a terms of service such that it's okay for us to use each other's passwords to watch our favorite sunday night shows  depending on how that is phrased  it might open up the door for corporations to start using those passwords that they glean from the deep and dark webs to access your accounts and see what you have hidden behind your privacy settings to look through your window  so to speak ,hbkjxq

328,In trouble with HR for sharing my negative workplace experiences,tl dr  i'm in trouble for honestly sharing negative experiences at my company   long rant ahead because i am pissed   i have worked for greedy healthcare company  ghc  for a mere six months  and it has been a nightmare   they screwed up my benefits  so it took 5 months to get things sorted  and i was passed from phone line to phone line to email to phone line  rinse and repeat for weeks   i quickly began to feel like ghc  was doing whatever they could to avoid providing me the benefits i'd been promised  but i didn't give up the fight   finally  as of june 1st  5 5 months after hire  it was sorted  but who knows how much i overpaid in that time frame because our pay stubs are impossible to decipher   it also took 5 months to get my cell phone reimbursement  which ghc only finally agreed to once they required i work from home  and i was using upward of 1000 minutes per month   since i've been there  we've lost our previous director  3 full-time nurses and 3 prn nurses   others in the office are looking for new jobs  and i haven't stopped looking for a job since a month after i started   ghc is the kind of company that just combines job titles when people quit or when they make cuts  so i'm already working under two job titles  then have also been  delegated  a laundry list of other massive projects  including one that is 100  a nurse's job  and i am not a nurse   my concerns have been met with   oh  it's easy   you can do it   you're so responsible   you're so organized   meanwhile  no instruction or training is being provided for anything   i trained myself on how to do my highly regulated  medicare-dictated job and i know i'm doing it wrong in many cases  but i don't know who to go to for help   the others with my title had no training  either   my boss is 90 days late submitting my 90-day review  it's done  she just hasn't turned it in  and she's constantly telling me we should talk so she can teach me how to do some of these  delegations  and even though i remind her at least once a week  nothing ever comes of it   but the final straw is that they are refusing to give me a copy of the job description i signed on hire   my requests have simply been ignored   so i left an indeed review that gave a short version of all these things and gave the ghc 2 5 stars   honest and representative of my experience   i deleted the review a couple days later when i realized it listed my job title  which would easily identify me  as i'm the only one in my office   but it was apparently too late  as i received an outlook calendar invite yesterday that said   conference call   the only participants were myself  my boss  and our regional hr person   i asked what it was about  and my boss just said   your indeed review   our patients and their families are suffering because greedy healthcare company cuts left and right and demands more and more of whoever is either brave or stupid enough to stick around   i have a job interview today 45 minutes before my hr  conference call   please wish me luck   i can't take it anymore ,hasw31

331,Employers assume their employees are stupid.,i guess this realisation fully hit me today when my previous employer  temp agency  thought they could try deducting negative unworked hours from my last paycheck  at least that's what i assume happened because the maximum number of hours they can deduct under certain circumstances is the amount that's missing  i'm still waiting for my paystub for details   see  the collective agreement that my labour contract is based on is cut and dried in that regard  the temp agency can deduct up to a certain number of negative hours a  if the employee quits on their own or b  if the employer terminates the contract without notice  this can only be done under circumstances  like theft  i guess    neither of which is the case for me    all i had to do was find a pdf of the collective agreement and read the bit about deduction of negative hours  it's not even a matter of interpretation or exception  the right to deduct unworked hours from an employee's last paycheck clearly doesn't apply in my situation  and still they tried    they count on people not knowing their rights or deciding that legal steps aren't worth it financially  they feel invincible  superior and like they are above the law  it's sickening ,hc3yma

333,Receiving unemployment benefits should not be frowned upon.,we are born into a society that puts us to work from the moment we start school until we are old and sick in retirement    5 days a week  8  hours a day from age 5-6 to age 60   60 if you're lucky   getting 26 weeks of income for sitting on my ass is a pretty trivial benefit compared to the aggregate amount of years spent working   0 5 years on ui   55 years spent at school or work     0 91  of your total years before retirement  so that's compensation to sit on your ass for nearly 1  of your years spent at school or work full-time   yet  people shame me if they find out i'm on unemployment  they seem thoroughly disturbed by it  they look at me with pity  maybe with disdain as well   this lazy pos leeching off society  come on  get the fuck back to work you sloth  this mere 1  of my working years being subsidized infuriates them   a message to any others on this sub who are fortunate enough to qualify for unemployment benefits  don't let these kinds of people ruin your fun  if you qualify  that means you deserve it  you've earned it ,hbt76r
334,I’m starting to enjoy working? Please help,hello everyone  i m in a bit of an unusual situation and really need some advice and would like to hear what you guys think  money has been running tight lately so i was forced to pick up a new part time job at a local grocery store  i had to mentally prepare myself because i heard the horror stories about working in retail and interacting with customers   anyway i started working a few weeks ago and was expecting the worst  but my experience so far has actually been not so bad  the pay isn t incredible  but it s several dollars more than what i was making before at my old job  what s more is that my coworkers have all been very welcoming for the most part  and i ve made a couple of good friends already  in all my previous workplaces everyone just kind of ignored each other and did their own thing  but here people constantly chat with everyone else while they work and it makes the shift go by so much faster   the management at this new job is also a lot better than what i m used to  at my old place my manager would get super mad whenever i needed to take a day off  but here they re completely fine with it as long as i let them know beforehand   so here s my dilemma  all my life i ve been against the idea of working because i believe my time belongs to me and me alone  why should i put in so much effort so the rich get richer  but ever since i started this new job i ve found myself being excited to wake up every morning  i don t know how to feel about this but i m starting to get worried that i ll become a bootlicker at this rate   im afraid that if i stay  the capitalism will delude me into becoming their supporter and make me lose faith in socialism  for that reason i m considering quitting this job and finding another that i ll be miserable at  but at least will have a peace of mind that i will firmly remain anti-work  do you guys think this is the right way to go from here ,hblrx7
335,Why ?,why is it the time away from work just fucking flys by  like it was all just in 15 minutes  then you spend that same time at work or  hell  and it feels like you ve spent a week there in a hour  i m so sick of this ducking country and the way we live   time to work out in the rain  get bitched at  then come back and do other people s job with no o t,hbbv6u
336,Proof (if we even needed it) corporate tax breaks aren't going towards workers,i work for a healthcare company doing the work of an entire team as just one person  i manage a multi-million dollar budget and have complained that i'm drowning and need help for the past three years  every time they say it's not in budget and that  this is your job  make it work    today  they told me that i'm getting  2million extra in budget and i need to find new ways to reach three of our most trickiest demographics  i went silent on the call and then said   wow  we have 2 million to spend on prospecting but not on the help i've been asking for  who could fulfill this job full time better than i could with my limited time    their answer  well  this is government subsidized money  it's not long term  so we can't hire another person and keep them each year  this money is for now   i just fucking greyrocked and shut down the rest of the conversation   there is no trickle down  there is no soul or heart in a company  it's not family     2 million dollars to a corporation  and we  the people  got a one time  1200 check and a ton of us complaining about the unemployed collecting  600 mo until july    i'm so done  i would've joined the circus if i knew life was this much of a shit show ,ha2vrl
337,Wanna get knocked up so I can be a stay at home mom,okay i can t be the only female who sort of fantasizes about this right  i hate working so badly that i wish i could find some sort of sugar daddy who would make me a housewife or a stay at home mom so i never have to work another day in my life  it sounds bad but it also sounds like one of the best options  anyways i m in a long term relationship and am very happy so it s not even an option but i feel a little guilty hoping my boyfriend gets rich one day   the good news  i am very transparent about my desires to stop working and thankfully we both want a future that can make that happen for me  but i still have a long time to go until we get there and i am really getting so exhausted because of it  also my boyfriend is one of those people who actually like working so no  i m not taking advantage of him  sounds weird to say but i literally can t wait for the day where my only concern is what to cook for dinner and maybe vacuuming the house ,h9xc4f
338,"Got a new job, now I am just sad.

340,A solution to replace compulsory work by replacing capitalism,i know we all feel strong feelings about what's happening right now  we are furious because we are not allowed to feel  but we the people  are clearly expressing we have had enough of this shit   as long as the corrupt own the means of production  we will never truly be free  we will never truly be heard  and we will be forced to work  as long as capitalism exists  your working life is not going to end    i wanted to share with you something i've worked on for the last 4 years  a simple but powerful alternative to capitalism called senatism where work is optional but encourages  a true meritocracy   i don't care about cash  fame  or anything  i'm writing this anonymously  i just want this idea to spread  i think we can do a lot better than what we have  and when the people do take the power back  we're going to want to avoid making the same mistakes that got us here   the website is    http senatism org http senatism org   please take a look and please  please  please  challenge the idea  make it better  keep the conversation going  the time to throw capitalism out was centuries ago ,haf4uc
341,Don't forget: your eligibility to find housing is also dependent on your shit job,my partner and i have been filling out rental applications lately  i'm somewhat new to the requirements for applying for a lease on a new apartment or house  and i am straight up appalled at some of the requirements we need and the amount of info the landlords need at times  here's a few examples that make my stomach turn   1  credit checks  you need an acceptable imaginary number that is based on your spending and debt  are you trying to save money by not having a credit card  fuck you  you can't live here    2  income verification  screenshots of your paystubs from your shit job  don't forget that they need your managers' name and number so they can verify that you are  in fact  a wage slave  don't make three times the amount of rent per month for a house that probably has rats and has no washer and dryer  fuck you  you can't live here   3  bank verification  not only do they need a credit check  they also need to take a peek at how much money you have in your checking and savings accounts  to make sure they can bleed you dry when they require a deposit that is rent x 3  oh  you don't have enough money for a deposit that we're probably never going to give back to you when you move out anyway  fuck you  you can't live here   4  work history verification and housing verification  they need a list of every job and place you've lived in for at least the last three years  do you not have the phone numbers  addresses  names  and company titles of every single individual you've ever lived with in the last three years because you were desperately floating from room to room in an effort to not be homeless  are you not in contact with every single individual you've ever been forced to live with in every single slum you've ever been forced to stay at  fuck you  you can't live here   5  pets just fuck you  you can't live here     so not only do i have to be a wage slave for my whole life  i also have to beg these fucking slumlord bottom feeders to pwease pwease let me live in their shitholes and prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that i am indeed a subservient little robot that works for the capitalist machine  this shit is in every fucking facet of our goddamn lives and there is no escape from it  not even our friends and family who mostly just ridicule us for not wanting to spend 75 percent of our only life on this shit planet on work work work ,hbtoe5
342,What if slavery abolition had another purpose?,foreword  i'm not encouraging slavery  it's been an immoral practice for millenias  wrong and people in this sub know how  modern slavery  feels like  so     anyways  i just had a random thought earlier today  what if  back 200 years ago  when slavery in the us at least  was abolished  it wasn't abolished for the sake of the slaves but beacuse some dude in the 1  or top ranks or call it whatever you want  thought  you know what  why enslave a few when we can enslave everybody     put it this way  inbefore slavery banning  there where pretty much two major social classes  the upper class  made of laid back fat fucks who made slaves do all their chores  sounds familiar  and the lower class  people who were living by what they were producing  such raising animals and growing vegetables  a point of start where the upper class was at some point in time too  there was the middle one as well  you could think of proffessors or doctors but they were not as common as today  this is mostly for the fact thay cities were not as big and developed as today and most of the population was living in the countryside  also probably  this is the point where the whole  work hard and you'll make it big  bullshit story was born but this is for another discussion   yet  the industrial revolution happened and you really couldn't expect to cover all the workforce needed for the different emerging industries with the back then existing slaves  that baby born capitalism needed more workforce in order to satisfy its belly to grow up into what it is today  so they replaced slavery by employing people who needed money to survive anyway and who didn't have a choice but to find a job  fast forward to 2020 and this sub exists     let me know what you think ,hcioz3
343,Capitalists are more afraid of you dropping out sustainably than of violent revolution.,not to say they aren't afraid of revolution  all their fears turn on it  but a process of dropping out and organizing externally to the system in an intentional way - as opposed to the  tune in  turn on  drop out  ethos of hippies - is an important component of revolution  and one neglected by contemporary revolutionaries  without it  revolutionary movements become reabsorbed into capitalism  even whilst retaining their radical premises   a revolutionary movement would have to have external capacity  for food  shelter  personal support  etc  supplied for by independent freeholders etc  and an internal revolution is gonna necessarily be preceded by a bunch of people trying to get outside to create these conditions  if you can start finding ways to do this ,hc7wn1

353,"Choosing money over happiness, or happiness over money",i grew up in a very underdeveloped  impoverished area of the united states  where rugged individualism and pulling oneself up by the bootstraps was basically dogma  the picturesque images of my country i saw on tv  the lavish lifestyles- all of that did not exist in my hometown  i come from a family of poor farmers  one of my parents left my siblings and i  and the other one died  i spent part of my teenage years living with a social worker and her family  and another part of it with my grandparents  who got lucky and found a 'career' later in life that enabled us to enter the middle-class   i never understood the obsession with money  mostly because i lived somewhere that lacked the opulent luxuries that many people on tv had  not really much to do if all you see is fields  one gas station  and one grocery store  i worried more about being bullied at school for having autism and being gay  the hard-drug addicts that roamed the neighborhood  and whether or not my family would be robbed again  than i did about status and  what do you want to be when you grow up   my educational prospects were severely hampered due to my upbringing  the public school i went to was not up to par with the state's standards  and it was very hard for people to advance to university level  if they managed to get that far  many people were not prepared for the rigor and got very poor grades or dropped out   i was told that my education was the most important priority  as it would open doors towards a future career  i was forced into perfectionism  and have always felt broken when i fell short of that   i had a traumatic event happen during high school that gave me severe ptsd  this crippled me  especially later in high school whenever i was taking college level classes and working at a part time job- because my foster family didn't adequately provide for us   i fumbled whenever i managed to get into a very low-tier university that didn't even offer my stem major  and despite getting good grades  had to take time off to do minimum wage warehouse work because i struggled academically  was very stressed  and really needed more money   there is absolutely no industry and no jobs where i live  so you typically have a 2 hour daily commute to even go to a ramshackle city with some fast food joints and walmart target   this was honestly the worst time of my life  i was in an abusive relationship and my ex boyfriend coerced me into working full time and being his personal housemaid  my feet and back have never felt the same since i was forced to work retail  warehouse  and food jobs  but if i didn't have a job  i was useless to everyone   despite the fact that i dedicated lots of time towards learning algebra  geometry  trig  and other subjects i had not properly been taught in school  so that i could return to college    i transferred to a respectable school that gave me a full scholarship for computer science  didn't realize things could get even more miserable than when i was wage-slaving full time for walmart  the stress and the pressure to succeed was suffocating  i never made a single friend  as people were competitive  cutthroat  and seemed to care more about expanding their linkedin network than companionship  my school did not provide me any disability accomodations and seemed to get frustrated whenever i complained about the conduct of some faculty towards disabled students  and how it was impossible to get academic help from them    i've had over 10 different therapists  and been on over a dozen psych medications over the course of my lifetime  but none of it helped  i was so drugged up last year at university i could barely function  all because i was not being productive enough and  depressed   when the reality is  i am depressed due to the state of the world and the crushing reality that my whole life has been spent trying to be someone i'm not so that i could succeed in the rat race  not some chemical imbalance   i realized i could not go on at that school  i was so upset everyday that i couldn't even will myself to go to class  around this time  i had started seeing someone long distance  and went to his country to visit him over one of my academic breaks  living in the english countryside seemed like an escape from the dog-eat-dog capitalistic hellhole that i was living in  so in secrecy  i began applying to uk universities  my grandparents pushed me into applying to transfer to other schools in the usa  and i hid that i was trying to move to the uk   i got an unconditional offer to study what i truly wanted- neuroscience- at a pretty good russel group uni  rather than push myself further in the hot mess general education curriculum here in the usa  the kicker was  i also go accepted to an ivy league school  and have been pushed heavily to attend due to the  prestige  and the career prospects that come from being in the upper echelons of academia   however  i'm honestly sick of everything that is happening in my country  i don't give a shit if i get paid a lower salary after graduation when i start my work visa  i don't give a shit if i can't buy 10 different brands of pasta in the store  i don't give a shit if i have to give up some of these  luxuries and freedoms  everyone seems to treasure so much  i hate the idea of a career  but i'd much rather pursue potential happiness in a place that won't work me to death rather than pulling 60 hour weeks as a minimum wage lab tech here in the states  or being a developer-slave to a massive corporation    everyone is saying i am stupid to give up the chance to go to an ivy league- if they give me decent scholarship money  i need some reassurance that my decision to take on some debt and pursue a better life elsewhere is worth the sacrifice  would you pick potential happiness over money ,haxijl

373,Worst Work Stories,i would honestly like to hear your worst work stories  the most horrible and unthinkable things that your managers  coworkers  etc  have done either to you or someone else   back in 2012  i worked as a teller for a large bank in new england  one morning at around 9 am  my father  who was only in his early 40s  had a heart attack  i was scheduled to work at 1 pm  when i got to the hospital  i called the manager at the branch and explained the situation to her  the first words out of her mouth were   no no no no  we are really busy today and you need to be here for 1 pm  i explained to her that i was going to stay with my father  who at this point was critical  she would not take that for an answer and kept insisting that i call her back in 1 2 hour and let her know what time i would be in  not once did she say anything about my father  i was beyond taken back  and yet  unsurprised  i ended up blowing her off because the bank was the last thing on my mind that day   at around 1 30 pm  and after 4  missed calls  she leaves me a final voicemail saying  hello  i just want to let you know that everything is under control at the branch  and then goes into telling me a bunch of work-related stuff  again  not once bringing up my father or saying any kind of condolence  i found the whole situation to be sickening  over the years  i realized that most managers and companies operate in this inhumane way  it's always business first and the customers first   my father ended up recovering that day but died a few months later ,ha4n0g

375,What do you do for income?,i know we all hate the grind  but what do you actually do about it  what alternatives do we have   i'm genuinely curious because i'm looking into the possibilities for myself  i'm 28 and i know i will never work full time 9-5  because mentally i cant handle it  but at the same time i dont want to be chained to the rental system or have to rely on anyone  i'd like to be self-sufficient  and i want to be able to travel overseas every couple of years or so    so far i've looked into tiny houses and living off-grid  travel blogging  freelancing  or working random jobs like farming etc  but i'd love to hear real life stories because it makes it more achievable in my mind   how are you receiving income  whats your living situation  and your quality of life  what is your ideal lifestyle and do you have a plan    thanks  ,hbqjve
376,Retail/customer service is absolutely the worst kind of job,i've had office jobs  outdoor jobs  driving jobs  warehouse jobs   nothing compares with dealing with jerks and idiots who don't know what they want  i sometimes work parts and accessories at a powersports dealership and get people all day long asking for parts with no prior research done first  telling me they need xyz when each thing requires looking up their machine in the system and sifting through part diagrams  the best is when people bring in a random piece from their bike like a bolt and tell me they need a new one  how do you expect me to know where on the bike this thing belongs  go online and get me the fucking part number it takes 2 minutes and makes my job easier  people are just so lazy it's insane    thank god i only have to do this job when one of the two usual parts guys call out  i'm usually in the warehouse down the road shipping and receiving for the dealerships' ebay store  it's tedious work but at least i don't deal with the fucking public  how people do it every day and not want the economy to collapse is beyond me ,haodql

379,"The concept of a ""two weeks notice"" should be ABOLISHED. Employees should be free to quit a terrible job on the spot without it being taboo or burning a bridge.",feeling the title pretty hard as of late  can't give explicit details for privacy reasons  but basically  i work for a private company that sends me out to individual clients cases   i currently only have one client case and it's been a nightmare since day one  i am the only employee who's been able to handle the client  who is the most volatile  demanding  neurotic  and rude person i've ever worked for  i've tried splitting the case with coworkers just to deal with her less  to no avail she complains about them all  and they've all been promptly removed from the case  for reasons i'm still not entirely sure of  she only wants me  so i've been dealing with her shit for a year and a half now  i find a lot of her choices to be super shady and unethical  choices i often have to personally carry out for her  though they make me feel anxious guilty af  all i can do is express my concerns to my equally morally bankrupt boss  who doesn't care   early into the case  i was fed up and ready to leave my company  not only because the case was miserable  but because my pay was absolutely terrible  so i found a new job and put in my two weeks  because this case was so unusually big in terms of hours  my boss was making a lot of   on this case  when i gave notice  my boss and her assistant hounded me almost daily trying to get me to stay  they knew that finding a replacement the client approved of would be borderline impossible and they'd likely lose the client if i left  as an added bonus  the client was especially treating me like absolute garbage at work every day because she was so very pissed i was leaving  then my boss played her final hand  a 5 hour raise  basically the industry maximum  so i ended up staying   the client ended up getting a little better for a while  then the pandemic hit  and it's back to square one in terms of her being a neurotic nightmare with terrible ethics that my crooked boss happily enables  though i will likely have to take a pay cut if i leave  i'm at the point where i've made the choice to do that  very soon   but given how my company and my client handled my two weeks before  i'm determined not to put one in again when i find a new job  i do not want to deal with the hostility from the client  which i think will be much worse this time around  and my boss basically trying to get me to sell my soul for a price    in my opinion  even in the best of times  i think the concept of a two weeks is total bullshit and if someone wants to quit a miserable job on the spot  it shouldn't be taboo  i've heard many stories where the company fires the employee during the two weeks  wtf  or the bosses coworkers are extremely hostile unprofessional in response to the notice  which the employee has to just awkwardly deal with until they're free to actually leave something i know firsthand   i know i'll ultimately burn the bridge when i leave my company without notice  i know a lot of people would tell me to suck up the abuse that'll come with a formal notice  but i just refuse  but i've done good work for this miserable company for 3 years  so losing the good reference just feels so unfair to me   if any of you have advice on how to get around this shitty situation  or just getting around putting a two weeks in general with minimal issues  i'd be open to hearing it  overall  i just wanted to vent about this shitty practice formality  it really should be optional if not abolished outright ,hcq7ce

381,Told my boss to go fuck himself today.,i'm really into backpacking and i like to take a long weekend sometimes to go on a three night trek  i'm an electrician and i was doing overtime today  i was planning on doing one of those three night treks just over a month from  so i stop in the shop after work and my employer is there so i very kindly say i'm gonna take one day off one month from now after having just given him one extra day of my time  he says he can't do that cause he might need me  no again i'm an electrician and the company is not busy at all right now and even if it was  my missing one day of work won't stop production it just means the crew will get slightly less done that day because i'm not there  so anyways i told him i wasn't asking and to go fuck himself and then quit without a two week notice  guess now i'll be doing the whole long trail for a few weeks so i ain't complaining now    may seem a bit harsh to tell him to go fuck himself but he is an incredibly controlling boss who cheaps out on us every oppurtunity he gets  once some of the guys got in a car crash on the way to work because he sends them so far away sometimes that they have to drive at 3 30 in the morning and fell asleep   we also don't get travel lat for going two hours  one way every day  fortunately noone got too hurt but they were bruised up and first thing he said after asking if everyone was ok was that he would really appreciate it if they went to work today     i'm fortunate enough to have been able to save lots of money and have no debt  no college needed for electricians  so i can afford this much time without working ,hcvb9j
382,99 percent of jobs are bullshit jobs,do we really need doctors  nurses  lawyers  police  judges  bankers  polititians etc    why not everyone just live on a farm with their family and grow their own food   boring life but simple   i know the reasoning of what if you get sick  what if violence  what if disputes  what about money  leadership   ask yourself  do doctors stop people from getting sick and dying  can doctors help everyone who is sick    do the police stop violence from happening  do they even help or do they often make things worse    do judges deliver justice  does the justice system even work    does money stop people from starving or is it the reason millions are starving   do polititians provide good leadership or do they mostly make false promises   do any of these jobs solve any of the problems we have had since the dawn of time    if the answer is no  then they are bullshit jobs and we can live without them    if all of these jobs are bullshit  is it fair to say the system is bullshit  i'll leave you to ponder that ,hcr534

384,We don't know peace,we never get to have a moment of true peace  capitalism is always pushing us to produce  think  educate ourselves  we can never have the present  we are always working towards something  anxious  with deadlines approaching  the fear of starvation  of falling behind  of not being able to  be good enough for the market   our psyche is completely molded by capitalism  it's hard to even imagine a different type of social mediation other than the commodity  anxiety is ever present  neurotism and psychopathy developing  unbriddled  necessary to navigate the world  to produce more  to tolerate more  to push for more  to disdain the value of human life in favor of commodity production and circulation  our minds atrophied  too focused on abstractions that have come to enslave us  too weak to break the order  consumerism and anchoring to that which we consume  in a ritualistic fashion  as if it were our personality  expressing ourselves through the commodity  it's all so broken  it's all so pointless  i sometimes wonder if it's even real  it has to be a joke  right  our society couldn't be more divorced from use-value  we let the homeless die in the streets while we guard pieces of paper and commodities like they were more precious than any living being  how corrupted can we be  what's the effect of the value-form on us  even  are we just subject to it  or do we become stronger  empowering our own twisted mechanisms of destruction   what could we create if all of the limitations and obligations imposed over us by work were lifted overnight  how would we use our new-found  freedom  and expectation of free-time and development across our lifetime  could we deal with that landscape  or would be shackle ourselves and others once again ,hb4ftw

388,A lot of these problems on this sub are American only,i live in balkans  technically you could say eastern europe   here we get our at least 30 minutes of rest  if you go out you can see people sitting down drinking coffee at what would be considered rush hour  people not working super fast  not taking coffee-to go  but actually taking their time to sit and eat drink   we also aren't all about work  not all of us  like americans are  we also don't have to drive 2 hours to get to work and back  everything is relatively close   at the same time we enjoy the good things about capitalism - we have our tvs  our gaming consoles  our phones  all of that good stuff  and we work 40 hours a week  not all of us and not as hard as americans   we have a lot of problems  our economy is kind of f-up  it takes us waaay to long to sort out documentation and stuff  but working experience by itself ain't as bad as people on this sub make it out to be   maybe its a cultural thing  maybe if americans didn't have this work culture maybe then employers would actually have to treat people better ,hbczci
389,In conversation with an evil capitalist.,just browsing this sub and it's nice to get a different perspective on things   if anyone wants a chat with someone 'from the other side' then i'm here all day    i sympathize with the antiwork stance  work is troublesome  but i believe it's a necessary evil and if everyone had adopted an antiwork lifestyle  we'd still be in the stone age  so we're actually fortunate that historically  the concept of antiwork wasn't popular  mainly because no work has always meant starvation  i'm pretty much failing to understand the stance of antiwork and would like to hear an argument against work that gives me an  ah ha  moment  maybe i can learn from you  maybe you can learn from me  perhaps not  who knows    amp x200b   i've heard a few people expect homes  but not want to work for them  this i cannot understand   an example i like to give  is the house example  do you have any idea what a technological marvel the modern home is  and you want one for free  i know a lot of people who've built their own homes  good quality ones at that  it's cheaper than buying  but you need project management skills at a minimum  you can too  assuming you've got the skills   the skills required to construct a home are many and learning these skills is highly difficult  if you don't have these skills  how can you ask those that do  to use their skills and labor to build you a home  they've got other things they'd rather be doing  like not working   it's up to you to convince them  how you go about that is up to you   what about this do i not understand ,hc3j88
390,American capitalism is psychologically murderous from a very early age.,if life's a playground  we ought to sue the designers  there are way too many sharp edges and needles buried in the woodchips   school as such is bullshit and should be abolished in favor of vr-oriented education for higher learning and small apprenticeships for hands-on learning  the forced socialization of public school is soul obliterating billshit on par with factory farming  even those who enjoy the experience do not escape it unscarred  the  only reason it exists in this fashion  - and yes  i am targeting the  public  school system  which isn't magically separate from the society around it - is to ready individuals for the labor force    capitalism produces emotionally flat introverts at extremely high rates  this is again a response to enforced socialization after spending one's formative years being marketed to with bullshit - i can remember gi joe being one of the early triggers for whatever brand of narcissism i unfortunately have   the point is that  yeah  capitalism  is to blame  we  don't  have to blame ourselves  it  is  the system  your very responses to basic social relationships are deeply colored by your formation in school ,hcanfq

407,I wish profitability were the actual goal here.,long story short  the management at the place i work at are focused more on appearances than efficiency or even profit  i say this based on what i've seen during the past week  covid has resulted in lower work orders and less shifts  so someone upstream in accounting must have calculated the minimal number of workers needed to complete work and maximize profit  this meant the guys that sort the product containers in the warehouse didn't come to work and i had to do their job in order to do mine  i load and unload the containers  i did 2 jobs for the same minimum wage  this means i work slower than i normally would and output is diminished  but hey  money saved by not paying workers   on top of that  i was next to the foreman's office when i heard him screaming  i shortly found out that someone had used their phone on the job and that the section leader was being reprimanded for not policing the no-phone policy  we were 'reminded' to turn our phones in before starting work  i'd never been told this before  i found this a bit inconvenient because the lights on the 1st floor storeroom are blown out and it's almost impossible to read the labels on the products late in the afternoon and impossible during overtime hours  which is why i used my phone flashlight to check labels  but i suppose appearances are more important than productivity  right  and don't get me started on overtime  seriously  this company is run by ego-centric eggheads that don't understand that their cost-saving measures are actually losing them money   edit  i still hate the fact that i had to sell out by getting a job just to be able for food,h85bge

409,600€ for a fulltime job.,hey  this is like my third post here  i think     i'm a trades apprentice  the reason im doing this apprenticeship is solely because i want to have my own brand  company one day  because i had no other idea and it was time to get a job  at every cost      the job was kinda annoying but mostly ok  i liked the field i was in  art supplies  good compromise instead of studying art  and my colleagues  but one  were cool     until recently  the company i work for was sold to a much  much bigger chain a few months ago  now we will become a normal hardware store  my section was removed and even though we are all taken over  i was put in the only department into which i didnt want to go  tiles     im going to try and make the best of it though  only 2 years left  at the moment we're dealing with a mix of the plague crisis and the change of lead crisis  my job is pure chaos at the moment     i'm being purely exploited  i work 32h per week  school and i get 600  for that  i work a bit more than she shift says  every day  yet somehow my hours are in the minus area     im expected to dedicate myself completely to selling goods  heart and soul into it  yet i only get the min  apprentice wage and no boni     i'm expected to put heart and soul into the apprenticeship but basically i'm almost self taught because the company doesnt give a shit about me and doesnt teach me anything  but if there were to be a deficiency in my grades  for example  it would be my fault  im sure     i'm depressed and finding motivation for anything is hard  today i'm in for another 10h shift  i dont know how to survive that ,h9aaiv

411,''If you don't like it leave it'',that's the words the regional manager said to us branch staff at the beginning of covid lockdown in the uk  the reason she said that is because everyone was complaining about how the company was handling covid   'i don't like it so i'm leaving it' is what i said to my manager today to pass to the regional manager  i did it as i gave my resignation and made it explicitly clear it was because of the rm's comments at the beginning of covid   it previously took them months to hire someone else and i'm the only full timer  due to the nature of the job it takes roughly 6 months to be fully trained up   fair to say they're completely fucked and will have to close 'shop' for a while ,h9d9qv

416,Time sinking demands for a PHD application,long time lurker here  best and realest sub ever  i am wondering whether the following demands are normal for a phd vacancy  especially the parts highlighted in bold    candidates must submit the following documents  1  a recent curriculum vitae 2  a letter of motivation of a maximum of two a4 pages  explaining your interest in the project and detailing your suitability for the scholarship 3  a copy of your diplomas with a list of course grades  4  2 letters of reference from academic referees 5  a research proposal of up to 2000 words  covering state of the art  main research question  key objectives  and relevance  the proposed  methodological  approach  a brief description of the relevant literature  and a provisional timetable  6  a writing sample of no more than 5000 words  e g  an essay or part of a master s thesis   honestly  i have applied thus far for 3 phd's and have been invited three times for a first interview  but rejected in the second interview  so i am not some shit candidate that is lazy or has some terrible resume    but a 2000 words essay  why the fuck should i spent so much time on something  when i am not even guaranteed to be invited in the first place  wouldn't this make more sense as a second interview    i hate those who waste my precious free time  although i like the project  i am not sure if i will apply for something that is so disrespectful of applicants time   what do you guys think   any one present here that works in academia ,h7qpfq
417,Work makes people not realise what really matters,so i have been leeching off my parents and have had a lot of free time as a result  a lot of times i feel bad that i am not working and being irresponsible  which i feel is due to social conditioning  but i also realise that many people are unnecessarily working    in my free time  i get to think about what really matters in life how to live life  and stuff like that  most people who work at corporate jobs think that to be happy you need a better lifestyle  travel a lot  eat at expensive restaurants  buy expensive cars etc  without a job  or even with it actually    you  won't have these things and you would have to keep doing what you dislike    with this mindset  life becomes miserable and guess what makes you feel better  a bit of junk food or porn or alcohol or anything materialistic  you just want something exciting very quickly so that you don't hate your job so much that you quit  you wouldn't get enough time to even think about what's wrong with your life  or even if there is anything wrong  over time  maybe people accept that life has to be of misery    the other thing is that since i don't consume much  i can afford to have a low paying job or quit working early if i start working  but when someone consumes a lot   because that's how they can enjoy life  they will always feel like they don't earn enough  and they cannot quit anytime soon  and it keeps them in that cycle of consumerism  while never enjoying life as it is meant to be ,h882tn

427,"The paradigm of leeching off someone vs. ""earning"" your money is fundamentally nonsensical",many of you guys still living under the paradigm and narrative of being self sufficient vs  being a leech are not really taking into consideration the reality of how nonsensical the economy is   you would feel guilty 'leeching off your parents' perhaps if you have to live at home with no income or not enough to get your own place  but somehow would not feel guilty if you for example had a job of slaughtering hundreds of chickens full time for a paycheck in some factory - while having to shit in a diaper standing there killing chickens all day because that work place doesn't allow toilet breaks   yes this is a real actual thing  look it up if you think i'm making a job like that up   that money really ought to be given to you  you earned it killing these animals pumped with hormones that will produce cancer in those that buy them to eat while you're shitting away in your diaper you citizen of the land of the free  way to contribute and make the world a better place  thank god you're doing that for the world you wonderfully contributing admirable citizen  you   having kids in this world and telling them   when you grow up you must work full time or starve to death on the street even if whatever work is available to you is soul crushing stupid pointless made up bullshit - you have to do it  to avoid starving to death on the street  and we will not help you in spite of choosing to unnecessarily bring you into existence to begin with  is insane to me  they are responsible for taking care of you as long as they can and if they don't and don't want to  well alright  i just think that's fucked up that they chose to impose all that on you   we live in a world where a most wealthy people are wealthy precisely due to leeching off of slave wage labor and where a tv star earns in a few days what a firefighter earns in literally 40 years of full time work   i've done the math no joke   so whatever money you do or do not have is not legitimately or fairly or justifiably yours  no one's money is actually theirs  it's an arbitrary made up concept   no one  earns  their money it's not fair or deserved  it's all arbitrary   biological existence in general is quite unequal and unfair to begin with but then even more so is the human man made economic system   like imagine a firefighter asking christiano ronaldo for a 20 just to help him out in a pinch somewhere   and christiano ronaldo who 'earns' in a few days what the firefighter would earn in 3 lifetimes goes  nah that's my money i don't believe in hand outs  you need to earn your own money   you are not in actuality leeching off of your parents at least not anymore than companies leech off their employees or their customers  because whatever money anyone has is never legitimately theirs to begin with  nor is anyone's  it's all made up and arbitrary  we all just need food and shelter  the money stuff is made up   christiano ronaldo is a multi billionaire because football is an avenue through which companies can sell beer and cars etc   so alcoholics and the destruction of planet earth through oil over use pollution of the air etc  is the reason why he is so unfathomably rich  he is rich due to fucked up things   so the idea that someones money is and should be theirs in some justifiable sense is completely delusional to me  how do you know that you would view it as appropriate and fair that they get that money to begin with ,h77jyo

(Rant), tldr below  let s say i  a capitalist  create a job where a person is to simply copy  by hand  the text written to a 1000 page textbook onto sheets of paper 100 times  and i pay them minimum wage  it is possibly  in the modern age  one of the most pointless jobs to exist  but i would be hailed as a  job creator   stimulating the economy  and the worker who does the work would be seen as a  hard worker  with  an impressive work ethic   just earlier  i had an argument with my mother and sister on the nature of jobs that exist for the sake of jobs existing  and i mentioned that the 40-hour week is an arbitrary construct design to drain people of the energy needed to rebel against the structure  they then defaulted to the idea that work can be 30 weeks  but i suggested that it could be even less if we evaluated what our real needs as society are  remember  i m just starting with lesser work hours  i can t even discuss communism yet  immediately  i was called  lazy  and that  people need to work     conclusion tldr what the hell is this  these are the same people that say that they would be  bored  with retirement  and if everything were automated  they ll simply invent new work to do  or more accurately  beg some capitalist to do that  because work in our society is defined by the capitalist paradigm  if you independently decide to copy textbooks and you re not making money doing so  people would think you re wasting your time  if you do that under employment  you re a  hard worker   so what  exactly  does it mean to be  lazy ,gzu0le

447,We're wasting the one chance we may ever get in our lives to protest and strike against modern indentured servitude.,we are in the midst of a pandemic  the system is in shambles  some face a dilemma  starve  or potentially send themselves to their death  aka covid-19 filled workplaces  in order to put food on the table   this is the opportunity of a lifetime  our one chance to kick the enemy while they're down  they realize now  more than ever  that they are nothing without our labor  they are constantly trying to manipulate us into  reopening the economy  and  getting back to work  whether it's through misinformation about the virus  cutting off unemployment insurance  or who knows what else   this is an insanely rare opportunity  they are begging for us back  desperately leaning on the support of our poor essential workers  elon musk had to threaten his city officials to get his workers back  we need to kick him while he's down  not just him - the universal him  we must refuse  once we go  back to normal  this window of opportunity will close  most likely until we die of old age   instead of protesting and going on strikes to end wage slavery  the masses are fixating upon one of the many issues in our system  systemic racism  yes  black lives matter  but are people seriously putting their lives on the line to speak out on that one  singular issue  when they could be fighting against so much more in addition  against the wealth gap  against modern indentured servitude  nope  they're eager to get back to their beloved jobs that they feel  lucky to have  they  miss  their jobs dearly   wage slavery affects all of us  whether we see it or not  all races  ages  genders  etc  except for the billionaires and multi-millionaires who are hoarding wealth  the 1   if people are going to protest  i think they should protest the big-picture injustice we all face  while they're at it   people should be going on strike for a  25-hour work week  for  universal healthcare  for a  minimum of 1-month pto  at this time  these strikes could actually work  if all essential workers go on strike and the large corporations have literally no one for a period of time  i could actually see them budging  no bail-out  no matter how much cash it is  could save them from that  giving into our terms or at least negotiating would be the only way they could stop a full-blown  anarchistic collapse and the greatest depression to be seen in history   it's too bad we've been blessed with this unique opportunity at a time during which the masses are too blind to see that their employer is their enemy  they only see the obvious enemy  corrupt cops  but the sly  disguised enemy  their employer  still has them under the spell of corporate stockholm syndrome ,gzyva6

449,Why is it even legal to ask employees to sign away their collective bargaining rights? Anyone in any job should be allowed to unionize.

452,Memes are proof that money is a lie - and offer a way to spread that awareness,i know this sounds asinine but just give me a few paragraphs to get some momentum   you can't exist in 2020 and not intuitively just  know  what a meme is  even those that exist totally cut-off from the online sphere would get the picture after a few examples  most typically we think of image macros like  this https imgur com sc1nbl7  or  this https imgur com yw2quqt  but these are just a couple of modern  digital memes and don't begin to scratch the surface of just  exactly  what a  meme  is  and why the answer to that might be really fucking important   for example  a picture doesn't need any text to be a meme - similarly  a picture can be  only  text and still be a meme  a phrase can be a meme  or even a single word  a sound   symbols https en wikipedia org wiki cool s media file 22cool s 22 svg  the structure of the building you're in and the design of the device you're reading this from are memetic artifacts  musical subgenres  fashion and style trends  social patterns and institutions including family  marriage  property  law  crime  and punishment  even complex ideologies - religious  political  and philosophical - are essentially very nuanced and enduring memes that span hundreds and thousands of years    it's difficult to think of anything that is not a direct result of memetic repetition  as this is the way in which all information  beliefs  and ideas are shared and become socially entrenched - this method of transmission is directly related to  and reveals something specific about the origins of power  authority  control  and choice  and how we relate to those concepts and ourselves   human behaviour and response is memetic - a product of pattern  repetition  and context rather than a series of conscious  decisions  we make at every moment - this is not to suggest we are totally bound and determined by fate  but only that we are bound and determined to act only in accordance with our own character - we are not  something  responsible for our decisions  we  are  our decisions  and for that we bear responsibility   can you imagine trump acting like anything else besides a caricature of pure petulance    that s his role - his constitution   i think the belief that he  or you  or i   make decisions  is backwards - partly a product of the language we use to speak about ourselves and the world  and partly just our basic instincts - it's plainly obvious that i am aware and alive and can consider many possibilities so it only seems to follow that i must exert some influence over my choices   to me  there is little distinction between  me  and  my choices  - i am those choices  not a separate entity that chooses - that stands separate  considers  and then finally pulls the equivalent lever corresponding with the  'choice' i ve made   those final three words are superfluous - to me they all reference a single thing - a localized  happening  from my specific perspective   this idea is naturally unpalatable as it would seem to not only absolve one of all responsibility for wrongdoing  but also rob one of their ownership over both their good actions  and artistic creations   i think this is simply a knee jerk reaction to protect the ego's sense of itself as something distinct and in control  as to accept the opposite comes with a great sense of powerlessness     responsibility is not something we take - responsible is what we are   language has an implicit kind of magical quality - by that i mean much like the imagined casting of a spell  it is widely assumed that speaking the right words in the right combination  and order  can influence and compel people to act  and this  action  is the source of change  this is why great orators have always possessed great influence over the course of history - someone must be able to give  power  to an idea that can move masses to act as a single  unified force of nature   i don't believe individual human action is ever the true catalyst to change - i think it is human action predicated on and driven specifically by the memetic concepts we have at our disposal - most importantly   what is good  right  valuable  and true   language is itself inherently biased  limiting and divisive -  black lives matter  means absolutely nothing until it is interpreted  and language is always loaded with judgments  as much as it is the primary way we communicate  ironically it just as often obfuscates and confuses because the kind of language we have available to us directly determines how we understand and conceptualize the world  and ourselves  it is not a matter of merely being peterson-ianly  precise  in our speech  because precision is meaningless if the principles that precede it are incompatible   how many proponents of any ideology have  actually  read and engaged with its foundational and supporting texts    probably very few   how many have absorbed bits and pieces through their specific context - language  culture  family  friends  media  and memes   probably almost everybody   these repetitions of pattern connect us to something far greater than any single one of us - our  collective  human ideas about value  function  purpose  and their relation with each other - memes are a portal to the sum total of all human knowledge  experience  and feeling - memes are threads sewn into the fabric of the tapestry of reality  connecting us to the past  present  future  each other  and something totally separate - something unspeakable that yet demands to be spoken of   you may have felt it when engaged in something everyday and ordinary  yet struck as if for the very first time by the majesty and totality of all there is - all experience happening right now  billions of distinct and separate simultaneous happenings  disconnected and separated only by virtue of the limitations of their own collective conceptions of what is real  what is true  and what is possible   this universal need to communicate and share - to be heard - is intimately linked to creative and artistic expression   memes are innately communal and creative - they are meant to translate a feeling or thought into a shareable format that can be used  related to  and understood  and community and creativity have a direct and intimate connection to both art and play  two characteristics central to the human experience   art is itself its own distinct form of language - a language that transmits ideas and feeling only through its interaction with another  art is our way of speaking telepathically - a way to contain and convey something enormous and infinite bound in the confines of an object   memes and artistic expression both reflect something crucial and universal in the spark of our human spirit - both are inherently creative and communal - they represent the human need to share  something intimately linked with community and altruism  art can of course be done selfishly  but there is no artistic expression at all without the memetic patterns that allow that expression and an audience to engage with and be receptive to the artist's message   memes are thus quite a bit more significant than just funny and relatable pictures we share - what a meme is has direct implications regarding what we are  and our current shared cultural conception of them is simplistic and  as a result  limiting  if we don t fully grasp what a meme is  we lack the capacity to both comprehend their true power  and the ability to wield that power to our own collective benefit  instead  we persist in an ordering of society that enriches only a small handful that have fallen to the top through nothing other than circumstance and who insist this  must  be the natural ordering of the world simply because it is the  current  ordering of it   can we really trust those who wield inordinate amounts of power to fairly consider how it might be meted out differently   is the fate of society directly tied to the fate of the billionaire class  or to the  current institutions  of policing and governance   from where is their authority and power actually derived   the primary source is our shared belief that these institutions are legitimate and just   the secondary source is their ability and willingness to inflict violence on us if we do not accept the first source    violence is of course the most powerful and persuasive avenue of acquiring and maintaining power - both literal violent acts  and indirect violence inflicted and facilitated by a system of organization that regards the principle of one person's right to hoard obscene amounts of wealth as a higher and more just one than providing the material necessities of life for all people   that is the basic moral principle that serves as the keystone of the structure of our society  as it is currently ordered   do we really believe those with obscene means deserve it   what about those with such means that they could lose a thousand yearly salaries in a single day and not have that impact their quality of life in the slightest   the divine right of kings still rules  although now it's simply the divine right of the wealthy   we are meant to believe this is just  the way the world is   i find that idea just as intolerable and narrow-minded as those that believe it   society bears little proof of functioning properly anywhere - properly as in for the common good of all people   if we instead understand  properly  as to the obscene and perverted benefit of a small few at the expense of everybody else  then it is functioning tremendously properly   individualism is too often championed by those who don't understand the distinction between it and selfishness  and this crucial error acts as the basic foundation for an entire wing of political and philosophical thought which insists might makes right  and  value  is directly related to money and money alone  where everything can be spoken about in terms of it's worth in terms of the us   - one of many currencies that can  in an instant  become as good as worthless due to nothing other than our shared confidence in it   now i want to make some statements that are broad and general  but ones that i think are fairly common and subconscious  these are not meant to be statements of fact  merely word and concept associations to get us to see how we arrive at 'facts'    the relationship between progressivism and conservatism is like the relationship between masculine and feminine  which itself is like the relationship between individual and community   consider this disharmony between two opposing  or complementary   principles as essentially the basis of all philosophical  and thus political  thought  also consider opposing principles as really a  single thing  as opposites always exist only in relation to each other   this sounds a lot like some meaningless new-age woo  but i think many people make these associations subconsciously anyway  even though we can offer legitimate arguments against them   just conjure up some typically conservative imagery and symbols in your head - what kind of qualities are emphasized  what is deemed valuable  good  and of worth  what foundations precede these symbols    the inescapable and global grasp of the internet and the smartphone was a pivotal evolutionary shift in human history  comparable to our discoveries of fire  agriculture  steel  and the combustion engine - all of which are only  useful  through memetic transmission   the internet and our constantly connected culture has allowed us to  in a sense  act as a very rudimentary hivemind  our access to  and saturation of information  media  and communication is both constant and instant -  it is now possible to share our thoughts with almost everybody there is  - our friends and family  their friends and family  people we don't know and never will  people in another country  and people who perhaps don't even share the same primary language as us - a single sentence spat out into the ether can potentially reach billions of people on the planet in a matter of hours     you  me  and everybody else has a form of direct access to nearly every other human consciousness on this planet - what could we possibly use that for   memes  of course    to crowdsource the question of 'what is good '  because that is what lies at the centre of all action and belief  the fact that we have seemingly become ever more divisive and politically polarized is not to be tutted at or wished away  but rather acknowledged as the  only way  in which an outcome - truth - can be arrived at  spread  copy itself  and propagate to the point where its opposite seems wholly and utterly absurd   accepting all of this  it is possible to understand  humanity  not as an abstracted collection of billions of separate individuals  but as a single   unique happening of organism environment  that can  given certain factors  act in unison   the most important factor is  of course  each self knowing and feeling that they are a part of this greater self  which is not something that can be forced  but something  like creation itself  that happens spontaneously   one can edit and correct and obsess over the minutiae of an artistic object  but inspiration strikes  it is not conjured - it is never willed into being  it is rather being itself which then acts on our will   those advocating for either a progressive or conservative approach to policy can not compromise  not because the facts are in disagreement  although that is true  but because what comes  before  the facts is not in agreement - that is  the way the world is structured and ordered  or  the way the world is  which always itself acts as the background for an ideology rather than the reverse   the idiom  'seeing is believing'  is actually totally backwards -  the truth is that  believing is seeing   so  if memes are the true catalyst of human action and social change  can we then  meme ourselves  into a better reality  can we  together  engineer  build  or construct a meme to spread and transform our shared  collective  un conscious and the ideas that follow about not only what is true   but what is possible   i believe so  and i think a good place to start is to understand the  illusory and mutable nature of money and wealth  and their direct relationship to power and authority and the distribution of these things  money is a real 'thing' that performs a necessary function  but our shared understanding of it holds real power over it  and in this way we can collectively shape and alter that power it commands over our lives    we can't function without money  but we absolutely can function with a novel way of distributing it so as to lessen the total amount of suffering directly related to poverty and the inability to provide materially for oneself    does jeff bezos really have billions of actual  tangible currency  or is his currency really in the form of power and influence  as represented  by money   is the standard work week from monday to friday  or monday to thursday    whatever the answer  is it because this is simply  the way the world is  or is  the way the world is  directly shaped by our collective ideas about it   the state-sanctioned brutalization and modern lynchings of black men at the hands of  law enforcement  in the u s  is itself a memetic pattern -  law enforcement  tactics are memetic  including their violent response to protest  organization  and the legitimate outpouring of anger directed at the inhumanity of the institutions of  justice  the video of george floyd's horrific and senseless murder was spread memetically  and so too were the calls for protest all across not only the u s  but the entire world   a memetic call for collective struggle has been sounded  and heard by the entire planet - now is the time to take this opportunity to understand ourselves as one  to tear down and rebuild the arbitrary social patterns of power and control that rule  all  of our lives   the 'legitimized' armed wings of state  police and military personnel  should stand with the people  not as their opposition - stand with them in demanding justice and equality for  all people  and the dismantling of a system which treats all conscious beings as resources  and like its treatment of every resource  exhausts it to the point of annihilation    a single officer taking a principled stand  to cross the illusory barrier of us other could be the crumbled brick that begins the collapse of the whole structure  all it will take is one person of good conscience to do something difficult  but something good  to memetically begin a shift towards a better  more equal society   if you can't bring yourself to do that  you just may be an enemy of the people   see how compelling language can be  nested within every word is paragraphs of subtext  assumption  and implication   enemies of the people are just that - enemies to a free and emancipated existence    to preserve life  violence may sometimes be the only option  violence can be avoided memetically - you cannot put a bullet in a concept  and it s just as futile to do the same to those who espouse  exemplify  or believe it  not to mention a wee bit of a moral grey area  violence can be lessened with the correct memetic foundation that underpins our conception of 'self'  'other'  and 'world'  and the reciprocal nature of those things - violence is given power by distinction and separation  but that power can be neutered by understanding that not only are you yourself  you are every other self  too   the global economic and social reaction to the coronavirus is proof of this shared power our collective thoughts have over the world we inhabit  of course we cannot simply will it out of existence through a shared psychic exercise  but we can decrease the destructive potential through the memetic spread of ideas like social distancing    it has also laid bare that the distinctions and lines in the sand we use to divide and categorize are mostly illusory - the global community  as the aggregate of every other community  group  faction  and individual  is where we must focus our collective efforts  there is no nation but earth  and to shift our reality in the direction we want  it will take collective effort    the emancipation of all humanity must happen together because of the memetic nature of change and our connected world  there is no freedom until we are all free   somebody called the police because of a suspected counterfeit  20 and here we are   imagine what can be accomplished together  by simply altering our beliefs about what is inherent and immutable  and what is merely a byproduct of antiquated memetic artifacts and the resulting methods of ordering and structuring society    we can meme ourselves better   black lives matter   white supremacy does not   land matters   landlords do not   people matter   profits do not   billions matter   billionaires do not   collective ownership over the instruments of profit  production  and class stratification is  our  right   food is a right   water is a right   shelter is a right   healthcare is a right   education is a right   freedom of expression is a right - this includes the right to quell and dismantle the violent rhetoric that enables violent expression   these things are only true or false based on our collective ideas about what is right and what is valuable   justice should not be owned by anyone  it is owed to everyone   humanity is an organism - a unified field of conscious relationship and pattern from micro to macro  comprised of each one of us   knowing what we are is the first step to becoming what we can be    we can meme ourselves into a better tomorrow  together ,h0ys8b

458,"Is anyone else annoyed by the concept of ""noble"" poverty (Don't know what subreddit to post this in.)",i know some people who work on farms here and there  and make handi-crafts to sell  and work in farmers' markets  and they dress in shabby clothing  they buy second hand clothing to be 'moral'  and they've got this attitude of like  we're so anti-capitalism  we chose the simple life   meanwhile every single time there's an accident or emergency  or f they decide want to save money  or if they simply don't want to pay for something  they call their parents and their parents bail them out   so they get the positives of  poverty  such as a totally cool  anti-establishment image  and freedom from the workplace  but none of the negatives of  poverty  such as   literally the definition of poverty  stress  anxiety  health problems  a lack of money to get the necessities in life or to weather more serious storms  etc   i'm trying to be open-minded  but everytime they lounge around talking about hating the concept of working a boring job for money  i imagine the physical violence  sexual violence  drug abuse  mental and phsyical health problems that my family and the people i know in real poverty faced and it's a bit much   no  i can't call them out on their bs because i'm trapped in a small place with small town politics  i'll be leaving soon  i just need to grind through this   it's probably easy to read into what i'm feeling as jealousy  but it's it's not like i don't like them as people  yes  i'd love to be able to do what i want  safe in the knowledge that someone else will pay away any issues i come up against  but i don't want them to  not  have these things  i'm glad that some people get to live their lives without being forced into slavery in the capitalist system   but  i just can't bear listening to them talking sometimes  due to their lack of self-awareness  it's like when someone gets hired straight into a managerial position in their parents' company and then talk about how they bootstrapped their way through life  these people exist in and out of the working world   please send me helpful tips  and similar stories  i need a sanity check ,gzjr23

465,"People want you to live like they live, even though they aren't happy.",society wants you to work hard and fit in  to climb the cooperate ladder like everyone else does  but everyone who's doing that isn't happy  if they were happy they wouldn't judge other people for being anti-work   the way the system is setup is very clever because you're always in a position where you're higher than somebody else  but of-course somebody is always higher than you as well  so although people feel bad because somebody is above them  they get satisfaction from the fact that there's somebody else below them  and this keeps everybody always climbing the ladder  which is basically just a circle   i've decided to step out of this whole game and do my own thing  of course the way the system is set up makes it hard to live without working some shitty job to pay the bills  so i work just enough to take care of my immediate needs  and they aren't much  my lack of greed leaves me with a lot of free time  and i spend it doing what i enjoy  i meditate  i read and try to watch movies that help me become more spiritually conscious  this week i decided to write a song and i'm really happy with how it turned out so much so that the process of making it was an end in itself  but i still wanted to share it with people who might resonate with it  it's called  'nihilism' https soundcloud com remedy97 nihilism  and i hope you listen to it  don't let the title mislead you though ,h0f2ew

471,First job back last September,just an old story from almost a year ago but thought i d share it with everyone  it was my first real job ever  i was 18 and was super busy through school so never really experienced a part time job  it was at a lumber mill way out of the way in the industrial part of town  i was by far the youngest person there and right off the bat everyone didn t like me for some reason  i was charged with pulling out 2x4s out of a plainer and stacking them tightly on a cart  but the guy pushing them through was going way too fast for me  i asked him to slow it down but he just stared blankly at me and kept pushing them through  i had a big mess of them in front of the machine and i was near the point of tears because of this   at lunch time i had to go to the guy who hired me who was super cool about everything but asked me if i would finish the day just to see if i could keep doing it  i agreed to it because i felt like if i was doing something else i d be better off  the next stage was me pushing smaller stuff under a different thing but by the time it was the end of the day  my hand was seized  shut and i couldn t move it  i told the hiring guy that i thanked him for the opportunity and all but it wasn t for me  he was thankful that i stuck around for the full day and did tell me that some guys just leave an hour in if they don t like it  as i was leaving the guy that was pushing the 2x4s threw a chunk of wood at me and yelled never come back which thankfully i did never go back   that was really my first experience of really hating work,h8e6im
472,I had no clue I was creative/motivated,anyone ever notice how whenever you are given permission to take a significant amount of time off work that you're creativity and motivation spikes significantly  i never really get to take any long holidays from work and so it doesn't happen that often but when it does everything improves for me  i end up spending hours upon hours of spending time on my own personal projects that i enjoy so much that time flies by  my strength in the gym flies upwards suddenly  i take care of my health way better because i actually have time to take care of it opposed to having to force down some form of processed food coz i don't have time to make myself anything  i sleep way better knowing i don't have to step back into the shite hole known as the work place when i wake up  so just to sum it up forced labour sucks away every little bit of happiness  creativity and motivation in my life   the only way i see some semblance of long term happiness in my life ever happening is by working higher paid contract jobs and just working when i absolutely need to  because seriously fuck retirement  who the hell sees retiring at 65 when you may not even be alive by then and won't be able to do much of anything anyway as a worthwhile goal to aim for  the only way to win at this game is to not play   that's my rant for today ,h9douf

474,"Wait, why are we doing this?",i'm sorry  but i'd like an answer  it seems like almost everything anyone has ever told me about work  is straight up false or propaganda  8 hours isn't productive  most people only do like 4-6 hours of work in a day  working in the morning is straight up unhealthy and working in general doesn't guarantee you shit  but paying someone entitles you to determine their shift  so basically if i pay someone's salary  i get to choose their bedtime    but what really frustrates me  is no one seems to like this  so why do we fucking bother  everyone complains about their boss and makes the same tired old workplace sucks jokes  but why  why are we still bothering with this shit  it doesn't even really pay the bills anymore  is this what stockholm syndrome is like ,h9bqsf

497,What's the minimum amount of work we would need to do?,if we were to produce enough food and other basic supplies for everyone  how many work hours would that be  if we were to divide that by all physically able adults  how many hours would that be then  how many 4-hours-of-work days would that be in a year  per person   i know this sounds like some wonderland utopia  but i believe it is possible even in these modern times that everyone would work only a small fraction of the year  and the rest would be total freedom   i think we are already producing more than enough supplies for everyone  but of course it's not distributed equally  and it's only a small fraction of population that actually works in production of these supplies  the rest work in unnecessary jobs that are in demand nonetheless  my idea is that only a small amount of work really needs to be done  and anything more than that is providing luxury and entertainment for the rich ,gzma5e

502,19 and trying to make a decision on a degree that'll help me get a job that at least somewhat works with my antiwork mindset. Help?,hi everyone  hope you're all well   sorry for the long post but this is very heavy on my mind as of late   i'm 19f who's been living in malta for around 4 months now  moved here because of my love of international living and my desire to get away from the country that is stripping me of my eu citizenship   came here just to test the waters and find a job  but after realising that i can study here for free if i apply this year  degrees here are free for eu citizens but we lose our privileges at the end of this year  i would be a fool not to take up this opportunity as one of the biggest complaints i see about tertiary education on the internet is crippling debt  sending my sympathies across the pond  but i'm wondering what i should invest my time into   i am thinking about what i want in the future  and what i want most is freedom  i think i want a job that i can leave and come back to without too much hassle as the job is in constant demand  i don't want to be in a situation where i feel i can't leave my job that has shitty hours because i would risk being jobless for an extended period of time due to the surplus of workers scrambling for the position   the degree course that stands out to me is speech and language therapy  it combines linguistics  psychology and biology - all passions of mine  it's meaningful in that it helps people live life to the fullest  god forbid i land myself in a soulless bullshit job  but i'm concerned about its transferability to other countries that aren't english speaking  a lot of speech therapists have told me applying the skills you obtain to countries that speak other languages is very tricky as you train in the language you speak  and therefore you lack the skills in other languages  furthermore its extremely specialist nature and somewhat anonymous status within the medical community makes me think jobs won't be easy to come by   this leads to me thinking nursing would be better  travel nursing is a concept that intrigues me greatly  foreign nurses in the eu  even around the world  isn't uncommon  and nurses are always in demand  simple as  i'm unsure of the nursing shortage in the eu but i know for sure the uk is suffering in this respect   my first thought was to post here as what i want in a job is heavily influenced by my antiwork values  what do you all think  what are other options that could give me this freedom  in the end i want to be able to work  save  i am a minimalist at heart and feel it wouldn't be hard for me to save a decent amount  and then leave work to pursue my whims  be it travel  hobbies  whatever  i'm sure you all know what i mean  and then when money gets short i can return to work and vice versa  bypassing the 'you've been out of work for a while prioritising your life and well-being  can't have that in our corporate family' shtick due to the job being in demand   am i being naive  advice would be much appreciated ,gzup1t

505,Let's take over some federal land,i believe in working for ourselves and stop giving our money to the elites  so to keep most of our money and freedom i propose massive pacific protests on federal land in the states where it is abundant  start building and or living in motorhomes   so many people live paycheck to paycheck because housing is so expensive  society  as it is now  is like a big monopoly game and we all know how it ends  billionaires get richer every day  rich families get to pass on their generational wealth  we just get stripped out of our basic rights  the right to benefit from our work  that's why we are working so hard and getting nowhere  we are working to feed ourselves and to feed them   even if i'm lucky enough to buy land  there are so many regulations that make it almost impossible to build something if you don't have the money  but you know what a house can be built of literally anything including the same dirt on your land  why then we have to spend our lives working to serve the rich    we have the skills and the technology to do anything we dream of  it is society mostly the ones who already own land to make things difficult for the ones who own nothing  they care about property values  about attracting other wealthy people like themselves  they couldn't care less about the homeless  the vulnerable  people on power positions who order to remove benches from parks  to build everything as uncomfortable as possible for the people living on the streets  even the lucky ones who got to keep they cars after they were evicted face harassment for the police  unfair laws that target them and make it illegal to sleep in their cars  so they can eventually take their cars too  leaving them on the streets   being homeless shouldn't be as common as it is in the us  we have smart people  we have the technology  but we lack the political will to do anything  they don't care about us  we have to help each other as much as we can  our strength is in our numbers and our unity   go out take a piece of unowned land  save some money  respect nature as much as possible  maybe even improve the place  it isn't yours but a place to temporarily stay  to recover  to build wealth  let's go out and improve places  make them beautiful  so beautiful that people feel ashamed of destroying them  ashamed of kicking out the people who live there  we can do the world a better place   maybe nothing of this makes sense to you as it does for me  or maybe i'm just too random jumping from topics  anyway  thanks for reading and have an awesome weekend ,h7zzem

507,Most People Live At Their Job,with the covid pandemic going on most people worked with different schedules and i was one the the lucky ones that worked kinda biweekly   my experience was great when i was at home  i got most needed rest that i couldn't have  i spent time at my hobbies  i spend time with people that i actually want to spend time about   i exercised  i lost some weight  felt better  had time and mental energy for myself  i was happier   well things normalized  almost all workers from all sectors returned to work full force and i had a chance to hear from my coworkers and some friends about their experience    well most of them said they actually didn't like it  i asked about exactly what was the problem  did they got so much work or it felt really soul crushing while most people never came to work and they had to work  it was nothing like that for them  their workload was similar and they had some time off from work which they appreciated  but the problem for them was the social part of the work  they didn't see their friends  they couldn't chat-live at work like they used to    one of my friends said that the last 3 months felt empty  i mean i know he had work similar to before and had time offs that he liked  but after this normalization he said this and when i asked what exactly he felt empty about  it was about social aspect of the work  that there was no one at work to socialize    my coworker that liked this normalization said that he didn't had any friend outside of work  so he was happy that the things returned to normal   i mean these people clearly doesnt think that covid is still a threat  that 1 person can infect all workplace and they can carry the virus to their families  they are not sad about losing those free days  they are happy that they could live their life at their job again  like only meaningful thing in their life was to work at this job  feel useful  socialise with people and live this way   i cant fully blame them  we work 10 hours a day and its like you are forced to give all your energy to these hours to have a meaningful life at somewhere  you are mostly exhausted at home and you don't have time and energy to build any meaningful life outside of your workplace  i was lucky to have some free years after university and not going straight into some job  maybe that makes things different for me  but still  this is really sad ,h7ryxz

511,Saving the world means not working,for the last year  i've been offering my days  and some of my nights  to the deities of marketing and labor  working at small digital marketing agencies means long hours  underpaid work  and an endless succession of meaningless tasks  a big chunk of my current existence has revolved around producing content to allure low-income people into buying multi-level-marketing products and persuading them into a pipe dream of success  if that wasn't enough  my newest client is an  opinion leader  who routinely calls epidemiologists dealing with the pandemic  economic hitmen  on twitter   marketing is such an exhausting and taxing industry  not only to the people who work at it but also to the planet  we manufacture propaganda to coerce people into buying stuff they don't need  selling overpriced  detox  shakes or supplements  funko pops  fast fashion  the newest samsung galaxy phones  or another pair of sneakers that will likely get forgotten in the bottom of your closet   we live in a vortex  selling and buying useless shit  while the significant stuff in life like housing  education  and leisure become unattainable commodities   working on marketing made me realize that the solution  or at least an important part of it  relies on a simple premise all of us know  not working  the best thing a marketing expert can do to save the world is not creating an original ad to sell eco-friendly guacamole or reusable diapers  the best thing he or she can  and must  do is stop working  by not advertising useless stuff and getting rid of their own industry  marketers can reshape that world in a more meaningful way than they could have ever imagine   getting rid of marketing and consumerism will free us all from work and save the planet along the way   i recently told a friend about my anti-work views and said to him something i read in this forum   my dream is not having the perfect job  my dream is not having a job at all   this is only a dream  most likely an unachievable utopia  but at least i hope i can get away from marketing in the near future and begin to change the world simply by not giving my time and effort to the capitalistic machine that sucks our will for a better world   do i sound naive  maybe  but at least it's worth trying,h903gk

How do you use that time and money to make a better future with less work for yourself?,if you had a year where you didn't have to work at all and had  10k you could spend any way you wanted  what would you do  i'm looking to get out of the world of slaving every day to make someone else rich  i can live on very meager means  i'm looking for ways to find a new way to sustain myself for the future that involves the smallest amount of work possible  i'm looking for all ideas  no matter how crazy vague specific boring they are  some examples would be   invest in x because y reasons  buy some woodworking tools and start making x crafts and selling them at y  start flipping cars or something else on craigslist   become an antique hunter and sell stuff on etsy or x  play poker at casinos once they open back up  have done this in the past with decent success   bake fancy  artisan  bread and sell it at the farmers market   buy x equipment and start an x business from home   find a way to grow vanilla or some expensive exotic profitable plant from home or rent a plot of land for a garden or greenhouse for growing   buy a truck and trailler and haul stuff for people for money   pan for gold   move to the coast and harvest shellfish or crab lobster and sell it to restaurants or out of the back of your truck   move somewhere with lots of mushrooms and forage for mushrooms for income   get a growers license and grow weed  and or make edibles and sell them   hike 50 miles deep into some national park and live dick proenneke style   -----------   whatever your ideas are  i'd love to hear them ,gzims2
525,What am I supposed to do? Make money for others then die.,venting   birth  go to school to get just enough education to be a functional cog in profit machine  get a job that barely pays enough to put a roof over your head and put food on the table  if you're lucky   make company tons of money while you never save a dime because anything you need in life is price gouged to maximize profits for whatever company it's from   make babies so they can grow up to be more cogs in the machine   at best you scrape by until you die on an assembly line or at your desk or doing whatever job your corporate overlords have allowed you to ascend to while giving you the lowest  most insignificant raise possible   this is life unless you were born into wealth  hit the metaphorical lottery with some invention or literally make every single right decision for the short and the long term even though your parents don't have the answers for how to escape this hellscape and your brain isn't fully developed until your mid 20's   socialism for the rich  rugged individualism for the poor  birth is a promise of profits for your future company and death is your retirement   we are fucking cogs  we're fucking lemmings  at this point we're here for no other reason than to throw human effort and misery into the profit machine so the ceo can buy a new private jet or buy another house   look at the lives of the upper crust of society  the rich and powerful  now look at how you're living  you work your whole life while the rich and powerful enjoy all the fruits of your labor   the american dream is dead  the constitution should go as follows   you have the right to make profits for the company of your choice  make new workers never fully enjoy your life  get by on the bare minimum and then die ,h0z8kq

528,McDonalds UK is not adequately protecting it's workers right now and all it makes me want to do is cry,i work for mcd's uk and as you may or may not know we recently reopened nationwide  before returning to work we had e-learning outlining the new regulations  in regards to health and safety  small things like social distancing and screens to separate work stations were obviously going to be implemented  as well as mandatory facemasks and gloves for staff that are customer facing  the problem comes in the enforcement of these rules  or lack of  i've been back for 1 week now and every single one of the promised protective rules have been broken or disregarded    for instance  on masks  the company states that masks will be readily available  up to three per shift  these are non medical masks obviously  and don't offer too much protection  especially as both staff and managers wear them incorrectly  off the nose and the like  on day 2 i got told it's now 1 per shift  with the reason being they cost 75p each   the acrylic screens were quickly moved as they make the job harder in their default position  originally they were between workers on the line  separating in two meter boxes  on day one they were moved to the middle  and the only stations they cover are the fryers  so the people handling the food are wearing dodgy masks incorrectly and are not separated by screens    we were told that everyone would wear gloves  this is not true  we were told it would be a maximum of 7 in the kitchen and during the rush of the first few days back  this was also not true    we were promised protection  which was rescinded  the wellness check they provide is a scan with a digital thermometer  which no one has ever seen their results from  no one is scheduled to provide cover for anyone so it's suspicious  especially when i hear co workers regularly break out into a coughing fit    at the minute i'm terrified of asking to be furloughed for my own safety  as all staff i've asked have told me that until i have a fever they won't do anything  by then it could be too late  but they haven't thought about that    i'm angry  and confused  why are schools not safe or the government isn't safe but retail and fast food are a ok  why has no one  not warehouse  not retail workers or service industry workers received higher pay for risking their lives by interacting with potential millions a day    why does the nhs which supports our country right now  continue to not pay their nurses and doctors enough to not have to work 50-60 hour weeks    help me because there of the last days i've accidentally let slip to managers my desire to go on strike   e  also our service timer  ranked leaderboard of the uk mcd's and out customer satisfaction reviews were supposed to be turned off so we can focus on safety  turns out the only one that's off is the csat  which is the only one we lose money on  1 99 big mac and fries for a review    turns out the only rule we turned on was one not financially great ,h10p1u

535,Why has everything become so bureaucratic?,every job application requires you to submit a resume that has been edited for that particular job  a letter of interest cover letter  and a list of references  those are the easy applications    then there are the online forms that ask you to literally type out your entire history and take a 30 minute competency test    it would be one thing if all these forms were perused  but everyone knows no person could be able to do any of that with the hundreds of applications a position receives   we know recruiters and hr specialists only skim resumes and cover letters  nothing ever in depth  but there is an expectation to have everything extremely polished or else it s an instant rejection    why is this system widely accepted if it s so inefficient  time consuming  and wasteful  why aren t there any better ways to apply for jobs ,h7yiub

541,The New Spirituality,to briefly introduce myself  i am a social worker of over a decade of education and experience   and multiple times over the last few years i have been caught fighting against the injustices  both against clients and against staff  in my field   i have seen individuals with severe mental health problems left to the street because they were no longer profitable   i've seen people taken into the system and their lives ruined because a judge ruled them incapable and failed to install oversights   i've seen employees threatened every day for speaking up  and i've seen them murdered for not   i have always stood up tall against these things and on multiple occasions have lost my job because of it  i rarely last more than a few years  as even a good manager will soon find themselves overwhelmed by the corruption  and while they leave  unwilling to put their career on the line to fight  i remain  and while there is never a single person who isn't aware of the problems  and in agreement that something must be done  there is also never a single other who will speak with me  in all these years   so as a mental health professional  i suffered from severe depression and anxiety  with significant trauma lasting years attached to these jobs  and these people  i had lost   so i began to write  to use what i had learned and create poetry in a style modified from those depicting greek and norse heroes  outlining a practice for me to keep my head above water  end my anxieties  and most importantly  to keep fighting   i'd like to bring up here a novel spiritual system  a method of dispelling our fear  and unifying us  as well as a method of controlling our own depression and anxieties when we are fighting what needs to be fought   what i'm talking about here isn't religion  or anything centralized  but a philosophical system to unite and inspire us  in a world where we're otherwise ineffective at toppling the powers that prevent real change from occurring    let no greed and striving cause us stress and sadness     since we re born  we re told to try and work our hardest     help withdrawn  though  once we re grown  we fall to failure     frustrated  anxious  depressed  to termination we re trying     until at last we die  our eyes then dark and exhausted     do not let this plague accost us  keep our eyelids     closed and strive for merely living  safe and happy     see the worthwhile things in the world  as love and fulfillment     what takes years of work one loathes cannot be worth it   this is from the  nameless script http www ren-philosophy org r n pdf  of r n philosophy  stating that everything we do in labour is for some reward that we're told is good   money   but beyond the bare minimum we require to survive  we don't really need it   the concept of being rich is an illusory reward  but because of it  this frankly illogical desire  we have these power structures and the resulting violence and inequalities   this philosophy is monistic  like taoism and some other eastern ideas  stating that everything is ultimately of one substance  and it uses this to completely humble the individual  to the point of denying its existence   r n  is used in the text as a pronoun  to refer to any and everyone   it puts us all on the same page  so that rather than striving to get rich  to be better than everyone else  and increase the self  we're instead uplifting each other  recognizing that none of us are alone a unit    men of science call it selfish altruism     selflessness  a fantasy  charity  happy fiction     but fables cache residual truth  and tales remind us     extolling  to give is as much for the sender as for the receiver     instinctive wisdom begs us feed the worn and helpless     where there s a choice  the charity comes to them from oneself  our     chest to hungry throats  and have no agency process     the help we re lending  lest they squander the service rendered   although they've been instrumental in gaining us rights in the workforce  unions today have largely failed us  in my experience   they've become toothless  being themselves large organizations with a disconnect from those they're supposed to be representing   what we need is a sort of revolutionary altruism  in which enough of us are on the same page  regarding the same philosophy  and can speak up against injustice directly  as unions once did   to begin with  upon seeing abuse happening in the workplace  we should have the strength to organize together and stand up against the people in power who are propagating that abuse   as it is  spinelessness is rampant among employees  and that needs to change   when it does  power can shift  and we will no longer be disposable commodities  but will have the final say in what we are worth and what we can do with our lives  rather than expected to show gratitude for the privilege of giving our lives away to employers that will pay barely a living wage and threaten you every day of your life with your dismissal   because you are not necessary   we will become more necessary than them   we can't get there  though  without a drive  and spirituality has historically been a great source of that drive   it gives both individual and community identity  which is precisely why christianity has been so unfortunately used by capitalists to support conservative movements in the west  especially the us  which controls the cultural narrative in the english-speaking world   so i'm hoping to introduce a new sort of decentralized spirituality in r n  that regardless of one's religious beliefs  or lack thereof  a consistent worldview and sense of justice can exist in a great enough number of people to provide the energy for this sort of revolution   that  if one practices and loses the sense of the individual   number one  being the most important thing in the world  then they will lose the fear that prevents them from taking a stand against the injustices of modern capitalism   and by nature of spiritual philosophy  they can take others along with them   thanks for reading this far   this subreddit is an inspiration and it's good to see this much support for those suffering under our current system   i hope people will in time find r n to be a useful tool in enacting positive change in ending the exploitation of the working class ,gvf9eq

544,Suggestions on how to get fired for performance issues - not “for cause.”,i feel like even subs like r unethicallifeprotips wouldn t understand  i ll explain a little anyway  i m sure you guys don t need me to explain my reasoning   my job furloughed a ton of people  from my estimation  it seems like full-timers whose health insurance they no longer wanted to cover  as well as people who were the least efficient  now they re squeezing every last drop out of the people who are left  part-timers the most efficient people    i m sick of being a number  i m sick of being treated like cattle  i m sick of the rules only applying to them and i m sick of them only enforcing the rules when it benefits them  and most of all  i m sick of constructive termination   for example  i had two weeks of no pay last year without warning  didn t know i could have collected unemployment i m young and stupid  i ended up with less than  50 to my name at christmas  with bills still to pay  they didn t care about enforcing minimum work hours back then  but of course now all of a sudden they do    my dream would be to get fired for a performance issue as that s just about the only way to get fired not for cause and even have a chance  however small  of collecting unemployment   it s a shitty  10 hr wfh job  i can tell they re starting to engage in some constructive termination right now  but it s so flexible they can t fire people for being  late  because the only thing that can be done late is turning in work late  i believe that counts more as a performance issue rather than tardiness  tardiness is easier to fire people for  so guess what they re doing switching us from a flexible work schedule to set shifts  everyone signed up for this job for the flexibility and they re taking it away    i should mention that my unemployment payments  even without the extra  600 weekly right now  is significantly more than what i normally make at this job  so even after 7 31  it will be better for me to be on unemployment   my question is  how do i get fired for performance issues  not for cause  without making it seem like i tried ,gwtsj9
545,Capitalism won't enslave us if we choose not to participate,of course we all need things  but if we just buy what we need and nothing else  billionaires cannot exist  the system is designed to make us want more and spend more  making us work more  thats why advertisements are in our face everywhere    i'm only 30 but i have come to a point in life where i just dont want anything anymore  no car  no clothes  no clubs  no alcohol  no applebees  not even arbys  i'm content to just buy groceries  pay my bills and chill at home    only thing i wish is i had come to this earlier in life  i would be so much richer  i'm not rich by any means but my expenses are low  which allow me to save money  even on minimum wage  i'm not stressed over layoffs  job loss  reduced hours  i'll get by    i know its cliche to live below your means but if we all were to practice it then not only would we have more money but our stress levels would go way down  knowing next months rent is not depending on this weeks check makes jobs less stressful and offers more flexibility in life ,gwn4cd
546,Is it worth living on SSI (in poverty) to not work?,is it worth living on ssi  in poverty  for the rest of your life to avoid not working  i been really thinking about this a lot  thinking about working ramps up depression and anxiety but on the other hand i don't want live in poverty either   ssi is a stable source of income especially during pandemic like this but it is also a low amount of money  the biggest issue on ssi is housing and once you have that i mean i feel like you be okay living with ssi  the problem is that rent is sky high in rents are about how much an ssi check is  and subsidized housing apartments have long waiting lists  and once you get into an apartments you be fine and could stay in it as long as you want   personally to me though  in the back of my mind i don't really feel  safe  inside the apartments just for the fact that the landlords could kick you out for any reason they see fit  amp  you most likely be living right next to troublemaker neighbors too  and their monthly inspections  amp  pest controls  amp  maintenance  its not like im going to dirty the place up its just i don't like how they can come inside where your living at any time they please  it feels like legal trespassing  i had this happen with roommates i was living with at my previous apartment in the landlords  amp  maintenance felt like they were coming in every other week in if they see or smell something they don't like they can evict you  it's like you have to keep the place squeaky perfectly clean at all times throughout the day because anything they don't like they can evict you because of it   speaking of roommates  just thinking of living with roommates gives me hella anxiety  amp  depression  i don't like sharing a bathroom with someone or a room inside someones house  i don't know the roommates or the landlord from jack adam they could be a troublemaker for all i know   but because the government says this is how much money you get the only thing you can afford with it is a room like that   personally  i rather own my own place  i don't have to deal with anyone else  i can live in it all to myself in peace  amp  quietness  i don't have to deal with ever being kicked out  but there's problems with that too  i don't understand how a basic human necessity such as getting your house shelter can be this difficult to obtain   to be able to get a home loan  you need to get your credit score high in if you don't have that can take about 6 months to years to  get it high enough to qualify  not only that but you need to get a cosigner on the loan to boost the dti because ssi is not enough just by itself  so i have to go find someone else willing to just do that  amp  they are responsible on this loan as well  and most likely they wanna live inside the home too so if i wanna live by myself i can't do that  all because ssi is not enough for the dti to qualify for the home loan  it's just ridiculous the stuff that you gotta do just to get yourself a basic human necessity   the other options that i can think of to own your own place is that out of the ssi checks start putting  amp  saving money into an able account because inside those accounts you can hold more money than the ssi limit allows  you can put  15 000 per year inside the accounts vs the regular  2 000 ssi limit   you can use the able account to buy a small land  amp  i guess a tiny house mobile home or something  i really don't know how much it costs to buy a complete tiny house mobile home  but there's all kinds of risks and stuff that you have keep in mind too with the land  amp  tiny house mobile home  does the land have the sewer  electric  water if not thats a lot more money  are there any infestations of animals on the land  like snakes  scorpions or something  and does the home have good electrical wiring  roofing  etc  if not there can be fires  amp  leakage from rain  amp  floods   what kind of insurances i need   and the land might not be able to get high speed  amp  low latency internet thats very good for online gaming because thats also the most important to me at least   all this stuff just really exhausts my brain thinking about all this just to get your own place that you can call your own  amp  a basic human necessity    i'm going through a housing crisis right now in im trying to evaluate all of this   but honestly once you have housing covered  you could use the free time you would have to learn  amp  research all kinds of stuff like business  amp  skills if you wanted to do that to transitioned into a six figure income or more  that's just an idea if you ever decide you wanna keep working   i just don't know  what do you guys think  is it worth living on ssi in poverty to not having to work ,gwosp4

549,First Full-time Job and I Hate my Life Already?,i just started my first full-time job yesterday  and i absolutely hate it  i have a bachelors degree  and am currently pursuing a master's degree  i've done a few political and government internships since that's the field i am interested in  and have only had 2 small part time jobs throughout undergrad for brief periods of time  luckily i'm in a position where i don't need to work at all  i live at home and my parents pay my tuition  but i still realize i need work experience for when i do graduate  i mean  how lame would it be if i graduated with a master's degree and had minimal work experience    anyway  i hate the job i just started  it was kind of given to me too  and the pay is great for someone with no real expenses  but it's so drab  the furniture is moldy  the commute is over and hour  the people are dead inside  and the work is tedious and uninteresting  this makes it all worse because i already hate the idea of wasting away 40 hours of my week for something i don't care about  when i could be doing things that i enjoy and focusing on my studies  i just feel bad because my mom has been freaking out about me finally getting a  real job  she's over the moon  and it feels like this is the first time in a while that she's shown interest in my professional life  i don't want to quit because i already quit law school after the first day  so it feels like giving up without even trying  but i actually hate it here    honestly  i just need some advice  am i being overly dramatic  should i give it a week or two or go with my gut ,gvesk3

551,Should I turn down a promotion during a pandemic?,i got a job as a bartender in december  it was my dream job at first  no complaints  in february  the owners approached me about managing day-to-day operations  i was thrilled  they set a  trial month   where i do the work with no additional pay or real authority  which kinda rubbed me the wrong way  right before we closed because of the pandemic    now we ve re-opened  i ve restarted the trial month  and i m already feeling micro-managed  it seems they still want to make decisions themselves  big or small  from behind the scenes  while i am on the front line as sort of the messenger barrier between them and other employees   they seem untrusting  i have to jump through hoops to do what should be simple tasks  ex  they won t give me direct access to accounts or company cards  i have to ask each time i need it   they re also pushing the boundaries already on what my responsibilities are  i assumed it would mostly be weekly ordering  scheduling  resolving customer complaints  etc  but now they re asking me to come up with entirely new systems  still in the trial period   also  i ve been refraining from seeming pushy  but i have brought up pay twice  with only vague responses- no numbers  i m assuming this will be discussed at our review  but normally when you re applying or trying a job  you know the details of what you re getting yourself into   now i m hesitant on whether or not i should even take the position  it s already caused me additional stress  double the hours  no balance- and i have a feeling their monetary offer is going to be way below the expectation   my husband recently got laid off from a corporate management position with a similar boss  so on one hand i feel it s now my responsibility to make more money  but his experience also showed me how draining a vague  micro-managed position can be   advice ,gxccm4

554,Small Business pretending Covid19 is over (venting/ranting),i live in a southern state that was  shut down   only clearly non essential businesses  a lot of businesses never closed though  from around the middle of march until around the middle of may  the small business i work for was shut down in that time because we re a clothing jewelry boutique  so definitely not essential in the slightest   i was given the ultimatum of losing my job or coming back by may 15  so i came back  my boss  couldn t find  any sanitizing cleaner  so i ended up buying my own lysol to bring to work to sanitize the credit card pin pad door handles etc   wasn t compensated at all for it  either   we started selling fabric face masks  and my boss brought down a series of like 150pt huge font printed pieces of paper that say  we sell face masks  to put in the front window   the problem is  my state has had the highest reported positive cases since covid started just yesterday - higher even than any single day we were shut down  our percent positive cases increased too  so it isn t just increased testing  covid is legitimately increasing here  when i got into work today  i saw that my boss had removed the sign on our front door that tells customers our maximum occupancy based on sq  footage and to maintain social distancing  which was part of the governor s mandate for businesses to reopen   i cannot for the life of me understand how you can advertise that you re selling face masks to reduce transmission of a highly contagious virus  and then just blatantly ignore any guidelines that were put in place to reduce transmission of a highly contagious virus  this is far from the only example i have of him basically pretending covid isn t happening while simultaneously selling face masks  he literally said almost verbatim   maybe some people need to die  maybe it s just their time  to me the first day i was back at work  so i know for sure he s not taking this seriously at all   i ended up making my own max  occupancy sign and put it back on the front door where the old one was  i work alone usually  so i ll be enforcing those while i m here  if it causes an issue  i guess i ll have to decide if it s even worth it to keep working here  or if i need to move on to something else  just what the fuck is wrong with people  you know ,gygn69

577,Two years out of college and I'm already sick of working (long rant),before i graduated from college  i had several career options in mind  i wanted to be a business analyst  marketing analyst  or financial analyst because they seemed like interesting careers that paid well  i applied to hundreds of jobs before after graduating from college and kept failing interviews because of my social anxiety and inability to make myself seem like a good candidate  i dreaded interviews  i was always nervous and messed up no matter how much i practiced prepped for the interview   after a year of grueling interviews  i landed a job as a content reviewer  it wasn't what i wanted  but i took it because it seemed interesting and i'd be getting paid  however  it was anything but interesting  my mental health slowly deteriorated to the point that i would sigh before getting out of my car to walk to the office because of the content i'd have to review  a month into the job  i decided to quit because my mental health was more important to me than working in a job that didn't even require me to use my degree    a few months after quitting  i got another job as an administrative assistant  still not what i wanted  but i had no choice at this point  i wanted to quit within the first few days of doing the job because they slammed me with training on a bunch of different areas and i got overloaded because of all the technical terms and steps  i decided to tough it out and after two months  everything settled down  i didn't even have to do some of the stuff they trained me on    a couple of months ago i had my first break down while driving to work  i started crying because i was tired  i was tired of everything  i was tired of doing the same repetitive work over and over  i was tired of getting paid little  i was tired of not being in the career that i intended after i graduated  i thought i'd be stuck doing this type of meaningless work for the rest of my life  despite having tried so hard to get a college education    most importantly  i was tired of working  i was nostalgic about my college days  the days where i'd see different faces every day as i walked through campus  the days where i was surrounded by like-minded individuals that i could talk about anything with  being stuck in an office for 8 hours a day  around the same people  doing the same damn thing  and faking being professional is tiring    recently i've been thinking  asides from the obvious reasons for working such as money  to repay debt  repay parents  groceries  material goods  and traveling  what is my purpose for working  why do i want to have a certain job title when all i'm doing is being a human-robot for a company  why do i have to work until retirement age  why is a certain career more respectable than another career  why do i care about people's opinions about what career i have  will i ever be truly satisfied with any job that i have  does a dream job even exist  why are we stuck in this system of working our lives away for things that we don't even need    tl dr it's been two years since i graduated  had two jobs that i absolutely hated  and am upset that despite having a college degree i'm still stuck doing low-paying jobs that don't require me to have a degree,gxyxa9
578,Please don't forget that the 40-hour work week was fought for by WORKERS and not created by or given to us by business owners.,while the 40-hour work week is outdated and should be reduced without efficiency loss  please don't forget that countless workers and unions fought to get a more humane work life balance from the previous system that offered next to no workers rights and could enforce extreme work hours without any repercussions  capitalists and business owners did not create and design the 40-hour work week to keep you bored at your cubicle  workers fought to reduce 12  hour days of hard and dangerous industrial labor to a more humane 8-hours along with laws against child labor and better worker safety  this is not in defense of maintaining 40-hour work weeks but it's to remind everyone that many people fought and died for you to rightfully complain about being forced to work 8-hours a day regardless of productivity  don't give business owners credit for something workers fought for ,gx0ujw

588,[New York] Keeping work search records for 1 year from START EFFECTIVE date or from the date I SUBMITTED my UI claim??,few people i came across said to keep work search records for 1 year  i submitted my ui claim during this pandemic on 5 9 2020 and certified weekly starting 5 11 2020 and currently getting paid  when i got accepted my start effective date is showing 3 9 2020 and expires on 3 14 2021  so when they say to keep your work search records for a year  is it from the start effective date  3 9 2020  or the date i actually submitted my ui claim  5 9 2020   also after my ui claim expires and can they still ask for my work search documents or no    wrote this post out of concern that i fall into the group of people that has to do work search during this time ,gwcgzr

602,Why would I feel bad for being a free-rider when the common response to our view is telling us to fuck off into a forest?,market advocates support a system that uses a persons individual success in the market to determine if they deserve the basic necessities human life  obviously many people end up not succeeding or agreeing to take part in the market and are placed in a position where they are denied access to basic human essentials    then  the people who support this system usually ridicule and complain about the existence of the homeless  free-riders ect  for them to do this is not only disgusting  but it shows a complete lack of self awareness  if you really do hold the belief that there is a standard a human needs to meet before being deserving of necessities like food and shelter  then you are going to have people who do not meet your standard    if you do not like dealing with homeless people  leeches  free-riders ect  then i do not think you are actually a true advocate of markets or capitalism  both homelessness and free-riding happen  under capitalism  it's part of it  it's the part where you agreed that some people really don't deserve anything until they have been successful under your system  don't like that part  well then you don't like capitalism    money is a concept  don't value concepts  don't do things in exchange for concepts  when you see money  think monopoly  it has no actual value  it's actually people pretending that something has value that in reality demonstrably does not    fuck markets  value wisdom  value life ,gypm5n

611,"Just had a mass exodus at the small coffee/bake shop I work at, kickstarted by the riots. Working on my courage too (Wall of text incoming)",our manager  who is black  sent a group text to the staff that she would be taking a few days off  and was honest about not feeling safe being out in the world due to the state of our country    all personal feelings about that set aside  we all offered to stay late arrive early for our shifts to provide coverage  including the one other black girl in the shop  who said  me too  i'll contact you later for specifics    so the owner misinterpreted both of the texts  thinking they were both quitting  wrote back to the entire group text  take care ladies  fyi team  interviewing for a new manager  fingers crossed  and then went on a rant at the shop in front of other employees  no customers    i was not there  so i cannot say what exactly was said  but her nephew  also an employee  said that although she did not use any actual slurs  she was very disparaging  the gist of what i was able to gather is that the owner insinuated they would be joining the  losers  at the protests riots  and so were losers themselves  i believe there was also a  fuck them  thrown in     at the end of the day  during my shift  her nephew privately pulled her aside  and told her that she was way out of line and was not acting appropriately in front of her employees  that's when she doubled down and actually brought me into it  how she is tired of the  disrespect  and brought up the previous manager  a guy who helped her open the store just over a year ago  and also left on bad terms   she seems to have created this fiction in her mind that i was  tainted  by the guy  i suppose to help maintain her denial of how deranged and woefully unprepared she is at both business management and people management  to clarify  this was all behind my back  her nephew informed me of everything after she left    anyway  long story longer  her nephew then informed our manager and the other employee who unwittingly got pulled into the whole thing  this was all on wednesday  thursday night  the manager calls me and let's me know that she  the other employee  and the owner's nephew would be quitting  and by this morning  friday  i was off  they had all contacted the owner to let her know  this all after she apparently talked to whoever was on shift at the time in a  damage control  effort    which brings me to me  kind of in a tough spot because while i do have an interview in the morning  i am scheduled to close  and i will be closing with only her  now  she has never bothered to learn the front end stuff  she is primarily the main baker  and she has 2 other full time bakers  so not only am i not looking forward to the impending shitshow on a saturday  i do not want to be in the building alone with her    on the one hand  i know it is not wise to quit without having something affirmatively lined up  but i wonder about the toll on the psyche that staying with a passive aggressive and demeaning wolf-in-sheep's-clothing employer  obviously i'm not providing the whole story here  been there about as long as the shop's been open  and though she didn't get this bad until around the holidays  it has certainly been   i've got the email saved to drafts  and am just looking forward to killing this interview ,gxks7s

639,Finally left my first real job! Also what I have learned.,on april 8th 2019 i started my first proper job as a data analyst  i was very hopeful going in  with high expectations and wanting to prove myself to be the best    this quickly changed  after the first week i learned i was very naive and my optimistic mindset turned very pessimistic  during my time i have had serious bouts of depression due to work where at one point it was so bad that i was having suicidal thoughts and took a month off of work  i had planned to hand in my notice right after this month off but due to personal life circumstances i couldn't do that  this handing in my notice was supposed to be in october 2019  i ended up handing it in in march 2020 and was meant to leave on the 9th of april 2020  but due to the pandemic situation i extended my contract by two months  which leads to today  today was my last day and i'm finished  i feel very relieved and liberated  i know it isn't the ideal time to be unemployed  but i think this decision to leave is the best for me   the things i have learned are the following   1  corporate world is hell  2  companies do not care about you  3  rock the boat somewhat and you will get in huge trouble  4  seniors will give you a hard time if you are not submissive  5  work in the grand scheme of things just isn't important  you are important  your mental health is import  your hobbies are important and your happiness is important  obviously  with how the system is structured we're going to unfortunately need jobs but what i'm saying is there's more important things in life   not sure how the future looks for me right now  this pandemic is of course problematic  but right now i'm happy to have some rest ,gx9avb

660,I put in my two week notice a few days ago.,i was back for two days  got screamed at  manager rewarded the guest by halving her rate  i was already upset because my hours were bumped up to 40 a week  i'm a full time student and i have a few disabilities  but this just sealed it for me  i have ptsd  being screamed at aggravates it  i spent my two days off scared and angry  not the first time they rewarded someone for doing this to me  but it was the last straw   i had a breakdown and kind of freaked out on someone here  not angrily  but i just descended into a panic  they were so damn accepting and kind  if you're reading this  you're a real one   anyway  i'm done with it  i have savings to last me over a year if i'm not an idiot  maybe two if i'm smart about it   don't know where to go from here  but i'm so happy i'm almost out  gonna just work on my passions and see where it leads me  i love to write  maybe i can do that if i can find my footing   this subreddit has done wonders for my self esteem  it's scary to actively think about how bad our modern work culture is  but there's something gratifying about being told that you deserve better  thanks for providing refuge to people like me  it's easy to feel broken and wrong when everyone else seems content with the current system   i'm gonna dye my hair crazy colors and like  find myself or something  i'm 25 and i finally have a chance to rest for the first time in my life ,gz0cew
661,I just kinda had a eureka moment,years ago sometime after high school i got hooked on prescription pills  i first took them because someone said it would help my boredom at work  man were they right  but you don't think about having to pass a drug test until you're addicted  and by the way  why the hell are employers even drug testing  if you want to be a police officer  paramedic  i guess fine  drug test  otherwise back off you weirdo    kinda got off track  basically what i'm saying is   i just realized that work was responsible for creating an addiction that took alot of money from me  work resulted in short monetary gain but created much deeper issues  i think work is doing more harm then good    obviously worry will always need to get done  that's fine  but let's not keep jobs around just for the sake of having that job position ,gzb6ya

663,Have to take a drug test to get a remote temp job during a pandemic,i got laid off from my job during the 'rona  i would just choose to do nothing for a while  but i want to at least pitch in for groceries    anyhow  i managed to snag an offer for a six-week remote position through a temp agency  i thought i could stay safe by working remotely and avoiding unnecessary trips  but i'm expected to go to a medical testing center during the pandemic to piss in a cup before i can set appointments from my home computer    what  i'm not going to drive 30 minutes with a full bladder to get  10 hour  even if the job is easy  i would pass since i've never done any illegal drugs in my life  but no  just no   fuck it  not worth it ,gzgoqr
664,Quick reminder,stop calling your employers  boss  that instantly undermines you and boosts them  i cannot understand how people feel alright using that word  it promotes the slave mentality  when in my work a co worker says  our the boss  i say that i don't know about them but i don't have a boss  only dogs and slaves do  so what are you between the two  we are humans and not property therefore we don't have bosses  only employers  also a nice way to shatter your employer's ego if you feel comfortable saying that ,gyhii8
665,Help?,i m so stressed from my job i can t eat or sleep much anymore  i started hyperventilating multiple times this week  i need out  my boyfriend isn t as unwell but is also completely over his job  he had a wild idea to move in with his family out of state and live off his savings for awhile while we figure out the next steps    are there any practical tips or blogs or sub recommendations for how one can  even temporarily  survive being voluntarily unemployed  i ve been working since my teens and i m terrified of not being employed for even a few weeks  i m especially worried about losing health insurance  but i m also beyond burnt out and just a little time to recover and think clearly would be such a godsend  i m sick of bouncing from one bad work situation into another out of desperation to survive ,gxwhqb
666,Want to lay down and not to work for those greedy stockholders? Get autism!,call me a bloodsucker or a freeloader  but i think i have an indestructible point behind my choices   while i m  a special need guy https en wikipedia org wiki asperger syndrome  and thus less likely to make a living  i m also intentionally underperforming  because let s be real here - getting paid for doing nothing is the tits  i already researched how to get the most for the least with my condition in my country  when i was a teen   and sure enough  i only  studied  as an excuse to make my parents shut the fuck up and collect benefits for having something my way for change   also  i do have some idea of what working 8 hours a day would be like  getting my media assistant degree included internships with some assholes  who never knew what they wanted   until the last few years  i was in a  rehabilitative work  in various places  until they realized i won t become a normal worker by serving all kinds of twats for  9 a day   now i have a flat and i pay a rent cheaper than the average of my area  why  because i pay my rent for a foundation  that s been buying apartments for autistic people to rent  i m telling you - being autistic enough to get special treatment is the best  especially in nordic countries with their generous welfare systems    everyone has to pull their weight  suck my dick  i ll pull my weight  when i get to do a job that i like and what pays at least 150  of what i get now  also  i ll only bother when my employers or customers get their shit together and don t judge me for my weaknesses  which is never in this mock of a society  also  no guarantees   no deal  i m more than a marionette for a corporate fuckface to play with  i m a human being  who deserves whatever he manages to suck out of his country s system  as a life-long compensation for his disadvantaged position as a poorly raised aspie  that s right  i ll respond to the entitlement of employers by being more selfish than they could imagine   and if the system falls due to people like me  then so be it  i ll fall with it and get my corpse cremated before those money hoarders could suck the life out of me ,gxvt8b

671,"A personal anti-work renaissance, please let me know your thoughts",greetings  r antiwork  this is my first time here and i'm glad i found you  i have a brief description of my situation  ending with a question    i'm a salary worker currently working from home  nobody before me has successfully performed my job at my company  but i've been doing pretty well and been getting positive feedback  people have even commented that they don't understand how i have the time to do everything i do   the secret is that i really only do a few hours of real work most days  when i was in the office  this played out in acting busy quite often  which kills the soul  now that i'm at home  i can practice playing music or something else  but i end up feeling guilty about it    i used to read a lot of anti-work and crimethinc books back in the day which helped to uproot just some capitalism-based morality  currently i want to do the bare minimum in my job so i don't have to do the bare minimum in my life  but on the other hand i want to find ways to be excellent at my job    this goes back to the capitalism issue  my company is owned by sales people who do not reinvest in the company  so our internal technology and processes are outdated and weak  making it impossible to do my job as effectively as i know i could with the right resources   my previous job was truly pointless  i was hired so that somebody could go on vacation  while working that job i absolutely learned how to look busy when fucking off but still getting required work done    basically i'm looking to get your thoughts on my situation  sometimes i think i'm not pounding out the work everyday because i learned bad habits and i'm not motivated  but sometimes i think that if i can get away with doing the minimum amount of work then it is my right to ride that wave    i think i can guess the flavor of most answers based on the sub  but i'm really just hoping to hear anything back to help me think ,gvbj49

682,I feel like I'm going crazy,i'm a government employee  who works with the public a little  and i've been teleworking for 3 solid months now due to coronavirus   i initially started teleworking when i told my boss that i had covid19 symptoms  i did this on purpose because i didn't feel safe going to work and sitting close to coworkers in the middle of the outbreak  we were still doing business-as-usual at that point  early march  i'm in the nyc area  i was granted permission to stay home teleworking for 2 weeks and told to take a covid19 test  i never took the test because my doctor wouldn't order it  they were severely limited at the time  and i was pretty plain with her that i was bullshitting my employer about symptoms because i was scared to go to work  due to the scare i created at work  the city decided to let all employees work from home right when my 2 week quarantine period was ending   fast forward 3 months  i'm more productive than ever  my employees are doing more than ever  i am a low level manager with a 2 person department that i give 10 10 star performance reviews to every year and don't give a fuck what they actually do because fuck this city  we have an understanding that if they just tread water  i don't care  they usually play videos at their desk most of the day and i turn my head because i hate my boss and this city and work in general  anyway  digression   i found out today we all have to go back to work in the office 9-5  not even staggered shifts  and resume work as usual  the same work we are fucking doing right now at home  they plan to put up shower curtains between our desks  there is no plan to clean the staff bathrooms more than nightly  we are told to wear masks as much as possible at our desks  i wrote a strongly worded email to my boss about how ludicrous this is  not to mention dangerous  he said he agrees with me but there's nothing he can do  he relies on me to run the fundamentals of our department  so i need a good working relationship with him or my life will be even more hellish than it is   i don't know what the fuck to do  i want to quit  but i'm so deeply entrenched in this organization  and i'm worried i'll never get another job in this economy  i could survive a while and help my partner with his business  he's self-employed  so it's not totally bleak  just a big risk   i already requested to continue to work from home  but i don't think it'll be approved  i'm told not even health accommodations are likely to be granted  i have considered saying  bye  but the hand-off of my position would take bare minimum 2 weeks due to everything i do and manage  no one in my city department  except my own 2-person department  knows how to even like operate a fucking computer mouse without a 10 page manual  so handing off would be really difficult  i sorta made it this way on purpose for job security  now i feel trapped   i'm doubly trapped because my boss relies on me and i need to keep a good working relationship  i can't just be a total dick to him or i might as well just quit in that case anyway   on the flipside  the city where i work  and other people i know  are making me feel crazy for feeling unsafe returning to work  a lot of things have opened back up despite numbers not going down much  we're in the og hot zone over here  but people are sick of staying home  and all think it's  time  to just  go back to normal  so talking to most people is no help   anyway  it feels better just getting this off my chest  i have no one i can talk to it about except my partner  and he is giving me really wishy-washy advice because he doesn't know what i should do himself  he's really unhappy about me returning to work  though  he thinks it's an unnecessary risk and stupid ,gvba6n
