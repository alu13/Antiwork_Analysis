1,Plan your annual leave right!,"Hey guys, 

Been reading this thread a lot more recently and found it helps when I‚Äôm feeling unmotivated or frustrated about working. Sometimes get a good laugh and it cheers me up. 

It‚Äôs ‚Äònice‚Äô knowing others feel the same, but I found something that helped me feel better today. I put in all my annual leave (30 days) around all the busiest times during work so I will be working the bulk of my hours during the ‚Äúlow season‚Äù if you will and have lots of days off on Mondays and Fridays attached to the weekends during the peak busy times of year. This really mentally splits up the drudgery and weeks of what feels like monotony and endless work.

Working 3/4 day weeks makes such a difference if you‚Äôre really going through it. I find staggering my holidays through out the year helps, I‚Äôd get seriously depressed if I knew I didn‚Äôt have annual leave for 6+ months. Too scared to touch any sick days until I reach 5+ years continuous service.

Sadly, there's an internal conflict in the store over who has to backup the cashiers when we start getting lines. My manager won't help us out unless she really has to and immediately returns to her office when she can. There are some staff that just refuse to have anything to do with it. Others will help out, but are unhappy about it and become short with customers. 

The whole thing is so demoralizing because my employer is basically saying that my job sucks so bad that people fight over who will have to do it for a few minutes. But, acknowledgement of the work I do is nonexistent and compensation is restricted as much as possible. There was one employee who made a big deal about it and argued a lot with upper management about my manager not helping out. They fired him over it so now talking about it is totally taboo.

There are such beautiful and breathtaking places in the world, which most people will never be able to see. There are so many constructive and healthy ways to occupy your time, but most people will never get that luxury. There are so many opportunities and experiences that are paywalled behind socioeconomic status. Of course, I could put the blinders back on and turn off the empathy, but I can't do that.





""You can only be worried about yourself and what you can control"". Yes, I could do that, but worrying about ourselves is exactly why we're in this mess to begin with. We, as a supposedly ""intelligent species"", absolutely do not look out for each other. And it's sad to say that it's all by design. If people actually had the ability to help each other without putting their own security at risk, the system wouldn't function. It thrives on brutal competition. What good is capitalism if people aren't stepping all over each other, right?





It's just frustrating, because it's not like this is a unique struggle. Throughout human history there's always been a ruling class and some sort of oppressed, working-serf class. And every single time, the working class is slowly broken over and over and over again. Dead ass though, this story gets old as hell. Like how many times are we gonna do this same song and dance?

42,Corporalism and Grey Skies,"Currency floats in our society, so much that currency is technically both in an absurd abundance as well as simultaneously being invisibly transparent. The 80/20 rule is very much so evident in the case of corporalism and currency. As a cohesive society, we spend our absolute most significant resources both in the form of technology and humans themselves, in order to scrape on and off floating currencies out of corporalist jobs. Some humans are brilliant; their value lies in their skillsets and mind. Most humans are hard-working; their value lies in their numbers and lack of voice.

Considering the topic and reflecting, it would be easy to conclude that this is in fact just how it is. We spend our resources both individually and collectively to satisfy the corporal. There is constantly a corporal cog that requires motion in the form of human fuel. To break the cog would not singly do good nor singly do harm; there is no longer any distinction between them. A person X free of the cog is a person free of civilization, and any person that X desires to interact with also has to be a person free of civilization, too. As minimal as the act of existing within a country‚Äôs borders would threaten the person X‚Äôs freedom, as well would the act of purchasing an egg for breakfast.

Despite unable to achieve freedom from the cog, there are people thriving and blossoming. One explanation would be to label the thriving as members of the 20. They are on the forefront when it comes to corporal interests, meaning they have skillsets of actual use to the rest of the 20. The thriving ranges from the happy independent freelancers that makes enough money to sustain themselves, to the ultrawealthy oligarchs that lives in unbelieveable luxury. In common is their service to the cog. The oligarch‚Äôs money is a symbol of time, quite literally translating to a member‚Äôs ticket that is consumed constantly but never exhumed due to its near infinite pool of content. The cog does not operate in morality; fuel is fuel. Meanwhile the freelancer is granted the privilege of a single ticket every once in a while, completely independently as opposed to a worker from the 80s. The freelancer celebrates the usage of the ticket and experiences both the joy of individual labor as well as the relief of cog duty.

To differentiate between the individual laborers of the 20s and all of the 80s, one has to look at the source of one‚Äôs labor. While the 80s‚Äô labor is very rigidly given from a higher hierarchical position, the 20s‚Äô labor is always operating as equals devoid of hierarchies. This gives enormous power and often a sense of pride to the 20s, granting individual, creative freedom. If one pictures the cog duty ending by physically inserting one‚Äôs ticket into it, the 20s are always the ones doing the inserting, as opposed to the never-included 80s. In that sense, cog duty could be entirely similar and even worse off for 20s compared to 80s, meaning a member of the 20s could have labor so horrible and soul-drenching while the member of the 80s could work in offices of gold and glitter with aesthetics luxurious. The difference lies in the freedom of the two. The 80s member owns nothing of value to the cog. The 20s member has value and opportunities. 

This symbolical ended cog duty is another word for time given. Because of this definition one can further include another set of members to the 20s: the hobbyists. As time given is a signal for your mind to turn towards personal interests, one could kill two birds with one stone by working with hobbies within 20s conditions. As one goes to insert one‚Äôs ticket into the cog, one could already be filled with hours and hours of eustress and satisfaction only personal projects could grant. One could even argue one would not need the time given at all, because the time taken is all one needs. There is no point in differentiating freelancers and hobbyists. One could be both and one could be either, but the most important is to differ them from the 80s.",False,j2165p,yung_pupper,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/j2165p/corporalism_and_grey_skies/,0,1

1. Post scarcity society.

A place with no more competition over resources. Where automation does most work for us and we are given everything we need plus some of things we want. A place where you can spend most of your time pursuing things like Art, Music, or even space travel. 

2. Extended/Infinite Life Expectancy

Advances with technology and medicine may exponentially increase the average life expectancy, possibly to the point where you can live for as long as you want. Also pain and suffering from disease would no longer exist. 

3. The End Of War

Any and all conflict solved through diplomatic solutions. As of point #1 there would be an abundance of resources and pleasure so there would be no reason anyone would want to endure the hell that is war.

I have a bunch of experience but I realized that happiness was worth more to me than money and I didn't like the person I was becoming. 

Since then I've taken jobs that are ""below me"" or at least below my experience level. The job that I'm currently at and have been at for a year in the interview the interviewer said the resume speaks for itself but the only question I have is why didn't you move up in previous positions.  I was just completely honest I said I don't kiss ass and I made a lot more money on the phone (call center work) than moving up and baby-sitting other human beings. 
I was given the job  but I think he expected me to quit pretty quickly knowing that I would be making a lot less money than I could be somewhere else.

Sometimes I feel like the grass would be greener somewhere else, like I'm not living up to my true potential. But I also know the kind of unhappiness that leads to, I feel so damn programmed sometimes and I don't have any friends that feel the same way. Most of my friends and family are in that ambition mindset of ""work hard so I can hopefully retire some day"" 

I went from living beyond my means, drinking too much, and thinking very highly of myself to a very simple life, my job has great hours, weekends off, pays my bills and leaves me a small savings. I live in a small trailer, I moved to a warm climate, I'm 2.5 years sober, and I live very minimalistic. I am less stressed out even with less money coming in but I still feel this pulling within like I have to or should be working harder, doing better, making more money. 

Honestly if I could figure out a way to make money I would live in a small RV or Van and travel the US because I know the odds of retirement are slim and in the end having limited mobility and money van be an ugly and depressing existence.

89,"Hired on as a cashier, now doing courtesy.","Just like the title said, when I went in for the interview it was for a cashier position.  Now however I work every weekday doing anything but cash.  Courtesy is essentially the store labourers, I will do anything and everything from changing garbages, pushing rows of 7-10 carts (and sanitizing them due to covid)  climbing an extension ladder to do the billboard outside, etc.  I specifically told my current boss at the time of the interview that cashing would be a great asset for my resume and also a transferable skill.  Unfortunately though, I was on cash for maybe a months top from being hired, now everything I do is completely unrelated.  Supposedly they‚Äôre short staffed, but management says the store isn‚Äôt hiring. (which makes 0 sense if you‚Äôre short staffed)  The biggest issue I have is that I actually don‚Äôt mind cash at all!  Like I said it‚Äôs a skill that can be easily transferable, but before these courtesy shifts took over I actually didn‚Äôt mind my workplace. Co-workers are great, it‚Äôs a fairly good atmosphere, even management was decent.  But doing a completely different job from what I was hired on is so mentally and physically draining I could care less about my co-workers. Courtesy is far more physical than cash and is basically non-stop doing various tasks back and forth at a very fast pace.  I‚Äôve voiced concerns that this ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt what I was hired on for and have got back exactly a single 4 hour cash shift in like the past 1.5 months.  Another thing that is obnoxious to say the least is that I have never actually went on my breaks on time.  The 15 minute break is always late, no matter what day/circumstances and if my 30 minute lunch break isn‚Äôt late it‚Äôs completely forgotten!

For example:

‚ÄúWhen the rent due, you don't know what I've been through
When we can't afford lights
I write in the dark with a paper I'm putting my pen to
Try to fuck with my mental
Said my potential is minimum wage
Majority die before twenty five
Forty years later we're put in a grave
I'm filled up with rage
This is the culture you sent me to save?
Society stuck in a cage‚Äù

A world that your daughter can't even escape

Cause I've been jackin' off to Kim since I was in the fifth grade
You see you show us how to live, but it's a fib to get paid

94,"What type of company do you work for, and are you organizing at your job?","I'm really interested in labor organizing as a tool in a program of broader change. I work at a small-ish retail company (around 100 employees over three local branches), and we've been working with a national union to organize for an election to establish a local at our workplace. It's been slow going getting the votes we need to file for an election with the national labor relations board, but we're almost there. 

It's a little scary. The business has been hit hard by the pandemic and consequent shutdown measures, capacity limits and people just not wanting to risk exposure to shop in person. There's been talk of the business closing if our city has to shut down non-essential businesses again. We can operate during a shutdown but it cuts incoming revenue by a lot. I'm a little afraid that if we file for an election the owners will just close the business. However, the union we're working with has helped a few of their locals seize their workplaces after closures and run them as collectively owned worker co-ops. That would be the dream.

I think that the collective bargaining power National union backing could give us would make our jobs better. My workplace is also quite prestigious within its industry and in the city where I live. So if we're successful, that also gives us an opportunity to serve as an example of what successful labor organizing can look like in an industry that is typically union-free. It'd be nice to think that we could contribute to the strengthening of labor unions somehow.

Businesses are really afraid of unions. Amazon recently notified their employees that they're being monitored for labor organizing activities. This is illegal intimidation, but the fines Amazon would face if a complaint were filed mean nothing to them. However, people are still working to organize at Amazon. Think of the change that could be achieved by a concerted effort to organize all Amazon drivers, programmers and warehouse workers. If it was twenty-five percent successful just in one branch of operations, Amazon wouldn't be able to fight it. For instance, if one distribution center organized and filed for an election, Amazon would immediately close that center. If 25 percent of their distribution centers filed for elections simultaneously, they'd have a harder time quashing it. I don't mean to downplay the work of people already organizing at Amazon: I'm saying they're doing good work, and they have a real chance at gaining some say in the material conditions of their employment.

103,Working by Gaslight in the time of COVID,"TLDR employers are monsters and life is terrible, this is a dumb rant:

\---

Today in my Work Inbox was a letter from the Hourly Employees Rep about a talk with the Administration about employment security going forward, ie, how there's no security, no big surprise. But this blurb got me:

&gt;Nevertheless‚Ä¶ as sobering as the above uncertainty might sound, the absolute last thing Monsters University wishes to do ‚Äì to any of its employees ‚Äì is abandon them. This is why employees were paid 100% of their wages through June 30th even if no hours were scheduled. This is why employees (the current priority being those who haven‚Äôt been scheduled since June 30th) have been shifted to available positions in other departments when their position ended instead of being let go entirely. Desertion and mistreatment are not items on the agenda.  
&gt;  
&gt;VP James P. Sullivan provided one sweeping example of a group of employees reassigned to different positions from what they were initially assigned: our lifeguards. Given that our pool is closed until further notice, but our outside track is open to the public, our lifeguards are currently employed as ‚ÄúSafety Ambassadors‚Äù on the track, monitoring for safety and enforcing social distancing. This does not mean that when the pool reopens they won‚Äôt be lifeguards again, just that in the interim their position has changed, and they are still earning wages.

Names have been changed to protect ***me*** from a defamation suit or something, I don't know.

I spent most of June fighting to get paid for weeks of work that my supervisor did not want to pay me for while also fighting for them to tell me what my hours actually were, or if I had been fired or not. HR and Business Services, the latter of which Sully is VP, were places I contacted for help mediating this, and a botched screencap text message revealed that those folks were all coordinating to craft emails to send to me under my Supervisor's name in order to gaslight me into dropping my claim.

I did not, by the way, and forwarded that fumble along to the State along with the rest of the correspondence and eventually got my wages back, but certainly not anything like the '100% of wages' that the Rep letter said. The fight to learn how many hours they wanted me to work or not also made applying for unemployment a real treat and I lost weeks of benefits due to that.

The bit about the lifeguards was the real thumb into the wound though, as it was actually a clever way to keep people on the payroll, but while they were coming up with that idea they were trying to screw me while I am doing a job that is meaningful and so difficult to replace that they won't fire me.

It bothered me so much in such a cold pit-in-your-chest way that I had to write the Rep a lengthy letter rebutting the assertion with the details of my experience and talking about the emotional and financial toll it took on me and my family.

The letter was long so I won't post it, but I wanted to post the snip from the last paragraph because it described just how bad I'm feeling right now:

&gt;""But I nonetheless think that sentiment should have been applied to *going forward*¬†and not to where we have been, because the amusement is only a tinge to a deep lonely sadness at seeing such cleverness be applied to re-employing people whose jobs are literally useless right now while the only effort put into addressing my continuing struggle to stay above water was to push me further down.""

So this isn't a post that will really grease up your guillotine, I admit. I just wanted to shout into the void, or at the void, because that's better than just sitting there as the void passes over, and I hope it passes over quickly.

I feel sad but also a hard-to-describe sense of disappointment, which I called loneliness in my response, in the repeated demonstrations that the people who hold my fate in their hands are not just cruel but incredibly careless and too stupid to be effective in their goals. When your hurts are inflicted by someone clever or practiced it feels, somehow, a little less shameful, especially if you succeed in the end. But I do feel shame, even if I should not, to be put in such desperate circumstances by the sparring equivalent of a drunken Walrus falling down a flight of stairs.",False,j24idk,LunarGiantNeil,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/j24idk/working_by_gaslight_in_the_time_of_covid/,1,1

It was thought provoking. The fact that whether the work was done did not matter (they were only 'busted' incidentally when the boss was browsing security footage). What mattered was physically existing within the allocated 'workplace' for the commanded amount of time.

I'm looking for work, around 30 - 35 hours per week at the very most, so I can save up and my friend and I can rent a place out. He's keen for 40 hours or over, but that amount of work would suck the soul out of me. Even 35 hours would be pretty hard on me mentally. He's adamant that even if we rented a cheap 2 bedroom house, we would struggle to survive. Counting rent, fuel, water, internet, power and food, he says we'd need to make at the minimum $700 a week between us to get by. But if I'm working 30 hours and he's working 40 that's $1100. Even more if he works longer. It doesn't seem like we wouldn't be able to survive on that money, but he's certain that my perception is warped having never lived independently, and it's going to be a lot harder than I imagine. He's trying to convince me to work more, and dismisses any reasoning I give him for not wanting to as ""being lazy.""

135,Just had 2 weeks of holiday and realised a lot,"Hey,

I just got 2 weeks of holiday after almost a year of working all the time. Im a father of a 1 year old baby and in this 2 weeks, I could finaly not only spend time with my little girl, but the quality was also above than when I get out of work or even at the weekends.

Why? Because after working 8 sometimes 9 hours, I just dont have the ""mood"" and energy for anything. I play a bit with my baby after work, we eat together and then its already time to put her to sleep, which is everything exhausting after a shity work day. On this 2 week breaks i happily bathed her and we played 30min after and we read a book and then I put her to sleep. I liked it cause I wasnt out of energy. On weekends I need 1 day to recover and on sunday you already have this mental feeling of getting to work. I never liked sundays. Best feeling for your mental health is to know you got 1 or 2 weeks as a buffer to work. This only clears your head. Weekend barely does it for me. 

My point here is with this rambling is, that work also destroys your time with your own children. I mean how many fathers (or working mothers) waste their time with work instead of bonding time with their own fucking children? My father i remember was working 6 days a week and didnt do anything with me. I dont want to be like this. Im very lucky that I only have 10min to work, so on lunch break I go home and after work I dont have to a slave and waste time with a car I just walk home. 

Any parents here feel the same? I actualy would like to work 6 hours a day since the last 2 hours are the ones that fucking with my energy but yeah, goodbye money.

167,Work killed the happiness inside of me. Just leave me alone and let me be work at my own pace,"After trying about 6 jobs in my 20s I‚Äôve come to realize that no matter what I do I‚Äôll always hate work. I hate sucking up to bosses and acting like I enjoy seeing my coworkers. I hate having that pressure to constantly produce results and prove myself. I use to believe in genuinely befriending coworkers, helping each other out, and working together to achieve a common goal we can all be proud of, but the corporate life has sucked it out of me. Everyone in the office always gives off the vibe that they only care about themselves and that they‚Äôre ready to throw each other under a bus if needed. Everything is so fake a superficial. 

My boss always tells me that he‚Äôs here for me and wants to see me succeed but every time we meet, he also hounds me about how I‚Äôm not progressing fast enough, how I‚Äôm learning too slow, how I don‚Äôt understand this or that, how he wants me to grow faster. Never really asks me how I am or how I‚Äôm feeling and dives straight into asking me what I‚Äôve accomplished for the week. If I didn‚Äôt complete something fast enough for his standards he flies off the walls. He likes to tell me how when he was in my position he ALWAYS completed his assignments before the deadline and went above and beyond to contribute to the company. Obviously all he‚Äôs not REALLY here for me. It sounds more like he‚Äôs just here to see what I‚Äôve produced, and to tell me to work faster so the company can get more out of me for less. What if I don‚Äôt care about progressing fast? What if I just want to go at my own slow pace? What if I don‚Äôt want to be an overachiever at the cost of my mental and physical wellbeing? Why can‚Äôt people just be satisfied with me doing the bare minimum? Everyone learns and grows at their own pace, and everyone has their own life goals too. My job requirements never said ‚Äúmust be a hard worker and plough through work as fast as you can so you can take on more‚Äù. If they want me to work faster, work more, then they should offer to pay me more too. 

I‚Äôve gotten to the point where I don‚Äôt give a flying fuck about getting promoted or being the top performing employee, because it seems like the harder I work the more responsibilities I get and the more people expect of me. Sure I might get a small raise or recognition but compared to the torture I have to go through to get it, no thanks. I‚Äôm not hurting anyone by doing the bare minimum, and I don‚Äôt think anyone should be looked down upon for doing so. When has being a super fast and hard worker been the standard? 

I don‚Äôt even know what my point in writing this is, other than I‚Äôm so sick of working, the fake company cultures, and being pressure to perform. This subreddit is the only place where I feel like I can find people who understand me. I‚Äôm just so sick of working and wasting my youth doing things I hate for money. It‚Äôs like no one is ever happy  with just enough, everyone always wants more more more out of their employees. It‚Äôs always all about results and numbers. All this company talk of ‚Äúwe‚Äôre one big family‚Äù is a lie. It‚Äôs like just let me be. Let me be as lazy as I want as long as I deliver the bare minimum, which is what is only required of me anyway. Let me live life at my own pace instead of constantly comparing me to other more experienced, higher performing people and asking me why I can‚Äôt be like them. How about saying for once ‚ÄúEven though you‚Äôre not progressing at the pace I‚Äôm use to, I can see that you‚Äôre learning and slowly getting better. How fast you want to progress in this career and company is up to you so as long as you‚Äôre happy and delivering the minimum, we‚Äôre good‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúI gave you this assignment and expected you to complete it faster.

174,Is there anyone out there who found a serious and positive answer to being antiwork?,"I used to be a great employee, then I thought I became a terrible employee.

I beat myself up for it. But then I realised just like you all here that we are in a broken system where being taken advantage of is the norm. If you realise it, and show any signs of realising it, you are a problematic, and lazy employee who needs to be sabotaged and bullied out...

I almost wish I didn‚Äôt realise this and simply worked harder at my old job and got medicated or something. Reading that back is so depressing but it‚Äôs true.

I started my own business and worked all hours and barely made any money because I hadn‚Äôt even built up an audience to actually give it a good start. I was also too embarrassed to even tell people about it. I told a couple of people who I thought would be supportive and they told me I was a bit big for my boots.

I launched it too early, so I was marketing and serving a tiny handful of clients while having no money to put into the business and only me running it nearly made me have a breakdown. I closed it. I did learn a lot though and I‚Äôm glad for the experience.

I‚Äôm now at home with a new baby, very fortunate to have the support of my working husband. But I feel like time is running out for me and how long I can ‚Äúacceptably‚Äù stay at home.

He‚Äôs still a tiny baby and I‚Äôm so knackered I don‚Äôt have the energy to do any self-actualising like hobbies or learning a new skill with limited resources and access due to corona... But I know this is better than the rat race.

It feels like any idea I have it‚Äôs a hobby tied to monetisation (barf, but probably necessary), and a skill that I am at ground zero at and don‚Äôt even know if or when in time I can pursue it with a wee babe in the age of corona.

My SO is very fortunate for his job but he hates the rat race too, and he‚Äôs often thinking of ways to change paths.

Last year even before Covid I saw friends other than the ones I lived with about 5 times total. That's about once a month.   
I finally feel like I'm actually living my life. So here I am calculating how long I could live like this without needing to take on more work.

The first World Happiness Report was published in 2012. It summarised the state of world happiness, factors that caused happiness and what this meant for government policy. Later reports have explored topics such as the importance of happiness for nations and what its objective benefits are, as well as ranking countries on reported levels of happiness. 

Critics have argued that the measurement of happiness is difficult. Countries may have conflicting data. For example, being high of self-reported happiness but also having a high suicide rate. Others argue that happiness relates to an individual. Talking about the happiness of a group is therefore meaningless. 

Is this statement ' Happiness is a purely personal experience that has no benefits for other outcomes':

A) True

B) False, or 

C) Cannot say?",False,iytjs3,RearrangeYourLiver,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/iytjs3/applying_for_a_job_that_has_a_verbal_reasong_test/,3,1
225,I just got remarkably better performance review just by writing more emails and arranging more calls / meetings,"Hello all,

I wanted to share my experience with you after working for almost 4 years in a corporate world.

I work in IT industry as developer / admin for an enterprise solution. You know the typical workload of these type of roles. Sometimes you are busy as hell sometimes, there is nothing to do litreally. I have been always a caring and responsible employee. I always try to be flexible, helpful and solution oritented. I tend to complete my tasks as quickly as possible to sastisfy my customers (other business units of the company) However, I was unable to get fair performance reviews for the performance I show until I realized a stupid fact.

**In corporate world, It does not actually matter how hard you work, It is all about showing yourself busy.**

I realized this fact recently when I started to get more interactions from my manager whenever I send more emails and meeting invitations to the people. %90 of those emails and invitations could be considered unneccessary. I made up stupid questions or business related conflicts by email for obvious answers, I arranged calls and sent meeting notes for the trivial matters. I mean, I arraged calls to show people fields on the forms when they become hidden or visible or how approval process works etc. which takes 15 mins to demonstrate.

Then I started to produce meeting notes which no one reads (I never get any feedback for the meeting notes I shared) but It makes me look busier than I am actually. 

Finally, I have received my performance review recently and It was far better than the previous ones. Did I work more or harder? No. I just learnt how to make myself look busier in corporate world.

234,Work seen as a blessing!,"Please be kind to me. This is my first post here. 

I was born as a girl child ""in India"" to an ""upper middle class educated"" family! Education was thrust on me. Competition was thrust upon me. I participated in a competitive exam to get selected in top 50 students amongst 7 million people who applied. I joined. Went through horrible bullying which almost broke me. I couldn't take it anymore.

But when I called back home to say I am breaking down, I was told that if I come back home, I will be married off to a person I haven't even met. This was not presented as a threat, just a REALITY OF LIFE AND REALITY OF SURVIVAL. It was presented to me as a blessing that as an Indian woman I was being given an option to be independent and work rather than be a subservient housewife!

I was scared. I persevered. Did very well in university. Did well through initial stages of my work life .... despite the numerous sexual advances of my seniors offered in exchange for career growth (which I categorically resisted)! Yes that's what an independent woman in 1990's India had to go through. 

I ended up moving out of India to Australia and ultimately settling down in UK as I wanted to get away from all the shit I was getting as a working woman in India. Also I felt the work-life balance is better anywhere outside of India.

I fooled myself for years that I was lucky I escaped. I have a well paid job and I am not being looked down upon for it or being exploited for it! 

BUT... I broke down in my late 30's. Went into therapy. I am surviving on medication now. I still hold my job. I am psychologically dependent on it as it was drilled into my mind since I gained conciousness that career is critical to my survival! 

Starting to thing though, where am I going? Is it all worth it? Is this all there is to life?",False,ixv0fl,99zakya,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ixv0fl/work_seen_as_a_blessing/,8,1

There are no jobs in my area that aren't above minimum wage, the ones that do are either miserable shit holes, or require 5 years experience. I've applied to fucking everything and no where is hiring because those who knew someone in the bizz already. Even my friends IN SCHOOL are just miserable and have no time to live their lives, and even the ones who have graduated are struggling just as hard as me; and a lot of them are extremely intelligence talented people.

239,Is an anti work society realistic politically and practically?,"I've been lurking on this sub for a few months and I totally agree with the majority on here that find work to be horrible and soul crushing. Personally I couldn't live a happy life if I had to work. It's nothing short of torture for me. 

But how would a society where no one worked actually look like? Assuming that we don't make huge strides in technology and have robots that do everything which isn't going to be any time soon. 

I see a lot of people on here decry working for the capitalist system for low wages while a few get wealthy. That seems to be a huge problem for some people but honestly it's not MY problem with work.

I just don't want to work, PERIOD. I HATE the idea of having to get up a certain time in the morning, having to answer emails etc. It doesn't matter if workers owned the company, it doesn't matter my wage or if i was doing it for the good for millions or to make one person rich. I made really good money before I quit working. I felt valued and my boss was great. It didn't really matter. I just hate work. 

But no political system as far as I know guarantees no work. Communists work. I went to Cuba and Vietnam and they still have jobs they hate, bullshit bosses Just less inequality and much better social safety nets.

Even those who pull away completely from society like homesteaders work very hard. Some are not plugged into the capitalist system at all, grow their food, take care of lifestock solar panel for energy, hunt for meat and some of them report working from sunup to sun down. 

My sense is that anti work people want to be provided food, shelter, healthcare and all the basic needs but have the freedom to pursue their own interests. That's what I want as well but what would a society/political system like that look like?

259,Possible solutions for not working. Solution 1: Homeless by choice,"I have been brainstorming a bit and have been pouring over options for not working.

There's been a lot of commiserating lately which is fine and good, but no real solutions. 

So lets discuss!

Each week, I want to discuss possible solutions ***no matter how crazy***. After all, hardcore problems need hardcore solutions. Nor is one solution going to be for everyone.

We also need to define ""work"". The way I define ""work"" in it's negative context is any activity where you are doing the inconvenient or unpleasant stuff so an employer or owner does not have to while the owner or employer does not pay you enough to eventually not do such things or ever ""get ahead"".

Let's talk about probably the most controversial of solutions - being **Homeless by choice**.

While this sub tends to focuses on the Employer, Landlords take up half (or more) of income. 

If landlords can be eliminated, more resources can be put towards owning things - even perhaps an inexpensive house in a less than desirable area. Or whatever agenda.

On the surface this one is simple, if not hardcore as hell and requires balls of steel. You simply reduce what you own down to bare necessities and live in either a car or go grab a tent and stealth camp in wooded areas that get little traffic and hopefully remain undiscovered.

I do not recommend shelters unless absolutely necessary because of strict rules not compatible with freedom, safety, and the fact most homeless services exist primarily for salaries often to the tune of hundreds of thousands or to spread cult like religions among a captive audience.

**Positives**

\- With no ties, you can literally go anywhere. Dream job in another state? You can move.

\- You literally have nothing to lose. Job treating you bad? What are they going to do? Make you homeless? You laugh in their face.

\- If you DO work, all that money can be put towards whatever agenda you want. Be this eventually buying a cheap house in the ghetto, staying high or drunk (which many do), saving up for a plane ticket to a better country or area with better prospects, whatever. You could work 2 jobs and it's ALL yours. And, unless you are homeless in some expensive, overyped area like San Franscisco you could have quite a nest egg.

\- You are not scrambling around the first of the month. Zero stress from owing people.

\- It CAN be revolutionary. The stories of the rail kids of the 90s, Abbie Hoffman, and (some- not the posers in it for ad views) the people on YouTube are real. You are sticking your thumb up at society and their machinations.

 

**Negatives**

\- This can not really be done if you have children or a family. Social Services literally hang out in places homeless seek services taking away kids.

\- You have to be somewhat mentally and physically strong. This is lots of walking for necessities. Also, lonely and can be demeaning aggravating existing mental conditions.

\- While it is not illegal per se not to own or rent a place, many communities make activities of daily living illegal. It is illegal to hang around a place without buying something, sleeping, using the bathroom, or pretty much existing. This can be mitigated by scouting out hidden locations, but in extreme urbanized environments with too many homeless already this may not be possible and works better in medium sized towns rather than mega metropolises.

\- No storage. You either have to hide stuff or literally carry everything with you. Clothes alone are very bulky and heavy and gets dirty and begins to smell. Anything left outside is considered abandoned so you have no recourse if stuff comes up missing. It is possible to get a cheap storage unit, but you can't live there and there may come a point where storage fees can exceed the value of what you are storing versus merely replacing things.

\- You have less legal rights on foot or in a car than in a apartment or house. Cops have been known to ""stop and frisk"" or haul in people on questionable suspicions who ""look homeless"".

\- Hygiene. With no access to bathrooms and showers, it is harder to keep clean and this can hamper people's opinions. There are work arounds like gym memberships, the occasional hotel room, and carrying wet washcloths, but each has it's shortcomings.

\- You are passively hunted. People don't like homeless. They want them to go away. This can be mitigated by ""not looking homeless"".

\- Social standing. WILL lose friends, possibly spouses/lovers. Must hide from others because of stigma. This can be worked around through presentation. Hell, you aren't ""homeless"", you are a green urban explorer.

271,Check out this boomer employer/landlord of mine...,"I have been working for this woman who is in her 70s for a year now. It's a camp host position with lots of acreage surrounded by national forest. It's so beautiful out here. The kicker is I get to live out here for free, but there is no pay whatsoever. It doesn't matter how hard I work out here; I still get nothing. She has visited the property a total of two times since I've worked here. She barely ever responds to my emails and calls. Now that Oregon winter is fast-approaching, she wants to know everything about my past, says if I want to keep this job (and a place to live), I have to sign some documents ""for it to be legal"". 

The previous camp hosts were given a credit card from her and ran up tons of cash advances. Since they had control over the website and facebook page, when they got caught, they held those things for ransom essentially. They posted lies and left them up, potentially killing tons of business (we've had guests mention their serious concerns so I can only imagine the folks that didn't bother to inquire). But that's my fault apparently. 

We've been dealing with the pandemic, wildfire smoke (guests don't want to bring horses to exercise in that for weeks after sky clears), the owner's refusal to invest money in the business (we had to turn guests away because there is no working bathroom, only an outhouse), and the ongoing website/facebook crisis. But that's my fault too apparently.

**This is the email I got this morning (removed personal details):**


Thank you [NAME] for the information but I need you to elaborate more on:  
The college experience. You said your GI Bill ran out because it was expensive for-profit school. Why did you choose that collage? You said you worked and went to collage, where did you work etc. etc. while attending college?
How long did you spend in the service?
How long did you work at the [LAST OCCUPATION] in [TOWN]?  Why was your position Terminated... 

What are you getting in aid per month, yourself, and your mother?

[BUSINESS NAME] comes first because it is a business, our business. The sixth  business  WE CREATED  (NOT BOUGHT, not HANDED DOWN) One of 6 over a span of 60 years of time that we have 10 years of blood, sweat, and tears as well as 100's of thousands of dollars invested in just this one the same as everyone else who made it into the 3%. I am not sure nor do I presume in any way that you are of this mentality but for the record, I personally after working with those of your generation have come to a conclusion that they have NO CONCEPT of what it takes to just manage a business let alone CREATE your own business working every day 24/7  18 hr or more year after year denying yourself of everything except the absolute necessities to survive for a pittance never taking your eye off your goal watching that pittance grow into a substantial nest egg or enough to start that dream rolling and seeing that dream come into reality. Education, IQ nor money has anything to do with success. GRIT is no. 1. and was describes once as the tiny piece of sand in the oyster that turns into the pearl and that is so true but it takes a long time. PERSEVERANCE  never, never give up.  I have seen over and over this generation wants to start at the top but has no Grit no drive, no reality, or concept of real-life skills. I lay most of this on parenting or lack thereof.
Well I got carried away but could write a book on this subject

As you have witnessed it only takes a couple of toxic millennials such as [PREVIOUS CAMP HOST #1] and [PREVIOUS CAMP HOST #2] who in my educated view are exemplary or void of all real-life reality and skills coning their way through life because they believe they deserved that certificate of achievement for merely getting out of bed each day and to hell with everyone else, yet I saw qualities in both of them that were phenomenal but used for evil especially [CAMP HOST #2] has shown and continues to display narcissistic personality which of course has nothing to do with millennials. 

It is critical that I as CEO of the company make sure I have the best people at [BUSINESS NAME] in order to secure its future. You are there because of my decision which was I still believe to be morally correct but as you are aware that was temporaryor like I said to give me time to figure out the future. 

When you found out about [BUSINESS NAME] facebook site being trashed you said you could fix that  and insissted on doing so which impressed me. I made it clear to you I could not and did not have the time to do that but she has not done this.  I gave you numbers to call for a person to work with to help fix this. I told you that needed to be taken care of asap. 

If our circumstances were normal I would have worked day and night on behalf of this business but I have not seen this commitment so it is time I make decisions to mitigate further damage by pursuing the best people to continue at [BUSINESS NAME].

So, once again I believe you could be a deserving asset but if you are thinking you are there or staying because of your own circumstances that will not be acceptable. 

I also want to re-iterate that [NEW CAMP MANAGER] move or not to move Nov 1st has not been
decided.  

Just so you will no. Small children were not in the picture last March nor will it be in the best interest that they be allowed there now. [BUSINESS NAME] is in no way a homeless camp. I expect to be notified in advance of any significant changes that affect [BUSINESS NAME] or my ability to manage what is going on out there. If it does not enhance the business which in the future will enhance everyone's future it will probably not happen. 

Your questions are welcome.

------

* We recently had a large horse event here and people told me they've never seen the property look so good.

* My position wasn't terminated. I quit so that I could spend my time on this business, but she just assumes I was terminated. 

* I don't know why she referred to herself as CEO. She owns the property and business, but it's not traded. 

* She made up this story that I agreed to fix her website and facebook page (apparently for free too like everything else). It's her business that she would work 18 hours a day to make it work she claims, but is unwilling to do anything about the website/facebook page for a year now. But now that she realized the business isn't making money she wants to point the finger at me. 

* The previous camp hosts had a small boy so I don't know what the hell she's talking about.

* After a year she just decided she gets to demand to know everything about me and make me sign documents.

* In the previous email I told her I was a homeless veteran before this job so that's why she responded that she doesn't want there to be a homeless camp. This coming from the woman who cries in Christianity every chance she gets.

* She said she might be hiring a camp manager to take over the house so I may not even have access to laundry/shower/fireplace etc during the winter. It's all up in the air and has been for the last two weeks. Extremely stressful.

Sorry for the rant, but I had to get this off my chest and I'm hoping for some advice on what to do here.

291,I'm just a Temp.,"If any of you have ever been Temp workers, you can probably relate to this:

Got out of a very pointless meeting today. Two regular government workers talking down to 8 of us temp/contract workers. For context, all eight of us are paid the minimum, about $14/hr + agency takes a few bucks, so closer to $11-12. 

(Regular workers in this office get $22+ an hour as well as a bunch of benefits that we don't get, paid sick leave, vacation, holidays paid, med insurance, etc.) 

The point of this meeting was to let everyone know that they would be expanding job tasks to match those of their current government lab/admin staff. More work, zero additional compensation, bonus: they've let us know there's a 99% guarenteed chance of being let go once our contracts are up.

Luckily, I'm leaving in a week anyway. But they asked for feedback, turning to me specifically as I had been there the longest out of all the temps. 

""I'm just a temp worker, we were hired on to assist in data entry only.""

They looked at me like I had five heads and asked what the big deal was. Again, this office has specialists, folks with degrees, who have been here for many years. We're all just 4-6month temp workers with very few protections as well as very little compensation. I don't mind hard work, but I hate the entitlement mindset some places have. 

A week ago they were gloating to themselves that they were able to snag someone way way overqualified for a particular laboratory position. They were so happy that they got her on a contract for ""only $15 an hour!"".  This position is for a permanent job, but they're making her go to an agency first- even though they already plan on hiring/keeping her. Fair compensation is just as much a joke nowadays in government work as it is in many public sectors.

Bonus: The office was closed the other day, everyone on paid leave. My boss asked in advance what I'd be doing that day, I pointed out that I'll need to work, (somewhere else), to make up for the lost day of pay. She laughed and pointed out that I'm already compensated to take the day off! I explained to her that I and all the other contracters are actually not paid for any kind of leave.

Did study four years social work in university, our government gives grants and loans like around 300 usd per week of study, so after 3.5 years the loans where around 15k usd total I think, if you dont study 100% its lower. The education is free and the grants and loans are for living expenses, everyone is eligible. These numbers are calculated with todays exchange. The interest on the loans today is 0.16% with a monthly payment of 60 usd.

Work in the government/municipality most people with the same degree and earn around 4300 usd per month, before taxes, 3300 usd after taxes. Private sector is smaller and earns a bit more. The education wasnt that hard and like everyone gets a job. The salary after tax include pension payments, healthcare and so on. We also have 30 vacation days, five more when you reach a certian age, think its 40 or 50.

It cost 10 usd a month to insure against unemployment, so if you are laid of you get 80% of you salary for a year or so and after that a bit less. Even if you dont pay that you are insured but get less. But its really hard to layoff people in Sweden, especially in the government.

At my work we have flexible hours, so you can come early and go home early, come late and work late within some limits.

Even if this sounds like heaven compared to most countries my goal is to be independent, not have to work. So even if we have different starting points our goal is the same.

Having the majority of employees work remote was always a | temporary measure to hi
spread of COVID-19 within our communities and it is now time to. further enable the face-

In-person interaction is better suited for, innovative dialogue with colleagues that u sitiraeteny a

307,From 1920 - exactly 100 years ago,"‚ÄúYou may tell the American people that
we are living in an age of transition,

‚ÄúThe great danger is that we shall make
progress too fast.

‚ÄúSome was not built in a day, and it would
be a very bad thing for the working classes if
they get too much money before they learn the
value of it.

‚ÄúI am for Progress, but it must be Lane,
Orderly progress.

‚ÄúEvolution, not Revolution, is my motto.
Respect for law is the great need of the times.

‚ÄúMet the workingman resolve to Build Up,
not to Dear Down.

‚ÄúTo not decay Health. Of a man has saved
up a billion dollars he is entitled to enjoy it.
Instead of trying to take his billion away from
him, every man should resolve to save up a
billion of his own.

‚ÄúWork hard and Lay hard. That should
be the rule of life of every honest man.

‚ÄúThe eight-hour day may be a good thin,
in some industries, but it is not necessarily
good in all industries.

‚ÄúWork twelve hours, if necessary. To to
bed early, and get up refreshed for the next
day‚Äôs toil.

‚ÄúTo to church on Sunday.

‚ÄúMud outside of working hours get your
mind off your work. Take a spin in the
country. To to the seashore or the mon-
pains or to Europe in the summer.

314,Being disadvantaged,"Hey all, I lurk around but was inspired to make an account to post to this sub after reading a good post on gas lighting on Reddit (can't find the post now, please link or tag yourself if you'd like). It talked about people who may be at disadvantages and its not a matter of getting ""motivated"" or ""hustling"" and working harder...But it inspired me to put in my own words my frustrations and hoping some other people relate too.

I'm still trying to figure out the general philosophy of this sub and Anti Work people. Personally, I LOVE working hard on things, like projects, interests, etc but am just so tired of ""working"".  

I have a speech impediment that I have had since I was a kid, and its nothing intellectual/behavioural/psychological (a severe form of stuttering that can manifest physically such as "" tics"" and what have you). But I have never let it stop me and have accomplished many things. However my biggest challenge now in my adult life is with work. 

I have always worked crappy jobs with bad environments, toxicity, hours, pay, you name it. I have a very strong work ethic and always do my best, plus I am intelligent (or I like to think so lol :p), dependable and all around an excellent employee. I lost my job in the summer and have been looking for a new one so, you know, I don't die on the streets of starvation. My resume is pretty solid after years of working and I get interviews, but I'm absolutely positive that I have not been able to land anything because of how my speech comes across. 

It makes me angry, sad, frustrated, and honestly scared for my future. Its no good being a good little worker bee if you can't find a hive. I am very qualified for all of these higher paying (lol) jobs but nobody will take a chance on someone with a ""disability"" when we have 100s of people applying for jobs just for scraps. What the hell is the  point? I'm literally trying not to die here...I just want to rent my crappy appartment in my crappy neighbourhood with some food in the fridge and maybe a little leftover to save. Why is it so hard? What do you have to do? Does anyone else feel this way?

339,I'm working my job with one foot out the door and can't wait to leave.,"I posted this is in another sub and they said I should post it here.

5 years ago my now-wife and I moved to Salt Lake City for her PhD.  Long story short, I got a programming job right out of school, got laid off after 6 months, got another IT-related job, and have been there ever since.  Good pay, good PTO, working from home full time these days, pretty chill altogether.

But in the past year or so, I came to this conclusion: I don't want to do IT anymore.  I'm tired of helping people with their IT problems (who are often angry and frustrated), I hate programming, and I don't care about keeping up to date on the latest tech or getting certifications or anything.  I just want out.

The only thing that's holding me back is that while my wife is getting her PhD, I'm the main money-maker for us, so we can't really afford for me to start over with something I'd genuinely want to pursue.  Aside from my wife, our dog, and my couple main hobbies, the only thing I care about is animals.  I'm pretty knowledgeable about animals in general, especially wolves and Komodo dragons, but I don't have a degree in wildlife biology or ecology or anything like that, and I really don't want to go back to school.  I felt trapped, like how am I going to get out?  So I've just hunkered down and kept working.

But recently my wife started talking about graduating, saying she has enough data to write a thesis on, so she's going to talk with her lab director about it.  Her aim is to graduate next fall and get a job soon after.  We've talked about it and if our financial situation is right once she gets a job, my plan is to get a relatively low-stress job with a wildlife sanctuary, zoo, animal shelter, or government department of wildlife just doing administrative or clerical work.  I wouldn't be working directly with the animals, but at least I'd be less stressed and working for a place where I actually give a shit about what they do.

Ever since coming to that conclusion and having an actual plan for the future, I've been so excited.  It's the light at the end of the tunnel.  The exit door.  I'm comforted by the sheer idea of leaving.  And because of that, I'm basically working my current job with one foot out the door.  I'm emotionally checked-out.  I feel less rushed and overwhelmed by work (we're a team of 3 doing the job of 10) because I just don't care anymore.  I still do all my work correctly and in a timely fashion, but I just do the bare minimum now.  I'm more frank and honest with clients about things rather than trying to sugarcoat them to keep them from freaking out further.  I'm more stoic rather than having to put on a fake smile to seem interested in my work.

All in all, it just feels good to have a sense of direction and knowing that the current situation is only temporary and close to being over.",False,iyff7x,AppleHill_Wizard,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/iyff7x/im_working_my_job_with_one_foot_out_the_door_and/,2,1

The last time I had a job, I lost 8lbs in 6 months, was constantly physically sick, my bipolar episodes were worse and more frequent, and I had acute kidney failure at one point. I spent do much of my time angry and crying. I couldn't even enjoy my time off because I almost never got consecutive days off.

I stopped going to work a few years back when I was pregnant for my own health and for the sake of the baby. My husband had a salary position that he was fairly happy with, that gave him weekends and holidays off, and a fair amount of paid leave days. But he doesn't have that job anymore, and our financial situation has changed. 

His new job pays more than minimum wage, and covers most of our expenses, but not all of them. We're a few hundred dollars a month short. 

His new job is online from home so we can't switch internet plans for a cheaper one. We can't get cheaper phone plans until our contracts are up in another year. We just moved to a place with cheap rent so we can't cut anymore costs there. 

I'm going to have to find a job that works opposite to my husbands work schedule so we won't have to pay for childcare. We will barely see eachother anymore. His new job already has late hours so we're not going to bed or waking up together. If I'm working on days he's off, then we'll only see eachother a few hours a day.

I hate this. I love being creative, and doing things, but it is incredibly hard to make a living off of the things that I genuinely like to do. I'm really trying to make it work so I can be home with my family, but I don't know if I can. 

I'm doing freelance photography, but, so far, I only have 1 session booked for next month. I live near the ocean so I've been collecting stones and shells on the beach to make jewelry with. I've only just started so I haven't put anything up for sale yet. I don't know if I'll be able to make enough money from it, but I'm really hopeful. I'm also trying to write a book, but I know that authors don't actually make much, unless they make the best sellers list.

Back up three weeks ago, my hubs had a full mental breakdown and tried to kill himself. We‚Äôve been living through some financial dire straights, like many Americans‚Äîpaycheck to paycheck, credit card to credit card, borrowing money from my parents just so we can afford groceries after all the bills took our income. It became too much for him. His depression and anxiety broke. I had to take him to the hospital and he‚Äôs been going for treatment, started a medicine regimen, and while he hasn‚Äôt fully healed, it‚Äôs been getting better. He was off for 4 days of which he had PTO for. He brought in doctors notes for documentation‚Äîall of that. His boss was really nice it seemed. Telling him she was so sorry he was going through a hard time, and that she was there for him whatever he needed, and would work with him on his schedule if needed while he was healing. Go to last Thursday...my hubs texted his boss and told her he was having an anxiety attack and needed a minute to get his head straight and that he would come in, but he preferred if he could have the day because he was having a hard time. She told him that they had already gone over that he needed to be present and that it was inexcusable not to show up. He said that he could come in if she really needed him to. His boss said no. Then she started in on how his doctors notes looked fake and how he was just making it up so he didn‚Äôt have to go in. He then took a picture of the printed note and sent it to her‚Äîshe said you‚Äôre done. Don‚Äôt come back. All this after this woman hired him under the premise that he‚Äôd work a 6 month trial as a production manager at a print shop for $16/hr and then the pay would go up significantly. That was 2 years ago and never happened either. This woman also constantly told my husband how amazing he was at his job and how he was was like a brother to her. Then, she turned around and told her ‚Äúbrother‚Äù he was done. over text. no phone call. no meeting. Just bye. My husband told me today that this stupid family salaries their 4 kids in payroll and cuts them a $2k check a month and they don‚Äôt even work in the building or for the company to any capacity. Fuck capitalism, and fuck these greedy assholes who treat us all like god damn trash commodities to serve their own greedy interests. I‚Äôm ready to dismantle this awful system.

May what i will about the dignity of labor, of work‚Äîand

body to resistance of pitching cold in the winter and the torture of summer
heat; it is the training of the eye to scenes of squalid, relieved by a single
redeeming ray of beauty in the house where he has his dwelling place.

Work, under such conditions, is not attractive. The worker enters upon

the struggle early in life, and seldom lays down his burden except at the grave.
See him anywhere, and the battle is raging. He is contending, against formed-

383,Watched ‚ÄúThe Founder‚Äù on Netflix last night and it got me thinking. My thoughts...,"Released in 2016 but somehow I‚Äôd missed it til now. It‚Äôs based on the story of how McDonald‚Äôs became the mega Corp we know today.

Basically, the ‚Äúbackground‚Äù given in the exposition of the movie is that two brothers (Dick and Mac McDonald) opened their first McDonald‚Äôs restaurant in San Bernardino in the 30s (during the Great Depression) after many years of struggling to make a living. By the 50s, they had a booming business model as the first successful ‚Äúfast food‚Äù restaurant that challenged the outdated drive-in model. They worked hard, and their restaurant was a high success that they cared for and loved deeply. They put their hearts and passion into the restaurant, and were very content with their success.

The entire arc of the movie, however, focuses on Ray Kroc, a sleazy business man hell-bent on turning McDonald‚Äôs into a franchise. Through lots of complicated twists and turns, he eventually gets the brothers to agree to a contract to let him expand the restaurant and he starts opening franchises in cities across America. At first he seems to share the love and passion of the brothers, caring as deeply as they do about the restaurants and just wanting to spread the name. But over the course of the film, he becomes blinded by greed, money influence and power. He starts screwing over the brothers and ‚Äúbastardizing‚Äù McDonald‚Äôs standards in order to make more money. He starts recruiting his friends and trying to shimmy his way up the status ladder. His marriage begins falling apart and all he can focus on is how to make more money and gain more influence. At one point in the movie, he says to his wife ‚Äúwow look at how happy this husband-wife couple I recruited to run one of my restaurants is! So great how they work together as a team‚Äù completely oblivious to his wife‚Äôs heart breaking because he can‚Äôt see the irony in his admiration for someone else‚Äôs relationship. Truly, he gets off on watching other happy couple generate more money for him, while brushing his wife and their marriage to the side.

Long story short, he fucks over the brothers, basically forces them out of their position as the true owners of McDonald‚Äôs by creating a new corporation and stealing the McDonald‚Äôs brand name. He forced the brothers the change the name of their restaurant, and then opened his own ‚ÄúMcDonald‚Äôs‚Äù in San Bernardino to compete with the brother‚Äôs original restaurant, and puts them out of business.

Watching it got me thinking about how this corporatized, rat race, dick measuring contest mentally is now at 100000x what it was 70 years ago. The hard of small business owners, like the brothers, is getting stamped out by vicious power-hungry, greedy fucks like ray kroc who exploit the hardest workers who are just following their dreams and trying to do something meaningful with their lives. I‚Äôm just thinking about how WORK itself isn‚Äôt the problem. Long hours and blood sweat and tears isn‚Äôt the problem. The brothers had something that they‚Äôd built with their own hands, and they were very happy to have what they did. The problem is that there are just enough greedy rich bastards like Ray Kroc who all love themselves and their money so much that they‚Äôre willing to crush other people without so much as a moment of hesitation. And all for what? Money? Power? Influence? What‚Äôs the point. Also worth noting that this motherfucker hoard his massive wealth of billions until his sorry ass kicked the bucket. It wasn‚Äôt until after he died that his new wife (for whom he divorced his first wife, after having a long affair) eventually became a philanthropist and donated everything to the Salvation Army and other charities. He was probably a controlling piece of shit and wouldn‚Äôt let her touch his riches til he died.

Anyway Sorry just rambling my thoughts. Def recommend the movie even though it made me angry, it was well paced with very little filler content and the acting was good. The actual events in the movie are mostly fictitious but basically representative of the actual story.

415,Work gives me anxiety. Not working gives me anxiety + existential depression,"I'm 25 and slogged for 6 months at an IB. My boss told me right at the start that even if I went for a movie on the weekends I had to tell him so he could make alternate arrangements in case some urgent work came up.

I toiled like this day in, day out for 6 months before I burnt out, quit, and moved back to my parents'. I thought of taking some time off before taking my next move. Then Covid hit and quarantine has meant I've been stuck at home without being to go out, meet friends, etc.

I got sucked into frivolous social media debates and arguments and triggered my OCD again. I spent the last few months in complete agony with multiple hours in a day spent having imaginary arguments in my head.

A psychiatrist advised me to take meds but have avoided it so far. I felt I needed the distraction of work to get my mind to avoid thinking again, so I have taken up another job recently.

It's been a double whammy. I hated work, but my anxiety issues are so bad that I cannot be left free to think. I'm having to take a job purely to numb my brain ! The one thing I've decided is to not have kids. Don't want to pass on my genes for anxiety to anyone.

 I'm not able to find a purpose in life or connect with society either. Everything seems so polarized and filled with irreconcilable differences between various groups who can barely agree on a shared view of reality. Our innate penchant for tribalism is rearing its ugly head at a time of potential existential threats like climate change. Is there any hope?

427,Gaslighting and mainstream ideology on Reddit and the Internet,"The people on this site often reproduce a lot of toxic ideology and guilt-trip others in order to adapt them into the capitalist system. I've been lurking and subbed to many mental health subs, motivation subs, self-development, etc. and basically all of them work with the status quo as a given. Have autism or ADHD? Well we're not going to talk about how this excludes you from a lot of working environments, you just need to be medicated and function like the rest of us! Don't have any motivation to work? You're depressed and by such obviously wrong. Don't have skills, were raised in a toxic environment? Who cares? 

It's all about this far-fetched individualistic ""willpower"", ""discipline"", ""motivation"" discourse. They gaslight you, saying they want to ""improve"", but in the end you're only improving because you need to ""fit in"", and not because you want to. It would be nonsensical to improve for the sake of it, just like growing for the sake of it is what got us in the climate change mess. In the end all your problems are your responsibility alone and if you are not succeeding it's because of you. I hate it so much. It destroys our self-image. When we fail at commiting to tasks, following a schedule, it all comes biting back at us. With work and capitalism, this is overwhelming, as failing to ""get into a job"" proves fatal or pretty dangerous. Many having to return to the same toxic environments they swore they would never go back to. Others having to reduce their living conditions by a lot. It's ideology at its finest, and we are playing right into our own demise. Once the atomistic idea of the world sticks, you automatically exclude those not deemed ""fit enough"" to wage slave 8 hours or more per day. And this exclusion is total: you are left to live on welfare if you're lucky, or to rot away, or depend on close ones. 

We often hear of the ""success"" stories: YouTube, Reddit, Facebook are filled with them, people who are very skilled at what they do, like their jobs, have their lives ""in order"", earn loads of money, etc. However, these kinds of ""goals"" are unatianable for the majority. Most are destroying their mental health further by trying to meet expectations or just to fit in a broken system, and it pains me a lot, both in my personal life and when I think about others. And I'm sick and tired about it becoming mainstream and shaping up a whole generation to become either mentally distressed empaths, NEETS, hate-infused incels or narcissistic liberals or conservatives who buy into the discourse in its entirety. We've lost so many things. Social media is partly to blame for sure, but in only benefits the system in the end.

441,Studying for what? (Rant),"I'm a second year marketing and animation student in New Zealand, I also clean to make enough money to have a life outside of my studies and to feed myself.
I have all these deadlines for uni during a pandemic and I just can't seem to be able to do any of the work. I'm just thinking, why am I doing this? Why am I trying to condition myself into something that I don't really want.. but I do it because one day I'd like a dog! Sounds absolutely rediculous but the only way I can have a dog in my city is to be a homeowner or move away to a weird town where I probably won't get along with most the people.

I have these cleaning jobs where I go into peoples homes, these people have children and are working really long hours. I make sure to do a really good job for them because I know it's really hard to keep a home nice when you're slaving away. I get lovely texts with feedback and thanks and it just feels right.. but I can't survive off that job! And if I did do it for enough hours to make a living my body would be sore, I wouldn't be able to do such a nice job and I'd probably get stung by huge fees and taxes.

Why is my cleaning job worth so much less than a trained office job? Why is it expected that when I go into the office I'll have to leave my cleaning behind because they'll want 40+ hours out of me? 
I just want to feel like I have more control over my life but in reality I don't. None of us do.. how can we change the damage that has been done to our societies?",False,ivnqao,Chazzadan,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ivnqao/studying_for_what_rant/,0,1

My previous work experience consists of fast food, retail, warehouse, customer service operator, factory worker, waiter, currier, billboard changer (I have no idea what it's english name is), construction worker and a couple similar occasional jobs.
But one thing they shared is the ""if you have time to lean, you have time to clean"" mentality. And the universal rule that if you are found not running from one place to an another and you don't seem struggling, then there is certanly a huge lecture coming....
Now it has been a couple weeks since I have my new job in an office enviroment. And it is... calm... There are busy days. But sometimes 30-40 minutes just pass without having any work to be done. And that time is killing me mentally. (Most likely due to my previous work experience) I get anxious when there is nothing to do. I know it is not going to happen since my current boss is really nice and he knows well that there is no work to be done when this happens, but still I am just anxiously waiting to be shouted at and lectured for being on the clock and not working. It's been like that for weeks with no change. And I know it is bullshit, but I still get a little anxiety attack every time.

I would give up video games because I would have the energy and time to actually go do stuff in the world and spend time with people. I would give up MtG because buying packs and the gambling-like thrill of maybe getting a really good card is something that I can look forward to to get through work, and I could always just find a different game to play with friends. I would give up food in general and survive off of flavorless paste if it meant I didn‚Äôt have to go to work anymore. I only eat so much junk because it is another quick and easy hit of dopamine.

When they told me I wouldn't be receiving health insurance benefits I was under the assumption that it would be a grace period of 90 days or whatever. I found out recently that the position just isn't ""eligible for benefits"" and I really just have no idea why.

I work in a school as an autism support aide. I, arguably, spend more direct time with the students than the teacher does, I work the same hours as everyone else in the school does.. yet I don't get benefits. Apparently, none of the people in my position receive benefits and I'm even contributing 14 cents off of every paycheck to participate in the union. 

If I didn't have prescriptions and health problems, I wouldn't mind this as much.. but I take Lexapro for anxiety, Estrogen and Progesterone (long story - I don't produce enough hormones naturally, stopped menstruating in my teens) and have a disability (spinal stenosis - as a result I have hyporeflexia and numbness in my arms)

Right now, I do have some coverage through Gateway Health.. but of course, it isn't the best and I just don't know how to even go about contacting my doctors to see if my insurance will cover the costs of these prescriptions.. it's so much work. 

I'm beginning to wonder if taking this job was a good thing. It's better than not having a job at all, I guess.. but I don't understand why I wouldn't be receiving benefits.

496,My coworker and I are about to get fired because of one missing pill.,"I work as a med aide at an assisted living facility. It's been especially understaffed lately and a few days ago, while being rushed for time, I unintentionally dropped a bottle of suboxone. The pills spilled everywhere. I frantically picked them all up, or so I thought. I even counted them twice and came out to the correct number, but apparently I still miscounted by one. By the time the next med aide arrived, I still hadn't realized this, and so I told her she didn't need to count this med as I had just done it. She took my word for it and that was that.

The following morning, I woke up to missed calls from my manager and that coworker, telling me that one pill is missing out of the bottle. And since that coworker ""counted out"" with me, they put her at fault. I even explained to them everything that had happened, that I dropped the bottle of pills and miscounted without realizing, and then told her to not count out. But now we are both ""under investigation"" and can't return to work until further notice. 

We're supposed to get paid today, and it usually hits my bank account at midnight but its now 3:30am and still nothing. I mean i'm sure they'll pay me, it would be illegal to withhold it, right? I'm probably just paranoid. I don't even care at this point if they decide to fire me or not, but my coworker's health insurance is tied to her job and she really needs that right now. She's genuinely a wonderful person who's been a med aide for 10 years and has never made a med error. All it took was a careless med aide to fuck that all up. She doesn't blame me at all, and has been incredibly sweet, but I still feel terrible. 

We're working under two new nurses that have just started this month. They both have ""never dealt with anything like this before"" so they don't know what to do. Last year, I made my first and only other med error and my manager then was completely forgiving. Another med aide made three significant med errors in one week, and another lost a full card of oxycodone, and they're both still working here. These things happen. I just can't believe the two of us are now likely going to get fired over one pill.

499,The Four Burners Theory showed me the myth behind achieving Work-life balance," We‚Äôre often working extremely hard and trying to find balance across the various realms of our lives. I‚Äôm guilty of this too. This was when I came across The Four Burners Theory which essentially breaks your life into 4 quadrants:

1. Family
2. Friends
3. Health 
4. Work

The principle behind this theory is that in order to be truly successful in any of these areas, the intensity of one of these burners needs to be turned down. This sounds like a crappy deal, but the truth is that life is full of tradeoffs and embracing that is the first step to thriving.

There are seasons where some of these burners will thrive more than other and I, personally, choose to make temporary compromises in order to truly give myself to truly succeed at one thing. There are a few ways that I‚Äôve learnt to make the best of finding harmony between my work and the rest of my life including embracing limitations and incorporating seasonality. 

This has always been a really interesting concept to me and I dive deep into it here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khaWb5XqZNM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khaWb5XqZNM) .

In January found my dream job. Small, local company only a 10 minute walk from my home where I could sit all day and had a boss who genuinely liked and cared for me. For a little extra information I am an autistic and narcoleptic 20 year old with only a GED, i am transgender, english is not my first language and i have very limited mobility due to an inflammatory disease... i try very hard to not let my life center around any of these but these things make it hard for me to find work at all , especially work that pays well. But, regardless of all that. Once COVID hit the usa I was shit out of luck, and the company I was working for went out of business.

While I was on unemployment for some time I am no longer receiving benefits. I can't file for unemployment, because due to a lot of abuse growing up I have little to no medical records and I can't afford to get a diagnosis for any of my mental or physical illnesses. Even if I could I have heard terrible stories from people with my same inflammatory condition (it is a semi-unknown disease) about the hoops they had to jump through &amp; lawyer fees only to be denied disability anyways... And honestly, after 6 months of little to no income, I am really really terrified for the future. I tried crowd funding for help with medical and food bills, but seeing as I don't use a lot of social media that didn't help and only caused a lot of people to harass me online (why i don't use social apps anyways) 

Does anyone have any advice on how to get an income that I can survive on at least? I have applied for maany remote-work jobs only for them to say I can't qualify due to poor internet where I live. I can't turn to sex work because of the nature of my disease, and I cant create art to save my life... is necking myself the only option here?

Quarantine gave me alone time to sit and think about what really matters in life. Three weeks ago I read the ‚Äú4-Hour Work Week‚Äù which motivated me to start thinking about making the jump. 

Then last week the company I work for decided to not only make all employees pay back the 80 hours they had originally allowed us to take off for COVID but also took away my two week vacation at the end of the year and reduced it to only Christmas Eve, Christmas and NYE

I look forward to those two weeks every year. It has allowed me to spend New Years in a different country for 5 consecutive years and now it‚Äôs been taken from me and I am around 40 hours negative on vacation time.

I can't quit.  I didn't finish college.  I work in manufacturing and this is the ONLY manufacturing company that pays a living wage in the area.  You're lucky to make 15/16 an hour at every other company at top step.  I've been here 7 fucking years so I'm making $25 an hour.  

I can't take a pay cut.  I'm not going to lie, I grew up middle class, and I like being middle class.  I have a small little house I don't want to give up.  It's my sanctuary in my little time off.  I love it.  



That doesn't mean I don't want to change the system.  I want more protection for workers.  I want them to be treated like people with actual lives.  

I want more paid sick time, I want more paid vacation, I want laws that stop corporations from forcing you to work six days a week, I want laws that stop employers from being able to fire you for bullshit reasons.  

Why is that considered so ""radical"" and ""anti-capitalist"" in the US? 
Plenty of other countries around the world manage that and more while still being ""capitalist.""

534,This is all so wrong...,"It's all fucking wrong. 8 hours a day, locked  inside a cubicle, isolated from your family and friends, without the right to do anything you enjoy, only working to survive and not starve to death, plus commuting, and then you have a few hours left but it's night and you're too tired to do anything other than sit down and watch TV, and you also have to eat and do hygiene stuff as well, and your friends are too busy working and taking care of their kids to hang out with you, so you end up alone in your dark living room watching TV or using social media. Only a week or two vacation when it's summer. And if you work in retail,  or for some big corporations, you get minimum wage. 

And if you're one of the very unlucky ones, congrats. You are now working in a sweatshop 10 - 12 hours a day, with bad conditions, from age 8, without workers rights, personal freedom, breaks, or even being allowed to go to the bathroom. You get paid not even minimum wage at this point, you get like what, 50 cents a month? You waste your life and slave your days away just so that you can keep breathing, you spend all these years and years every day, doing the same thing locked inside a building, away from all those people and things you love, not allowed to leave, or else you starve to death, and you literally have to pay with not only your money but also your time go breath. You have to pay to survive. And I say survive, because surviving and living are two different things.

There are fucking 7yearolds working in mines in India, 13 hours a day, and the best worst case scenario for them is that they will get some terrible chronic condition that will follow them for the rest of their miserable, lifeless life and kill them at age 40, or even younger, and the worst scenario I can think of is them dying inside the mines of asphyxia or getting lost in them and no one ever finding them. They waste their childhoods, the most holy thing they will ever have, and work away their youthful, innocent, worry-less years, only to make a bunch of fucktards richer, a bunch of fucktards that pretend to care about the world and do charity but in reality they are the ones who cause so many problems in the first place, these children walk around in broken, ripped apart slippers that no longer fit them and their feet hurt and then these fucktards live in lavish mansions with pools, private yatches, 10 bedrooms, and a bunch of other things that they don't need.

There are 7yearolds being kidnapped and forced to work in chocolate plantations, yet those 7yearolds will never taste chocolate themselves. These 7yearolds will never have a childhood. These 7yearolds will never know what it feels to get dirty in the mud with your friends after a good rain and looking at the rainbow fascinated together and calling all your siblings and your parents to see if as well. They know what it feels like to be dirty from the labor, dirty from the unbathedness, but they don't know what it feels like to play in the sand right next to the beach with your cousins while doing cartwheels and playing tag. They will never know what waking up late in a sunny Saturday morning and going straight to the streets to meet your friends and ride your bicycles, run, and play together till the sun goes down feels like. They will never know what your parents buying you a new doll for Christmas or your birthday feels like, their parents can barely afford existing and raising them. They probably have barely played, barely chased each other, barely run, barely had fun, barely stared at  rainbows fascinated in their small, short existences. They will never know any of that.

They ask me why I am antiwork, well, this is why. I want a world where you don't have to pay to exist, neither with your time nor with your money. This system is broken, broken to the core, and cancer like that is normalized and romanticized by westerners who haven't even lived a day like that. ""OMG!11!! Shout-out to the parents who work like that so that their kids can live!11!!!"". Or ""Uplifting news! 80 year old woman finds job at a warehouse!"" 

No, you middle class ignorant piece of shit, this is nothing romantic. This is nothing uplifting. This is not something to celebrate, this is not something to shed tears of joy looking at. We should shed tears of terror. This shit is terrifying, it's terrible, and if says a lot of things about our world.

I know many other people have worse jobs but even the slightest things can affect you a lot when your mind's not working properly. A simple message or email from the boss or a client can make me feel terribly anxious. I was just thinking earlier today, living in constant panic is no way to live. 


 So what are my options...

- My dream job when I was younger was to work as a filmmaker but with my anxiety and depression that seems almost impossible.

- I could continue working at my current job without any joy, but what's the point? 

- Most people tell me to look for another job. But the job hunting process makes me so anxious it almost makes me cry. Also, I'm too depressed to add skills and degrees to my CV right now. 

- I'm not even sure if my current job is the problem. Working at any sort of place with depression and anxiety seems terrible.  Society values you according to the job you have, so I'm supposed to keep working. It's so deeply ingrained in our system that even I think I'd be worthless without a job. 

I'm extremely nervous about my future. I don't know what's a good option that I have.

How can we start a movement to make change? I made a post about the SEEDS movement, but that didn't go over so well. Does anyone have any ideas?

The only thing I can think of is...

* Teaching people to become more self sufficient growing food and building houses.
* Funding a company that is dedicated to growing free food and building free housing.
* All the workers begin waves of mass suicide in protest until the capitalists are forced to change or lose the only thing that makes them rich.

I'm really hoping it doesn't resort to the latter, but I see enough posts about this type of thing in this sub that I'm thinking this happens pretty often.

I understand that people don't have the time and energy to come up with ways to change the world. I do. I believe I was put into this world to abolish the monetary system. I have hated money since I was a child.

We are humans! We have strength in numbers! Let's come together and start a serious movement that forces rich fuckers to have to pay more for less work or else they have nothing!

I was able to live this exact lifestyle for about 5 months because of the coronavirus. I recently had to return back to school.

Those 5 months or so have been the best time of my life. I haven't enjoyed myself this much before. I was in complete control. I decided what to do. I decided when to get up. I decided when to go to bed. I was able to do what I want.

I enjoy being allowed to sit at home all day. It's beautiful.

But hey. Here we are. We're back to the old cycle. Now I gotta get up in the morning to go to school. Now I'm forced to sit in school for atleast 6 hours a day, being forced to listen to bullshit that I don't care about. Now I have to worry about my future again.

I'm miserable as soon as I'm forced to go outside of my house.

575,Just another rant about sacrificing your employees for your managerial mistakes / greed,"Quite a long rant, TL;DR at the end.

I work an office job for a big company. It's not atrocious but I clearly see a decline in the quality of the subjects I work on since last year.

I got upset today when my ""supervisor"" (he is not hierarchically above me but he basically controls the subjects I work on) told me that I would probably need to go alone on a business trip for 2 or 3 days next week in order to do something that's normally not my job.

I already went to this location a few weeks ago because I was one of the most relevant people to handle the work there was to do, so even though I don't like business trips (because I'm not more compensated despite having to dedicate my personal time to the company for a few consecutive days) I was not fundamentally against it. But this time, it's to do something that I'm not supposed to do, and that I barely know how to do. The reason I should go , I was told, is because ""we're short on resources"" (people). So, already knowing the answer, I naively asked ""But why don't we tell the management that we need more people ?"". The answer was ""We constantly told them for the past 3 years"". And obviously nothing changed for the past 3 years. So during all this time, the team had to do (and still has) with what they had in order to make the project succeed (or at least survive, I should say).

And that's exactly what the problem is: people in this team counterbalance the lack of resources by working late, doing more work than they should, and doing work they're not supposed / qualified to do. Not to mention the important amount of stress that they have to endure.

So of course the management does nothing to help: even though we tell them that there is a ""lack of resources"", the work is done, and that's all that matters to them. I think that the only way we could actually get more resources is by endangering the project itself, simply by doing our work as we are supposed to do instead of overworking. But that's not the team's mentality apparently. My teammates want to do more even though it might burn them out.

I always thought that this mentally was fucked up, so out of principle I try my best to never work too late or for too long. But this time, I feel like they might force me to do like them, even though I strongly informed my supervisor that I don't want to go and that I don't agree with the management policy. He didn't insist too much, but since the other people he asked refused to go too, I'm afraid he will come back to me and pressure me. 

I must confess that I am more and more fed up with this job that makes less sense to me every day, and I event recently considered to resign. I'm not quite sure yet if that would be such a good idea. But if my supervisor insists too much, I'll inform him that I'm considering quitting this job. If he forces me, I'll quit.

I'm not against discovering new things, new places, or learning things that I don't know yet. But I don't want to be forced to do things I never asked and that I am not supposed to do, and sacrificing myself and my family for the sole reason that the company's management is utter bullshit.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My supervisor wants me to go on a business trip for a few days in order to do something that I am not supposed to do, that I don't want to do, and that I barely know how to do, because our management doesn't want to give us more resources and it's a habit of this team to overwork themselves.",False,iu3prq,TechnicalFrustration,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/iu3prq/just_another_rant_about_sacrificing_your/,0,1

The reality is that the privilege of complaining about work and wanting to stay home and smoke/sleep/game all day, while at the same time not worrying about  dying, is brought to you on the backs of people who do work.

If you don't want to work then you can't take advantage of anyone else's work. Your Xbox, house, food delivery, cell phone, even this website are all the products of people's minds, motivation, and a hell of a lot of work.

So take all that and throw it away when you finally decide to stop working, because the only reason people wageslave is because their business has customers, don't be a customer and force someone else to wageslave if you can't handle it yourself.",False,irxaib,T3ddyBeast,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/irxaib/if_society_didnt_exist_you_would_still_have_to/,27,0

Quite the contrary, actually.

Capitalism THRIVES on uneducated people. Education, and thus giving people the tools to be able to think critically, is the only hope we have. The studying done at home wouldn't be necessary if the kids stayed until the evening in school because they'd finish their studying there instead of taking it home, but I don't think that's the solution everyone is thinking here about when they shit on homeworks and assume it molds us into slaves for capitalists.

606,COVID outbreak at my former workplace one week after my last day. They weren't allowing WFH.,"Context: I live outside of the US so bear that in mind as you're reading. 

I'm an attorney so even before COVID, working from home would have been something I could do most days. Unless I'm going to court or a meeting, I'm mostly sitting at a desk all day, so I never saw a need to be in office everyday from the jump. Then the court started having Zoom hearings and meetings, so there was even less of a reason to leave home. But I worked in a law firm with a bunch of old people who need to physically SEE you slaving away in order to feel like they're getting their money's worth out of you. 

Even when our Prime Minister put out a LAW saying that anyone who can carry out their job function from home SHOULD work from home, they were still trying to force us to come in. I got in at 10:00 one morning and my supervisor (who had been working from home for months at that point and who was hardly ever in office even before COVID) reprimanded me for being ""late"" and then made me do a bunch of things outside of my job function including delivering documents to court and to other attorneys' offices even though I asked if the documents could be sent electronically. No, she specifically wanted me to be going out and about during a pandemic while she was safely in her home. She said I hadn't ""paid enough dues"" in my career to be able to come in at 10:00 (during a pandemic when the government says I don't even have to be here, period.)

That was the last straw for me and the next day I sent an email saying that I will be working from home until the government mandates otherwise. She was annoyed, but there wasn't much she could do. I returned to office when the government ended mandatory WFH and then quit (my notice period is 3 months so I was there until the end of August). Cases had been steadily rising and they were still forcing staff to come in. 

One week after I left, I'm hearing that there are two confirmed cases and possibly more. The firm is trying to keep it quiet and they're STILL having people come in office lol. They're also being picky about whose COVID test they're willing to pay for. I think I should be fine since I had stopped interacting with coworkers due to low morale and just not giving a fuck anymore. I kept my office door closed most days and always wore my mask if I was leaving the confines of my office space to interact with a coworker.

My new job allows me to WFH, pays more and the work is more fulfilling (I transitioned from civil litigation to human rights. Civil litigation literally brought me to the brink of my sanity).

so imagine my shock and dismay, when i heard about this in an email that went out this morning to the WHOLE company, thanking EVERYONE for the hard work on this account. There are four people who work directly with the account, but I put in 90% of the work, overall, and I am lead on the account.

634,Freelancing is Fucking Humiliating,"This is a rant.

So I created an UpWork account yesterday and it has been approved earlier today. Since the only thing I've ever been good at were languages and literature, (I'm pursuing a fucking PhD in that area, can't say I enjoy it but I do live off the research fundings), so I posted that I'm there as a writer. Apart from my native language I speak English and Spanish - but because of my educational background and because of me being in academia for so long, I'm able to write good if not excellent reviews, essays, articles (can't say I'd dare to write fiction in a foreign language, that would be... a failure). However, it's not my language knowledge but rather my knowledge of literary theory, literary history, philosophy, my thought process, analytical skills and ideas that I find crucial. I even struggle with my style when writing in my native language and always get asked to improve it for it to get published.

Anyway, as I was going through my UpWork feed I could see all the job offers. I was stunned to see:

1. Humiliantingly low budgets (they pay 1 fucking dollar per 100 words).

2. Employers asking for a fucking native English speaker located either in the US or Canada (sometimes they add other English speaking countries such as: UK, Australia etc). For writing jobs in Spanish, they want a native Spanish speaker located in a specific Spanish speaking country as well.

3. Them asking for an application letter. What the fuck?! Can't you see my profile already?! I'm not going to write a bullshit cover letter.

So my thoughts naturally were: 

Nobody, nobody is going to write 100 words for 1 dollar. I wouldn't do it if I was starving.

But what bothered me the most was the discrimination based on person's origin and location: you can't feel good about yourself when you spend years learning languages and realize that it doesn't matter that you're probably more qualified than the native applicants, you can just go and fuck yourself.

Cause being a highly educated person, with a diploma from a prestigious University that ranks higher than the universities from most ""English and Spanish"" speaking countries, disqualifies you on this bullshit website. And basically, on any other website (I have applied for a remote ""Wikipedia strategist"" position (doing research, writing wikipedia articles etc.) two weeks ago and have never been contacted).

Read about this motherfucker Preston assuming professionals from non-English speaking countries are cheap and affordable, whilst those from English speaking countries are referred as expensive: although, the amount of money that is offered to native speakers is as well insultingly low. (I wouldn't even work for the money that is offered to native speakers, honestly). That's not all: this jerk insinuates that being an inexpensive writer puts a person into the next category of people - alcoholics, criminals, people who don't share your religious beliefs and are from...

It was hell, I was cut off from all my friends and family, never saw anybody but my co-workers and a bunch of fishermen who hated me for being a narc. After about a year my mom died of cancer and I got super depressed, I couldn't face leaving for another contract so I started doing Uber Eats full time and barely scraping by.

674,"CEOs want control, not productivity","It just occurred to me thait was odd how most statistics cite higher productivity in work from home, yet many CEOs are so eager to return to the office.

I though about what it could be; maybe the fact that they paid for office space.

But then it clicked, after seeing so many posts on on life advice, simple living, and many other subs. Many subs now basically look like anti work. 

Why?

Because work from home has given people free time to think about their lives. To think about the shortness of them, family, and leisure. 

CEOs probably noticed this and are scared. We are not willing to slave for them anymore. So what do they do? They do interviews where they call into question the productivity of work from home despite the facts. Based on nothing at all they say things like ""these stats could be skewed by the top productive workers"". 

They say Millennials are slacking outside the office and want them to ""learn"" in the office.They also cite mental health and say people are depressed working from home and miss the banter of the office.

We know this is a sham. We know these jobs are bullshit and there is nothing to ""learn"" other than indentured servitude and slavery. 

We don't miss being humiliated in the office and having our livelihoods dangled over our heads like carrots if we ever step out of line. We are not like the CEOs who constantly get false praise for people who just want to survive. Although working twice as hard, we always get attacked with what we lack.

I believe that there will never be a right form of culture or social construct, because my experiences and studies show me once again that humans aren't meant to live in large social groups.




All the stuff we're experiencing in the world is just basic and mostly primitive human behavior and most people don't even notice that what they are doing just leads to even more issues.





I feel like every concept we strive for nowadays, equality, freedom, democracy - they are all just human concepts and none of them works in the way we pursue it.




We as human beings forced our own perverted way of life and meaning into this world and feel like we have the God-given right to act like the pinnacle of evolution.



We act like we are on our way to perfection, what we don't understand is that everything that doesn't fall under that perception of an ultimate goal becomes ugly and unwanted to us.




We don't live in times of accepting, we live in times of seeking false meaning in mundane and distracting concepts of what we believe should be true. (and we just believe, we don't know)




We change things until they fit our own expectations, but don't realize that we have so different approaches to things that there will always be someone unhappy.





The best we can do in my opinion is to stop organizing and gathering humans in large social constructs that will only lead to jealousy, anger and injustice.

696,What am I suppose to do?,"I‚Äôve been working since I was 15. I am 21 years old now except for the past year and a half I haven‚Äôt been able to hold a job down. I have started and quit about 5 jobs. I quit my last job before the pandemic so no unemployment money for me but thankfully I have my fiance who is amazing and supports me financially and allows me to go to college rather than work. I am like this because when I was 19/20ish I experienced some extremely bad trauma and am now struggling with PTSD, extreme anxiety and depression. 

But lately, I‚Äôve been thinking where do I go from here? The thought of applying for and getting another job fills me with such anxiety that I completely shut down. Am I suppose to go on anxiety meds that make me gain weight and cause my ED to come back? What do I do? I really don‚Äôt have an answer and I‚Äôm just many of you don‚Äôt have either. 

At this point, I know my behavior of not being to hold a job down will not last long. We are about to enter a recession and the thought of suicide seems better than having to work. Even in the long run, suicide seems to be the only option out. I don‚Äôt want to work the rest of my life and no one, not even my fiance, can solve that issue.

Understandably, my company is tracking the COVID numbers and counting down the days until we go back to real full time, completely in office work.

705,"Why can‚Äôt the government make working optional, pay for the necessities (food + water) and we work for everything else?","Sorry if what I‚Äôm about to say is extremely ignorant. Honestly don‚Äôt know the economic reasons but surely there is a way they can do this? especially considering they fund other stuff unnecessary to basic survival

By necessities I mean at least food and water. *Maybe* also (very) basic shelter and basic health care.


They could regulate the food and water intakes so that each individual/family is given a certain amount of money that only covers basic food (each person is able to get all nutrients required) needed for each person (so like a family of 2 adults and 2 kids would get a slightly different amount than 2 adults, 1 kid and 1 baby). 


I think the only reason we have to pay for things in the first place (except for people just wanting to get rich and have more than others, and have power/control... which isn‚Äôt a valid reason anyway), is so that there isn‚Äôt a shortage of materials. Well, plus the fact that people believe that if you do more work, you deserve to get more in return, which I will talk on that later. BUT (basic) FOOD and water should be for everyone regardless of anything.


But back to the first point... there shouldn‚Äôt be a shortage of materials because many people are eating way too much than they need. So that should even it out a little of the overeaters get less and the undereaters get more. And if there did happen to be a shortage of food on the horizon (they would be stupid not to stop it before it happened, because they would be able to tell how much they are capable of producing vs demand) they can instead regulate the amount of children we are allowed to have.

Which I know doesn‚Äôt sound nice, but it is important to take care of the people already on the earth first. If we can‚Äôt take care of everyone here (in the sense that, there isn‚Äôt enough resources), then producing more people is only going to worsen that! Plus we all know that overpopulation is a big issue for many reasons. Any for those that do really want children and this were to happen, there are lots of kids that need to be adopted. 

I know it might not be that simple, but neither is what is happening now! It‚Äôs anything but. But surely this is a better way?


So why can‚Äôt the government pay for our food, and we pay for everything else? and make working optional. 


For those of us who want to live extremely simple work free lives, well away from capitalism, then we would be free and happy to do so. 


For those of us who want to work and buy tons of materialistic things, then we would be free and happy to do so. 


For those of us who want something in between, or only part time work, then we would be free and happy to do so. 


So why can‚Äôt they make it happen? 


Or rather, is it that they can? But they just won‚Äôt, because it benefits ‚Äòthem‚Äô personally, as the money is in their pockets? But surely, if we all stood for this idea, then the power of the people would overturn the power of those few?",False,iukrwz,aussiebeauty01,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/iukrwz/why_cant_the_government_make_working_optional_pay/,5,1

Dane here currently in his 40s, apologies for my bad English. I work for an engineering firm in Copenhagen. Denmark is known for having good workers rights, but it doesn‚Äôt always feel like it.

I used to work a typical 9 ‚Äì 5, 8 hours a day. However since January, I‚Äôve changed my working hours to 6am ‚Äì 2pm (30 min lunch included) because of a change in needs of our biggest client. Same amount of hours, right? I enjoy getting up earlier and finishing earlier. I am only contracted for those hours, not paid any more.

Well every day I constantly get harrassed about the hours I work. People joke, gossip amongst themselves and make passive agressive remarks about my work and how I always ‚Äúleave early‚Äù and am only a ‚Äúpart timer‚Äù. I am a laughing stock to the company, who knows what kind of nonsense they spread about me.

The problem is, the guys I work with do a crazy amount of hours unlike me. That said, they are getting paid a huge amount more than I am, so their salary justifies it unlike me. Or, they are getting paid hourly so suck up as many hours as they can for more money.

I always start and finish exactly on time. Someone came up to me in the kitchen when I was leaving to tell me not to ‚Äúwear myself out with all the hours I worked‚Äù (in Danish lol), then bragged about how he done over 100 hours the previous week (unpaid of course). He looked ill as fuck, black eyes, weak voice, I saw him as pathetic. It‚Äôs not an achivement, I don‚Äôt want to be like you?! He spends most of his day on his phone anyway and pretending to look busy in front of the management, his job I could do in 30 minutes (not exagerrating when I say this).

How do I deal with this, changing jobs isn‚Äôt an option. I think I‚Äôll try and work remotely instead. What about in the meantime?

749,Please take care of yourself! You deserve to be happy!,"To put things into perspective, I work as a lead software developer at a very small early startup and I've been working like a dog these past few months while the world was burning down due to COVID-19. I've put in more than the required 8hrs every day. Never skipped a day of work or called in sick.

A few days earlier, I wasn't feeling well. I was kind of depressed and tired of coding tbh. I called my employer to let him know that I will be off for a few days since I wasn't able to focus on my work and was in need of a breather. I was expecting to get a few days off without any hassle. But guess what was his response... He said: ""I would love to give you a few days off buddy, but I just set up an appointment with a potential client and we need to finish the following features as soon as possible "".  

I was like why did you set up an appointment with a potential customer without even letting me know? And he then proceeds to tell me that he mentioned it the day before, which I'm pretty sure he didn't, and that we need to start making money as soon as possible.

Making money? Is that all he cares about? What about all that work that I've just put in? Can't the client wait a few more days? 

Those are all the questions I've asked myself after my call with him and I came to the conclusion that no employer cares.  I've been working all these kinds of odd jobs, cashier, barista, cook, and every single one of my employers had an excuse as to why I can't take the day off to myself. 

I became aware that I am just a resource. A resource to be used to generate cashflow. A resource to be squeezed until the last drop. A resource to be thrown away when it's no longer productive. I am not a human but just a resource.

As a young child, I was always scared to voice my opinions. I grew up like most other kids and have been told to go to college, get good grades so you can find a good job.  So I followed that path. Went to college. Worked all sort of jobs to pay my bills. I worked during the day and improved my coding skills during the night. I was always exhausted and thought to myself that once I get into software development everything will be better. I just followed my parent's advice...

Now, I find myself spending my Monday to Friday in front of a computer close to 12hrs a day. I am gaining weight and becoming unhealthy &amp; depressed. Is this what I was meant to do with my life? Am I gonna spend 50 years in this stupid job writing and debugging code all day? Is this what adult life feels like?

This is what I've found myself listening to while working: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QI68giYtnXs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QI68giYtnXs)

Pretty sad, isn't it? I broke down and went for a walk outside while holding my tears. I was bent &amp; broken. I've decided that even though my boss didn't want to give me a couple of days off. I was gonna take them anyways. He can go to hell for all I care. I turned my phone to airplane mode. Turned off Slack. Logged out of my work email. And most importantly, I allowed myself to breathe.

I've never felt better in my life. That breathing room allowed me to start exercising &amp; eat healthier. I've started smiling more and I became more enjoyable to be around.

I think that as humans we are not meant for this kind of life. We are meant to help each other in times of need and we feel fulfilled when we make each other happy. I just helped my neighbor haul some stuff home and it gave me more fulfillment than my bullshit job ever did.

I think we need to value happiness more that we value money. We need to stop pushing people into jobs that kill their souls for the sake of money.

Remember that it doesn't matter if you are a blue-collar worker or a white-collar worker... You are still on leash.

To sum this up, I just want to remind you to please take care of yourself &amp; always put yourself first no matter the situation. You are a valuable member of our society and deserve all the best.

I was hired for a analyst role  which I later come to know has nothing related to what it was supposed to be. Now before even I joined these people having no regards keep calling me many weeks prior asking me to start to gain knowledge about the technology stack they work in, like come on shit turds. Like they call me at fucking  night for long calls about how I should start looking into stuff and later I came to know yada this job requires to work in shifts. Now fast-forward I joined the company and ny belief that I wanna leave this job asap was confirmed. 
Some fuckery listed in points if u wanna laugh and cringe at their degeneracy :
* Once I reported sick at the exact starr of my shift and the manager says you couod have planned it better üò±. No regard for privacy too. 
* Inspite of being a fresh graduate the manager keeps talking shit about how I need to catch up and comparing with others. 
*The constant micromanagement and short deadlines such that I cannot even do lunch and had to work 5h overtime manytimes. 
* Now once a colleague fell ill and damn they fucking talked like  they could report it. Also calling the sick person again n again and asking them to come as a person from headquarters had comeü§Æ.This continued till the said person came back. 
*Now the director is one shit who consider themselves some wonder person or what, like they made fun of other person's choice to leave the company to move out of the country and saying that they are doing a suicide by doing this.
*The colleagues are I don't know what species of sheep they slog throughout and act elated on their work which is nothing but slavery to their foreign masters to increase the company's revenue. Everytime they chuckle on video meetings I get disgusted by them.
*Also you know the ""team"" is supposed to ask doubts compulsorily in meetings like rofl. The manager kept sending messages to ask but you know fuck them, never did.

How is that a valid reason to be put on a pip? It‚Äôs not my fault that this old ass computer won‚Äôt let me be on camera.

i got a sub certificate to teach in public schools but my androgynous appearance i think is making it harder to find work. i'm amab and i'm either nonbinary femme or a trans woman. point being that to feel like my ideal self, until i get surgery or get or hormones or something, i'm going to have an andrygnous appearance. i don't really want to do all that right now because i want to move out of my parents' house because they didn't support the decision in the past and don't believe them when they say they want to help me with it.

i remember i had a conversation with an uber driver back at school talking about how an exchange student at my college was making so much money like 5k a month stripping. and i was thinking about with the gig economy job i do that's what i make in a year. 

i remember then joking with my dad and discussing all this and he's like ""well you don't wanna sell your body idk if i want you to do that""...but then i'm being pressured to find work. and those student loans have gotta get paid off

784,"So I've been slowly doing a shittier job at work, on purpose, to see how long it takes to get fired.","I work in a delivery place where we deliver shitty  made in china products to customers.  Furniture, appliances, just absolute fucking junk.  I hate the job but I have money in the bank so I don't give a fuck.  I'm the best guy on the crew by far and this company needs me a hell of a lot more than I need them.

So I had an idea two weeks ago to slowly but surely just start not giving a flying fuck and see how far I can go before I get fired:

 - I've started coming in late by one minute.  Every single day I punch in one minute later than the day before.  I want to see how bad it gets before they notice.

 - I've completely stopped taking shit from customers.  Where we live there is a shit ton of old, entitled white people and I've just started backtalking them. I really don't give a fuck if you've spent $48,000 in our store, fuck you.  I'm not taking my shoes off in your piece of shit house that you paid a million for.    I want to see how far it goes before I get written up.

 - I've started giving the finger to people in traffic that piss me off.  You cut me off?  I'm gonna lay on the horn and give you the finger.  You tailgate me?  I'm gonna slooooow right down and piss you off even more.  

 - I've started being rude to sales staff.  Our work has the DUMBEST MOTHERFUCKERS I've ever met on planet Earth.  They fuck up invoices all the time, sending us to wrong houses etc.  So I've started being a little ruder to them and calling them out on their mistakes and bullshit.

So far it's been freeing. I actually enjoy work now because I clearly don't give a FUCK anymore.  I'm betting on being fired within two weeks but we'll see what happens. This town has lots of shit jobs and I just wanna go back to a restaurant anyway for the free food and cash tips.  Yeah I make more delivering shit but fuck this place.

799,Corporate scum (rant),"I'm a full time salary employee of a major liquor retailer in Australia. 

Around 12 months ago the corporate giant that owns my company got caught in a massive employee underpayment scandal. To the tune of $500 million and counting. Turned out they weren't paying government mandated allowances and penalties. 

As a result they tucked their tails and said 'we'll pay it all back plus interest, but give us time to investigate' 

So then corona hit and we were all scrambling. As I'm sure a lot of you were...whats the story? Do I come in on Monday? The premier just said there's a fucking a curfew?.. So liquor is an essential service now? OK fuck you I guess I'm coming in. 

As a thank you for working during a pandemic they gave non-salary staff stock options and a $250 gift card. Salary staff at a sister company owned by the same corporation got a $1000 bonus in march or April. 

We got nothing.  

It's been as busy as Christmas since march. What can people do in a lockdown but drink and beat their wives? Sales are higher than ever but roster budget continues to get slashed. 

If a shop pays penalty rates due to OT they get a please explain from upstairs. 

And still no word on our back pay and not so much as a thank you for working during a pandemic... Just a bunch of empty platitudes about family and teamwork and keep up the good work. Great numbers today, atta boy!! 

Seriously since march, humans have become fucked. So entitled, so abusive to those that have to serve them. Working retail the last six months has honestly  been horrific. I'm forced to get into altercations on a nearly daily basis. I cringe when I get called to the front becuase it's just as likely something basic or me having to get into another fight with some fucking cunt. 

It's really demoralising having to put yourself through that AND know the company is underpaying you. 

No word on the underpayment investigation...Until about 6 weeks ago. 

We just finished working out the back pay situation and based on our calculations we owe you nothing.

But wait. 

They are going to 'lock in' our performance bonus to 80% as a thank you for working in a pandemic.... Not even the whole fucking thing. When I know for a fact this was the most profitable 6 months in the companies history. What a slap in a face. 

But wait. 

We now want our salaried staff to cover Saturdays and Sundays so we can save about $200 on Sunday pay per store. End result you are working a 4 week roster that results in you working 15 out of 17 days before a propper break... You don't need to spend time with your friends and family. We need you here on Sunday! 

And... 

Let's agree you don't necessarily need compensation for things like public holidays and overtime and meal allowances so we don't run into that pesky underpayment situation again. 

Also. 

Let's get all that on paper and bully you to sign it while unemployment is at an all time high so you have no where to go.

Yep they forced a contact change during a fucking pandemic. 

It was made clear to me that if I refused to sign HR would be involved right away and it would not be comfortable. 

What makes me most mad though is the conference calls, where these compassionless arseholes are broadcasting from their couch or kitchen or in the backyard having a beer and a BBQ giving me all the 'we're all in this together' bullshit. 

We ain't in shit until you're here on a Sunday handling some old cunts slobber covered cash motherfucker... Seriously I've seen boomers take their mask off to lick their finger to pull the cash out to hand over. Un fucking believable.

811,Is there an escape? (venting/seeking advice),"This post might end up incoherent, but this is something that I've been thinking about a lot lately. I apologize in advance that I don't really know how to articulate this. I don't even know if this is the right subreddit for this; I just need a place to vent and maybe feel like I'm not insane.

&amp;#x200B;

I (24F) currently work in a very emotionally and mentally demanding live-in direct care job in the social services field (in the United States). I've worked there for nearly two years now. What I am is essentially a single houseparent in a group home for teenagers that have been removed from the home. 

&amp;#x200B;

Nearly every day recently I find myself mentally distraught thinking about my job and about work in general. I think about how I'm severely underpaid and under-appreciated for the amount of time, effort, and energy I pour into my job. I love the kids that I work with, and some of my coworkers, but the long hours are very rough, the work itself can really take a toll on me emotionally, and I am rarely recognized for doing well (I actually often feel like I'm not doing well at all). Especially in the more recent weeks I've felt guilty for being so pushy about getting my breaks because we're so short-staffed, but other than the weekends, my breaks are the only time that I feel like I can truly be myself. I find myself comparing myself to friends and family members that make significantly more money than I do for jobs that don't demand nearly as much of them. I think about how simply by existing I'm being forced to participate in this society that is completely ruled by money, and that I'll never escape the need to make money to survive and pay my bills and loans. The only careers I'm qualified for are in a field that demands so much of me, drains me, and has led me to experiencing what I assume is burnout. I find myself feeling trapped, and like I'm being erased by my job. Like I'm not a person outside of my job title until Saturday and Sunday. I've been wondering if maybe social services isn't for me, but whenever I explore and research different fields, I come up against questions like, ""Would this be fulfilling for me?"" and ""Would doing this compromise my beliefs?"" and ""How can I afford to go back to school when I'm already so deeply in student loan debt?"" And I wish that I didn't care so much about how much money I'm making. One of my main goals in life though is to live somewhere rural in a cottage/cabin, and I know that I need money to get to that point. Literally... everything is behind a paywall. And even when I get there, I'll need to keep working regardless to pay the aforementioned bills and loans and keep myself alive. So I just feel stuck, knowing that while I'd really prefer not to work at all, or only do work that I enjoy when I choose to, I still have to keep working no matter what. I don't know. Maybe I'm just extremely burnt out from my current job, and that's what's going on with me. Any time I think too hard about it, I just... start crying, and I can never really explain what I'm feeling and what I'm going through. I feel like there really is no escape from work, from my life being ruled by work and by money for the rest of my life. Other than inevitable death, to me, the requirement to work is pretty much the worst part about being alive. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, being this upset so often makes me feel ungrateful, because these distressed thoughts are always drowning out everything else. What I should be thinking about more often is what I am grateful for: a place to live, a happy and healthy relationship with a loving partner, my family being alive and healthy, financial semi-stability at the moment, etc, etc. There is SO much more to life than a job, and work, and earning money, and owning things. And I recognize that and believe that, but I still just... I feel like I can't break free from my mind sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

All of that being said... does anyone else understand this feeling? How do you cope with this? How do you alleviate this kind of pain?

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a way to ever truly escape the hellscape work-driven society that we live in, especially with bills and loans hanging over your head?

Leaving this underpaid warehouse gig has been long overdue and now I'm coming up on my last week of my two week notice. 

I have enough sick days to apply to my last week so I don't even have to go in on Monday.

Since my boss knows this is my last week, will I get any backlash or denial of any of those sick days when I tell my boss each day I can't make it to work because I'm feeling  *""unwell"" \*cough\*cough\*?*

How should I word my phraseology when I'm reporting I cant make it to work? 

I want to make sure I can squeeze every last benefit out of this place as much as it did my time and health.

Any advice would be very appreciated. Thank you.",False,iqyhnn,THELegato,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/iqyhnn/2_week_notice_using_sick_days_on_last_week_need/,3,1

They declined because he worked from home with another company while helping them get started. They were also concerned because the CFO left his previous company for them. Like you cheated on your husband to be with me, and I don't want you to cheat on me too.

So I asked him, but if his work doesn't suffer, why does it matter if he works for another company too?

825,Guilt about working-class parents - advice/commiseration?,"My mom is 60 years old, a stroke survivor, and currently working as a food runner in a local restaurant.

She's worked in the service industry my entire life but her most recent position as food runner is really distressing to me, since it's a job usually reserved for athletic teenaged boys who can run up and down stairs carrying heavy trays all night no sweat.

I'm 1.5 years out of college, work for a silly start-up, and make twice what she does in a year just slacking off on the computer. I've been working from home since March and last week moved back in with my mom for a month or so as I prepare to move to a new city.

I'm in a position with my job, which I started a week after graduating from college, where I'm almost ready to quit, feeling overworked and underinvested as we head towards a big merger. I can't bear the thought of another round of performance reviews where I have to pretend to have goals that relate to the start-up or going through this merger and being told to hustle and keep up the grind as it makes my work 10x more difficult.

The thing I'm struggling with is the intense guilt when I bring up the idea of quitting with my mom. From her POV, I'm sitting at home in my pajamas reaping in the big bucks, while she is anxiously counting cash between shifts of grueling physical labor.  The idea of quitting a good job to find happiness doesn't make a lot of sense when you've always had precarious work and financials standing in the way of your happiness, I guess. She always says I should keep the job and count my blessings, and coming from her, of course it makes sense and feels like it's the only option.

I try to support her financially in the small ways that I can/that she accepts, but even with this job I'm not making enough to help her truly retire, so it's not like by quitting I would be taking anything away from her (besides the sense of security she has for my wellbeing), but it does feel like I can't follow through on the plan that I want (quit my job, be unemployed for a month or so to decompress and figure out what I want to do next, find a new job in the non-profit realm) while she is in this position.

At first we thought it was the chemical spill near by so we started closing all are dock doors. But it didn't really have much of an effect. For contexts there is a oil pump on the property 10 feet from the dock bays. Then we start thinking it might be the oil rig,so the gas company comes out and I find out at end of my shift that the guy thought it might be a leak under the warehouse. 

Are Manager just told us the faster we pull the quicker we can go home,nothing about closing down for the night or about the potential gas leak(at this point I'm still thinking it might be the spill). I had to take a few 5 minute breaks to catch my breathe inside the break room because I was not feeling well.

835,The stigma of not wanting to advance at work,"Hi everyone, just found this subreddit today so this is my first post. I‚Äôve had these thoughts for a while but hadn‚Äôt found a place to voice them before. 

I have an objectively great job. It pays well, I can work from home quite often even outside the pandemic, and I have 5 weeks of paid time off. I‚Äôm also quite good at it, have been promoted twice in 2 years and my manager says I should be up for my next one within a year. 

I‚Äôve kept this to myself because I don‚Äôt think anyone will understand it, but apart from promotions I get from just getting better at my job, I don‚Äôt want to advance. My manager asks where I want to be in 5 years, what kind of position I want to get into, and the answer is i just don‚Äôt want to move up. I don‚Äôt want anymore responsibility that‚Äôs going to eat into my personal time. I make plenty of money to meet my needs and wants and save plenty. My husband and I should be able to retire within 10-15 years on our current plan. 

All my coworkers are ambitious and career oriented, and I just don‚Äôt understand it. Are they really that fulfilled from their job? I do enjoy my job and coworkers, but if I didn‚Äôt need the money I 100% would not be there. I get much more happiness out of pursuing my own hobbies, and my job will never be the thing that makes me happy, but I feel like it‚Äôs still so taboo to be good at your job, 27, and say you‚Äôre done focusing on career advancement. 

I wish society didn‚Äôt automatically view you as lazy or stupid for not making work your life or selfish for prioritizing your happiness over other things. Makes me feel like we‚Äôve all just been brainwashed.

863,9-5s are forever ruined for me.,"Hello fellow anti-workers!

Since COVID-19 hit and working from home became the norm, I‚Äôve gotten used to setting my own hours, avoiding long ass commutes, working when I feel most productive, getting 8+ hours of sleep a night, cooking my own meals, and having time to go outside for fresh air. 

I can‚Äôt go back to the 9-5 life. I‚Äôm making less now but I feel like I have more life somehow. 

If working a 9-5 was hard while I was doing it, now that I‚Äôve gotten used to working on my own terms it‚Äôs gotten even harder üò´

And I‚Äôm not mad at it tbh ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",False,ir3mgs,RenitheGreat,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ir3mgs/95s_are_forever_ruined_for_me/,3,1
864,One of the easiest ways to break free of the 9-5 hellhole,"**How do you make a centuries-old system like capitalism work** ***for*** **you?**

*You find the skills it can't function without so you can grab it by the balls.*

I work as a freelance sales copywriter. I find myself recommending this route to so many people sick of the corporate world I figured I might as well put it into a post. Maybe it'll help someone here 

This is for anyone who doesn't mind escaping the 9-5 lifestyle by taking advantage of and profiting off the system. And even if you're not - being aware of this kind of fuckery will dramatically enhance your quality of life. Trust me.

At the moment, I make $3,500 a month as a retainer writing sales copy and emails for a single company. Most days I only have 1-2 short emails to write, which is usually no more than 2 hours of work.

If I need to take a few days off - which I do frequently since I'm dealing with some severe health issues - my employer is more than happy to let me do it because of how much money my writing is making him.

Plus even if there's a recession going on (like right now) I never have to worry about finding work, even if my employer goes out of business. In fact, what I do is so integral to the sales process that whatever businesses are surviving in a bad economy will need someone like me more than ever.

The reason for all this is because the kind of sales copywriting I do is based on a very specific, scientifically-proven form of marketing that targets **specific psychological and emotional triggers in people to drive them to take immediate action**. 

And it's not just non-profits and companies using this. The basic psychological principles this style of marketing is based on have been widely used by people in positions of power all over the world for ***as long as humans have been able to communicate***.

Only in the last 100 years have companies started using it for monetary gain.

It's called ""Direct Response Marketing""... and without this crucial step to the sales process, all business have a near-zero chance of making money due to the very nature of consumerism.

Politics  is pretty much nothing but direct response marketing. Appeal to your  voter base's pain points, blame it on someone else, explain how they're  holding you back from your dreams, &amp; ask for money to fix it. I've  used the same sequence to write emails and sales letters for health  supplements and hi-tech garden hoses more times than I can count.

This is why companies like Amazon and Apple and Google are bending over backwards to steal everyone's private data through their products and  services. The secret, most private thoughts of your target customers is  the kind of information that can easily be spun into **billions and billions of dollars, even with a barebones advertising campaign.**

Because of that fact, companies will pay you substantially more for your time. So much so that you'll eventually learn to stop charging based on time and start charging based on how much money your client estimates to make from your work.

That makes it insanely easy to hit a 6 figure income once you know how to market yourself. Even if you're just a so-so copywriter. Your skill is in so much demand it simply doesn't matter.

So if you're looking for a way out of the 9-5 hellhole or just need a way to make more money, this is probably one of the most efficient ways:

**By learning the skill that functions as the lynchpin to the capitalist-consumerist sales cycle.**

Best thing is anyone can do this and no one cares about your resume. Only your ability to bring them results. I had only 5 months of part-time experience working for clients (all remote) before I was fired from my last actual job. I decided to try freelancing as a sales copywriter full time. It was a little bumpy at first but I'm now stable enough that I don't have to look for work unless I want to make extra money. I'm even learning how to charge companies high-ticket prices for my services, like $5,000 for a sales letter.

And even if you're not on board with taking advantage of this terrible system... Hopefully this serves as an example of how much money your opinions and interests are worth to people in positions of power. Politicians and corporations use this in their every breath.

908,What is work? ‚Äî A few thoughts on what it means to be anti-work,"# ""I‚Äôm not completely anti-work‚Äù

Even the more radical people on here keep making exceptions to their opposition to work, and so I‚Äôm here to suggest we stop doing that. The reasoning behind ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not completely anti-work‚Äù goes something like this: 

*We‚Äôre opposed to capitalist exploitation of labor, opposed to bosses and 40-hour weeks, opposed to how work is done in this system. But we‚Äôre not against work when it‚Äôs voluntary, meaningful or necessary.*

I‚Äôm afraid this doesn‚Äôt clear things up. It usually leads to comments about how the term *anti-work* is misleading and how the subreddit should be called *anti-exploitative-labor*, *anti-employment*, *anti-jobs* or whatever else. It leads to folks claiming they‚Äôre anti-work, while busy making excuses for work that they deem necessary or worth keeping.

When you describe your anti-work position as a stance against ‚Äúwork that is exploitative, unnecessary, meaningless, alienated‚Äù, or as a stance against the 40 hour work-week, then you leave the door open to all kinds of reformist nonsense. To the average liberal, pretty much *all* work is (at least in some way) necessary and a good source for meaning, and so they will happily agree with your opposition: *Let‚Äôs get rid of unnecessary jobs (but keep the rest)! Let‚Äôs get rid of asshole bosses (and find better bosses)! Let‚Äôs make work more fulfilling! Let‚Äôs work towards a 30-hour work week!*

These dreams of a slightly less shitty world are often high-fived and upvoted, because at least they push in the 'right direction'. Good intentions leaving us with a vague, incoherent, watered-down version of anti-work. An invitation to demand small changes to work, rather than rejecting and abolishing it altogether.  

# Let‚Äôs define our terms

Wikipedia defines *work* as such:

&gt;Work or labor is intentional activity people perform to support themselves, others, or the needs and wants of a wider community. Alternatively, work can be viewed as the human activity that contributes (along with other factors of production) towards the goods and services within an economy.

Using this definition, it‚Äôs not entirely clear what exactly separates *working* from other activities. For example, me writing a post for this subreddit can be considered work. Why not? Who are you to say it‚Äôs not done to support myself, others, or the needs and wants of a wider community? What does it even mean to ‚Äòsupport myself‚Äô, where do you draw the line? 

Arguably, even my post here ""contributes towards the goods and services within the economy."" (Reddit wouldn‚Äôt make much money without people posting and commenting, creating a social platform and lots and lots of data.)

Another example highlighting the vagueness of the wiki definition: Cooking. When I prepare a meal for myself and others, am I working? Is it work if a friend pays me to do it? Is it work if I do it 9-to-5, as part of my job in a restaurant?

In the context of anti-work and radical politics (or anti-political traditions), it‚Äôs generally a good idea to avoid such broad definitions. If we want to take a stance against work, we better use one that can‚Äôt be applied to pretty much *any* activity, under *any* circumstances. 

Luckily, plenty of anti-work authors and radicals have already given us definitions that are far more coherent and useable for our purposes:

&gt;Another form of incomprehension involves confusion over what work is.  This stems in part from the fact that the word can be used in ambiguous  ways. I may, indeed, say that I am ‚Äúworking‚Äù on an article for WD or on a translation. But when I am doing these things, it is, in fact, not work, because there is nothing compelling me to do them, I have no obligation to do them; I do them solely for my own pleasure. And here is where the basic meaning of work and its destruction becomes clear.    
&gt;  
&gt;**Work is an economic social relationship based upon compulsion**. The institutions of property and commodity exchange place a price tag upon survival. This forces each of us to find ways to buy our survival or to accept the utter precariousness of a life of constant theft. In the former case, we can only buy our survival precisely by selling large portions of our lives away‚Äîthis is why we refer to work as wage slavery ‚Äîa slave is one whose life is owned by another, and when we work, capital owns our lives. \[Wolfi Landstreicher - [Willful Disobedience](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/willful-disobedience-wolfi-landstreicher#toc64)\]

and

&gt;My minimum definition of **work is forced labor, that is, compulsory production**. Both elements are essential. Work is production enforced by economic or political means, by the carrot or the stick. (The carrot is just the stick by other means.) But not all creation is work. Work is never done for its own sake, it‚Äôs done on account of some product or output that the worker (or, more often, somebody else) gets out of it. This is what work necessarily is. To define it is to despise it.   
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\] Modern work has worse implications. People don‚Äôt just work, they have ‚Äújobs.‚Äù One person does one productive task all the time on an or-else basis. Even if the task has a quantum of intrinsic interest (as increasingly many jobs don‚Äôt) the monotony of its obligatory exclusivity drains its ludic potential. A ‚Äújob‚Äù that might engage the energies of some people, for a reasonably limited time, for the fun of it, is just a burden on those who have to do it for forty hours a week with no say in how it should be done, for the profit of owners who contribute nothing to the project, and with no opportunity for sharing tasks or spreading the work among those who actually have to do it. \[Bob Black - [The Abolition of Work](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/bob-black-the-abolition-of-work)\]

# Work as an institution

Both definitions offered by Black and Landstreicher paint a picture of work that we're all familiar with, and it's a lot more specific than the all-encompassing wiki definition.

Work can be understood as a highly authoritarian institution.

&gt;[**Institutions**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution), according to Samuel P. Huntington, are ""stable, valued, recurring patterns of behavior"". Further, institutions can refer to mechanisms which govern the behavior of a set of individuals within a given community; moreover, institutions are identified with a social purpose, transcending individuals and intentions by mediating the rules that govern living behavior.

Similar to how the state forces us to be citizens, pay taxes, accept its rule and its monopoly on legitimate violence, *work* forces us to be *workers*.

Sure, you can make all kinds of excuses for the state (""it protects us"", ""it's necessary"", ""it creates order"", ""how else would we deal with murderers?""), and so can you make excuses for work (""nothing would get done without it"", ""it's necessary"", ""people need order in their life"", ""how else would we deal with the lazy?""). But don't cling to these ideas and call yourself anti-work.

As long as you value the *economic social relationship based upon compulsion,* and as long as you can't even imagine any alternative to work as an institution, you're not anti-work, you just want work to be a little nicer.

# Let's be pragmatic: Keep it radical.

Now some of you probably want to point out how we can't just switch from having a work-riddled society to a completely work-free society overnight, and so, the reasoning often goes, it's silly to be ""completely anti-work"".

I'ma be honest, I don't know what a future without work might look like. I don't need to know; nobody really does anyway. I also don't know how a future free of *war and slavery* might look like, but I sure as hell oppose these things as well. You can be 'pragmatic' without making excuses for work. We don't need to water down our opposition to work just because work is considered normal and necessary in this society.

If we want to *end work*, then keeping our perspective radical (as in: going to the root or origin; fundamental) is about as pragmatic as it gets. Liberals have sometimes advocated for nicer working conditions, leftists have occasionally even fought for it, but that only got us where we are today: A world full of work, more useless, destructive and alienating than ever before.

But... $500 each year... for the rest of my life seems like torture and more hours of my life spent on subscriptions. We all know money = freedom.

My thoughts are this... if the house falls down from being old, then is too much fine print in the policy to even know if major damages would be covered. 

I just makes more sense to take the extra 500 i would save by canceling my hoi, then adding 100, and purchasing $600 worth of cord wood to heat my home in the winter using an efficient wood burner.

Cord wood is insurance that i don't freeze to death, is it not?

The snowball effect would be a significantly lower gas bill as well.

Again, the alternative is that I pay my hoi AND my full gas bill.

Maybe use the saving to purchase compost and start a food garden?

I don't like giving strangers my money for things i can't physically see or touch or taste with my senses.

Perhaps I know that the septic might need to be pumped in the next 2 years. I could use the money i save by not paying my hoi, for... *chuckles* actual home repairs!?

I had a coworker tell me he did this at every job he‚Äôs ever had and never gotten caught. When I was finally fed up with my job and didn‚Äôt have anything to lose, I did this and had a great time recharging my batteries.

Basically, you gotta lie and say Grandma died. Aunts, uncles, cousins, those do NOT work. It‚Äôs gotta be your direct lineage or your spouse‚Äôs direct lineage or else it‚Äôs not paid time off. You maybe can get excused absences for cousins/ etc, but it won‚Äôt be paid.

During your down time, stay off all social media, don‚Äôt leave the house, and enjoy three paid days of peace and quiet. And obviously do NOT tell any coworkers you‚Äôre doing this.

You do however need to print off a fake funeral program as most jobs require proof. Most funerals are so damn expensive that homemade programs aren‚Äôt suspicious. If that‚Äôs not possible, you can call the funeral parlor where real fake Grandma is and ask them to mail you a program. ‚ÄúI was there for the funeral, but I lost my program, and it would mean the world to me...‚Äù

And it‚Äôs best not to claim someone who is still living has died because if/ when they DO die, you‚Äôre stuck at work or caught in the lie. My brother-in-law tried that, and he missed his real Grandma‚Äôs funeral.

So recently about 5 months I have a new job. It's a part time job and it's a very good salary.

I love the company. There are things I like about my job, I love the products, the colleagues I have are nice &amp; it's an OK environment to work in.

I took a part-time job but I need to be available 5 days a week which just doesn't work for me.

The company itself is Spanish, and everyone that works there is Spanish. I'm the only one that isn't Spanish nor do I speak any word Spanish. I feel very lonely by not doing so. It's like I'm an outstander.

Work it's self has been very exhausting lately, I have a schedule that doesn't work for me, the manager doesn't want to change it, makes me work days that I can't, because I need to go to school and with my dad having cancer she does not give me any free days except for 2. I need to be there for my dad because I am the only person he can count on at the moment. This is a huge problem for me because there's lots of other things I need to focus on and there's really no change. The manager doesn't even care I feel like and thinks it's unfair to change my schedule because she should not supposed to be making a different schedule only for me.

I feel like leaving because I'm literally dragging myself out of my bed (My mental health has been deteriorating), because this is so frustrating and demotivating. Also had some other problems within the company which added to the fact that I'm feeling like this. 

The only thing I'm scared is of leaving is that I won't find another job with the same salary for a while, but my mental health has really been going down.

952,"If you let your kid train for their future job for 8 hours a day, you're mentally unstable","I have a friend who is like 15, and she is planning to join the circus when she grows up. Which is awesome! At least she will do a job she will enjoy, unlike us wage slaves or artists who never want to go pro/full time who are stuck in a system rigged against them. 

What disturbs me though is that her parents actually let her practice 8 hours a day. Every single day, it might even also be on weekends. She does online school early in the morning, and then for 8 hours straight just practices, in the same way a cubicle worker just works for 8 hours straight. And she also has homework so that leaves her with little to no time for herself or social activities.  It distrubs me that this is considered fucking normal. I am very concerned for her, I do not think it is mentally healthy for a kid to spend so much time away from normal kid stuff like being with friends, silly high school stuff, watching movies, being in fandoms etc. I am really sad that such work life imbalance is normalized for some people from literal childhood. Why do we think it is okay to do something from the moment you wake up to the moment you go to eat dinner? How is this ever okay? How is your whole damn life revolving around one single thing, whether it is your job or your passion normalized? We are more than just our jobs. Sure, lets say that a man named Joe is a worker. But he is not just a worker. He has other roles to fulfill in his life. He is not just ''Joe, The Worker''. He is Joe The Worker, The Father, The Husband, The Friend, and perhaps even Joe The Painter or Joe The Celloist. And my friends usernames in all the social media accounts she has are something along the lines of ''CircusGirl15'' which disturbs me even more. I know I am not the right person to discuss this cause I am practically an internet addict, and have suicidal thoughts every single day, but what I hate more than people who work sitty soul draining office jobs that they are AWARE are NOT MENTALLY HEALTHY nor good for their work life balance and suffer in them, is people who think being forced to do one single ting they  love by their employer for 8 hours straight every day or starving to death is an okay, normal thing and are completely fine with it. 

I see this as a defilation of art. Art is supposed to be beautiful, charming, dreamy, exciting, fulfilling. NOT an addiction. Not a thing that you are forced to have your whole life revolved around or you starve to death. It is fucked up. She is a kid. She is supposed to be doing normal kid stuff while simutaneously enjoying her art and cultivating her talents, not just having her whole life revolve around her future job. EVEN IF IT IS A JOB SHE ENJOYS. This is not okay! She is more than just an acrobat, she is a person with a personality, probably has friends, has family, and will possibly find a spouse and may have children in the future. Se has many roles to fulfill in life, not just her future job. What on earth are her parents thinking? Are they stage parents or something? 

Which brings me to the next topic I want to discuss, which is people who have no identity outside their jobs. People who are just ''Joe the warehouse worker'' or just ''Joe the builder''. Or that is what they THINK they are, not what they REALLY  ARE. People who only discuss their jobs, their projects related to their jobs, people who can only talk about jobs. 

Personally, I think if you spend more time working at mcdonalds, working in a cubicle, working at an office, or even at a fucking circus than you spend with your friends and family, then there is somethin seriously wrong with your life and you need to fix it, and anyone who normalized tha during your childhood was clearly mentally unstable and an irresponnsible parent. We are more than just our jobs, even the jobs we love! There is more to life than just work, or just art! There are relationships, experiences, trials, challenges, dreams, goals, travelling, learning, loving, celebrating! So many other things other than just working your days, whether your job is an Amazon Employee or a fire eater for Cirque Du Soleil. Life is complex, full of different activities, people, relationships and experiences, especially childhood! And it should not worked away! 

As Niechze said, any man that does not have 2/3 of his day to himself is a slave whether he is a worker, a statesman or a buisnessman.

If your whole life and identity revolves around your job, or even your future job as a chil worst case scenario, then something is wrong with it. Doesn't matter if its a mind sucking shit office job, or an exciting form of art, life is more than just that and it is to be lived! You have only ONE life! No one on their deat bed wishes they spennd less time with friends and family to train for their future job! 

My two cents, no I have to go to sleep. This makes me even more suicidal than I already was, and it also makes me feel guilty for some reason for not wanting to make my passions, the loves of my life about money. No, I don't want to type my daydreams for 8 hours a day, I am not a fucking robot, I am a human, I am more than just Ayano the writer, alright? I am Ayano The Writer, Ayano The Friend, Ayano The Sister, Ayano The Grand-Daughter, Ayano The Believer, Ayano The Thnker, Ayano The Traveler, Ayano The Activist, Ayano The Lover of Movement, Ayano The Poet, Ayano The Simple Girl That Sometimes Just Needs Alone Time For Herself To Watch Binge Watch Anime.

two off actually sick.

nowhere near as often as | used to and, now, | can usually

I'm pretty sure that there are millions of people who feel like
me about work. | bet there are millions out there who have
loved working from home and dread it coming to an end. But
there are also loads of companies who, it seems, have
noticed increased productivity and lower costs during this

My boss has been ill and out of work, not sure when / if she will return. Anyhow, one time she suspected me of doing this and requested to see when I clocked out (and one of the trainees) (they dont give her access) and she was like ""this doesnt match up with time sheet... on time sheet you said they stayed later... payroll can't see these discrepancies"". I get a sense she did this to scare me. I know the boss we both answer too wouldn't check on his own. When the government comes to see if we are in compliance, I don't believe they ask for clock-in info, they barely ask for trainings. One of the payroll chicks got fired recently and I don't know why and I'm getting paranoid, what if they are now cracking down on this? There is a new CFO as of last year who is very aware of my leaving 10 min early and cheating the system to get the full 8 hours. Is there a way I can avoid or twist it around in my favor?

962,"24m, finding a career that doesnt make me depressed.","I'm not sure if posts like this are allowed here, but this sub seems filled with people who have faced the same struggles, so it seemed like a good place to post this.

Hello, I'm writing this because I'm just lost. I've never really been a career oriented person, I've always been more concerned about how I spend my free time as opposed to what I do for a career. I went to college for programming and eventually dropped out because i couldn't handle it.

I've worked i handful of different jobs, at truss plant, a warehouse, have 7 years total experience at a fast food resturaunt in my hometown (worked there since highschool). I currently work at a factory that makes various plastic things. There isnt a job ive worked that didnt feel like a plauge on my existence. All I think about at home is how my next shift is coming, all I feel at work is this really depressing bleh feeling that I'm not really sure how much longer I can handle.

However, its really hard to picture myself in a career that doesn't have me feeling like this constantly. Your typical trade job strikes me as something I'd hate doing even more than what im doing now, and its hard to justify going back to school for something unless I'm incredibly enthusiastic about it.

I'm lost and I can't keep up like this. I recognize the problem is probably with me and my own attitudes but I'm clueless how to escape them. And I'm extra lost at the idea of how to find an even remotely tolerable career. They always say look at your hobbies to find a career, but i don't do much outside of your typical hanging out with friends, watching TV, reading, playing games, etc. Nothing really in terms of practical/productive interests tbh. I feel like my only real option is do some generic buisness course and go work at an office somewhere, I'd probably make a little bit more money and I doubt it'll make me feel worse than my current job makes me feel. I still have bills to pay after all.

What do you guys think i should do. I think at the end of the day my only goal here is to find a job that isn't str8 up emotionally painful to get myself into everyday, something I'm at the very least, so numb and indifferent towards it doesnt plauge my mind during MY time.",False,iox02i,zman419,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/iox02i/24m_finding_a_career_that_doesnt_make_me_depressed/,5,1

996,Today I fell asleep during a meeting with my CEO,"Hello /r/Antiwork.

I started at this company in the start of May this year during the corona crisis. Before accepting this job, my union even told me only to use this job for experience and then find something better paying.

But fast forward to today. I'm still a relatively new employee accompanied by two people that also started after me. Today the new people were at a meeting with our CEO/Founder, where he circlejerked about the company and his prior experience in life.
He used an hour at least talking about how the business was near and dear to him and how important it was for him, that it was a profitable business. I literally fell asleep, and thought he didn't notice, with us just being four people in the meeting room. The meeting was two hours long. I challenged him on where his perfect imagination of the business fell through in practice. He was like, we'll have to do better at that. It's group effort and we strive to be better than everyone else in the IT business.

All I was thinking during our rather unproductive meeting was the following 'If the business is as great as you're claiming, why the hell do I get shit pay even with my qualifications for the job?' 

Later this day, my boss approached me and asked if I was tired, I told him that I was earlier. He answered 'Yeah I know, the CEO reached out to me to tell me he wasn't please with that fact and that I should maybe go earlier to bed.' I told my boss 'It was very boring, and I even slept early yesterday, so I got plenty of sleep.' He laughed and went on. Somebody on my team asked me why I was pulled aside by our boss, I told them. They laughed their ass off.

I have another meeting tomorrow, continuing todays meeting with the same four people. Let's see if I can live through that.

I can't even say that I felt bad for sleeping through half of it, I'm not paid enough to stay awake during circlejerk. 

TL;DR: I fell asleep at an introduction meeting with my CEO and two other newly hired people. The CEO wasn't impressed and told my boss. I still have a job, though.",False,iouvco,4ScreensAtWork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/iouvco/today_i_fell_asleep_during_a_meeting_with_my_ceo/,19,1

1002,"So burnt out from years of non-stop work, idk what to do.","*Long Rant* 

So I‚Äôm fairly young at 25. I know I haven‚Äôt put in years of hard labor and feel guilty for complaining...but I‚Äôm still exhausted. 

My mother was the type to constantly demand more of me. Better grades, more chores, more after school activities. Always thinking about the next thing to achieve. I started working as soon as I turned 16. I would work doubles every weekend, and after school when I didn‚Äôt have practice for the 4 different sports I played throughout the year to ‚Äúlook good on my college applications‚Äù. 

Then I went to college. I immediately fell extremely ill and was sick for literally a year straight. Did I have a break? No. I still continued school online with a full course load while working 40 hours at one job and part time at another. Once better, I continued with full time school for 4 more years while I worked during every waking moment of free time. 

I swear I even remember the day I just cracked. I was in my second year of an incredibly degrading service job and I feel like my mind just completely numbed out by the stress and pressure. 

After graduating, I worked part time at an office job that I fucking **hated**. They were so fucking stupid/outdated and ended up firing me bc I suggested using emojis in a marketing email subject line to get people‚Äôs attention. They said it was unprofessional. OK THEN. At the same time I worked at Ulta which was also a hell hole. I was forced to con people into signing up for a credit card to not get my hours cut, and in return I‚Äôd get these shitty free samples of like a pea size amount of products nobody wanted. 

Then in May of 2019 I finally got what I felt like was the closest I could reasonably get to a dream job. I worked with a bunch of other young people in a gorgeous office with lots of amenities, dogs, and *unlimited* time off. Then, everything changed when we were bought by a huge corporation. Back in Jan I could tell things were changing and at this point it‚Äôs hell. I still feel **incredibly** bad for complaining bc at the end of the day it‚Äôs still cushy and I make decent money. However, my boss is now cracking down on our time off. (I got in trouble for taking time off when my dad had cancer and had to beg for 2 mental health days off this month despite not taking any time off since May) 

Plus we‚Äôre doing insane revenue pushes and are being told that it‚Äôs going to get even worse for the last few months of the year and to not expect time off for holidays. I have worked on accounts that have made a whopping $40 million total in the last 3 months alone, along with another account that just got like $3 mil out of nowhere, but my team is the only one who hasn‚Äôt gotten any raises. we‚Äôre told we can‚Äôt get bonuses or anything either. 

the light at the end of the tunnel is that i‚Äôm being considered for a promotion next year. which at first sounded awesome. but the more i think about it i can‚Äôt breathe. i don‚Äôt want a fuck ton more responsibilities for a MEASLY pay increase when i work on stuff that earns god knows who literally MILLIONS of dollars. 

i‚Äôm just at a loss. i live for friday nights and saturday mornings bc sat night and all day sunday i‚Äôm just dreading the week. i try so hard to ‚Äúrecharge‚Äù but nothing works. games, tv, cooking. nothing i love brings me pleasure anymore. i just refuse to live like this. if this is going to be my life i‚Äôd rather kill myself. 

i have devised a plan to escape in ~8 months and work for myself, but i feel discouraged about whether or not it‚Äôll work. if anyone is interested i‚Äôm happy to go into it. but yeah idk. i just feel dead inside and it seems pathetic bc i know there‚Äôs people working in sweatshops but even that doesn‚Äôt make me feel, like, more grateful for helping rich people get richer you know?",False,intm4i,y-i-k-e-s-69,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/intm4i/so_burnt_out_from_years_of_nonstop_work_idk_what/,13,1

1005,"""Resolve to serve no more, and you are at once freed.""","&gt;Poor, wretched, and stupid peoples, nations determined on your own misfortune and blind to your own good! You let yourselves be deprived before your own eyes of the best part of your revenues; your fields are plundered, your homes robbed, your family heirlooms taken away. You live in such a way that you cannot claim a single thing as your own; and it would seem that you consider yourselves lucky to be loaned your property, your families, and your very lives. All this havoc, this misfortune, this ruin, descends upon you not from alien foes, but from the one enemy whom you yourselves render as powerful as he is, for whom you go bravely to war, for whose greatness you do not refuse to offer your own bodies unto death. He who thus domineers over you has only two eyes, only two hands, only one body, no more than is possessed by the least man among the infinite numbers dwelling in your cities; he has indeed nothing more than the power that you confer upon him to destroy you. Where has he acquired enough eyes to spy upon you, if you do not provide them yourselves? How can he have so many arms to beat you with, if he does not borrow them from you? The feet that trample down your cities, where does he get them if they are not your own? How does he have any power over you except through you? How would he dare assail you if he had no cooperation from you? What could he do to you if you yourselves did not connive with the thief who plunders you, if you were not accomplices of the murderer who kills you, if you were not traitors to yourselves? You sow your crops in order that he may ravage them, you install and furnish your homes to give him goods to pillage; you rear your daughters that he may gratify his lust; you bring up your children in order that he may confer upon them the greatest privilege he knows ‚Äî to be led into his battles, to be delivered to butchery, to be made the servants of his greed and the instruments of his vengeance; you yield your bodies unto hard labor in order that he may indulge in his delights and wallow in his filthy pleasures; you weaken yourselves in order to make him the stronger and the mightier to hold you in check. From all these indignities, such as the very beasts of the field would not endure, you can deliver yourselves if you try, not by taking action, but merely by willing to be free.

&gt;Resolve to serve no more, and you are at once freed. I do not ask that you place hands upon the tyrant to topple him over, but simply that you support him no longer; then you will behold him, like a great Colossus whose pedestal has been pulled away, fall of his own weight and break in pieces.

1009,"Unemployed for the last 3 months, no desire to go back to work","About three months ago I quit my job. There was a few reasons I cited in my resignation letter, but to be honest it was mostly due to stress. This job was technically my ""dream job.""

When I was younger, the moment I left one job I always had this drive to get my next job as soon as possible. This time, I feel nothing like that, I'm content to just be unemployed forever. I've sent some resumes, but only a handful (like 10), and only for positions I actually want. Even though they're ""good jobs,"" I dread the idea of being hired again.

I've struggled through burnout before, so I know this isn't it. When I was burnt out, I remember feeling something along the lines of ""don't wanna,"" which I overcame with the typical ""fight through it, remember that you'll die of starvation if you don't work."" This is a new feeling, its not that I don't want to, its that the very fabric of my being simply refuses to go back to a life of working just to survive. It's not a malleable feeling like ""don't wanna,"" its set in stone: I wont.

Fortunately I still have five to six months worth of living expenses covered thanks to my savings, and I'm back in school. Anyone else experiencing this next level of burnout? Post-burnout burnout?

I call it a reverse job, because living my life and hanging out/relaxing is my primary occupation and I just work when most people take a lunch break.

I deliver more than other similar devs so no one calls me out or has ever suspected anything.

1043,Why can't businesses offer now what they could in the boomer generation?,"I'm really confused and I'm not even sure I know how to articulate this.

Why was the boomer generation able to just throw on a collared shirt and a pair of jeans, waltz into a company and request to speak to a manager to get a job?

I'm looking at an entry level engineering job wanting a P.Eng and 36 bullet points of varying specialized skills.  The starting salary is $39K CAD  \~ $30K USD.  6 years ago this same job was $55K CAD and that was still nuts then.  That salary would barely allow you to afford rent for yourself in a crappy amenitiless apartment let alone budget food.

What happened?  It's not fiction, right?  My mom worked a Summer to buy a car, and pay for her tuition and rent for a year... 

Like, I didn't do anything wrong right?  I sacrificed.  I worked hard.   I got the degree.  I got the experience.  I got certs and professional designations.  My salary has just been going down for years now.  Companies either have mass lay-offs or totally die.

I don't get it.  

When a boomer retires.  Their job is also phased out and their responsibilities divided among who is left with no increase in pay.

Even considering most of the jobs I've ever had, I hadn't really needed my degree for them except to hit the HR check box.  

Was there really a time where jobs just wanted to see your enthusiasm and they'd train you?  

There's no way my parents did this much work on the daily for this little pay.  Someone explain this to me.",False,ioyrdu,I_TrustedMyEmployer,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ioyrdu/why_cant_businesses_offer_now_what_they_could_in/,66,1

1047,Being traumatized at work made me leave for good,"In 2014 i graduated school and found a position working for the airlines as a ramp agent for a very popular airline company. Things were fine for the first month or so but for some reason people really hated me for being ""so quiet"". 

Most of my coworkers were idiots who were getting paid minimum wage just like i was, except they were in their late 40s. They hated me for a bunch of superficial reasons like, not being ""man enough"" because i didn't have a car, i didn't boast about working 16 hours a day, and i didn't have a girlfriend. People quickly saw me as a target to be fucked with, including my boss.

I was bullied to the point where someone thought it would be funny to hit me with their car. Everyone, including my boss just laughed about it the following day. I couldn't report any of this because my boss would find out and make my job even more of a living hell (i found this out the hard way). I didn't know wtf to do because worked my ASS off and was always respectful, despite being treated like shit. But because i was new and MUCH younger than everyone there, people assumed i was just lucky to have that job in the first place. 

I worked mandatory overtime almost daily which resulted in me almost forgetting essential steps in securing the airplanes (luckily i was always on point). Getting paid minimum wage, working 60/hours a week, commuting 2 hours a day by bicycle, paying ridiculously high rent in Washington DC, and not even having the time or energy to feed myself left me malnourished, depressed, anxious, restless, and suicidal. Every waking moment was hell and getting hit by the car seriously messed me up mentally. I thought my coworkers were plotting to kill me and the trauma of it kept me awake at night for weeks.

I remember catching an Uber to work one day at around 5am. It was still dark, and i couldn't bike to work because it was winter and there was ice everywhere. My Uber driver was an African guy who looked like he was in his mid 40's. In the middle of a random conversation, i was telling him about my job situation, my shitty life, and that i was running late because i barely sleep anymore. He took at good look at me through the rear view mirror and straight up said, ""Brother.... don't take this the wrong way, but you look like absolute shit. Keep this up and you're going to have a heart attack before you make it to 30. I'm only telling you this because you really need to hear it.""

I appreciated his bluntness and honesty. From that point on, i decided to leave the rat race even if it meant me going homeless or staving. 

Fast forward to 2020, I've still kept that promise to myself and although im not rolling in money, i no longer worry about my income and live better than most millionaires. Life still has its struggles but their minor in comparison. I work between 15 - 35 hours a week and i control every aspect of my life at this point. 

I will never understand the concept of wanting to suffer though a manual labor job for the entire day. Choosing to work like a literal slave does not make you a fucking ""man"". This is the result of programming... and yes, it IS programming. I had no idea so many people felt this way until i found this sub. You all have an opportunity to choose the red pill or the blue one. Others have already chosen... and i assure you it's a sad path to take.

TL;dr - Got bullied to the point where my mind was lost at my job. Felt like i had no way out. Hated every moment of my life and every inch of myself. Eventually met a man who convinced me to leave forever.",False,iof29n,UnplugYourMind,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/iof29n/being_traumatized_at_work_made_me_leave_for_good/,12,1

1052,Finally quitting my job,"Hey all. Sorry about mobile but I‚Äôm at work right now! My job absolutely blows at the best of time. Little back story, I went to college to try to get a teaching degree, but ended up dropping out because I wasn‚Äôt able to afford. Since then I had gotten a job as a pizza guy. I loved being a pizza guy. You made really good money in cash, and you made that money driving around by yourself listening to tunes and smoking pot in your car. I ended up having to leave that job because they didn‚Äôt offer very good insurance and I‚Äôm diabetic, which was very upsetting. I like to imagine I was maybe in the pony express in a past life, as that job was just really good for me seemed to fit. 

I looked all over my town for a job that would hire me that offered good enough insurance. Quite literally the only one is the school I previously had dropped out of. Applied for a couple positions and none of them were good for me, and finally had to settle on being a janitor. Being a janitor has pros and cons. Pro being it‚Äôs a union position, so I had really great PTO and insurance, cons being literally everything else. I hated my job, but grinned and bared it for my insurance. I ended up getting my insulin pump through it, which I have spent years trying to get. I am extremely thankful for that. 

But cut to coronavirus time. My job wasn‚Äôt great before this sure, but it was bearable. Janitors got affected a lot by the pandemic, as the ones tasked with cleaning and disinfecting the school and dorms. Not only are we all risking our lives just coming to work now, especially people like me with auto immune diseases, but our work load tripled. Instead of cleaning all our bathrooms once a day we had to twice. So now I had about 10 public restrooms I had to completely clean twice a day, where before I‚Äôd spend all day doing the 10 once. On top of that, due to people quitting, I was tasked with two student apartment complexes that also needed to be cleaned twice a day. They were on opposite ends of town. If that wasn‚Äôt enough, they also decided we would no longer get weekends off or be able to use any of our benefits (PTO) or risk being fired. 

Now I‚Äôm doing triple the work, without any days off (did get 2-4 a month), risking my life, you guessed it for the exact same pay. I was no longer grinning and struggling to bare it at all. Finally today is when I reached my limit. I got my only weekend off for this month, to be told I‚Äôd have to come in on Labor Day an hour earlier then I usually do. Thankfully we only had to stay till noon. I rushed through my things trying to get my triple workload done in half the time I‚Äôd have normally been doing 1/3rd of it. At noon my boss asked me about all these things and if they were done and I told her honestly what I had gotten done and what I hadn‚Äôt. She looked upset and I told her if she needed I could stay later. She sent me home. Today I get to work, start up, get a call from my boss. For about 30 min she chewed me out about what a terrible job I was doing, she went and checked yesterday and all the things (I had said wernt done) wernt done! How dare I! I hung up the phone literally shaking with anger and called my dear mother. 

We talked, and she offered to let me come back home to California (living in Midwest currently), where my mom owns her own apartment building. She offered me discounted rent, and of course CA‚Äôs good ass statewide insurance (fuck ya Medical), plus their free community college. So I got off the phone with a huge smile on my face. Today at the end of the day I‚Äôm going to tell my boss this is my last day, fuck your 2 weeks and fuck you too. I am the opposite of a quitter, and will normally work till I drop. But this is it this is the point of dropping. I‚Äôm gonna coast on some of my savings for a while, being free for the first time in literal years (been working 40/50/60 hours since I dropped out of college). Then I‚Äôm gonna move back home and basically have most of my problems taken care of while getting to be back in school to work on something I‚Äôm actually interested in doing. I am so fucking excited. My first thought was for the first time in about 5 years, I‚Äôm gonna go get myself breakfast tomorrow. Maybe waffles. I‚Äôll go home and eat breakfast which I havnt been able to do since I started working.

1071,So tired of school,"This might not be absolutely appropriate for this sub as it's about school and not work, but I thought school is pretty much the first and most important part in a life of work and where they condition you to be a good worker.

I am very tired of school - I think a lot of people already agree on this, but it's not an effective, supportive and long-term genuinely educating system. Your time and individuality is not respected. 

You are thrown into a class of 20+ people with a single teacher. You have to work at the speed of the teacher and majority of the class - no matter whether you need more or less time. You have only a few ways of gaining information - the teacher and whatever they dictate you to write down and your textbooks, which are barely used anymore because how goddamn outdated they are.

You have just no control. If your school says you will now have a lesson of Chemistry, you will have a lesson of Chemistry. Class is too slow and your time is being wasted? Get used to it. Class is too fast and you'd like to go back and understand from there on? Do it at home and not in class, because you need to follow our rhythm.

They don't want your genuine independence, creativity or other methods of learning. It's a goddamn pain.

They even have the audacity to automatically associate great grades with talent (at least my teacher did). I mean, seriously? You are just going to shove this black and white world view onto students? You really believe good grades are a product of mere intelligence and talent?

Some of the people with the best grades were incredibly shallow. They had no important hobbies or talents, were not particularly good at anything and were some of the most boring and average folk. And they are willing to sacrifice you alive for some cookie points and better grades.

School injects a mad amount of competition and rivalry into children/young teens. Competition alone is not bad, but making it all about perfect grades and disregarding skills outside of that? Making many students feel hopeless for their future if they are not an absolute certain way? 

I still have a future ahead of me, but just the experience of school and seeing so many miserable adults with jobs they hate makes me incredibly pessimistic. I feel like you'd be most successful by going against the grain and doing something yourself and basically employing yourself (which is a failed dream of many and is a complete hit or miss), or hitting the super rare chance of working a good job with good conditions and a feeling of satisfaction (if these exist at all).",False,ipdyec,stingysoysauce,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ipdyec/so_tired_of_school/,12,1

Oh but some even go as far as to take their pride further by not taking those days.
People are getting fucking exploited and they'll say ""welcome to the world üòÉ"" in that stupid fucking condescending tone. Like no jenny you fucking absolute idiot this is not normal, you have a severe mental defect for believing it is. You're just as fucking miserable as everybody else so quit lying to yourself.
Not only all of that, but the fact that people identify with their careers makes me sick. Why is the first question people ask you ""what do you do?"" Or ""how is work?"" Like for fuck sake is that all you serfs know how to talk about? My answer to that is its fucking terrible, thats what. I would rather be doing anything else, as would most of you if you werent so programmed by the hustle hard mentality.
America is literally mindless drones who LOVE to be miserable and if you go any other direction than the mold, they will feel nothing but the upmost content for you.

""But I HAD TO SUFFER AND PAYBACK STUDENT LOANS"" like honestly nobody gives a fuck.

I deliver food for a laid-back family restaurant, i can be at home until i get a text that there is a delivery cooking, only then do i have to go to the store. After I complete the delivery i can simply go back home and wait for another order. (Only exception is during busy hours, i just wait in my car)
So basically get paid to sit in my car, jam out, and be at home whenever they don't require my labor. On paper this is perfect. If I could just make my money this way it would be amazing. The downfall is none of this is taxed or verifiable income, it is all under the table. I make a lot of money thanks to this, easily enough to afford rent for a 1 BR apt in my area. But I simply cannot get one because under the eyes of the gov and landlords, i am completely unemployed.

I've tried a few jobs so far (retail mainly) and they make me want to kill myself. No lie, a ""real job"" makes me so fucking depressed. I've worked jobs like this since i was a teenager and im getting really down and wondering if ill ever be able to find something else that's as bearable as this. Does anyone have any suggestions of what I can look for? Something i can do part time that has a low barrier of entry. As of now I've been looking for mainly call center/desk jobs since that doesn't really bother me.",False,inbkdh,glassneighborhood22,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/inbkdh/my_situation/,0,1
1077,I‚Äôm as close as I‚Äôll ever get to not working. Here‚Äôs how I did it.,"1. Went to school for a bachelor computer science 

2. Perfected my craft, focused on my favourite tech stack to the point where I‚Äôm not constantly googling things. Spent 3 years as a software developer for a big company while doing this.

3. Got a remote, part time, Software Developer II job. It‚Äôs 25hrs a week @45$ an hour. I just open slack around 9AM, fuck around or go back to sleep until 1PMish, work from 1PM to 2:30PMish. Call it a day.

I call it a reverse job, because living my life and hanging out/relaxing is my primary occupation and I just work when most people take a lunch break.

I deliver more than other similar devs so no one calls me out or has ever suspected anything.

It pays enough for my wife and I to live a modest life, houses around me cost 100-250k (Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada) so If I want one the option is there.

Just my 2 cents if anyone is looking for a realistic way to get out of the 9-5. Took me maybe 7 years total but now I just plan to coast in my pseudo retirement as long as I can.",False,inbjny,thePatientDev,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/inbjny/im_as_close_as_ill_ever_get_to_not_working_heres/,3,1

1084,Home Healthcare: Caring about the people you serve when your bosses don't care about you.,"Warning: Rant. If you don't work in this industry, this might come off a little intense. Sorry. I'm just pissed.

I work home healthcare. We cook, clean, take people on appointments, speak to families, speak to doctors, speak to nurses, we lift people, we use equipment, we give medication (including narcotics), and are expected to know the cause and location of every bruise on our clients bodies. When they die, we attend and arrange their funerals sometimes.

Our clients often cannot speak for themselves. The ones I've interacted with are kind, funny, and full of personality. There are other clients who sexually harass us or try to hurt us, but I personally view that as a failure of the system rather than them purposefully trying to make our lives harder (there are a few exceptions, lol). I care about every one of them greatly, even the ones who seemingly try to purposefully piss me off.

I make 25 cents above minimum wage state. My managers make 5 and 10 dollars above minimum wage, respectively.

And I feel evil for not doing my job perfectly because it's constantly held over our heads that we're neglecting them if we don't go above and beyond our duties. Our company doesn't fucking pay us enough to care for ourselves. People call out all the time because they're so fucking exhausted from this job. I don't, because it's been drilled into my thick skull that I need to help the people we serve even if I'm hurting myself in the process.

But it's not just me. It's the fucking system that thinks paying people like me and my coworkers to work 14 HOUR SHIFTS doing this job. I love the individuals I work with, period. And I will not be guilt tripped into thinking relaxing when I can at the job when EVERYTHING IS DONE is fucking neglect!!",False,ipm5vo,TA_mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ipm5vo/home_healthcare_caring_about_the_people_you_serve/,6,1

1104,How do I confront my boss about micromanaging?,"Hi there, new to Reddit (this is my first post, actually). Since I (23F) graduated college last summer, I‚Äôve been working as a videographer/editor at a relatively small tech company for over a year now, but my position title has never changed from ‚Äúintern‚Äù (even though I have never received proper training and was not brought on via the internship program).

The funny thing about all of this is that I‚Äôm the only video person the company has ever had (despite having been around for decades and having locations all over the world), so I‚Äôve had to teach myself numerous programs, skills, etc to make up for all their video needs. For the past year, I‚Äôve been told that they were in talks of hiring me as a full-time or permanent employee, but every time they said they‚Äôd give me an answer they kept pushing it out and telling me things are really busy so it has to wait. My internship was supposed to only be 6 months long, but here we are.

I‚Äôm grateful to have a remote job right now, and for a long time I had a really supportive supervisor who advocated for me often. However, his position was cut at the beginning of the pandemic to save costs. My new supervisor cut my hours (I signed something that said I could work 20-40hrs a week and spent most of my first year working full-time, of course the document I signed regarding these specific hours or the email it was discussed in are nowhere to be found) and told me I‚Äôm actually a part time, temporary employee when she had HR check the system. I had to rope HR in myself because she initially claimed I do not get benefits at all even though I have been receiving partial benefits as a part of my contract this whole time. She also told me that there will never be a full-time or permanent video position at the company, despite what my past supervisor and one of the executives I work closely with led me to believe.

My new supervisor underestimates the amount of time projects will take and questions whether there is actually 20-25hrs of work for me almost every single week. She knows all the projects I‚Äôm working on as they are listed on a sheet we both frequently update. I feel like she is suspicious of how I spend my time at work, which is especially frustrating because I‚Äôve been busier than ever since my previous supervisor was laid off. Every day I feel like I have to prove that I‚Äôm doing the most, which is negatively affecting my mental (I have anxiety and depression, don‚Äôt we all?) and physical health (I don‚Äôt even take proper breaks for fear that my boss will think I‚Äôm slacking off, thankfully my partner is able to bring me water and meals). 

I‚Äôve developed a trustworthy reputation for my work at the company, so I‚Äôm just confused by all this. On top of that, my supervisor knows that I can barely support myself currently as it is (not that that changes anything). How should I word my concerns and frustrations to her, if at all? I‚Äôm not sure of any way to do this without sounding rude or like an ungrateful, disgruntled employee. Thank you for reading all of this, sorry if I sound naive.",False,ip2tti,Meryl_Strep_Throat,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ip2tti/how_do_i_confront_my_boss_about_micromanaging/,4,1

1106,"""Employee safety is our number one priority during this pandemic!.....Oh wait, our numbers are higher than we projected!? Fuck the employees!""","This is my company.  


When my state allowed non-essential manufacturing to start back up, my company was all about ""safety"" (they still pretend they are, but it's BS).  

They *projected* sales to be way down.  So in our manufacturing department, they said we only had to work four days a week.  Volunteer only.  Nobody had to come back mandatory until the late fall.  


But they didn't project that people were idiots in this country and would be ignoring the pandemic on a massive level and still buying and using our purely recreational item.  

All of a sudden, *everyone* got called back mandatory.  All of a sudden, four day a week was out the window.  Six days.  Mandatory.  Every week.  Sometimes seven day mandatory.  

No more lunch break.  Only a 15 minute in the first and last half.....purely for ""safety"" reasons.  Gotta limit people in the cafeteria, even though it's empty and everyone sits in their car.  Nothing to do with production and screwing us.  Just safety.....


Entire factory is filled with posters saying, ""If you feel ill you are not allowed to enter the building.  Contact your supervisor and stay home.""  

There must be one of those posters every 20 feet.  

Guess what happens to people who are out of sick days and call out?  

Written up.  No actual change in the attendance policy.  

Last Thursday and Friday I was vomiting and had diarrhea.  That's obviously ""feeling ill.""  Both are also Covid symptoms.  

Written up for it.  This has happened to many other employees since we've come back.  

We only get five sick days.  I had influenza in January, all five of my sick days went out the window.  

The STATE guidelines tell employers to encourage their employees to stay home when sick.  Our company guidelines do the same according to these posters.  

But how the fuck do you write employees up when they actually stay home?  


This fucking system is a joke.  


I'm working 6 days one week, 7 days the next.  Alternates back and forth weekly.  Been doing that since I came back to work in June.  

But two days out for actually being sick, doing what the company told me to do, and I'm written up.....


Don't get me wrong, the money is good.  So I can't leave.  Average income in my city is like 24k.  I make 60k.  


But this corporate bullshit is insane.  


The thing that really gets me is 90% of the employees are pissed off.  Moral is in the toilet.

1115,My boomer coworkers are more fake than people I went to high school with.,"I'm a white collar worker in my late 20s. To be honest I have learned to not let work things affect me. I don't stress, I don't put in a ton of energy, I just kind of do what I'm told and never strive to improve anything, as I see that as useless energy.

I have been told that I need to be more assertive about my work, but I honestly feel like fuck that. It's not like i'm underperforming so they can suck it. 

I do get really frustrated about my coworkers though. A few of my coworkers are annoying peacocks, and i think they have an actual 'need' to tell everyone about 'how busy they are' daily. It's so cringy to listen to. Anytime our boss is around, they start to talk in buzzwords all the time. It's legitametly patgetic to hear someone in their 50's or 60's lose all self respect and dignity trying so hard to impress a worthless manager half their age like that.

Today was annoying in particular because I was trying to work, and three people in the cubical next to me were talking about how ""we need to continue driving in the left hand lane"", meaning increase the amount of work we all do. So they are all jerking each other off with words talking about how much work they all do, then they start to talk about their actual commutes to work, then about how the roads need to be changed, looking up the roads on Google maps,  then talking about the cars they drive, then about podcasts, then about their kids' schools, and on and on and on for almost an hour. 

Like WTF? I honestly do the bare minimum, and I do not care one bit if they or anyone does the minimum as well, but to make an outrageous try hard show about how much work they all do, all agree that we as a company need to do more so they can act like they care, then waste an hour doing nothing at all, loudly, is the most childish, pathetic, boomer behavior.

1117,I [20f] have no idea what to do - fucking hate this.,"I'm 20-years-old. I was perpetually told by school that the only way to increase my prospects was to pursue university. Is going to university even worth it when I'm not sure as to what I want to do? I read a statistic a few days back saying that 48% of graduates struggled to find work after graduating. That, and your degree is essentially worthless if it's obsolete/not in demand. 

I've already wasted a Gap year due to mental illness (suspected agoraphobia - oops) and am embarking on another (at this point I think it's just called 'life') after having suffered a breakdown/suicidal thoughts upon putting in a second application (because I'm stupid and felt pressured by society to re-apply). It's either university or full-time minimum wage work. Apprenticeships are mostly offered to 16-18 year olds. I doubt I'll be allowed to pursue another course at the local college - 20 and living with parents, currently unemployed so I'm not paying rent (that fucking sucks - knowing you're a burden on your family).

So far my prospects consist of: warehouse operative, retail, office/admin work, cleaner - of which even then are challenging at times to get into. But then again I've heard plenty of stories of people going to uni, accumulating ¬£50,000 worth of debt for a 3/4 year course and landing a bar tending job.

1120,I‚Äôm tired of working as a NURSE rant,"I had been working as an RN since I was 21. I graduated Nursing School at around 20. To be completely honest, I had no choice of whatever profession I can take since it‚Äôs either be medical or go to law or accountancy. And my Asian parents were just pushing me to earn money fast even when I was barely an adult. Honestly having Asian parents suck, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. Such a toxic ‚Äòyou have to be better than Mr. B‚Äôs daughters‚Äô and ‚Äòpride over stupid material things and status culture. Probably one of the main reasons why I hated working in the first place. 

I moved alone and lived in Brighton for a bit and met friends there and a lot of them folks my age, are just living their lives the way they want to. (Although some of them have illegal part time jobs) They were still HAPPY and do not give any fcks about whatever people think of em.

For a while though, it felt like I was hanging out with losers cause the more I spend time with them the more I realised these people have no direction in life. Leeching off the system. Pretending to be disabled and putting each other as their designated carers or whatever to get free housing and benefits.

I hate working but I don‚Äôt want to be a fcking parasite.

I also lived in London and every single day when you take a commute in the morning, I swear you‚Äôre in a train full of dead zombies. It made me so depressed. And the busyness of it all made me anxiety worse. Hence why I moved again and moved back to the countryside.

After moving for the nth time and not enjoying the nth hospital / company I applied to. Not enjoying the toxic medical environment, not enjoying the commute. Not feeling any satisfaction or any gratefulness of ‚Äòhelping people‚Äô. Isn‚Äôt my job supposed to be rewarding? 
It is for a tiny bit then again is it worth giving all of me, my time to people who won‚Äôt even remember my name the next day. Families who won‚Äôt even remember the NURSE who did everything (run around, get the meds, inject the meds) to save their family member. They will remember Dr. Smith though.

COVID-19 happened and things got more shttier. 

No one has any idea how to handle things. Everything that we‚Äôve doing at the hospital before were all apparently non effective and could not protect us from this disease. 

They change the policies every single day and I‚Äôm not even sure if it‚Äôs to PROTECT us, the public or their pockets.

Beginning of last week, they told us not to use excessive PPE anymore because Public Health England says so. And using minimal PPE is enough.

All of this nightmare, is getting to me. I‚Äôve been working so much over the last few months.

I‚Äôve been working 50+ hours and even weekends.

Last Wednesday, my alarm didn‚Äôt go off because my phone didn‚Äôt charged and it was dead.

I was so anxious and didn‚Äôt know what to do. I live about an hour away from work and will be super late if I even attempt to go.

I decided I would just lie and call off sick.

I couldn‚Äôt think of any excuse but say I have a fever and I told them that and then they all panicked cause I forgot it‚Äôs a COVID symptom and now I have to self isolate for 10 days, take a test and the whole shebang.

I took a test, obviously it‚Äôs negative. But my manager said I can come back to work if it‚Äôs negative and I feel better. 

I received my test yesterday and I still haven‚Äôt reported it to my manager yet cause I still don‚Äôt want to go back. 

I probably would let them know later and come back to work tomorrow. It would be months and months of overtime and not being able to sit down again. 

I hate it though. I‚Äôm glad I saw this thread. And know that I am not alone. I‚Äôm waiting for a few more months, save some money and do part time. But it might not actually happen as soon as I want to cause my bf is at risk of losing his job , we need to pay the rent and we have two cats we need to feed.

1125,Burnt out from an internship,"A few months ago I started an internship at a huge company. I'm obtaining a Masters degre and have a cummulative 1-2 years work experience, but all I could find were internships. The company is well-known to be a good employer.


I wake up at 6am to get to work before 8am, and usually leave work around 6-7pm, arriving home around 8pm, sometimes later (I could leave earlier but I refuse to take unpaid work home with me unless working from home).

I'm never thanked for my work, for which I earn slightly less than minimum wage, not including the 2hr daily commute. In fact, my coworkers all hate and constantly complain about eachother. Pretty sure I heard one of them complaining to my boss that they have to help me with things, and that i'm not doing enough (lmao) since I only work with said coworker on one of the 100 things I need to do, and it's physically impossible to give 110% at 100 things.

In the beginning it was great, I was still in training and hanging out with other interns all the time. But once training was done, I was expected to single-handedly maintain and expand code for a tool that's integral for our whole department, write important reports (that are reviewed by government agencies), organize the 1000s of physical and digital files we have, organize and oversee a project from conception to completion, and do the day-to-day. All at the same time, with little guidance.

I'm only a few months in and seriously considering quitting. That nukes my chances at ever getting an actual job at said company, but if I don't put the internship on my resume I should still be able to get other jobs.

I know some interns who do nothing all day. I know a lot more in the same boat as me. Managers treating them like full-time employees on deadlines with vital tasks and constantly under pressure. 

When tf did internships like this become the norm ? How do people live like this for 40+ years ?

At least now I know I never want to work in this sector.

1140,Employer stole $3176 in tips,"Employer stole $3176 in tips. The register was solely used for containing cash tips, and has been openly spent on ""supplies and wages,"" said the owners, down to $31. The credit card report shows $3176 in tips since I was hired.

Yesterday was my last day after working my full two weeks' notice. Why did I submit resignation two weeks ago? The verbal runaround regarding the tip pool distribution, a pool which grew each day in cash and cc form. Today I came in to collect my last pay.....they made me wait 45 minutes....They shorted my pay $100 last week. One of them sexually harassed me and another person, shoved a third hard enough to bruise him about two weeks ago. 

Back to the topic at hand: After initiating a final conversation about tip distribution and receiving a runaround again, I decided I had to take the $600 loss ($3176/5 employees) and move on with life. My coworker, half an hour into her shift, told them she quit and walked out as well.

However, since the lockdown the business is going down and we are all just seen as costs to cut so I couldn't stay in this job anymore.

Most of my colleagues confessed that they envy me, even my boss said that he envies me as he isn't even able to go on holiday this year. I feel bad for them as not everyone has a family they can go back to and/or the courage to quit their job without something lined up.

Investigators studied workplace stressors and health outcomes. Using meta-analysis of 228 studies they found that job insecurity increases the odds of reporting poor health by about 50%, high job demands raise the odds of having a diagnosed illness by 35%, and long work hours increase mortality by almost 20%.

The first comment about it made me sick and I've neither the time nor energy to listen to this guy anymore, as well as whatever other commenters want to stand up for corporate slavery. Apparently, we need to sacrifice the health and mental/emotional well being of American workers for, and I kid you not, ""American supremacy on the world stage"", and that the best thing for people is to ""do what their employers tell them"".

We all love to think that we'd be the enlightened ones if we lived in the barbaric past, but can we all agree that had this commenter been born two centuries ago, that he'd be the most passionate advocate for slavery? Chattel slavery, I mean.

1156,What do you think realistic UBI based on current technology and circumstances look like?,"Curious to see what you guys think of this.

As we advance technologically automation affects more and more industries. We‚Äôve already seen lots of cashiers be replaced by self checkout tools and certain warehouse employees be replaced by warehouse automation, over the next couple of decades we‚Äôll see the logistical and travel industries change as self-driving vehicles become more abundant. Eventually this will affect every industry and the requirement for human labour will decrease massively. At that point all the human necessities will be met without the need of human labour and society can function even with mass unemployment. Unfortunately we‚Äôre not at this point yet.

It‚Äôs also worth noting that the system we‚Äôre in will never change completely, anyone thinking we‚Äôre going to go the route of ‚Äúoverthrowing the billionaires and sharing all wealth‚Äù is delusional, there will always be lower, middle and upper classes.

1173,"I had an epiphany last night that I could live basically the exact comfortable life I have right now for the rest of my life, without a single ambition to achieve any more than this, and no one could force me to do otherwise","I've been thinking a lot recently about the Heinrich B√∂ll story that everyone who's been on this subreddit for a while will recognize:

&gt;One day a fisherman was lying on a beautiful beach, with his fishing pole propped up in the sand and his solitary line cast out into the sparkling blue surf. He was enjoying the warmth of the afternoon sun and the prospect of catching a fish.  
&gt;  
&gt;About that time, a businessman came walking down the beach trying to relieve some of the stress of his workday. He noticed the fisherman sitting on the beach and decided to find out why this fisherman was fishing instead of working harder to make a living for himself and his family. ‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt going to catch many fish that way,‚Äù said the businessman. ‚ÄúYou should be working rather than lying on the beach!‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;The fisherman looked up at the businessman, smiled and replied, ‚ÄúAnd what will my reward be?‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúWell, you can get bigger nets and catch more fish!‚Äù was the businessman‚Äôs answer.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúAnd then what will my reward be?‚Äù asked the fisherman, still smiling.  
&gt;  
&gt;The businessman replied, ‚ÄúYou will make money and you‚Äôll be able to buy a boat, which will then result in larger catches of fish!‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúAnd then what will my reward be?‚Äù asked the fisherman again.  
&gt;  
&gt;The businessman was beginning to get a little irritated with the fisherman‚Äôs questions. ‚ÄúYou can buy a bigger boat, and hire some people to work for you!‚Äù he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúAnd then what will my reward be?‚Äù repeated the fisherman.  
&gt;  
&gt;The businessman was getting angry. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you understand? You can build up a fleet of fishing boats, sail all over the world, and let all your employees catch fish for you!‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Once again the fisherman asked, ‚ÄúAnd then what will my reward be?‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;The businessman was red with rage and shouted at the fisherman, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you understand that you can become so rich that you will never have to work for your living again! You can spend all the rest of your days sitting on this beach, looking at the sunset. You won‚Äôt have a care in the world!‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;The fisherman, still smiling, looked up and said, ‚ÄúAnd what do you think I‚Äôm doing right now?‚Äù

My fianc√©e and I have been house hunting recently, and my brain has been constantly spinning the same gears that they've been programmed to: I can ""only"" be comfortable, feel secure, be satisfied, enjoy my hobbies, feel like my dog has enough room to run around, etc. if I buy a bigger/nicer house. It's ""not good enough"" for me to stay at the same job I have now, even though it's tremendously easy, decently-paying work that I don't have to carry with me outside of working hours or respond to any late-night emails or texts from the boss.

It just really struck me hard last night that she and I have had fun hanging out together in our quarantine-ish bubble almost every night for months now without other distractions getting in the way very much, and even though I'm programmed to want more than this, the whole goal of life should be to get to the exact point that I'm at right now, where I get to spend my day in my comfortable house with the dog I adore, working a job that doesn't require an exceptional amount of me, and my night hanging out and having fun with the person I love the most. (Of course, having all of this and *no* job is the true ideal, but if that life were attainable, there wouldn't be a need for this subreddit.)

And when I started thinking about the fact that what I have right now feels really good and comfortable and fun, my head really started unwinding when I started considering the fact that I literally could choose to live this exact life for the rest of my days, and there's nothing that requires me to move up, work harder, look for a better-paying job, get another degree, constantly have projects that I obligate myself to, have a side-hustle, work out, have kids, buy a new car, or anything else at all. If I wanted to use my same couches, my same bed, my same TV, all until they literally fall apart, that's my prerogative. If I decided to never apply for another job or seek to move up the financial ladder in any way, I could do that. We could just go on renting this same house forever if we chose to.

All of this is obvious, but it struck me as profound, because the need to move up in the world has been constantly embedded as something that I'm *required* to do. I've always been a Type A personality. I have the ability and energy to work harder to make more money than I'm making now. And knowing that, it always seemed mandatory that I should work harder, get that side hustle, monetize my hobbies, invest my money in the hopes of making money. And it usually makes me feel guilty when I'm not working hard enough to achieve those ends, because that feeling of ""you *can* work harder, so you *should* work harder"" has always been deeply ingrained.

1176,The corporate elite says they can't pay workers a living wage or they'll go under. Is this bullshit?,"**Note**: Mods, let me know if this is not the right place for something like this and I'll gladly remove it. Also, please let me know if I made any mistakes on crunching the data and I'll promptly fix those.  


As protests increase in size in the street and millions of Americans face evictions amidst the coronavirus pandemic, we see corporations getting richer and richer. Most Americans live paycheck to paycheck and several of them must hold more than one job to just make ends meet. On the other side, corporations claim that increasing the minimum wage and paying workers a living wage would cause their business to collapse.

This is sheer horseshit. Matter of fact, there is a simple way in which we can analyze what companies do with the money they don't need to run the business. 

Simply, we'll look at dividends and stock buybacks. **We can take this money from the rich shareholders and give it to the workers without any damage to business operations.** But first, let's talk about what the fuck are dividends and buybacks and why you should care.  


Let's think of a corporation as if it was a person (*privileged enough to make ends meet in this example, which is not the case for a lot of people*), for the sake of argument. Sadly, in this dystopian system, people have mandatory expenses, like rent, food and debt costs. If you don't pay those, you'll go homeless, go to jail or starve. However, if you're lucky enough, you may have some spare cash in the end of the month. You may choose to save it, spend it on a game on Steam or anything else you'd like to. **The key takeaway in here is that you already covered your needs, and you can spend this money on whatever you see fit.**   


We can look at corporations in the same way. After accounting for all costs that they need to stay running and invest on the future, they'll have some cash left in the bank. This cash can go to any place management wants to. Currently, corporations believe in maximizing shareholder value. Read as: *Giving money to rich people to make them richer*. In order to do so, they take this cash they have left and give them to those rich folks. In order to do so, they can use stock buybacks and dividends.   


Think of dividends as just walking down to the houses of your rich investors and giving them a briefcase of cash. Buybacks are a bit more complicated. Think of it under the optics of toilet paper in the beginning of the pandemic. In this case, let's assume your investors have a stockpile of toilet paper. We will then use all of our spare cash to buy toilet paper in mass from all of the Walmarts and Costcos in the country, so that they look like [**this**](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jkULApgUSBsblxQCeN2bFMwTV0c=/0x0:3000x1458/1200x800/filters:focal(1260x489:1740x969)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66494925/SHORTAGE_031320_1.0.jpg). Since there's not a lot of toilet paper around, your rich investors can charge much more for their stockpiles of TP, since people in the street desperately need to wipe their asses and will pay more to do so. In reality, buybacks do exactly the same thing, but to corporate shares instead of TP.  


So, since the business clearly doesn't need this cash, what if we just gave all this money to the workers?  
Now let's do a small thought experiment. 

Let's redistribute the money to workers. **If we redistributed every dollar going to the top 1% (from dividends and stock buybacks) by giving it to workers, how much extra money would you be able to make?**  


**Methodology:** We take the money spent on stock buybacks and redistribute those equally to all workers. So if a company spend 100$ in buybacks and it has 10 workers, each worker would receive 10$. Also, it's surprisingly hard to find free data on buybacks(I really wonder why....), so we'll be doing this analysis with numbers from 2018.   


**The data(**[click here for data](https://americansfortaxfairness.org/stock-buybacks/)**):**  
Cool, let's look at some companies and see how much money they've spent on those things. Current average worker pay is estimated from Glassdoor. I'm just throwing some examples in here. *If people have interest, I could look into making a simple webpage where you can go through all this data, since it takes some time to run those numbers.*  


**Home Depot:** 

* **Buyback amount:** Authorized for **22.5 billion dollars on stock buybacks** from 2017-2019. 
* **Number of employees:** 400,000
* **Current average worker pay:** 12.60/hour(\~$26,208 a year).
* **How much workers could make:** Workers would receive $55,000 in the years of 2017-2019, or $27,500 per year. Average worker salary would increase to **$51,500** per year.  If you make **$51,500** per year, your hourly salary would be **$26.41/h**.

&amp;#x200B;

**Starbucks:** 

* **Buyback amount:** Authorized for **5.93 billion dollars on stock buybacks** in 2018. 
* **Number of employees:** 291,000
* **Current average worker pay:** 11$/hour(\~$22,880 a year).
* **How much workers could make:** Workers would receive 20,378$ in the year of 2018. Average worker salary would increase to **$43,258** per year.  If you make **$43,258** per year, your hourly salary would be **$22.31/h**.

  


**Southwest Airlines:** 

* **Buyback amount:** Authorized for **4 billion dollars on stock buybacks** in 2018. 
* **Number of employees:** 61,118
* **Current average worker pay:** 20$/hour(\~$42,000 a year).
* **How much workers could make:** Workers would receive 65,447$ in the year of 2018. Average worker salary would increase to **$107,447** per year.  If you make **$107,447**per year, your hourly salary would be **$57/h**.

  
**Conclusion**

This is just the tip of the iceberg, as we're looking at a limited amount of data and not even accounting for dividends and other things. But I hope that this data helps to shed light on how much wealth is being directly stolen from the working class and redistributed to the wealthy.",False,imr6k9,notagan,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/imr6k9/the_corporate_elite_says_they_cant_pay_workers_a/,19,1

1191,Feudal Peasants Worked Less Than Modern Wage Slaves. I‚Äôll take the famine and disease tbh.,"The Great Debate
Why a medieval peasant got more
vacation time than you

By Lynn Stuart Paramore | August 29, 2013

000000

Life for the medieval peasant was certainly no
picnic. His life was showed by fear of

famine, disease and bursts of warfare. His diet
and personal hygienic left much to be desired.

 
 
  

But despite his reputation as a miserable

wretch, you might envy him one thing: his
vacation.

Flowing and harvesting were backbreaking
toil, but the peasant enjoyed anywhere from eight weeks to half the year off. The Church,
mindful of how to keep a population from repelling, enforced frequent mandatory holidays.
Wedding, wakes and births might mean a week off puffing ale to celebrate, and when
wandering smugglers or sporting events came to town, the peasant expected time off for
entertainment. There were labor-free Sundays, and when the plowing and harvesting
seasons were over, the peasant got time to rest, too. In fact, economist Juliet For found that
during periods of particularly high wages, such as with-century England, peasants might put
into more than 150 days a year.

Is for the modern American worker? After a year on the job, she gets an average of eight
vacation days annually.

It wasn‚Äôt supposed to turn out this way: John Raynaud Eyes, one of the founders of
modern economics, made a famous prediction that by 2030, advanced societies would be
wealthy enough that leisure time, rather than work, would characterize national lifestyle. To
far, that forecast is not looking good.

That happened? Some cite the victory of the modern eight-hour a day, 40-hour workweek
over the punishing 70 or 80 hours a with century worker spent toiling as proof that we're
moving in the right direction. But Americans have long since kissed the 40-hour workweek
goodby, and For‚Äôs examination of work patterns reveals that the 19'"" century was an
aberration in the history of human labor. When workers fought for the eight-hour worldly,
they weren't trying to get something radical and new, but rather to restore what their
ancestors had enjoyed before industrial capitalists and the electric lightbulb came on the
scene. To back 200, 300 or 400 years and you find that most people did not work very long
hours at all. In addition to relaxing during long holidays, the medieval peasant took his sweet
time eating meals, and the day often included time for an afternoon ooze. ‚ÄúThe temps of
life was slow, even leisurely; the pace of work relaxed,‚Äù notes For. ‚ÄúOur ancestors may not
have been rich, but they had an abundance of leisure.‚Äù

Last-forward to the 21¬∞ century, and the U.S. is the only advanced country with no national
vacation policy whatsoever. Any American workers must keep on working through public
holidays, and vacation days often go unused. Even when we finally carve out a holiday, many
of us answer email and ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù whether we're camping with the kiss or trying to kick back
on the beach.

I won't get into personal details but I'm luckier than most but far from retirement and currently can't stand working 40 hours. But it seems there are no decent paying part-time jobs, and obviously not having an income isn't an option. True change will hopefully happen over time with a Universal Basic Income, but what can we do now? I'd love to somehow find joy in my work, even if that means a career change, but I worry I'll just end up hating whatever I switch to and will end up making less money than I do now.

1. How do we work less hours now while maintaining a livable income?
2. How do we work limited hours while retaining affordable/usable healthcare in the US?
3. How do we find something we're not unhappy doing?

Sorry to come with only questions and no answers, I've been searching for a while to no avail. Maybe I'm just lazy, as I don't do much with my  free time but I just feel so drained after work.

I graduated from university in July with an honours in psychology and it‚Äôs extremely hard to find a job despite having the experience of small jobs but it‚Äôs not enough. I can‚Äôt even get a receptionist‚Äôs job!! 

My parents keep forcing me to get a job because I‚Äôve been home for almost two months. It‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt want to and I‚Äôm not trying really really hard to do so it just hurts me so much when they talk about me not being able to get a job like it‚Äôs my problem that the economy in shambles. I expected my parents to understand since people from their company have been kicked out as well and their friends are having a difficult time too but they just continue to yell at me everyday making me feel like shit.

It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm not trying to do things, I have an astrology business, i write poetry, read a lot and try to learn things everyday. My mom was using my laptop for the past 3-4 months hence I really couldn‚Äôt use it at all. I couldn‚Äôt even give my final exams using my laptop because she wouldn‚Äôt give it to me!!!!

They also keep pressuring me to start a Youtube channel or an online business despite knowing that I‚Äôm an introvert and that it takes a lot of time and money to own a business (like i said, I‚Äôm already doing good with my astrology).

I am saving every penny in order to flee somewhere cheap such as South East Asia or East Europe. If needed, I can do some remote programming and I think I will manage to earn 1000$ a month without working my ass off.

I don't have a girlfriend, family to take care of. I am absolutely alone in this world (or maybe free).

What if instead of working to earn things, why don‚Äôt we just work to help everyone so everyone can have everything they need? 

If your society has access to free healthcare, free food, free housing, free public transportation, free college, free everything and your only responsibility is to give back to the community doing what you want/love. 

Be a scientist? Go to school and start your real life research. 

Be a doctor? Go to school and go work at a hospital.

And let‚Äôs say all the jobs at the top are taken (doctors, scientists, etc) and all that‚Äôs left is janitorial, food service, etc. Who cares? You already got everything you need. Why not just help out everyone else because they give you everything for free as well. I‚Äôd fucking love work. I would actually feel like I‚Äôm part of something while having all my needs met. This would theoretically create world peace forever. 

You don‚Äôt get paid. You don‚Äôt owe taxes. Everything you need is free, and the playing field is leveled and accessible to everyone.

I know this is impossible because people suck, but to be honest it‚Äôs the only way humans and any other civilization could achieve utopia.

If people are expecting super intelligent AI to solve humanities problems then I feel like we‚Äôre in for a world of hurt. All of our problems are so simple to solve.

1267,Infecting My Coworkers Is A Career Advancement Requirement,"I've gotten sick a few times this year, and most recently my doctor wanted me to get tested for covid-19. Naturally this has meant staying home from work, and in this most recent case, my employer barred my return until I produced a negative covid test result. As all the testing sites near me were booked full for three days, and results took three days to come in, I ended up missing 4 days of work.

On returning, I received a quarterly review (meets expectations), but my supervisor (good guy, reasonable, just conveying company policy) informed me that I've missed a lot of days this year, and if I'm absent more than 1 more time, I'll probably be looking at a ""needs improvement."" He says it's not fair to those who have worked every day to be assessed as equal to someone who's not been present to do as much work. I didn't share that I felt it unfair to judge anyone based on things beyond their control - what's the point of arguing?

So, I'm now in a difficult situation where if I get sick again, I'll have to bring that illness in to work with me. I've been put against a wall, and my choices are jeopardize my own career development or potentially infect my coworkers. Unfortunately for them, I'll be looking out for #1.

1283,My old boss who refused to give me a raise quit because he wasnt given a raise,"I dont even have structure it just makes me laugh.

My last job was - lets just say a retail spot that specifies in guitars but also sold DJ and Livesound equipment. 

I was the livesound, lighting, DJ equipment salesman. I was very good at what i did. I sold quality equipment with 5-year protection plans to easily 60% of my customers. I was so good at my job that literally after 3 years of being there, i watched my sales go down because the people with quality equipment on 5 year protection plans didnt need to come back. 

So i asked for a raise because i also clean, maintain, rewire, and generally bust my ass to a sweat on a daily basis. I used my incredible sales numbers from year 1-2 as a basis of my performance, however since my sales dipped because my regulars had quality equipment, i was showing a decline for the year.

3 years in, no raise. Not even a god damn cost of living adjustment. So i quit. No 2 weeks. Fuck them entirely. I gave them 3 years and i obviously was so replaceable that they didnt deserve 2 weeks. 

Fast forward to the pandemic. My boss was given a raise in January to a salary that put him just over the overtime compensation level for my state. They made him work 7 days a week and when he asked for a raise they said he didnt deserve it and that he should ""do his part"" and show his ""passion for the company in these trying times""

So he quit. No 2 weeks. He already gave them 8 years, they didnt deserve 2 weeks. Fuck them entirely.

I would love to say i had a gamer moment where we got drunk and talked shit about the company but realistically, him and I are 2 people who dont like each other because we were treated the same way by our superiors.

1296,Rant about my own stupid decisions and an awful call centre job,"September 2019 I finished a masters in Developmental Psych. At the time I was working part time in an off-price retail store. The money wasn‚Äôt great but the hours were flexible around my uni schedule and I didn‚Äôt mind the work. I already had in mind that I wanted to do a PhD so before I quit the store, I did the bulk of writing out a huge proposal on my days off. 

I decided that the retail job has nothing more to offer me, so I decide I just want a temporary full time job (not working weekends for once) doing something easier, to earn some cash to pay some debts off, then maybe work on my PhD applications a little more, maybe do some travelling. 

I find a job in a call centre. It‚Äôs temp to perm, so not quite what I had in mind but the recruiter tells me, just do the 12 weeks and if you don‚Äôt want to stay on permanently, you can leave. 

Then COVID happened. I‚Äôve been there for 7 months. I know I should be lucky that I had a job over lockdown but it‚Äôs hard to be pleased about such an awful job. 

I still haven‚Äôt been made a permanent member of staff. If I‚Äôm a minute late logging into my computer, I get a late form and have to make it up at lunch. Every day we get emails reprimanding is for something or other, like we‚Äôre in school. The clients that we work for at the call centre are extremely unethical, scamming confused old ladies. They‚Äôve been understaffed for a long time so the work load has been insane. We are VERY closely monitored. I just hate my life being so controlled and micromanaged. 

I mentally checked out of the job a long time ago. I‚Äôve been on sick leave for 3 weeks now and I‚Äôm due to go back in on Monday and I‚Äôm terrified. The thought of the job makes me sick to my stomach. I‚Äôve tried applying for jobs and also getting back into my PhD applications, but I‚Äôve been stressing about finding a job ASAP before my leave was over, so it‚Äôs made things even worse. Once I‚Äôm back, it will be impossible to apply for new jobs or a PhD course as both are essentially full time jobs, and I‚Äôll never get the time off to go for interviews. 

I love being in education and focusing on my own projects. I HATE this super controlled 9-5 life. 

I live with my parents so I won‚Äôt be homeless or foodless if I leave and my parents agree that I should quit if I need to. My mother actually worked at this company years ago, and had to quit due to the strain on her mental health, so they understand completely. However, the idea of having no income scares me to bits. I have a little bit of money to cover my bills but not much. I‚Äôm planning on going back next week, handing my notice in on Friday and working my notice so I can at least have two weeks extra plus my holiday hours to add to my funds. 

I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve gotten myself into this mess and I don‚Äôt know how to get out. I should never have left my retail job. I am also having a quarter life crisis, I‚Äôm 25 and nowhere near my goals. I hate that my entire life has to focus around working and earning money.

Many of you want to see world peace and less chaos, but the only way to make your dream come true is you must listen to me the world savior, if not then that would never happen unless you are immortal beings who have little interested in mortal human life.  
 

**There are many type of war conflicts going on Earth in 2020, but mostly only 4 types:**  
 **Tier 1:** Religious War.  
 **Tier 2:** Countries Nations War.  
 **Tier 3:** Ideology groups about how to run the social life system such as Capitalism vs Socialism, Climate Change Global Warming, Vegan vs Non-Vegan, Black people vs White people, this that, etc.  
 **Tier 4:** Between people about what is correct or wrong, good or bad, etc. about certain events like a sport match, a scandal, a movie, etc.  
 

For me the World Savior, all of them are very easily to resolved.  
 And the corona virus NCOV COVID is a golden opportunity to end the religious war, and tell people the true purpose of religions was for studying, education.  
 

All what you need to do is 1 national government contact me to receive the perfect formula cure which is a set of many religions teaching will make body better off.  
 

\- **Do the Kosher Food in Judaism good for general people, and better than the rest?**  
 Yes, it does.  
 \- **Do eating like Ramadan event in Islam good for human body?**  
 Yes,it does.  
 \- **Do cutting all hair like a monk in Buddhism increase your intelligent and overall health?**  
 Yes, it does.

If you can resolve the most difficult one the religious war, thus unify all religions, then all kind of national war, groups war are easily to be resolved !!!  
 

Many of you may have different ideologies about many other subjects, but if you want to do anything, you must first unify the people through religions. And the best way now is get behind me The Legendary Savior, you have nothing to lose, all I need is just one announcement from 1 national government !

a product grown with love and care: **hand** picked, fermented, washed, fermented,dried, milled, tested, packaged and weighed, shipped across the ocean in containers, tested again, packed onto trucks and sent across the country, hand roasted, then dated, hand packed, hand shipped-

only for them to fucking open it, try it, dump 5 pounds of this brown gold into the GARBAGE to rot...*and then demand we send them another bag*.

And tell me that it's not good enough....Please don't respond with return policy advice.  I'm not paid enough to come up with that nor do I have any interest in having that discussion/reading that comment so you can save yourself the trouble.

1315,I really don't like working for a company,"I started working as a front-end developer in October of 2018.
the first company I worked for payed good but the environment was very toxic and it was far away from our home, also they did work for an organisation that I always felt ashamed for working for them and didn't want to work for that company. but the pay was good with flexible hour. after the pandemic started they told us to work remotely for a couple of months and it was awful for me. I struggled concentrating or even being motivated to work so I told myself ""that's it. I have to change my workplace."" I started sending my resume and I got interviewed for a very big company and I got hired. this company has good environment but the pay is not good. when I started we had to go to work eveyday but again the pandemic got worse and they told us to work remotely on Saturdays, Mondays and Wednesdays. but in Sundays and Tuesdays we go to work. I realized I'm very bad at remote work. when I'm at home I don't want to work. due to economic problems in my country the dollar's worth got very high and now if my hourly salary is equal to less than 2 dollars. it's awful for a developer. I need to buy an external harddrive and that costs half of my monthly salary. I don't know with these prices how married people with kids live and can afford buying stuff.

I also realized I don't like coding for a company. I like coding in general but when it comes to doing it for this job, I lose all my motivation and energy. there are lots of concepts I like to learn but I don't have time for extra learning at work and in my free time I'm very tired.

my contract is for three month because I'm a new employee and the first three month is for company to see if they are satisfied with my work and they really want me in the team. I always imagine them saying they don't want me and then with the cold seasons starting and obviously the Covid getting worse again in my country, I can spend the rest of the year at home and doing the things I like or maybe I can think of doing something that I enjoy and also getting paid for. but I don't have the guts to tell them myself that I don't want to work anymore. my inner critic always makes me feel bad about these decisions.

I don't know if I have the right to not wanting to work like this or I'm just a lazy spoiled person but that's how I feel about working for a company. I like to have freedom. I like to try new things but I always worry about money.

I don't know what to do...

Naturally to make it happen we, the employees, had to work like slaves. My boss even stated once that""there's no comfort when there's a crisis"". He was clearly getting psychotic in the web-meetings as he would keep scolding everyone despite everyone giving all they'd got (and they really were, as no one wanted to lose they're jobs during the pandemic).

So I worked three weeks with no days off, sometimes until quite late in the night, to make these projects work. Basically they already knew they were dismissing me by the end of the month so they just squeezed everything they could from me and then throw me away.

* If you worked at your job for more than 3 years, they must give you 3 weeks of paid vacation per year.

* If you have 2 weeks of vacation, you may request a 3rd week of unpaid vacation that can't be refused by your boss.

How are we expected to work 11 months in a row to take a vacation or 4/6 months to take a single week. That's burnout fuel right here.

And while looking this up, I found even worse.

* The employer has the privilege of setting the date of the vacation. (They must tell you 4 weeks in advance.)

Thankfully, none of the jobs I've had to far enforced this. Imagine trying to plan a trip or activity of more than 3 days with your SO, friends or family but Oh no, your vacations don't match! Better luck next year!

1336,Walked Out.,"  This is going to be a long one, sorry.

I mentioned in another post a few months back that I work in the retail department of a restaurant. Since the restaurant has reopened following lockdown, going there has been absolutely soul crushing.  People happily shopping with no masks on, making fun of us for wearing masks, leaning around the glass barriers at the registers without wearing masks to ""hear better""... in the last two weeks I have had no fewer than three people hand me something to scan, but not before rubbing it on their uncovered faces first. I cannot understand why. It's just beyond me at this point, truthfully.

In addition, people have been far more impatient and angry when they enter our store. Despite the dining room now being open, we still get the majority of sales through our to go option. In no way is our restaurant fast food related, but people have come to believe that everything on the menu should take a maximum of three minutes or less to be ordered, paid for and brought out. The restaurant is still operating on a skeleton crew to boot, which only makes people angrier when they find out that even though it's 5 PM on a Friday night,  there is only one person manning the to go station and doing everything themselves. Being a cashier, we get most of the anger taken out on us. The abuse has gotten worse and management has shown their true colors through all of this, though I always have my suspicions of anyone in a management position.  They are not even pretending to care about the employees anymore. Last week, my coworker and I were chewed out by management on the sales floor in front of customers just because the hostess had stepped away from the podium (I was working on a floor set and we had two cashiers already up there, I dont know why any of that was our fault but apparently it needed to be \*shrug\*).  

But two days ago, I had enough. I was supposed to be the closing cashier. Things were going pretty much the same as usual, but I have long stopped trying to be little miss sunshine on the clock. It takes all of my energy now not to just have a nervous breakdown. I think the issue of whether or not I am smiling behind my mask is irrelevant.  Anyway, by the middle of the shift, I was tired and fed up with serving people who had no patience or who thought it was funny to refuse to pay for their food unless I said ""please"" and no, I did not play along.  On top of this, my only coworker at the time was a girl who has only been there like a week and a half so, I was doing a bit of juggling.  As I'm in the middle of a transaction, new girl asks for my help. The customer I was ringing up conveniently decided to walk away from the register to keep shopping (yep) so I just left my register altogether and tried to help out my coworker.

The issue was over the correct amount of change she owed back a customer. Everyone who works in retail knows that no matter how long you've been there, if you have officially finished the transaction but the customer  retroactively hands you a random amount of additional cash, it can throw you way off. Such was the issue here, so I grabbed the calculator and tried not to panic so I wouldn't struggle to think clearly. The whole time this customer and his little gf are whispering and laughing to themselves and I end up messing up anyway. STILL LAUGHING QUITE HEARTILY, the man leans down toward me and tells me how much we owe him. I am panicked and exhausted so all I do is give him a deadpan look and turn back to the calculator. What he said to me next just made me completely snap. He raised his voice at me and in an attempt to I guess intimidate me said, ""DON'T YOU LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT, GIRL! IT'S NOT MY FAULT YOU CAN'T COUNT!""

And I was just done. I looked at him, said, ""nope"", took off my radio and threw it on the floor, grabbed my things from behind the counter and left just like that.  My only regret was leaving the new girl on her own, because that is not like me. But I can honestly say that it happened so fast it was like I wasn't in control of my legs, if that makes any sense.  When I got out, I messaged a coworker that they needed to get in touch with one of the managers there because the new girl was by herself and would need help. I know I should have handled that part better, but I was so tired of being humiliated and degraded by these people who don't even see workers as people.

I wish I could say I feel relieved to be out of there but I don't.  I feel drained and anxious because now it's back to the job hunt and the whole experience, as the people here know, is an existential nightmare.  The likelihood of my only being able to find employment in a situation exactly like the one I just left is overwhelmingly high, and I am back to wondering if being alive just for this is worth it. I'm not saying I'm suicidal, I'm just really, really tired and dreading every single second of the future.

I knew from a young age I hated the 9-5. I have always been an advocate for taking risk and trying new jobs in hope id enjoy it and I would become one step closer to becoming financially free. A buddy of mine was explaining to me how he worked 2 months that last year and made roughly 10k - 15k. The minute he said that my ears perked up and I immediately had questions. I asked him ‚Äúhow is that possible?‚Äù ‚ÄúThat sounds like a MLM scheme‚Äù  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe you‚Äù ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not possible‚Äù ‚Äúwhat is the catch‚Äù It was none of those things he was literally working a real job with a legit company and he showed me paystubs etc. I was completely shocked and completely geared towards finding out more. I did research online and found out that this was achievable and I immediately wanted to start. I found a great company that had been around for 19 years, family owned etc. I told my buddy I‚Äôm going to give it a shot. The company flew me out, payed for an apartment for me, trained me bought me all my tools needed to be successful. I didn‚Äôt invest 1 dime the whole time I worked, other than food and going out. My first 4 months working I made over 30k and I flew back home I was able to actually do things, I was able to get my own apartment, a dog. I was able to go out and eat and buy things for myself. I did what I wanted to do for 8 months straight. Not only that since I did well the company I work for flew me out to Hawaii for a weekend and sent me on a 7 day cruise to Mexico (pre COVID). Moving on to my second year working, I made a whopping 90k in 5 months. I worked longer so I can make more. One of my beat friends works with me, my girlfriend of six years works with me. It‚Äôs completely changed our lives and has been nothing but a blessing and an amazing experience and it‚Äôs just getting started. I know a lot of people are closed minded and aren‚Äôt open to taking risks and trying new things, and I know when people read this post they aren‚Äôt going to believe me &amp; will find an excuse in THEIR head to make themselves feel better about THEIR situation.

1342,"Willfully giving up years of your life is a sign of immaturity, not maturity.","Most people would say that becoming an adult is learning to be okay with giving up huge portions of your time to ""make a living."" They will argue that a person is immature if they are unwilling to give up their time in order to participate in Capitalist market. 

In my opinion they have it backwards. 

Not having the ability to recognize the importance of time is a sign of a immature mind. Time is integral in terms of the most important aspects of life. Spending time with loved ones, seeking wisdom, growing as physically and mentally healthy as we can. 

Giving up your time to do things against your will in exchange for things no human need be deprived of is not a healthy way to spend a life. This is one of the main reasons so many modern cultures are so unhealthy, physically and mentally. We are not allowed to live in a healthy way, and learning to accept this is not a position to be defended or looked up to.

1359,I quit!,"Last week I quit my high paying and very reputable job. Yesterday was my last day.  

Why? Because it was an absurdly toxic place to work and I don't want to work in a place like that.  Nothing really ever happened to me, I actually managed to get along with everyone, but I just cannot work in a place that fosters these behaviours.

My boss (the DG) was a psycho manipulative narcissist, lacking empathy but being extremely charming and only saying exactly what you want to hear. Of course, then he has his watch dogs do his dirty work, telling me what he knows I categorically disagree.   

Our workplace is only women, because he thinks he can control us better. His secretary is proud to work 12h a day and was giving me tips on how to do it (""just put some cold water on your face and you're good to go""). The women in charge of the legal stuff is clearly not well in her head, worked until she got burnt out last year and thinks all of us should as well. The women in charge of events is proud to have worked 4 days straight without sleeping last year and then having a stroke at 49 years old. The girl in charge of communication does not have the maturity to stand up for herself, so she gets abused daily, working infinite hours with huge pressure from him - of course, last year she worked so hard she reached a point where she could not speak, was completely apathetic, completely burned out. This girl is also clearly losing control of herself, as she just turned 26 and is obese and getting bigger.

The only ""normal"" person there is a girl with whom I got along very well, she has been there the longest and she has testified on court AGAINST the company, in a case that they have with her previous boss. Somehow, she is still sane and manages to block everything out.   

In my office I'm alone with 2 women who hate each other (and the DG, who only goes there sometimes), there had been screaming everyday and it has reached a point where one of them threw everything from the other's desk to the floor. 

So yeah, I'm out.  

I'm trying to get pregnant and I could not imagine having a pregnancy in an environment like that. Feeling stressed everyday, dealing with such a negative workplace everyday. What is better for my family? Having lots of money or a happy, stress-free mother/wife? My husband works and likes it (he opened his own company), we don't have any debt, we don't have any money issues, I have a good CV and, even immediately after quitting my job I have companies interested in me. We wont be homeless, we wont starve. I don't care about my status, telling people how important my job is, how I deal with such high level people. Everyday I was dealing with those people I understood our world is ruled by the worst people - because you need to have a certain type of manipulative and dishonest personality to get to the top, and the higher you are, the less empathy your have for the people below you. The good and smart people leave because they understand they cannot change it, the honest people refuse to contribute to everything that is wrong in our system. Maybe I'm not resilient enough to fight it, but I don't have the motivation to try any further. I rather be happy and let them kill each other and ruin the world.

I have no job from today on, even though I'm interviewing for a couple of companies. But I'm not going anywhere until I'm confident they are NORMAL people.

Or it is but I would sucknay it and the hit my career would take is too great. If I stick with what I am doing I have a chance at a decent ""middle class"" life in a few years. If I bail that's gone.  

But I remember what it was like, and it was awful. I hated it. I dreaded it every day for about 10 of the 12 years I was there. There was bullying, from students and teachers. And by bullying I mean violent assaults, which for some reason weren't treated as crimes, because nthe perpetrators are only kids right? Yeah well so was the victim. In fact usually the perpetrators were older kids, assaulting younger kids. One of the guys who beat the shit out of me ended up on ""Australia's most wanted"" after shooting a security guard during an armed robbery. So treating his assault on me as some kind of interpersonal fluff, rather than the brutal assault it was, didn't work in terms of keeping him out of the system. It did succeed in making me internalise the idea that it was ok for people to hit me and I probably kind of deserved it. 

That was the worst part, but only by a little. There was also just the constant forced social contact with people I would never have chosen to be around, learning to accommodate ntheir toxic disfunctions and superficial obsessions, since walking away was not an option. The constant endless crble for social status. The grinding, crushing, mind killing boredom was nearly as bad, and unrelenting, constant, endless, stretching on for years and years and never getting any better. 

The content of what I learned was sometimes interesting, and there was a real mental and personal development. But the format of learning was awful. Above and beyond the subject matter what schools teach is conformity, submission, obedience, groupthink. 

And this is what we do to childhood? The most wonderful magical period in a person's life, when new places, people, conversation freedom, play, imagination, are a source of immeasurable joy - and then we make kids spend it in this prison-like institutional setting.

I look at my kid, and his energy and imagination and compassion and sensitivity, and I am terrified of what they will do to that. I had to twist myself into this contorted shape to survive, and it took a long time to untwist myself, if I even have.

Hopefully he fares better than I did. Hopefully he is a bit more robust, a bit more popular, and the school and cohort he joins are a bit less awful than mine were.
