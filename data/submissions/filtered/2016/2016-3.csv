1,"""Work"" (xpost from r/SanctionedSuicide)",forced into life youre told its your duty to work for the privilege of living  to sustain an existence you had no part in making  youre expected to forfeit your time in a job that you hate to earn just enough to survive  to slave for pennies and save for a retirement youll never receive  and so goes the cycle of living to work and working to live  wake with the alarm and commute to your cage  endure 8 hours of tedium and stress frustration and fatigue asskissing and office politics  come home exhausted anesthetize yourself with tv then head off to bed to do it all again  work eat sleep repeat  like a broken record over and over again and again day in and day out  this is your life an absurd daily grind 8 hours a day 5 days a week  spend the weekends recuperating and doing the crap you couldnt do while you were working  cooking cleaning laundry maintenance of a miserable life  a morsel of pleasure may be found here and there  but time keeps score the clock ticks down  because the next thing you know youre back at your desk back in the bondage of work  with another weeks worth of shit to swallow,49zo5a
