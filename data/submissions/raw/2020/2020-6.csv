2,"[PA, USA] 3/4 rant, 1/4 advice: My restaurant is forcing a 30 hour weekly minimum or else you're terminated.","My state has recently entered the green phase, so the TGIChiliBees I work at reopened with less than half capacity. The GM is slowly bringing people back for dine-in, but has said that because the company received PPP money, servers must work a minimum of 30 hours per week (3 10-hour days minimum, regardless of business). No one has seen any real evidence that this is actually the case, rather it's likely corporate lying to us to ensure that the servers who work cannot file for partial benefits. I just think it's insane that I didn't even work that many hours before COVID, but I have to suck it up or I lose this shitty ass job, shitty ass health insurance, AND my UC benefits  (that PUA changed my life, man, I could pay for healthcare/medicine without worry and provide for my mom without a thought). 

So what? A quarter of the staff works for a mystery amount of money each day at the restaurant and the other 75% gets to keep collecting till it runs out? Why even act like it's a choice? If I decline your shitty offer of shitty work for shit money, I lose not only the PUA money that actually pays the bills, but I lose the job too. Why even pretend it's an option? Once I got that phone call, I knew I was fucked. No matter how busy the restaurant could possibly be, it will still pay less than UC. Let's not pretend anyone would choose to go back for less money dealing with cooped-up Karens and Kyles all day.

It just seems like a way to make sure employees can’t file for partial benefits. Basically my job is saying that even if it's a dead shift, you gotta stick around for no cash. Sales aren’t always high for dine-in right now, so I’m sure my coworkers would be able to file and receive partial unemployment if it weren’t for the 30 hours minimum bullshit. I know I'm beating a dead horse on this sub because everyone who posts here says the same, but this pandemic has clearly highlighted the fact that you have to choose between you and your family's health or your livelihood or *get fucked*. Two American freedoms: the freedom to work or the freedom to starve. I hope y'all stay safe, healthy, and fed.

3,Anybody got injured at work and now permanently disabled?,"It’s pathetic that I worked so hard at my last job (FedEx package handler) basically slave labor and ended fucking up my back up after having to work 6 day weeks for a month. I felt like the more I was there the more I couldn’t leave after putting up with it for over a year and now I realize I got used like I was nothing and now I have hardly nothing to show for it, well a mere $1100 left but that doesn’t matter to me I’d rather have a fully functioning fucking back again but obviously I’m probably fucked for life after already dealing with this for over a year now being disabled and can’t even get out the house now. Sure it’s my fault for picking up those boxes that lead me to hurting my back, but it wouldn’t have happened to begin with if I wasn’t constantly being told to work harder and harder and faster and faster. Now I’m living with severe backpain that’s pushing me to suicide. Seriously learn from my mistake and don’t push yourself when someone tells you to.

9,Its sad how people who get work get corrupted,"Just something I, unfortunately, had to observe twice now. I had two friends who claimed to hate work. They pretty much thought like anyone on this sub does. Both got work because they basically were forced to and both slowly developed into your usual wageslave. 

It started slowly. First they where complaining about how much they hate it. Then they started with ""Im only doing it for the money, I will quit this job as soon as I have enough"". A while later it went on to ""I kinda like it tbh, its nice to be needed and do your part for society"". Thats when you know its too late. Because both started to say shit like ""you should try to work at least part-time too, its cool to have more money"" and lowkey insulting me with ""its better than getting money for doing nothing"", which is a sure sign that they feel ""better"" than people who are unemployed. Its sad, really. Im still in touch with one of them and sometimes he says it sucks being a wageslave, yet he wont quit the job without any real reason. I guess he either says it because he thinks thats what I want to hear or he simply gave in and does what people expect him to do. It sucks either way to lose friends over petty shit like that. Its not like I mind people working, but stop insulting people who dont want to work.

It's the culture of my workplace, everyone in the warehouse constantly asks me why I'm still working 24 hour weeks and I'm sick of the shit. Ive found a lifestyle that doesn't require a lot, I'll be moving into a cheap cooperative living situation in a month, and won't have a car to pay for. I feel like ive succeeded in finding the lifestyle that I want to live and yet, I feel like shit. I feel absolutely worthless for not going full time, I'm wasting my free time before school starts when I could be making more money. Grinding 60 hour weeks to make more money. It's ludicrous and if I had any self respect whatsoever I wouldn't feel this way and yet, I'm stuck in this shame spiral of working part time, feeling shitty about it, not changing, feeling shittier. Not that I would be happy full time, I did it for a few weeks before going back to part. It's no different. Just less time to work on actually important things and a fatter minimum wage check.

But there are thousands of me and we’re here to kick your ass

You’ll think that you can burn us all before the clock strikes noon

Yes, you act as though the sun’s rays will not strike your skin too

Pity that you never thought that we could organize

Your hubris is apparent and it will be your demise


I’m sure that things would turn around if you would simply stop

But I guess your precious stock market portfolios would flop

Numbers on computer screens mean more to you than lives

You treat humans like cattle, so I guess I’m not surprised


Since the rise of agriculture society has been fucked

We could have gotten better if you all would suck it up

I could not spend half your money in twice my lifetime

Yet you pay all of your workers with rusty nickels and dimes


My mom always would tell me to bake my own goddamned bread

Someday a great earthquake will rattle all fifty states

China plates will fall and break like colonial mandates

Like a tacky Gucci bag, your reign is an eyesore

We’ll be glad to kick your racist asses right out of the door


I’d tell you we’ll be singing, but I’m sure there will be tears

I’d rather we rejoiced, but this will scar us all for years

Centuries from now if there are any humans left

They’ll name this period of time after your blatant theft


Historians will weep for all the precious years we lost

Playing all your shitty games no matter what the cost

Rainforests and children and black lives and crisp, clean air

Our whole planet will suffer because you can’t fucking share


So by all means keep thinking that you cannot be dispensed

26,Trying to find a job and feel like dying,"So I’m in grad school and disabled. My spouse had been doing odd jobs, and between that and me being a GA we have had enough to pay for expenses and tuition. However, my GA will be up at the end of the summer term.

I’m trying to find another position that will hopefully help comer tuition (I’m earning one masters degree but need to earn another due to the field I’m going into...basically it’s specialized and technical). My spouse has been liking for jobs but they are at risk due to childhood pneumonia. I’m at high risk due to several risk factors.

I hate these ads. “Amazon is hiring!” “You can find a job on Indeed!” What they don’t mention is that Amazon wants three years of experience to work there, and Indeed is rough with finding remote jobs.

SSA is being uncooperative, as one can imagine if you have ever tried to apply for disability.

Meanwhile, we are getting shamed for not finding employment by family. This college fund my mom payed into for my education...well they have agreed to cash it out, but there is right control to pay for rent and other expenses.

At least we know we won’t be homeless and we can pay tuition, but it’s still a bad situation.

Why is our worth tied to us having jobs? Why can’t the government pass UBI? What’s going to happen when I graduate?  What happens if they try to cancel Medicaid?

And the worst part is, we are in a relatively good situation.

29,I know this sounds dumb as fuck but I genuinely believe memes are the key to understanding how we can collectively 'hack' The System (and prove money is a lie),"We are a connected world, in 2020 more than ever. 

We are an absurd word, in 2020 more than ever.

Where are you reading this from? Probably very far from *here* and yet I'm *there*, in your mind *now*. The inescapable and global grasp of the *Internet* and our eternal engagement with it through the smartphone has been a pivotal (r)evolutionary shift in human history, one more significant than our discovery of fire, agriculture, steel, or the combustion engine. We have yet to scratch the surface of its potential and power, and the deeper implications of its existence and what that reveals about us - the Internet is the genesis of a global communal awakening and awareness of hidden connection.

The Internet and modern constantly connected culture has allowed us to act as a sort of rudimentary hive-mind. Our access to, and saturation of information, media, and communication is both **constant** *and* **instant** - it is now *possible* to share our thoughts with almost everybody there is - our friends and family, their friends and family, people we don't know and never will, people in another country, and people who may not even share the same language as us - a single sentence spat out into the ether can potentially reach billions of people on the planet in a matter of minutes.

You, me, and everybody else has a form of direct access to nearly every other human consciousness on this planet - what could we possibly use that for?

**Memes, of course.**

To crowdsource the question of 'what is *good*?', because that is what lies at the centre of all belief and action.

The fact that we have seemingly become ever more divisive and politically polarized is therefore not to be tutted at, wished away or met with calls for civility, but rather acknowledged as the *only way* in which an outcome - Truth - can be arrived at, copy itself, spread, and propagate to the point where its opposite seems wholly and utterly absurd.

Advocates for either a progressive or conservative approach to policy can not compromise *not* because the facts are in disagreement (although that is true), but because what comes **before** the facts is not agreed upon; that is, the way the world is structured and ordered, or **The Way The World Is**, which itself always acts as the background for an ideology rather than the reverse. The idiom *'seeing is believing'* is true backwards as well, perhaps even more convincingly -  **believing is seeing** and this is evident now more than ever.

I’m going to make some statements that are broad and general, but ones I feel are fairly common and often subconscious. These are not meant to be statements of  “fact"", only associations to get us to think about how we reach the conclusion of ""fact"".

*The relationship between progressivism and conservatism is like the relationship between masculine and feminine which is like the relationship between individual and community.*

Consider this disharmony between two opposing (or complementary)  principles as essentially the basis of all philosophical (and thus political) thought. Also consider opposing principles as really a **single thing** as opposites always exist only in relation to each other. This admittedly sounds a lot like some meaningless new-age woo, but I think most of us can and do recognize the basic and fundamental necessity of this tension between opposites.

We see what our minds project and what our contexts allow - we frame the world in the language we have at our disposal and what words *mean* is not something static and *in* the word itself, but something dynamic, unique to us specifically in the way we *relate* to that word.

Language has an implicit kind of magical quality - by that I mean much like an imagined casting of a spell, it is widely assumed that speaking the right words in the right combination (and order) can influence and compel people to act, and this action is the source of social change. This is why great orators have possessed great influence over the course of history - someone must be able to give *power* to an idea that can move masses to act as a single unified force of nature.

Language is itself inherently biased, limited, and divisive - **Black Lives Matter** means absolutely nothing until it is interpreted and language is always loaded with prejudice, even and perhaps especially when great care is taken to make sure it is not. There is always a fundamental aspect of loss from translating a feeling to a thought to any *thing* else, even when the path is as seemingly direct as from thought to speech. 

Have you ever known *exactly* what to say but been unable to get the words out properly in the moment? 

Have you ever written and rewritten something multiple times because the exact *feeling* you’re trying to capture just isn’t there? 

As much as language is the primary way we communicate, ironically it just as often obfuscates and confuses because the kind of language we have available to us directly determines how we understand and conceptualize the world (and ourselves). It is not a matter of merely being *Peterson-ianly* ""precise"" in our speech, because precision is meaningless if the principles that precede it are incompatible.

How many proponents of any ideology have *actually* read and engaged with its foundational or supporting texts? 

Probably very few.

How many have absorbed bits and pieces through their specific context - language, culture, family, friends, media, and digital memes?

Probably almost everybody.

You simply can't exist in 2020 and not intuitively just *know* what a meme is. Even those that exist totally cut-off from the online sphere would get the picture with some examples. Most typically we think of images like [this](https://imgur.com/Sc1nBL7), or [this](https://imgur.com/yW2QUqt), but these are just some examples of the modern, digital meme and don't begin to even scratch the surface of just *exactly* what a meme is and why the answer to that might be really fucking important.

For example, a picture doesn't need any text to be a meme. Similarly, a picture can be *only* text and still be a meme. A phrase can be a meme, or even [a single word](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/c/c3/D%27oh.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141226214635). A [sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_scream). [Symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_S#/media/File:%22Cool_S%22.svg). The structure of the building you're in and the design of the device you're reading this from are memetic artifacts. Musical subgenres, fashion and style trends, social patterns and institutions including family, marriage, property, law, crime and punishment - even complex ideologies - religious, political, and philosophical (all actually inseparable and arguably the same thing) - are essentially very nuanced and enduring memetic conversations that span hundreds and thousands of years.

Human behaviour is memetic - a product of pattern, repetition, and context rather than a series of conscious “choices"" we make at every moment - this is not to suggest we are totally bound and determined by fate, only that we are bound and determined to act in accordance with our own character - we are not *something* responsible for our decisions, we *are* our decisions, and for that we bear responsibility. 

Can you imagine Donald Trump acting like anything else besides a caricature of pure petulance?

That’s his role to play - his constitution. If it weren't he would be someone else, and here lies the crucial error that pervades all levels of society.

I think the belief that he, or you, or I ""make decisions"" is quite backwards - it’s partly a product of the language we use to speak about ourselves and the world - a confusion of the symbol with The Actual Thing - and partly just our basic instincts. It's plainly obvious that I am aware and can consider many possibilities and outcomes and think rather abstractly about present, past, and future, so it only seems to follow that I **must** exert some basic influence over the course of my life, but I think if we really examine that thought there’s no good reason to assume that’s true and necessarily follows. We might *feel* that it does, but perhaps that is a sign to be skeptical of our most basic assumptions.

I find little distinction between *Me* and *My Choices* - I **am** those choices, not a separate entity in the pilot's seat of my skull that ""chooses"" - that stands separate, considers, and then finally pulls the lever that corresponds with the **choice I’ve made.**

Those last three words are superfluous - to me they all reference a single thing - a localized *happening* from my specific perspective.

This idea is naturally unpalatable as it seems to absolve one of all responsibility, for both wrongdoing and ownership of good acts and artistic creations, but I think this is nothing more than a knee-jerk reaction to protect our sense of *I* as something distinct and in control, as to accept the opposite comes with a great and terrifying sense of powerlessness. This terror is multiplied further when coupled with the additional quality of randomness, and the ordinary and pervasive accepted fact of our free will  is an attempt to reconcile this powerlessness with our instinctive desire to be in control. Even when faced constantly with the reality of circumstance where one life is destroyed based not on any decision or choice it was able to make, but the simple act of existing at the wrong point in time and space and colliding with the wrong other does nothing to dissuade us of this familiar and comfortable illusion.

Responsibility is not something we *take*, it is what we **are** by sheer virtue of being.

Memes and the repetition of pattern connects us to something far greater than any single one of us - our *collective* human ideas about value, function, purpose, and their relation with each other - memes are a portal to the sum total of all human knowledge, experience, and feeling - memes are threads sewn into the fabric of the tapestry of reality, connecting us to the past, present, future, each other, and something totally separate - something unspeakable that yet demands to be spoken of - something that can be glimpsed only for a moment and reflected only as a fragment.

You may have felt it when engaged in something everyday and ordinary, yet struck as if for the very first time by the majesty and totality of all there is - all experience happening right now, billions of distinct and separate simultaneous *happenings* - connections - disconnected only by virtue of the limitations of our own collective conceptions of what is real, what is true, and what is possible.

What *is* possible?

It is possible then to understand **Humanity** not as an abstracted collection of billions of separate individuals, but as a single, *unique happening of organism/environment* that can act with that awareness of unity and underlying connection.

We currently insist on persisting in an ordering of society that enriches only a small handful that have fallen to the top through nothing other than circumstance and who insist this *must* be the natural ordering of the world simply because it is the current ordering of it. 

Can we really trust those who wield inordinate amounts of power to fairly consider how it might be meted out differently? Is the fate of society directly tied to the fate of the billionaire class, or to the current institutions of governance and policing?

We are meant to believe and accept that this is just **The Way the World Is**? 

As far as I see it, society bears little proof of functioning properly *anywhere* as long as we define ‘properly’ as for the common good of all people. If we instead understand ""properly"" as to the obscene and perverted benefit of a small few at the expense of everybody else, then it is functioning tremendously properly, and will only continue to do so until We put a stop to it.

From where is authority and power actually derived?

The primary source is our shared belief that these institutional structures are legitimate and just - and they are so long as we believe it. 

The secondary source is the ability and willingness of these structures to respond violently if we do not accept the first.

Violence is of course the most powerful and persuasive avenue of acquiring and maintaining power, both literal violent action and indirect violence inflicted and facilitated by a system of organization that regards the principle of one's right to hoard obscene amounts of wealth as higher and more just than an attempt to provide the basic material necessities of life for all people.

That is the basic moral principle that serves as the keystone of the structure of our society *as it is currently ordered*.

To preserve life violence may sometimes be necessary, but violence can be avoided memetically - you cannot put a bullet in a concept and it’s just as futile (and a bit if a moral grey area) to do the same to those who espouse, exemplify, or believe it. Violence can be lessened with the correct memetic foundations to underpin our collective conceptions of 'self', 'other', and 'world' and the reciprocal nature of those three things - violence is given power by distinction and separation, but that power can be neutered partly by understanding that not only are we ourself, we are also every other self, too.

Individualism is too often championed by those who don't understand the distinction between it and selfishness, and this error acts as the basic foundation for an entire wing of belief that insists ""value"" is directly related to money and money alone and *everything* can be spoken about in terms of its equivalent and assumed value in US dollars, one of many currencies that can in an instant become almost worthless due to nothing other than our shared confidence (or lack thereof) in it.

So, if memes are the true catalyst of human action and social change, can we then ""meme ourselves"" into a better reality? Can we, together, engineer, build, or construct a meme to spread and transform our shared, collective (un)conscious and the ideas that follow about not only what is true, *but what is possible*?

I think a good place to start is to understand the **illusory and mutable nature of money and wealth, their direct relationship with power, authority, and control and the distribution of these things**. Money is a real *thing* that performs a necessary *function*, but our shared understanding of it holds real power over its form, and in this way we can collectively shape and alter that power it commands over our lives through a collective psychic exercise.

We can't function without money, but we absolutely can function with a new way of distributing it in hopes of lessening (not eliminating) the amount of suffering directly related to poverty and the misery that flows from that.

Google, ""how many billionaires exist?"" - Answer: 2095.

**2095 problems.**

Let's look at just one.

Does Jeff Bezos really have billions of an actual, tangible currency, or is his currency really in the form of power and influence *as represented* by money?

Is the standard work-week from Monday to Friday or Monday to Thursday?
 
Whatever the answer, is it because this is simply *The Way the World Is*, or might *The Way the World Is* be directly shaped by our collective ideas about it?

Wars are no longer waged on an actual battlefield - our modern war is a psychic and spiritual one, set in the space of the collective human (un)conscious, and the targets of annihilation are not only people but possibilities - the target is **Truth**, and the creation of Truth As it Serves the Manufacturer - we are in an era of memetic warfare and unless we can understand that and figure out how to turn it against itself, the collective human spirit will be swallowed whole, outlived by the last piece of manufactured shit we can sell for a dollar.

*2095 problems and 1 crucial error* stands between us and a better society, and building that society is as simple as believing in and spreading the right memes.

We can meme ourselves better, but only together,

I work in marketing and I absolutely despise everything about it. About 6 months ago, I took a big loan for a very expensive copywriting course to become free from 9-5 and be able to become my own boss... but it turns out I hate marketing with every ounce of my soul. I got a ""decent"" job as chief of marketing operations but I shiver even thinking about spending one more day doing this shit... It was a big mistake.

But I can't quit or else we'll end up on the street or worse. My wife is unemployed (foreigner, can't find legal employment here yet) and we depend on my income, and I still have this debt to pay off.

Recently I've noticed that I started having very dark thoughts and generally just wishing to die... It's getting worse day by day. I barely force myself to do the necessary minimum at work guzzling coffee. My marriage suffered and I've decided to do something about it - but what the hell can I do?

I hate this marketing job and I've spent an entire day crying in the bathroom yesterday... But it pays my bills. I won't be alive for long if this continues though, that's for sure. 

My boss is a cunt and he shouts at his wife during company zoom calls and the work is extremely unenjoyable. I want to quit tomorrow but I have nothing else lined up - and all alternatives look equally bleak or worse. I wish I could one day make money from playing music but it seems like a utopic dream at this point. Any advice on how to survive&amp;escape this situation? I really need help:(

Dear MF,


Thank you for you interest in Michael Richards Orthodontics.  From your resume it looks like you have a great background and experience with x-ray technology and working with that in a medical environment.  I'm curious to know what has you looking for something different?


We have found that the easiest way to start the interview process is to begin with an initial phone call where we can both ask questions.  It saves so much time - especially when applicants are trying to juggle a current job.  Would you be available for a call on Monday or Tuesday?  If so, please let me know a couple of times that would work for you.


I look forward to a reply!

Have a great weekend,

Becky

Me:

Good morning,


I have only done diagnostic xray and am interested in the Monday- Thursday schedule listed. It is very important to me to work no more than 4 days a week for optimal work-life balance. That has been very hard to find, unfortunately. I am also licensed to do xray in Utah if that is a requirement.


To not waste your time, I expect at least $23/ hr, $25+/ hr is better. If this is a good fit, I am available early afternoons to speak on the phone at xxx-xxx-xxxx.


Best,


MF

How the fuck did we get to this point. I think I’d be a great fearless leader, but who do I even lead? To what? Our deaths? Everything about my existence is like antimatter to this shitty world. And tbh it seems society doesn’t even want a better life. It just wants to continue exploiting and raping everything around them until they and everything with them crashes down into a bottomless pit. 

Everyone keeps talking about a hell in the afterlife, but we already made hell on Earth, why the fuck are you scared of hell in the afterlife? I guess that’s part of the dna delusion and years of religious brainwashing.

Only thing that scares me is rebirth. I don’t want to believe that we’re all the same entity living every life simultaneously. Eternal oblivion is sad, but considering the alternative (what we have now) it’s a much better deal tbh.

54,I haven’t done any work in a week and despite trying to work my brain has completely shut down,"I’m working remote and have been for a while. I have to keep this vague since I’m pretty sure my coworkers are on to me and they also reddit lol. So I’m not sure when I shut down completely. Maybe Tuesday? I was going along well enough for a while. 

I think what really gets to me is the constant emails and messages checking on me. I’m in training at this job so I don’t really have my own work yet. I’m just learning at the moment. We also have daily reports on our “progress” which I find incredibly draining. 

I feel like there is a sky high expectation. I need a license to even be allowed to do my own work, which I do not have yet. Therefore, it’s not like I’m robbing the company of time by not getting my stuff done since there is nothing to be done until I pass my tests. I think that’s about 3 months away when I’m out of training. 

I guess I don’t really feel terrible about not working but I do feel scared I could lose my job. It would be really bad since I’m only 2-3 years into my career at 24, and I do not have a ton of savings yet. It would be a struggle for sure. 

I also feel kind of lazy and like I’m worthless for not being able to get myself to do anything. I made a serious effort the last 2 days and I got nowhere. I maybe did 1-3 hours of work at a slow place the last two days. I work slow since I’m still figuring it all out. 

I don’t really know what to do so I can get my productivity high enough to not compromise my job. Pretty soon my boss will start asking specific questions about the training projects I should’ve completed. Even though I do not like this job, I need it at least for now.

I tell her that such a task is easier said than done because nearly half of the USA has become unemployed from all the shit going on and job prospects are very minimal.

She tells me that the only thing stopping me from getting a job is my ''negative attitude'' and I would probably find a job if I was only more positive.

There are no words to describe just how much I despise people who act like my mother in this situation. Being positive cannot and will not change the current state of the American job market or anything for that matter but she doesn't understand that. She thinks I'm just not trying.

70,My experience of a four-day workweek,"I've been a long time visitor to this subreddit, and thought you all might be interested to hear what my short-term experience of working a four-day week has been. 

&amp;#x200B;

I applied to do a four-day-week when I started my current job, last year. My manager refused it, saying I was ""too useful"" to lose for a day a week (despite it being offered to me at interview). So, when my dept did nothing about social distancing measures etc. through COVID, I saw my chance and got HR to approve a condensation of my hours, about a month ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reaction to my move to a 4-day-week, from my colleagues, has been one of jealousy and general disaproval, I would say. My manager acted as if I were being given a huge gift, as he signed the form grudgingly, and another colleague asked ""if I was going to be doing this much longer,"" as if it were temporary. The trouble is, you see, I've taken on a lot of responsibilities that should be theirs, and by now being absent for a day a week, their shortcomings are plainer to see. I have not once been thanked for staying very late to get things done (in the hospital I work in) for the months before. There's certainly a distrust of me working these new hours, and as it's still new, I feel I'm having to ""prove"" that working these hours are effective to everybody.

&amp;#x200B;

From a working point of view, I am way more organised doing these hours: I supervise people (well, more orchestrate than supervise - I fight their side, not the manager's battles downwards) and so I can catch up on emails and calls before anybody else is even in, organise the work for the day and then spend my day helping others as opposed to chasing my own problems up. My ten-hour day feels a lot more effective than my 8-hour-days.

&amp;#x200B;

From a personal point a view, the ten hour days feel long. I work 7-5, with a rushed 30 min lunch break somewhere in the middle. I'm an early-riser anyway, so that early start isn't bad for me. My commute is 1 hour each way, so not having to do that on a Friday feels good, as is saving me fuel. On my work days, it really does feel like I get home, cook dinner, wash up and go to bed - those 4 days are a write-off.

&amp;#x200B;

But the three-days off, guys: OH! It's been fantastic. I spend my Friday recovering, as I used to on a Saturday: I get to visit more local shops &amp; markets at a leisurely pace, away from the weekend crowds. I get my chores done. My wind-down from work efficacy mode occurs, meaning by Saturday, the day is mine to do what I want. It's a mental freedom that I'd forgotten. I still get the Sunday Scaries, but now I have a day to truly enjoy my weekend. I hope that the four-day week is adopted, but that third day is variable for everybody, so they too can experience this. 

&amp;#x200B;

My advice is, if you can do this, or if you have to push to get this: do it. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL,DR: I've worked a 4-day-week for about a month now. My colleagues/manager are suspicious, but I'm more organised &amp; effective at work, and feel a lot more balanced in my personal life. Work writes off those 4 days, but lets you truly have ""personal time"".

93,Going back to work,"My company announced that they will make it voluntary for people to go back into the office in August.

Apparently some people expressed that they want to go back.

It just sucks that others have to ruin a good thing bc they just can’t work from home. I understand kids and other stressors May exist but I’m just worried I’ll feel pressured. Even though it’s voluntary, I just worry they’ll go against their word. Just like my company promoting work/life balance but judging me for actually using vacay time/traveling (pre covid).

95,Work: The Theft of Life," \[This is an excerpt taken from [The Network of Domination](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/wolfi-landstreicher-the-network-of-domination) by Wolfi Landstreicher\]

# Work

&gt;  *What is the bombing of a judge, the kidnapping of an industrialist,*   
  *the hanging of a politician, the shooting of a cop,*   
  *the looting of a supermarket, the burning of a commissioner’s office,*   
  *the stoning of a journalist,*   
  *the heckling of an intellectual, the thrashing of an artist,*   
  *in the face of the deadly alienation of our existence,*   
  *the much too early sound of the alarm clock,*   
  *the traffic jam on the expressway,*   
  *the goods for sale lined up on the shelves?*

The alarm clock disrupts your sleep again — as always, much too early.  You drag yourself from the warmth of your bed to the bathroom for a shower, a shave and a shit, then run down to the kitchen where you wash  down a pastry or, if you have the time, some toast and eggs with a cup of coffee. Then you rush out the door to battle traffic jams or crowds in the subway until you arrive... at work, where your day is spent in tasks not of your choosing, in compulsory association with others involved in related tasks, the primary aim of which is the continued reproduction of the social relationships that constrain you to survive in this manner. 

But this is not all. In compensation, you receive a wage, a sum of money that (after paying rent and bills) you must take out to shopping centers to buy food, clothes, various necessities and entertainment. Though this is considered your “free time” as opposed to “work time”, it too is compulsory activity that only secondarily guarantees your survival, its primary purpose again being to reproduce the current social order. And for most people, moments free of these constraints are fewer and fewer. 

According to the ruling ideology of this society, this existence is the result of a social contract between equals — equals before the law that is. The worker, it is said, contracts to sell her labor to the boss for a mutually agreed upon wage. But can a contract be considered free and equal when one side holds all the power? 

If we look at this contract more closely, it becomes clear that it is no contract at all, but the most extreme and violent extortion. This is currently exposed most blatantly at the margins of capitalist society where people who have lived for centuries (or, in some cases, millennia) on their own terms find their capacity to determine the conditions of their existence ripped away by the bulldozers, chainsaws, mining equipment and so on of the world’s rulers. But it is a process that has been going on for centuries, a process involving blatant, large-scale theft of land and life sanctioned and carried out by the ruling class. Bereft of the means for determining the conditions of their own existence, the exploited cannot be said, in honesty, to be contracting freely and equally with their exploiters. It is clearly a case of blackmail. 

And what are the terms of this blackmail? The exploited are forced to sell the time of their life to their exploiters in exchange for survival. And this is the real tragedy of work. The social order of work is based on the imposed opposition between life and survival. The question of how one will get by suppresses that of how one wants to live, and in time this all seems natural and one narrows one’s dreams and desires to the things that money can buy. 

However, the conditions of the world of work do not just apply to those with jobs. One can easily see how the unemployed searching for a job from fear of homelessness and hunger is caught up in the world of work.  But the same holds for the recipient of state aid whose survival depends  on the existence of the assistance bureaucracy... and even for those for whom the avoidance of getting a job has become such a priority that  one’s decisions come to center around scams, shoplifting, dumpster  diving — all the various ways to *get by* without a job. In other words, activities that could be fine means for supporting a life  project become ends in themselves, making mere survival one’s life  project. How, really, does his differ from a job? 

But what is the real basis of the power behind this extortion that is the world of work? Of course, there are laws and courts, police and military forces, fines and prisons, the fear of hunger and homelessness —  all very real and significant aspects of domination. But even the state’s force of arms can only succeed in carrying out its task because people submit. And here is the real basis of all domination — the submission of the slaves, their decision to accept the security of known misery and servitude rather than risk the unknown of freedom, their willingness to accept a guaranteed but colorless survival in exchange  for the possibility of truly living that offers no guarantees. 

So in order to put an end to one’s slavery, to move beyond the limits of merely getting by, it is necessary to make a decision to refuse to submit; it is necessary to begin to reappropriate one’s life here and now. Such a project inevitably places one in conflict with the entire social order of work; so the project of reappropriating one’s existence must also be the project of destroying work. To clarify, when I say  “work”, I do not mean the activity by which one creates the means of one’s existence (which ideally would never be separate from simply living) but rather a social relationship that transforms this activity into a sphere separate from one’s life and places it in the service of the ruling order so that the activity, in fact, ceases to have any direct relationship to the creation of one’s existence, but rather only maintains it in the realm of mere survival (at whatever level of consumption) through a series of mediations of which property, money and commodity exchange are among the most significant. This is the world we must destroy in the process of taking back our lives, and the necessity of this destruction makes the project of the reappropriation of our lives one with the projects of insurrection and social revolution.",False,hirsqs,onedayitwillbedaisy,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hirsqs/work_the_theft_of_life/,2,5

103,I don't know what to do anymore...,"I work a simple desk job since about 2 years. I chose this because of stable hours and because I was kinda burning out from my last job at a hostel, being a manager, I was too overwhelmed at 20 years to do that job, so I left.

Now time has passed and I work in a completely different field, I couldn't even describe what we as a company do, it simply doesn't matter to me.

My coworkers are significantly older than me and that's a big reason why they are so ""loyal"" to their job. They do over hours even if they don't get payed for them. Personally, I value my private life more than just a job, so I frankly don't care about staying any later than I have to. There are exceptions, but mostly I just leave asap. 

Nobody understands my feelings. I can't talk to noone about this. My boyfriend likes his job and wants to build up a successful career in his field. Which is fine, but he just doesn't understand how it is when you don't have a ""corporate mind"". I couldn't care less about my company. 

My parents always just say ""almost noone loves their job, but everyone has to work, so you just have to suck it up. It's not going to be different anywhere, every job has its downsides"" 

And I agree. But it just still doesn't feel right to me. 
I just came to the conclusion that I don't see myself pursuing a career. I don't want to climb up the ladder. I was a manager and I couldn't handle the stress. And frankly, the money is not worth the hassle for me. 
 
My boss had a review talk with me some months ago and he asked me what position I could imagine myself in and I honestly couldn't answer the question. 

He was like ""... You surely don't want to stay on the same spot forever right?""

I didn't answer anything. But the more I think about it, I don't want to work towards more responsibility and even more work. If you ask me, the next best thing would be to cut my work hours and start working part time so I have more time for my hobbies.

I feel like this option is always just laid out to woman with children.

Sorry for making no fucking sense, I just had to get it out, couldn't wait for my therapist appointment anymore.
I don't know what I want.
If money wasn't a thing...

104,I cant live like this and I am scared.,"Long story short, I was a really bright kid till highschool. Turns out I was being tested for ADHD and Autism but my incredibly uninformed dad shut it down and never told me about it because it didnt want a 'retarded daughter'. 

I can not function in a daily work environment. People dont understand my personality and even at 28 years old I normaly end up bullied covertly or completely ousted. Completing tasks is a hit or miss, somedays I am incredibly efficient,  other days just the noise of the florescent lighting is physically painful and I have to pretend I'm fine till my shift is over. I have wept in my car because It hurts so much to leave my daughters to come to this work place that contributes no good to the world.

Very recently I've began to seek treatment and I had this relaxation that I'm not lazy or stupid or an underachiever, the world just isnt built for people who think like I do. I know a lot about a lot of things and I can apply that knowledge if left the fuck alone but the moment I have to meet a regiment written by someone else I crumble. 

I feel like there are work environments that could allow me to really prosper but you need a very expensive degree and a big ol' sack of privilege to obtain it. I have a desire to be productive and to do things with my time that help others. I wish my job could be teaching people about animals or nature. 

I don't know how much longer I can sustain this. I have two daughters under the age of four, an eviction notice.

Well no one noticed period except for me and I spent way too much time trying to weigh whether the risk of someone finding out and chewing me out at some point in the future (which would be more difficult to explain) was worth the risk of telling the dude what happened and getting chewed out tomorrow. Spent way too fucking long just ruminating over which way to go just paralyzed in fear and anxiety of—what exactly?!

Why the fuck do I care so goddamn much about this shit? Some wealthy company has to do a little more paperwork to get some bills paid, the person who’s in charge of that client looks “unprofessional” for not having everything together and what about me? I get chewed out for making a mistake. As if that hasn’t happened before. I’m not going to get fired I don’t think... and even if I were the worst thing that happens is my ego hurts... i’m fortunate enough to have money saved to get me through a few month... But I spent a whole hour typing up an email and not sending it then finally sending it after so much stress and I can’t even relax. 

I just wish I could stop caring about this whole bullshit... I can’t stop caring about the most meaningless shit in the big picture because... why exactly? Is this just work culture or am I crazy?

118,Any Advice?,"TL;DR I am autistic and live with fibromyalgia, anxiety/depression and chronic pain, so a lot of jobs are just off limits to me (anything that requires too much physical exertion floors me - bar work, most customer service roles), There are very few things I'm actually passionate about and of the few jobs that excite me the majority of them are unmanageable with respect to my conditions, and the rest are just really hard to break into (I'd love to be an author, for example but can't find the energy or motivation to finish my book, would love to work in healthcare but its unsafe and impractical for sick people and colleagues). Every time I've had any kind of job in the past my mental health has taken a rapid decline and I've become more suicidal than normal to the point where its almost unbearable. I don't know what to do any more and I feel like my life isn't worth living half the time because i'm either working and depressed and suicidal because i spend all my time doing something I hate and then dont have the energy to do anything I enjoy or I'm depressed and suicidal because I can't do simple things like pay my rent on government benefits or do fun things like go out to eat or any of the things I actively enjoy doing because they all cost money I don't have because I'm unemployed but at the same time working makes me just want to kill myself. I struggle with organizational issues, planning, faking interest in things I don't care about etc, as well as my productivity can obviously change day to day depending on my conditions and concentration etc which doesnt go down well with anyone and its horrible to live like this I don't know how to fix it but i've always felt this way I remember telling my parents at 8 years old I never ever wanted a career because all it did was take up time away from things that I actually wanted to do. I've always seen things so differently because I see how much easier it could be and my brain can't understand why anyone would ever work a 40 hour week or how anyone could make money loving what they do. I don't have any goals any more or any real purpose despite having third level education (long story - chose the wrong degree hated myself and it the whole time, graduated anyway, changed my mind on what I wanted to do, started new healthcare degree, dropped out of my healthcare degree due to my own health and am now stuck) I feel like such a burden on everyone who cares about me and I feel like I'm never going to find something I love to do or that I could even tolerate that I'm both physically and mentally able to handle. I'm just so lost but I can't afford to exist and i dont know what else to do. I've tried to speak to careers advisors in the past and nobody has been helpful in any way and I'm just so tired of this already at 25 i don't think I can keep going like this much longer does anyone else feel this way? I feel so useless and hopeless and its horrible i dont know what to do. i feel like a massive disappointment to everyone who knows and cares about me because I was so smart in school and everything and i could have gone places but here I am sick and disabled and demotivated with no goals I'm just the walking family disappointment and it haunts me.

125,"I give 40 hours of my week, for $12 an hour.","I get off work at 3pm and have weekends off - but I work retail. The coveted set hours, weekends off retail shift....but it pays garbage. 

If I have to work my whole life away, give up my time and energy so I can’t enjoy my life, I at least want to make more than twelve measly bucks an hour. 

I have a degree. I could use that! But of course, there’s nothing that pays over $15 that doesn’t require *more* education and allows for nice hours like these, that won’t require weekend rotations or on-call hours. Or a job where I’ll have to do something I might actually enjoy and be able to accomplish. 

Don’t go to college. Just don’t. $90,000 on a *bachelors* degree in something I don’t even like or want to do because I was told how *proud* my family was of me, being a *first generation college graduate.* I’m going to *make something of myself.* 

Yeah. Working at Lowe’s for $12. At least I get weekends off. 

But I can’t afford a goddamn house. 

I was such an idiot. I will regret that decision for the rest of my life. I owe so much...it makes me sick. I can’t afford payments, my deferment is on year 3/3...I’m royally screwed unless I get a job that pays good money.

129,"Venting - work culture is laughably fake, and there isn't anything wrong with you if you reject it.","Thank you to this sub in advance for giving me a place to vent about this. I can't talk to anyone around me without getting some variation of ""you just don't understand that you need money and a decent job to live. Nobody wants to work, but you need to suck it up, buttercup!"" Or ""you're just negative and need to appreciate little things more. Maybe start by smiling more! :D""!

After years of grappling with depression because I can't convince myself that I want a Normal Life (TM) I've decided I want to live off grid instead.

I'm not interested in giving up 35-40 years of my life cultivating a fake work personality. Going through application processes that ask you question after question about how passionate you are about this customer service job or mind-rottingly boring office job. It’s as if they hope that if you lie enough on the application, you’ll start to believe your own lies, that you’re passionate about this shitty job. All it does is teach people to become effective liars and embellishers, and it speaks volumes that part of “normal life” is lying as much as possible just to get a job so you can meet your basic needs.

I’ve also accepted the fact that I’m simply not suited to the shitshow that is the “professional work environment”. Everything about it is pretending. Pretending to enjoy the whole experience so as not to be a “Debbie downer” to the “happy” people in your “work family” (with whom the only interaction you have is saying good morning, see you tomorrow, and TGIF on Fridays). Pretending to be engaged during hour long meetings where they spend 5 minutes reminding you that you’re not allowed to use the computers for anything other than work (because God forbid you do anything to pass the time, how unprofessional!) and then spending the rest listening to Sandy talk about her Sunday in the ER after her 6 year old fell and broke his nose. Going out for coffee with your boss during lunch in the hopes that one day years from now he’ll remember that time you went to Starbucks together and give you a promotion. 

And it's all for what? To get that fancy European car to drive to work and back and to run errands on weekends. To get the biggest house so strangers can gawk at it and feel envious for a moment. To go on vacation for 2 weeks to Paris or wherever the hell, then come back to your mundane life and spend the next 50 weeks eagerly awaiting that little bit of freedom like a dog fixated on a treat being dangled over its head.

And yes I know some people will say “do what you love” but as someone who’s been paid to do art commissions, a fun hobby can quickly begin to feel like a chore when made into a job.

Look at most nomadic cultures and that’s basically what they look like. 

Come to our society, or at least the one I live in, and it is basically like, this evil demon overlord took every village and township he could find and converted it into a work camp, hypnotized the villagers into thinking work was a virtue and they need material items to be happy and “normal”, and boom, you’ve got a good humming machine of labor. 

Zoom down into my house, and 20 years ago, and you’ve got a kid, me, sitting in their room, playing video games, watching commercials, and waiting for mommy to come home from work. Fast forward that kid’s life, that kid goes to state-funded school, gets encouraged to learn worker-bee skills and choose a specialty, and gets ingrained in them that the only normal thing in life, the only sensible and acceptable thing to do, is to work a job until retirement (if it ever comes), and... then presumably, die. Youth is meant for working away, time is meant for working away, energy is meant for working away. Any other use of youth, time, and energy, is selfish, insensible, and immoral. 

The kid breaks out of the mold, sees the world, and finds, that most places she finds, is just like her one-stoplight hometown. Her friends, her family, all trapped in this rat race world.

142,"Had a breakdown because of my career (long post, question at the end)","  Last Thursday I (M28) had a complete breakdown.

I was sitting at my desk staring at my screen, just another day doing work and I had a thought pry it’s way to the front: “All of my dreams are dead, I’m stuck in a job I hate and causes me endless stress, to pay off bills, debt, and rent all for the rest of my life. I have no hope. I have nothing to look forward to. Why do I bother?”

It’s not the first time I felt that way and won’t be the last. I’m not entirely sure why, but on this particular day it hit me much harder. To the point where the rest of my day was demolished while I tried to restore a semblance of normal life.

I have been struggling for a long time. On the outside things appear to be fine. I have (what appears) to be a great job at a desirable company with all the benefits and I get to work from home right now. 

Before I go further I want to let you know, I get these are tough times and there are millions unemployed right now without the benefits I have, without jobs, medical insurance. Millions struggling way worse. I fully acknowledge it.

I always hear “You’re lucky to have a job”, “be grateful”. Be fortunate that I get to sacrifice my time, my health, for someone else’s profit? Money can be recuperated, time is gone forever. I will never be as young as I am now.

I knew early on in life that I was going to struggle in the modern workplace. Growing up there were plenty of topics and fields that *interested* me, things that I felt were cool and I wanted to learn about. The problem was that I definitively knew there wasn’t anything that I felt was worth giving up 40 hours a week. Of course, looking back that thought is even more painful, as I’m often giving up much more time than that every week. But I digress.

Even now I struggle to come up with hobbies and activities that I can do for 8-9 hours consistently with complete focus. Even things I’m passionate about are often put aside after some time. Otherwise I just feel drained, exhausted. I need a break from them, a change of pace. Usually that means going outside for a walk, taking a nap, or just doing something else while I recharge.

But not work. Not my career. That requires 110% (hah) focus, commitment, dedication. I have to throw a smile on and pretend everything is OK, otherwise I’m “a downer”, or “not a teamplayer”. I have to be a robot that’s on “always-productive and cheery” mode. I’m not allowed to let people know that I’m an individual struggling with depression. Struggling with the thought of working the rest of my life. 

There’s a quote that cropped up recently, it’s from a 2007 game. Think what you want about the game, the story, or it’s message, but the quote really struck a cord with me:

“A man chooses. A slave obeys”

Throughout my life I’ve made choices that I ‘thought’ were mine. But looking back I’m not so sure. 

· I chose to work hard and get good grades

· I chose to go to a specific college

· I chose a major. Not because I wanted to, but because it was one of the ‘reasonable options’

· I chose to get a job, to chase down a career.

I chose to follow the safe path. To let go of my dreams, and passions. To forfeit my childhood aspirations.

But was it really a choice? 

I don’t know about others, but for me it certainly felt like there were no other options. No other paths to follow. I remember asking many times why we had to work everyday and give up huge portions of our lives to our careers. 

“That’s just the way life is ”

I hate that answer. Always have, always will. And I have zero power to change it.

Of course, there are those that say “well go get a new job”, or “it could always be worse”. I concede that maybe getting a new job will reset my personal doomsday clock *for a little bit*. But the deck is still stacked, the game is still rigged.  A choice between two different sets of handcuffs isn’t an acceptable choice in my mind. And I’m still going to be resentful that I’m forced to make that decision.

So what are my choices? What options do I have to break free?

I’m not sure that I have any. I’ve thought long and hard about how to break out of this predicament. But without any fundamental changes, I always circle back to my handcuffs: Carving and selling myself for a profit. Either as an employee working for someone else, or on my own.

The choice is a deception. I am still a slave. I just get to choose the poison that kills me.

And if I don’t want to choose? Then I get to look forward to:

· Homelessness

· Starvation

· The world falling apart and burning us alive

· Some disease rotting me from the inside out (COVID or something worse down the line)

· Etc.

Oh and for those of you suggesting FIRE. No. How do you expect me to slave away for another 10+ years waiting for that compound interest when TODAY I’m already at my breaking point? Meanwhile spending all that time pinching pennies like Scrooge. That’s just another set of cuffs, one that relies on the ever expanding growth of shares and the exploitation of your fellow people. I have a whole list of gripes against FIRE, though I understand its allure.

&amp;#x200B;

I appeal to the rest of you. Please, help me understand. What alternatives are there to this drudgery? Or will we just always be slaves? 

Thanks, see you all at my next mental breakdown.",False,hi69q8,Darkwolf762,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hi69q8/had_a_breakdown_because_of_my_career_long_post/,8,6

I've learned that reliability and dependability go hand in hand with more work and I'm not at all interested in people turning to me to ""get the job done"" because I come in every day—which I absolutely do not—, I get all of my work done and I volunteer for shit. 

Yeah. No. Stopped that years ago. 

I call out a lot, sometimes during a project I need to get done at a certain time and somebody else apparently ends up finishing it sometimes—like the one I came back to today. My assigned task is done, completed by someone else, so I'm happy. The task wasn't arduous and I did extensive detail work so it was fine. 

It may come and bite me in the ass eventually since I haven't even finished my probationary period but I can't find it in me to care most days. I'll either get my shit together long enough to maybe not get fired or just get fired.

153,Socialists should give conspiracy theories another chance part 2,"In my last post my point was that the correct information on what conspiracies are happening is good for socialists to know and that the idea of a controlling elite that controls the institutions on this world is actually compatible with the ideas on the nwo elite from a socialist perspective. It is also important to take away the nwo's power, maybe even more important than getting rid of capitalism. I know most conspiracy people do not look communism in a favorable light, I was heavily capitalist in thinking. Noncompete, Badmouseproductions, Thefinnishbolshevik and the movie Psywar really changed my persepctive. 

In my original post I talked about how false flags have been used against communists for a very ling time. Operation gladio was a series of false flags in europe that were blamed on communists. In Psywar the movie it makes the point that the wealthy have always found ways to conspire to keep the masses from taking their stuff. Making everyone in america temporarily embarrassed millionaires, distracting people with political football issues and putting many other ideas into the american people's heads has made america very accepting of capitalism. 

The first main counter arguments I got was the one argument that has flown around in the last two years, it basically says that conspiracy theories give too simplistic of answers to complex problems. This is not entirely false, but it is mistaken to extend a pattern thinking every societal mystery that is not understood has to be complex. Society can be simple, complex or a certain combination of both. What has happened on earth with the nwo having so much power is basically the world taking on a mostly simple way of being.

I also was told that conspiracy theories are not worth it because of all the crap theories. Separating the false from the true is a little bit of a hassle, but is not unworth the effort. There is way more than a kernel of truth in the conspiracy information. Just because alot of people cry wolf about wolves doesn't mean there are not real wolves that are being called out. On r/conspiracy yesterday and earlier today there is alot of good stuff on there, the right wing politics has went down.

One of the biggest arguments I give for 9/11 truth is that a trillion dollars went missing, on 9/10 donald rumsfeld talked about it, on 9/11 the are of the pentagon that got hit had the office that was investigating the missing trilion dollars. 

On Oklahoma city truth, there is a video I constantly link that proves multiple bombs were in the building, the video has excerpts from 3 live news reports, they talk constantly about multiple explosions and how multiple bombs were found, I always talk about Terrence Yeakey who was there, he knew a false flag happened and he was going to talk, but they killed him and falsely ruled his death a suicide, his family has come out saying this. Hoppy Heidelberg was on the grand jury investigating this and he has come out about how the process was rigged.

I know alot of people here see Pizzagate as a right wing crank story, but one thing that exposes that more is going on is Tony and John Podesta's art collection, as well as Jimmy Alefantis's art collection. They have all sorts of paintings of kids being embarrassed in bathrooms. Epstein who didn't kill himself was part of a larger ring. Prince andrew was a part of it and you can see in his interview that he was lying.

162,Just sharing antiwork stories,"I just wanted to share a story of my mate and coworker, one of the few people at work who I actually care about. My mate was working for a little bit over a year at the company, not working too hard but definitely not slacking. He has a great connection with a lot of people and someone you could always laugh with.  But when he went op for review they said ""if you keep on going like you do now, I am not sure if your contract will be renewed."" to which he answered: ""Well, I will save you the hassle of the choice, I am not planning to renew it anyway."" 

So he had still \~5 months left on his contract while everybody already knew he was going to quit. A month after that talk, he received a mail from his supervisor (who was sitting in the office right fucking next to him) that he should stop slacking and work harder. No face to face, just an email to send this message across. Right at the time when he was having a shitty week due to the loss of a pet, which was also well known.

So my mate decided he was done, left his work phone and computer and just left the building like a boss without saying anything. Send a mail to his supervisor the next day saying ""Yeah i ain't coming back no more"".

173,MONEY ISN'T EVEN FUCKING REAL LMAO,"We are a connected world, in 2020 more than ever. 

We are an absurd word, in 2020 more than ever.

Where are you reading this from? Probably very far from *here* and yet I'm *there*, in your mind *now*. The inescapable and global grasp of the *Internet* and our eternal engagement with it through the smartphone has been a pivotal (r)evolutionary shift in human history, one more significant than our discovery of fire, agriculture, steel, or the combustion engine. We have yet to scratch the surface of its potential and power, and the deeper implications of its existence and what that reveals about us - the Internet is the genesis of a global communal awakening and awareness of hidden connection.

The Internet and modern constantly connected culture has allowed us to act as a sort of rudimentary hive-mind. Our access to, and saturation of information, media, and communication is both **constant** *and* **instant** - it is now *possible* to share our thoughts with almost everybody there is - our friends and family, their friends and family, people we don't know and never will, people in another country, and people who may not even share the same language as us - a single sentence spat out into the ether can potentially reach billions of people on the planet in a matter of minutes.

You, me, and everybody else has a form of direct access to nearly every other human consciousness on this planet - what could we possibly use that for?

**Memes, of course.**

To crowdsource the question of 'what is *good*?', because that is what lies at the centre of all belief and action.

The fact that we have seemingly become ever more divisive and politically polarized is therefore not to be tutted at, wished away or met with calls for civility, but rather acknowledged as the *only way* in which an outcome - Truth - can be arrived at, copy itself, spread, and propagate to the point where its opposite seems wholly and utterly absurd.

Advocates for either a progressive or conservative approach to policy can not compromise *not* because the facts are in disagreement (although that is true), but because what comes **before** the facts is not agreed upon; that is, the way the world is structured and ordered, or **The Way The World Is**, which itself always acts as the background for an ideology rather than the reverse. The idiom *'seeing is believing'* is true backwards as well, perhaps even more convincingly -  **believing is seeing** and this is evident now more than ever.

I’m going to make some statements that are broad and general, but ones I feel are fairly common and often subconscious. These are not meant to be statements of  “fact"", only associations to get us to think about how we reach the conclusion of ""fact"".

*The relationship between progressivism and conservatism is like the relationship between masculine and feminine which is like the relationship between individual and community.*

Consider this disharmony between two opposing (or complementary)  principles as essentially the basis of all philosophical (and thus political) thought. Also consider opposing principles as really a **single thing** as opposites always exist only in relation to each other. This admittedly sounds a lot like some meaningless new-age woo, but I think most of us can and do recognize the basic and fundamental necessity of this tension between opposites.

We see what our minds project and what our contexts allow - we frame the world in the language we have at our disposal and what words *mean* is not something static and *in* the word itself, but something dynamic, unique to us specifically in the way we *relate* to that word.

Language has an implicit kind of magical quality - by that I mean much like an imagined casting of a spell, it is widely assumed that speaking the right words in the right combination (and order) can influence and compel people to act, and this action is the source of social change. This is why great orators have possessed great influence over the course of history - someone must be able to give *power* to an idea that can move masses to act as a single unified force of nature.

Language is itself inherently biased, limited, and divisive - **Black Lives Matter** means absolutely nothing until it is interpreted and language is always loaded with prejudice, even and perhaps especially when great care is taken to make sure it is not. There is always a fundamental aspect of loss from translating a feeling to a thought to any *thing* else, even when the path is as seemingly direct as from thought to speech. 

Have you ever known *exactly* what to say but been unable to get the words out properly in the moment? 

Have you ever written and rewritten something multiple times because the exact *feeling* you’re trying to capture just isn’t there? 

As much as language is the primary way we communicate, ironically it just as often obfuscates and confuses because the kind of language we have available to us directly determines how we understand and conceptualize the world (and ourselves). It is not a matter of merely being *Peterson-ianly* ""precise"" in our speech, because precision is meaningless if the principles that precede it are incompatible.

How many proponents of any ideology have *actually* read and engaged with its foundational or supporting texts? 

Probably very few.

How many have absorbed bits and pieces through their specific context - language, culture, family, friends, media, and digital memes?

Probably almost everybody.

You simply can't exist in 2020 and not intuitively just *know* what a meme is. Even those that exist totally cut-off from the online sphere would get the picture with some examples. Most typically we think of images like [this](https://imgur.com/Sc1nBL7), or [this](https://imgur.com/yW2QUqt), but these are just some examples of the modern, digital meme and don't begin to even scratch the surface of just *exactly* what a meme is and why the answer to that might be really fucking important.

For example, a picture doesn't need any text to be a meme. Similarly, a picture can be *only* text and still be a meme. A phrase can be a meme, or even [a single word](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/c/c3/D%27oh.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141226214635). A [sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_scream). [Symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_S#/media/File:%22Cool_S%22.svg). The structure of the building you're in and the design of the device you're reading this from are memetic artifacts. Musical subgenres, fashion and style trends, social patterns and institutions including family, marriage, property, law, crime and punishment - even complex ideologies - religious, political, and philosophical (all actually inseparable and arguably the same thing) - are essentially very nuanced and enduring memetic conversations that span hundreds and thousands of years.

Human behaviour is memetic - a product of pattern, repetition, and context rather than a series of conscious “choices"" we make at every moment - this is not to suggest we are totally bound and determined by fate, only that we are bound and determined to act in accordance with our own character - we are not *something* responsible for our decisions, we *are* our decisions, and for that we bear responsibility. 

Can you imagine Donald Trump acting like anything else besides a caricature of pure petulance?

That’s his role to play - his constitution. If it weren't he would be someone else, and here lies the crucial error that pervades all levels of society.

I think the belief that he, or you, or I ""make decisions"" is quite backwards - it’s partly a product of the language we use to speak about ourselves and the world - a confusion of the symbol with The Actual Thing - and partly just our basic instincts. It's plainly obvious that I am aware and can consider many possibilities and outcomes and think rather abstractly about present, past, and future, so it only seems to follow that I **must** exert some basic influence over the course of my life, but I think if we really examine that thought there’s no good reason to assume that’s true and necessarily follows. We might *feel* that it does, but perhaps that is a sign to be skeptical of our most basic assumptions.

I find little distinction between *Me* and *My Choices* - I **am** those choices, not a separate entity in the pilot's seat of my skull that ""chooses"" - that stands separate, considers, and then finally pulls the lever that corresponds with the **choice' I’ve made.**

Those last three words are superfluous - to me they all reference a single thing - a localized *happening* from my specific perspective.

This idea is naturally unpalatable as it seems to absolve one of all responsibility, for both wrongdoing and ownership of good acts and artistic creations, but I think this is nothing more than a knee-jerk reaction to protect our sense of *I* as something distinct and in control, as to accept the opposite comes with a great and terrifying sense of powerlessness. This terror is multiplied further when coupled with the additional quality of randomness, and the ordinary and pervasive accepted fact of our free will  is an attempt to reconcile this powerlessness with our instinctive desire to be in control. Even when faced constantly with the reality of circumstance where one life is destroyed based not on any decision or choice it was able to make, but the simple act of existing at the wrong point in time and space and colliding with the wrong other does nothing to dissuade us of this familiar and comfortable illusion.

Responsibility is not something we *take*, it is what we **are** by sheer virtue of being.

Memes and the repetition of pattern connects us to something far greater than any single one of us - our *collective* human ideas about value, function, purpose, and their relation with each other - memes are a portal to the sum total of all human knowledge, experience, and feeling - memes are threads sewn into the fabric of the tapestry of reality, connecting us to the past, present, future, each other, and something totally separate - something unspeakable that yet demands to be spoken of - something that can be glimpsed only for a moment and reflected only as a fragment.

You may have felt it when engaged in something everyday and ordinary, yet struck as if for the very first time by the majesty and totality of all there is - all experience happening right now, billions of distinct and separate simultaneous *happenings* - connections - disconnected only by virtue of the limitations of our own collective conceptions of what is real, what is true, and what is possible.

What *is* possible?

It is possible then to understand **Humanity** not as an abstracted collection of billions of separate individuals, but as a single, *unique happening of organism/environment* that can act with that awareness of unity and underlying connection.

We currently insist on persisting in an ordering of society that enriches only a small handful that have fallen to the top through nothing other than circumstance and who insist this *must* be the natural ordering of the world simply because it is the current ordering of it. 

Can we really trust those who wield inordinate amounts of power to fairly consider how it might be meted out differently? Is the fate of society directly tied to the fate of the billionaire class, or to the current institutions of governance and policing?

We are meant to believe and accept that this is just **The Way the World Is**? 

As far as I see it, society bears little proof of functioning properly *anywhere* as long as we define ‘properly’ as for the common good of all people. If we instead understand ""properly"" as to the obscene and perverted benefit of a small few at the expense of everybody else, then it is functioning tremendously properly, and will only continue to do so until We put a stop to it.

From where is authority and power actually derived?

The primary source is our shared belief that these institutional structures are legitimate and just - and they are so long as we believe it. 

The secondary source is the ability and willingness of these structures to respond violently if we do not accept the first.

Violence is of course the most powerful and persuasive avenue of acquiring and maintaining power, both literal violent action and indirect violence inflicted and facilitated by a system of organization that regards the principle of one's right to hoard obscene amounts of wealth as higher and more just than an attempt to provide the basic material necessities of life for all people.

That is the basic moral principle that serves as the keystone of the structure of our society *as it is currently ordered*.

To preserve life violence may sometimes be necessary, but violence can be avoided memetically - you cannot put a bullet in a concept and it’s just as futile (and a bit if a moral grey area) to do the same to those who espouse, exemplify, or believe it. Violence can be lessened with the correct memetic foundations to underpin our collective conceptions of 'self', 'other', and 'world' and the reciprocal nature of those three things - violence is given power by distinction and separation, but that power can be neutered partly by understanding that not only are we ourself, we are also every other self, too.

Individualism is too often championed by those who don't understand the distinction between it and selfishness, and this error acts as the basic foundation for an entire wing of belief that insists ""value"" is directly related to money and money alone and *everything* can be spoken about in terms of its equivalent and assumed value in US dollars, one of many currencies that can in an instant become almost worthless due to nothing other than our shared confidence (or lack thereof) in it.

So, if memes are the true catalyst of human action and social change, can we then ""meme ourselves"" into a better reality? Can we, together, engineer, build, or construct a meme to spread and transform our shared, collective (un)conscious and the ideas that follow about not only what is true, *but what is possible*?

I think a good place to start is to understand the **illusory and mutable nature of money and wealth, their direct relationship with power, authority, and control and the distribution of these things**. Money is a real *thing* that performs a necessary *function*, but our shared understanding of it holds real power over its form, and in this way we can collectively shape and alter that power it commands over our lives through a collective psychic exercise.

We can't function without money, but we absolutely can function with a new way of distributing it in hopes of lessening (not eliminating) the amount of suffering directly related to poverty and the misery that flows from that.

Google, ""how many billionaires exist?"" - Answer: 2095.

**2095 problems.**

Let's look at just one.

Does Jeff Bezos really have billions of an actual, tangible currency, or is his currency really in the form of power and influence *as represented* by money?

Is the standard work-week from Monday to Friday or Monday to Thursday?
 
Whatever the answer, is it because this is simply *The Way the World Is*, or might *The Way the World Is* be directly shaped by our collective ideas about it?

Wars are no longer waged on an actual battlefield - our modern war is a psychic and spiritual one, set in the space of the collective human (un)conscious, and the targets of annihilation are not only people but possibilities - the target is **Truth**, and the creation of Truth As it Serves the Manufacturer - we are in an era of memetic warfare and unless we can understand that and figure out how to turn it against itself, the collective human spirit will be swallowed whole, outlived by the last piece of manufactured shit we can sell for a dollar.

*2095 problems and 1 crucial error* stands between us and a better society, and building that society is as simple as believing in and spreading the right memes.

We can meme ourselves better, but only together,

You're just going to end up working another shitty job you hate and your labor is just going to be exploited by another capitalist. 

When it comes down to it we have all the power. Something that I know we all know here, capitalists generate wealth by stealing the capital generated by our labor. They don't have wealth without us. They don't have power without us. I've been involved in a few unionization campaigns and I've seen them effectively work at utilizing our collective power to fight against the bosses. 

How do you all think we ever got the weekend? We fought for it and won. The weekend, the 40 hour work week, and other past victories have been slowly eroding for years. It doesn't have to be that way. We can take the fight up again, and this time we can take it further. We can fight for 30 hour work week, we can fight for a 3 day weekend, we get so much more. The boss only has the power as long as we continue to forget that their power exists solely because of us.

180,I like my job. I just hate working and having colleagues.,"This might sound strange, I love the job I do. I took this career path because of a lifelong interest in that field and I still love what I do very much.

But... why do I dread going to work every day? Sunday feels like I’m waiting to have my head cut off Monday morning, Friday afternoon feels like I’ve won the lottery. The rest of the days I come home and go straight to sleep just so I can get through all the days as fast as possible.

I think it’s the work environment and having colleagues that does it for me. I’m more of an introvert and can get a lot done by myself. During summer and Christmas times the office is quiet and I get so much done. I hate the bullshit every day of what to wear, what to chat about with colleagues at breakfast/coffee/lunch, what random nonsense meetings are we being pulled into.

what is the easiest degree without having to write a ton of essays while still being useful/still manage to get a good job with it?

i have horrible adhd that is untreated due to money reasons so i can't get myself to sit down and write long or multiple essays anymore. i used to be able to but i'm horribly burnt out from school and quite honestly i find myself repeating statements i had already said and just rephrasing them within the essay.

189,I’d rather die than go to college (rant),"Tw: suicidal ideation. I am twenty something years old and live on my own, away from my parents. I pay for all of my living expenses, with a bit of help from my parents to pay for half of my rent. I go to community college too, and I pay for that out of pocket. I work ~40 hrs a week to just barely cover my expenses (i make a few dollars over the minimum wage, too) The city I live in is expensive, but this is where my college and my job are, so I can’t really leave right now. I would consider moving home to cut costs if my parents weren’t so conservative (i am LGBTQ and hiding it from them) and my mom wasn’t so emotionally abusive. I’ll be done with CC in the winter, and naturally I’m ~supposed to~ apply to other colleges to get my Bachelor’s. But I don’t want to go to college, I don’t want to go into even more debt. All college does is prepare you to become a 9-5 wage slave, which I literally already am. I hate my fucking life so much, I have little energy to do anything other than my homework when I get home from work. There is really nothing that I want to learn. All of my passions are in the arts. I have a small following on some social media platforms from the art I post. The content I do put out gets received really well by my audience (mostly LGBTQ+ people who are struggling with their identities, being accepted, etc.) and it makes me feel like I actually have a purpose in life. I would love to just make Youtube videos and get paid from that, but that’s such a fucking coin toss. I cannot see myself working a “regular” job for much longer. I’ve known since I was 12 that I wouldn’t be able to do “normal work” and it still rings true. I’ve been suicidal for sooo fucking long that just ending it all seems like a viable option, but I know I’m not going to do it (any time soon, at least.)

194,I DID IT! I QUIT MY JOB!," I finally did it! ive been working this healthcare facility for 3 years in the kitchen and tonight/today at 1am i quit! I did it via text message to my HR, Manager, and supervisor but i did it! (please dont tell me that it was unprofessional they did plenty worse) 

 I started this job in the kitchen 3 years ago at 9$ an hour. 44 hours a week. thats right 44 hours a week. BUT as part time, no benefits! no healthcare!  

Gone through a new manager every year, same old ""were a family and i promise to fix everything!"" \*procedes to F\*CK up everything worse\*  one of my manger actually told me to my face ""people like you dont deserve to be working in my kitchen"" after working there for only a week. (im openly trans, gay and autistic)    


 I never know my work work schedule for the next week until the very last day of current schedule.  Half my coworkers are part of one family! Current (now old!) boss is friend of said family and makes one of them supervisor (we had NEVER had a supervisor until then)  and new family supervisor call out everything no matter how small towards non-family. (but family can do no harm. ever)    


Now under the newest """"family"""" ruled boss shifts get rearranged. 1st shift gets an extra person and less overall work. and second shift gets the same amount of people but with more work!  

One of the bosses family members hates my guts for some unknown reason (i try my best to get with people or straight up avoid them) and is allowed to scream at me. and even THREATEN violence against me! I tell supervisor, nothing happens. I tell manager, nothing happens. I tell HR, nothing happens. I have to go all the way the building admin and their higher up to stop this. And when it finally stops that person is still allowed to work on the same shift as me! (I have worked same shift longer before them or any of the family had even started the jobs)  

After 3 years im still making 9$ an hour while i know for a fact that the new family are making more. bosses even bragged about bonoues THEY got for staying under budget (by taking food away from they elderly.) 

So in these three years ive worked at this place, ive worked 40 hours a week. MINIMUM. but still on paper part time until 4 months ago when corporate finally caught  it. HR finnaly puts me on full time with healthcare! yay right? WRONG!  Two times a day, five times a week I washed dishes for roughly 100 elderly people. that means the dirty, flighty, bacteria filled, virus infested, DISGUSTING dish water filled with food that has been in 100 peoples mouths! EVERYDAY! TWICE A DAY! without healthcare!! and I wonder why i got so sick all the time.   

Now over the past month my supervisor who makes the schedule has reduced my hours to 30 hours a week, (WITHOUT my knowledge or permission) and when i confronted them they gave some bs excuss of of the covid 19 has us pushing hours back, WTF no we are still working the same hours?!?  

Now im part of the nation guard, and on multiple ocassions my boss has called, or rather has tried to call me in while im at my unit, in uniform!  Asking me to leave early to help them!  Now i gave my manager, my supervisor, HR, and building admin my yearly drill schedule FAR in advance. but they still try to blame me for not warning them that i have drill! when they have my drill for the whole year in paperwork and email, and i tell them every month!  

Now with this COVID-19 going on many units across the country have been doing work from home online work instead of going to the unit in person. this still requires me to be busy at my computer for 8-9 hours and calling in and doing classes over the phone and all that nonsense. But my HR askes me to my face to do it WHILE AT WORK. HR asked me to work both my nation guard and my kitchen work at the same time. as at least half my nation guard hours are during times im usually at work. aka NG time is 8AM to 4PM and work hours are 11AM to 7PM.  

That happened last week. now this week (my work week starts on Saturdays)  ive had to go do someone elses job for the past 4 days in a row! so that one person can go ""help"" the 1st shift on side of the builing when serving food. which means giving one side 4 people duing lunch hour, but yet the same side serving the same ammount of people with the same amount of time given only gets 3 people.  

So this all basically means that i have to go do someones else's job so they can do nothing.f and this all puts my an hour behind on all my work for the entire day, which means i have to stay over an hour.  this trend of me having to do someones else's job started after i went to corporate and had them fix my hours so i get my 40 to keep my new full time and healthcare. come to find out the supervisor was the one telling the cook to tell me to go there job, the same supervisor that does my schedule.    

All ive ever wanted was to do my job. my job. not someone elses. i just want to work 40 hours a week or hell even less, just so long as i can support myself. i live in a very rural region but my rent is the cheapest i could find over the past 4 years of living here and still takes up 40% of my monthly pay.  

For the past 3 days ive come home and cried, and tonight i came home and drank. ive never been drunk. at most ive been buzzed twice (im almost 30) so drinking has never even been on my list of things to do. but ive finnaly been pushed over the egde and i drank propably a thirdish of a wine cooler and honestly the hours of 8pm to 1am are a total blurr. im still buzzeed as of writing all this so at least someone could know my pain to the full. (im ok now and have poured all that was leftover into the sink. and never plan to do that again)

211,Yesterday I Got The Call To Go Back and I've Felt Like Absolute Shit Since,"I've had a pit in my stomach since yesterday morning.  Got the call to come back from furlough on Monday after 15 weeks.  I really don't know how I'm going to manage.  

I was told I'd be out until the first week of September, but there's been a ""big turn around"" in business.  


The most ridiculous part about this, is my company has been pushing *slow* production startup (I work in manufacturing), safety first, volunteers only for the summer.  

Now, fair is fair.  My company did do a few decent things.  

During the 2nd week of March, they decided to voluntarily shutdown for a two week period, with full pay for employees.  
During that time period, the state ordered a non-essential shutdown.  The company didn't try to BS their way into pretending they were essential, they let us keep our vacation and sick time without paying it out, and they let us keep our health insurance (granted with double payments when we go back).  


Once the non-essential order ended in May, it was going to be all volunteers and small shifts for the whole summer.  

They had no issues getting volunteers, because they promised a four day work week, with the fifth day being able to claim UI from the state, *plus* you would still get the $600 a week from the Cares Act.  


But then a couple weeks ago they started to realize that they were getting a ton of orders.  We make fucking sports equipment.  A specific type.  And it's one of the only sports people are playing right now.  


Well, all of a sudden that ""employee safety"" went out the window.  

Back to five days a week immediately starting next week.  All employees mandatory back to work.  OT reestablished, both voluntary and mandatory, possible six day work weeks until we ""catch up"".  

All of those volunteers were expecting an extra $600 a week until August, now they're not getting it.  


These have been the best 15 weeks of my life in I don't know how long.  My parents forced me to start working full-time during the summers when I was 16 years old, and part time during the school year.  I got fucked out of a lot of normal high school and college summer activities because they had me working manual labor jobs from 7am to 3pm everyday.  

This was going to be my first summer off in **eighteen fucking years*.   


I have fixed up my house, I've fixed up my yard, I've got a big garden going, I've read over 30 books, I've been learning French, I'm learning to play the saxophone again, I started painting....I've really been fucking happy.  


I don't know how the fuck I can go back to work.  

And the thing is, my job wouldn't be that bad if it wasn't for the corporate bullshit.  Like most large companies, I can't stand the *fakeness* of it.  It literally sickens me.  The pretending to care about every employee and their well being and the morons I work with who believe it.

Monday is a federal holiday?  Guess what, mandatory full shift on Saturday.  And what do these idiots coworkers say, ""Well the company has to make money and they need the product!  Nothing we can do about it!""  

Not to mention the low level supervisors.....I'm sorry ""team leaders"", gotta use that BS term to make employees feel more comfortable.  
Getting my fucking ass ridden even when I'm working hard.  

""Oh, you were suppose to make 200 of these products today....why did you only make 198?.......You had to use the bathroom?  Well obviously you were on your phone or fooling around.""

Fucking excuse me?  I'm 34 years old.  Who the fuck are you to talk to me like that?  I had to take a shit, like every other person does.  I'm pretty sure every time I walk by your office, you're leaning back in your chair on your fucking phone.  Who is calling you out?

Or, ""I saw you were at the punch out clock at 11 minutes of the hour....you know that employees can't line up until 10 minutes on the hour.  Yes, I know that every single clock we have up shows a different time, and yes I know we will suspend you even if you just lift your cell phone slightly from your pocket to see the actual time......but I'm going to have write you up.""

Fucking hell the juvenile and childish treatment you get and the way you're spoken down to.....



Maybe some of you will disagree, but I could probably fucking deal with my job on an ""ok"" level if it wasn't for BULLSHIT like that.  


FUCK.

213,I’m so boned. tl;dr at bottom.,"The company i’ve been working for the past year did not have their contract renewed so now I’m out of a job.  The company that, until very soon, signs my checks is contracted out to do its services for other businesses.  


Due to poor upper management, the client decided to move on to a competitor leaving us in the area employed by the original contract sh*t out of luck.  That’s the only fact that I know up until this point. 


The same management that’s screwed us out of decent health benefits has forfeited paying out any unused PTO.  They’ll likely loophole us into screwing us out of unemployment as well, writing this off as us quitting or something.  I wasn’t hired as a contract employee so I’m very blindsided, comparable positions have been held for 5+ years.  There won’t be any available positions locally with the company, although they do have contracts in other states (SC btw).  Apparently we signed a non-compete clause when hired so the competitor would have to pay an obscene amount to hire us on, which is very unlikely.  


The last thing this company has to offer me is unemployment benefits.  I’ve been quiet about plenty of unfair practices but they at least owe me that.  The company also knows our labor force is the last thing they have to offer the client or competitor, as to say “we treat our employees like crap, but they’re willing to stick around.”


I just want one last screw you to the company who made it seem like my work ethic effected my job availability at the end of the day.  How do I even continue going into work?  Knowing it’s only going to get worse as the competitor comes in to place their signage and equipment.  It’s not like this is a top-notch career so how can I be bothered to re-apply and re-interview for the crappy job that I already have?


tl;dr.  company contract not renewed and even though I’m not a contract employee they’re screwing me at every turn, including with unemployment benefits.",False,he7lke,pdubbinators,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/he7lke/im_so_boned_tldr_at_bottom/,1,1
214,Just got fired from my job after taking a week off to recover from an injury.,"On Sunday, June 14 I got injured hiking. I had to be rescued by the local Fire Department and Paramedics by being pulled vertically up the side of a cliff while tightly strapped in to what was essentially a plastic sled(which triggered the fuck out of my vertigo to no end - I don't even like rollercoasters). 

I called my boss later that evening after I came to terms with my anxiety and shock surrounding the entire situation, and he said ""no problem, take some time, I hope to see you in the office soon"". Come Thursday I have to go back to the hospital because it turns out the wound became infected, so I had to get antibiotics and was advised to take that day and Friday off, including the weekend, so I could be back in the office today. I was given a doctor's note.

I'm not feeling great today, my foot is wrapped, I still feel sore, I'm on crutches, but I was ready to go to work. I walk in, co-workers open the door for me, etc ""welcome back, hope you're feeling better"" etc. I sit at my desk, and all the sudden my boss asks me to take a walk with him. I get into the room and we have a meeting with HR. 

Long story short, I was fired. 

This isn't the first time this place has fired people under undesirable circumstances. I had a co-worker/friend fired around 6 months ago after having to take an extended leave after a total collision getting hit by an impaired driver. His body was basically ruined, was doing physio and was on heavy, prescibed drugs.

215,The quarantine has made me realize that I don’t really want to go back to work.,"Where I’m from the quarantine isn’t fully over yet, as an intern I’m in a particular condition in regards to employment, and the team where I work has been slowly going back to work but the interns (and a lot of other people) haven’t yet, I’ve been lucky enough that I’ve been paid the full 3 months that we’ve been in quarantine.

And you know what makes it just how clear how anti-work I’ve turned recently, is that I actually like this job, I could see myself working there, it’s 6 hours a day, 5 days a week and they pay well,  but ever since I started I started working here I've been thinking about just how much unnecessary labour we do, as much as I like my job and in it’s needed in context, I’ve felt that what I do is ultimately meaningless, plus there’s no shortage of shitty coworkers that I have to deal with, and that all rolls up into a nice ball of anti-work sentiment I’ve developed over time, after less than 2 years of entering the workforce as a “professional” (I’ve been working since I was around 16, but it was just under the table money).

I do want to work, but not for profit and under the threat of homelessness and starvation and not for someone else, I want to work for myself, for those around me and for the good of humanity, and I want to have a satisfactory life, I don’t want to spend the rest of my days in uneventful safety.

It’s just so hard to fight back against that little voice of internalized capitalism that says “you’re not worthy unless you’re being productive, you need economic safety and stability, etc..” and I’ve been considering going to college again to study something with which I can help people (plus I love learning stuff overall).

I absolutely love my field of study, and I am good at it, it’s just a little self-indulgent, which is fine, I love it, it’s good for my mental health and I’ve been doing it for my own enjoyment without it having generated me any income for years now and I don’t plan to stop, it’s for me, but in the context of work it just isn’t all that gratifying and it even feels vapid.

I do some volunteer work which is how I got the internship in the first place, and my internship tasks blended a bit with my volunteer work and I just felt so discouraged for a moment just thinking about going back to work.

And idk I’m just ranting at this point, this isn't meant to be particularly insightful, I just wanted to share this with other who I know feel simmilarly, and I’ve realized that I could honestly just go the rest of my life without working, and instead balancing my own enjoyment with the impetus I feel for helping humanity.",False,he10v3,patheticstereotype,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/he10v3/the_quarantine_has_made_me_realize_that_i_dont/,4,7

218,I found this sub.,"I haven’t read much into it, but I feel this is the place for the topic.

I don’t like working really, it all feels repetitive. What I want to do is just make art, and games. I know I can commission art, or make small indie games but honestly I don’t think that shit pays the bills.

I don’t want to be rich, I never have. Whenever someone asked me what I’d do if I won the lottery, I’d say live comfortably, and when I say that I don’t mean mansions, or big parties. I mean a small cozy apartment where I can spend my days on my computer, drawing art, or making games to play. If I had extra money, I’d probably give it to charity because I really don’t think I need a lot to live on. I don’t wanna live of bare minimum, but I don’t want to be rich; Just comfortable.

I want everyone to live comfortable, because I know the struggle. Things seem to just be ‘first come, first serve’ with businesses and such, meaning you can rarely ever try to ‘get rich’. Regardless of the amount of motivational speeches out there about it, it really feels like a coin toss to get anywhere in life.

221,"Starting over, how do I make the most?","I am moving to a new country in (hopefully) about 9 months. I will basically only know my wife and her family there, so I'm basically completely starting over. I want to make the most of this opportunity and not get stuck in the same ol 40+ hours a week in a stuffy office. But I don't know how. To be completely  honest, I don't feel like I have any remarkable skills. I'm pretty decent with excel and making spreadsheets for analyzing data, but thats not that uncommon.

But I dont want to get student loans and spend all that work and time unless I can figure out how to make it work as my own business, or at the very least be able to find a job where I can work remotely.

222,Biological existence is a dictatorship - all living organisms are fundamentally slaves,"We are also economic slaves to money and work. Submit to labor in exchange for a paycheck or starve to death on the street - due to having no purchasing power and thus (in this current system) no right to life. (Most people in the modern world are not able to 'go live in the woods' and make that function they lack those skills so it is a gun to the head scenario with no alternatives for the vast majority)

And even if you are willing to work for money to pay for rent and food - but are unable to obtain employment you will starve to death on the street, despite being willing to slave away to maintain your futile temporary existence.

You may indeed even be one of those rare people who genuinely enjoys your job/work/career. That does not however change the fact that you still do HAVE to do it. And you will starve on the streets if you did not do it, or found some other work in exchange for a paycheck in case you quit the current occupation to substitute in some other source of monetary income.

People that ""Love their jobs and are genuinely fulfilled by it and see it as meaningful and engaging"" are no different from Samuel Jackson's character in Django Unchained - a slave who enjoys being a slave and likes his slave master. You can be a slave who finds it acceptable and even enjoyable or you can despise it with every ounce of your being and resent it to the ultimate degree. But both are equally slaves.

Now in a similar sense we are biological slaves. We MUST eat. We MUST drink. We MUST maintain a certain body temperature. We MUST breathe oxygen etc.

Now you may say: ""Well I enjoy eating. I enjoy drinking. I enjoy seeking out a comfortable body temperature. I enjoy breathing I love fresh air. I like that things are like that.""

OK - but that does not change the fact that you indeed are a slave to all of that. You HAVE to do those things or you suffer and die. You may be happy with that situation and somehow find it justifiable and acceptable that you are a monetary slave and a biological slave and you can make peace with it or maybe even find it to be just and proper that this is the state of affairs, that this is how things are.

But you ARE a slave though.

235,Man I just need to rant,"TL:DR 
I hate my union carpenter job. Been laid off. Wife’s pregnant. No insurance. Can’t go back or I might lose my mind. Fuck. 


I’m depressed. Just bought a house. Unemployed. Wife’s pregnant. No insurance. Trying to get Medicaid for my wife and kid. 

I was laid off from my job as a union carpenter at the begging of the pandemic. I was honestly pumped. I hate that job. I hate the people. I hate working my ass off so that the boss can make more money while I lay in bed at night not able to move because my body is so sore. 

As long as I work and got enough hours in, my insurance premiums were paid for. Well guess what happens when you don’t work and there’s a global pandemic. You lose your insurance OR pay $1050/month out of pocket to keep insurance. Isn’t that funny? If you don’t work, you don’t make money, but you somehow have to come up with $1050 to keep insurance. The only thing keeping us afloat is the extra $600/wk the government has given us for unemployment but that will soon be over. 

I don’t want to go back to the union. I hate everything about it. They make it seem like a great opportunity yet all they care about is production over quality. Then when you do a shitty job to meet production you get yelled at and laid off. You’re just a number and unless you start sucking dick, you’re toast. I’ve been doing it for 2 years and I bust my ass for a company, just for the job to end, and all that hard work go unnoticed and I have to start all over again with a new company.

I have an opportunity to do a new job that gives me freedom and flexibility and ultimately less hours per week. No insurance offered though and possible weeks off in the winter due to weather. But it doesn’t fit the mold we are so convinced is the only way. My wife is scared, I’m scared. We’ve been stressed and pissed and don’t know what the fuck to do. I can’t continue to kill myself at a job I fucking hate but I also need to provide for my family but idk what to do.

236,Stuck with people who refuse to understand,"I'm 24. Been living with my parents in my childhood home for almost a year now, along with my two brothers as of \~ April. I'm working at a small local market garden which I enjoy (I'd still rather be spending most of my time on other things and would prefer to not hand over most of my labour value to my boss, but it's better than anything else I've done). My parents are... concerned about my future. I am trying to keep an eye out for a small camper van to move into so I can live rent-free on unemployment for a while and finally gtfo of this town, but my dad is against this idea, since he insists that it's somehow more of a burden to maintain and repair a camper than it is to burn half your paycheque every month on a single room in a basement suite somewhere. They are convinced that the best course of action would be for me to go back to school and then somehow immediately land a high-paying job ""that you can tolerate"" upon graduation. Someone can feel free to let me know if this is even reasonably possible anymore, because to me it seems completely out of touch and on par with ""just go into the building, give them a resume, and ask for an interview""

On top of this, I'm pretty convinced there is virtually no job that I can ""tolerate"" because the entire concept of wage labour as a precondition of subsistence -- that we are expected to spend 40+ hours a week toiling on (often completely useless) tasks just to prove that we are worthy of warmth and calories -- completely and utterly disgusts me to my core, and that's before the whole exploitation of labour value thing. They can't seem to understand that I would much rather scrape by in a van, posting music on the internet and maybe selling custom tee shirts than spend half my waking hours completely disassociating just so I can give half my money to a parasitic dirtbag in exchange for permission to live in a building they own. 

Oh and my dad shames me for smoking weed.

TL;DR: Stuck with my complacent, brainwashed parents who are trying to push me towards the same boring BS life path that they took back in the 80s when job stability, moderately affordable rent, livable entry-level wages, and degrees that carried more weight than the paper they were printed on actually existed. They think I am entitled for trying to explain why that life path is not really that viable anymore, and I wouldn't be particularly interested in it if I was.

My boss misinformed everyone that masks only need to be worn while the client is face up. WRONG. I'll be addressing this tomorrow with her since I re-read the guidelines from the council.

Anyway, I was massaging this bitch. It was a couples massage with me and another therapist working on the man. They were wearing their masks when we got them from the sitting area. After we came back into the massage room with them undressed, after awhile I noticed she wasn't wearing a mask. I asked if she was wearing a mask, she said no.

247,People need to be very careful hoping the U.S. goes to a permanent work from home culture.,"
TL;DR: Careful wishing. WFH is going to possibly lead to 50-60 hour work weeks with no OT and no pay increases. It could also spur law changes leading to the 777: Be ready at 7; sign off at 7; all 7 days; with availability 24/7.

I think the real argument going on in the U.S. is whether the 40 hr workweek needs to be re-evaluated.  Initial panic: If they can’t see you and demand you do more than what they hired you for, their long term game is screwed.

But, in the end, the worker will get screwed no matter what.

This leads to meetings with “strategists” and HR.  Before you know it, lobbyists are influencing congress to roll back OT, FMLA, etc. leading to the 777: Report at 7; sign off at 7; all 7 days...and be available 24/7.

Frankly, I’d go in for 3 days a week or just let me WFH 4, come in one. 

This is a slippery slope WFH. Employers will eventually want you to work at all hours and they’ll probably add a lot more assignments to your plate knowing that you have all the time in the world to get it done at home.. No commute? That’s 2 more hours for the company.  They forget that’s before 8 all of a sudden it’s work time. So I think a lot of people should be really careful about getting permanent WFH. Doing some kind of hybrid system to just remind the boss that you are a person hired to do 40 hours worth of work not 90 hours worth of work because they’ll expect you to juggle being home while working all the time.

Personally, I see the idea of OT being a thing of the past for WFH.  Instead of 40 hour weeks, why not 50 or 60 since there are no commutes, no lunch runs, no rush home to family needs. Ah, but no pay increases, they’ve been “generous” allowing you to WFH.

255,Small businesses,"Inasmuch as I have to work, I've always preferred to work for small businesses. It's easier to build across-the-board solidarity among staff (in most cases) and you can easily make changes in day-to-day processes and practices if you have a good idea. The pitfalls have always been that pay is as low as the can keep it, and you often run into narcissistic owners who can't stand for the business to do something that wasn't solely their idea. I've had owners either claim my idea was theirs or tell me that we'd introduce my ideas for change and then decide against it at the last moment.
I honestly like working, to a point. I tend to be a little asocial if left to my own devices, so having social interaction forced on me is helpful. I don't need a ton of money (I could live on $2k net a month here in DC), but it'd be nice to make that amount of money in 40 hours a week instead of having to find a second job (which are nowhere to be found rn bc unemployment is so high and people are going back to work. No one's hiring for nights and weekends). And it'd be nice to have actual input into decision making, especially considering that the safety protocols concerning COVID at the business I work for leave a lot to be desired. 
I think that we need to find a way to work for small businesses when we can, unionize those businesses to demand increases in base pay and regularly scheduled raises. And anywhere you can, encourage people to accept that they don't need everything immediately. They don't need every convenience. We have to reduce our dependence on large corporations.

256,How can I use my education to get more involved with Pro-workers/Pro-Union activism?,"I don’t want to get too personal, but I (27m) currently have an engineering degree. I think I’m smart and get paid pretty well, but I still want to be part of the Labor movement. Even though I’m skilled and most of my coworkers are pretty anti-Union, I still feel somewhat taken advantage of by management. Don’t get me wrong, I have it plush made and get paid well, but I want more! I want to be living in the same comfort as the managers who seem to spend their time flying to different cities having dinner with other CEOs etc. 

How can I work to bring down the establishment? I’ve considered going to graduate school, but I’m not sure for what exactly. I don’t want to get my masters in engineering, since career wise, I’ll still be taken advantage of. Would it help if I got an MBA? Would that just be joining the wrong side? Maybe I can go to law school and get involved with Labor Laws? (Idk what the legal term is, someone help?)

I guess I’m stuck in a lukewarm kind of Limbo.

The better ones are polite and pleasant enough, but they don't really give a shit about me in any capacity - I'm just a girl they work with (and to be fair, the feeling is mutual). None of them would be sad I got hit by a car and died tomorrow, except for the reason that they'd have to do more work until my employers found a replacement peasant to take my role. 

The worst of my co-workers are actually some combination of rude, racist, homophobic, disrespectful, peak Karen, insufferable, snippy and unpleasant. And yet, I am forced to spend 40 hours a week in the company of these people and am left with precious little time to spend with the people who actually fucking *matter* to me.

I've tried discussing work conditions to him but it fell on deaf ears, honestly I've only been back in office two days and this morning ( and the past two mornings) I've felt sick to my stomach. I'm just gonna take my paycheck and go. I'm going to be left with this paycheck, minimal savings and a small freelance income but I'd rather risk it than continue to let this job ruin my life.

266,Shower thought: Wages are given in currency per hour because work exists to eat up our time,"It's always seemed weird to me that there aren't really any jobs that pay by unit of production or by unit of effort exerted.  It's always seemed really counter to the idea that capitalism exists to maximize value created.   Like, if I assemble 500 widgets in a shift, but the guy next to me can only assemble 200... Why should we get paid the same?

Most employers don't really promote internally or give merit-based raises anymore (it's almost universally cheaper to hire someone from outside to manage), though they're likely to heap extra unpaid responsibilities on employees who perform well.  So, aside from doing just enough to avoid negative performance reviews, there's no good reason to overwork yourself.

Then today it occurred to me- the product of our work and/or the effort we put in isn't what keeps the system going, it's the time.  We have to be always busy, always tired, always desperate for small conveniences..   Quarantining for just a few weeks during a global pandemic brought the whole system to its knees because people had time to themselves.  Time to spend with their kids.  Time to think about systems and injustices.  Time to bake their own bread.

And look at the outcomes...  Global protests against racism.  The US is looking at rethinking policing.

Or you are dirt Poor.There’s no middle class, no upper class, just the very rich and the very very poor.One of our counties was declared the poorest EU territory (we gotcha Bulgary, another shitty record for us 😎).But there is a bonus category: the 4-5 million people that work abroad all over Europe or the globe, people that have left for a better life.My parents fit into that category.They have been working abroad ever since I was 6 years old, now I’m 22.I grew up in a small studio apartment, raised by my grandma.Even when they have a few weeks off work, my parents don’t have a stable place to live.They have been trying to build a house for years now, and after 5 years they raised the “skeleton” and put a roof on top.That’s it.Because you need a lot of money and money for shitty paperwork and so on..When they come back from abroad for a few weeks every year, my parents live in a improvised cabin near the house-to-be, it has no shower or a toilet.My parents take showers at my grandma’s or at some neighbours.They also shit in one of those old time wooden toilets.My dad said the bathroom will be the first room to be done in the future house, because he’s fed up of shitting like they did in 1930 (his words).My parents worked in agriculture for 10 years and now my mom is a maid (7 days a week with maybe 2 hours off) in Italy and my dad is a truck driver around Europe (4 months on the road, 3 weeks off and so on). My dad left in February and just came back and my mom left in May and she will be home in October I think.She hasn’t seen my dad in months and it’ll be around 10 months when they see each other again in the fall (maybe, depending on how much my dad will be away).That’s just sad as shit.10 months without seeing your SO for what ? For a fucking toilet and proper plumbing, because it’s expensive as crap to build a bathroom and connect it to the city’s system and blabla.Paperwork just for a place to have a proper shit.And I Know I’ll go down that path as well as I have nothing keeping me here, nothing worth staying for.We’re still a communist country with a little capitalist make up on, ran by corrupt officials and it’s gonna take years to break that chain of corruption.I don’t wanna study here, or work here or create a family here.It’s not worth it.I won’t get to study abroad either, because up until a year ago I had no idea about where I’m headed in life.I went thru high school not having a clue about what I want to do, and it made me feel so worthless.I have one shitty childhood dream of becoming an artist but I’ll keep it a hobby and a dream, as you need money to get into the domain that I want to go in.I’ll go be a slave abroad so I’m not a burden for two people, enslaved by this shit system.I want my parents to make money and build their house, retire there and chill.My journey as a slave in pursuit of money is just getting started.",False,heyy04,Ordextraord,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/heyy04/the_situation_in_eastern_europe/,2,1

271,The Mexican Fisherman: a short story about modern business standards,"An American businessman took a vacation to a small coastal Mexican village on doctor's orders. Unable to sleep after an urgent phone call from the office the first morning, he walked out to the pier to clear his head. A small boat with just one fisherman had docked, and inside the boat were several large yellowfin tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish.
  ""How long did it take you to catch them?"" the American asked.
  ""Only a little while,"" the Mexican replied in surprisingly good English.
  ""Why don't you stay out longer and catch more fish?"" the American then asked.
  ""I have enough to support my family and give a few to friends,"" the Mexican said as he unloaded them into a basket.
  ""But... What do you do with the rest of your time?""
  The Mexican looked up and smiled. ""I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take a siesta with my wife, Julia, and stroll into the village each evening, where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos. I have a full and busy life, senor.""
  The American laughed and stool tall. ""Sir, I'm a Harvard M.B.A. and can help you. You should spend more time fishing, and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. In no time, you could buy several boats with the increased haul. Eventually, you would have a fleet of fishing boats.""
  He continued, ""Instead of selling your catch to a middleman, you would sell directly to the consumers, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing, and distribution, and move to Mexico City, then to Los Angeles, and eventually New York City, where you could run your expanding enterprise with proper management.""
  The Mexican fisherman asked, ""But senor, how long will all this take?""
  To which the American replied, ""15-20 years. 25 tops.""
  ""But what then, senor?""
  The American laughed and said, ""That's the best part. When the time is right, you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich. You would make millions.""
  ""Millions, senor? Then what?""
  ""Then you would retire and move to a small coastal fishing village, where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take a siesta with your wife, and stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos...""

273,Unions are *not* the answer.,"The left-communist theoretician Paul Mattick explains it as follows:

https://www.marxists.org/archive/mattick-paul/1975/lebel.htm

&gt;Parliamentary parties and trade unions lose their limited effectiveness when it is no longer possible to combine an improvement of workers’ living standards with a progressive expansion of capital. Under conditions which preclude a sufficient capitalist accumulation, that is, under conditions of economic crisis, the reformist activities of political parties and trade unions cease to be operative and these organisations abstain from their supposed functions, as they would now endanger the capitalist system itself. **They will rather try to help sustain the system, up to the point of directly sabotaging the workers aspirations for better living and working conditions. They will help capitalism overcome its crisis at the expense of the workers.** In such a situation, the workers, unwilling to submit to the dictates of capital, are forced to resort to activities not sanctioned by official labor organisations, to so-called wildcat strikes, factory occupations and other form of direct actions outside the control of the established labor organisations. These self-determined activities, with their temporary council structure, indicate the possibility of their radical application under arising revolutionary situations, replacing the traditional organisational forms, which have become a hindrance for both the struggle for immediate needs and for revolutionary goals.

The union form cannot transcend Capital, because it relies on it for it's own legitimacy. It *requires* dues-paying members and a bureaucratic link to Capital. This holds good even of genuinely radical outfits like the IWW.

What, in my view, would be more revolutionary would be a group that organized *against* the workplace, rather than inside of it, which taught workers how to *drop out* of the system sustainably.",False,hew12z,AndrewEldritchHorror,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hew12z/unions_are_not_the_answer/,5,1

278,Living on welfare can be a choice and it doesn't mean that one is lazy or doesn't want to work. How living on welfare allows me to give more to my community.,"I'm not living in the US but in one or those European social democracy with a generous welfare state and I thank life every day that I was born here. Unfortunately, here too the people on welfare are often ridiculed as lazy, entitled by those who have a full time job.

Here is why living on welfare can be a choice of life.

Living on welfare allows me to spend more time working on my non-profit organization which focuses on helping organizing cultural activities and events in the community as well as helping those in need (single parents, the unemployed, children with special needs, etc...).

We organize all sorts of events year round where the people living here can gather and get to know each other and socialize, which as a result created a closer more social community. We organize everything from dinners to barbecues to concerts to promoting local artists to sport activities such as treks and football matches to craft workshops, etc...

Of course, as a non-profit we benefit from donations by residents as well as subsidies from the government without which none of these would be possible, but that's not the point.

We went from being a community where no one talked to their neighbors, where some kids would drop out of school, where there was some petty crime issues (nothing bad, just theft and the like) to being a living breathing community where the people all know each other and watch out for their neighbors, the petty crime has disappeared and far fewer kids drop out of school.

I'm not talking credit for any of it, I'd just like people to recognize and to admit that communities benefit from having events and activities organized where anyone can join, to have a social non-profit looking out for the needy in the community and to do their best to help them. None of which would be possible without welfare, because I'd have to work 40h a week and would come back home too tired to do anything.

And I'm not earning a cent from the donations or subsidies, the surplus is systemically reinvested into the community, I'm only getting my welfare check and that's it.",False,hdpc50,GuianaSurvivor,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hdpc50/living_on_welfare_can_be_a_choice_and_it_doesnt/,0,1

Lets see where do i even start, i went to college getting an engineer degree, was excited for my future and felt like all i had to do was work and make money. 

Oh how i was wrong like many of you here, couple months in and ive been already working 12 hour days its really exhausting and i barely have enough time for anything when i get home. It pays the bills and my rent comfortably, but mentally and physically drains me so much, i dont feel like doing anything, all my interests are gone, i dont get to hang out with my friends anymore and it sucks, i fucking hate it. 

The people i work seem like they are in the same boat as i, talking to them just gave me an idea of what im getting into if i stayed long like them. Some have been with this company 10+ years and still dont enjoy it. Some move up and turn to big bootlickers, praising how good the company is and all its benefits, how our company is the best and we are lucky to be part of it. 

Honestly, its all bullshit i hate how they make it seem like its some kind of luxurious place where i would enjoy being for 12 fucking hours of my day. Luring you in with company phone and laptop, all these benefits, telling me how our company is doing so well even during the pandemic. I dont give a fuck, how YOU guys are doing its US the EMPLOYEES working our asses off to make you guys look good. 

I feel miserable here being the newest and smallest member in a “manly” industry most people i work with are cool, but work is work and they’ll throw you under the bus if they have to when it comes to blaming someone for something. I feel like i dont fit in this industry at all, and i feel lucky to realize wtf i will be doing before its too late like many guys i work with. 

 Throughout all that from what i said and knowing its antiwork sub, i would still be willing to work and i find that i am really fascinated with technology and IT jobs because of all the remote work i can be doing. I enjoy being at home and wont mind working from home, and also willing to get a pay decrease working at a place that offers remote work. Anyone know where i can start to find a remote job? Planning to work here until i hit the 1 year mark for experience and im getting the fuck outta here, but i want to make my next job something i wanna do. I am willing to learn and get certificates from now till then so i can have some kind of experience in IT so i can look for jobs next year.

325,Entrepreneurship not the answer?,"Warning: long post. Thank you for reading if you so. 

I just found this subreddit a few weeks ago and I’ve never felt more understood. I’ve worked a variety of jobs over the years ranging from physical labor to desk jobs to a brief stint in self-employment. I’m currently working a desk job, and the last few months working remotely have genuinely saved my sanity. 

I keep trying to formulate some plot to make money to be able to quit and not be reliant on another job, but I’ve run circles in my mind for almost 2 years now because of the dilemmas I see from every side. For example:

- when I had my own business I was working 14 hour days, and even though it paid off handsomely I was the most miserable and mentally unwell as I had likely ever been. However, I did feel a sense of accomplishment at the end for “weathering the storm” and in retrospect the pain didn’t seem so bad, although I know it was because I was crying / having panic attacks every day for a month. 

- at any job I’ve had either physical or mental I’ve been miserable after about month 3 when the honeymoon phase and excitement from leaving my last job started to wear off. I’ve always seen so many flaws in every job from the treatment to the authorities to the actual tasks. For a long time I thought there was something wrong with me because I couldn’t find contentment and then I went into convincing myself that I had to find some form of business ownership again or entrepreneurship. 

- however; the problem is that I have very strong moral issues with much of entrepreneurship, in regards to consumerism, materialism, and capitalism. I hate how marketing is constantly shoving every person, place, and thing down my throat and it physically disgusts me to think of doing that to others for my own sake, but I’m getting so depressed and miserable over the years that I keep going back and forth between selling out for the sake of getting money to be able to get “out of the rat race”. Part of me just always thinks “I should just do absolutely whatever I have to do to make my own life and situation better and then once I have enough money I can retire and work on the writing, art, hobbies, etc. I really want to”. The sad part is, I’ve even tried to on several occasions: I’ve tried to sell a product, sell myself as a personal brand or “coach”, come up with some new concept or idea and I just feel so phony and fake. I feel like such a sham and am gritting my teeth the whole time until I eventually just stop after a little while- hence I never stick with it or put in a real enough effort to actually have success with it. And in a way, it’s almost like I psychologically don’t believe I would be successful or would deserve that success because of how morally unaligned I would be with those pursuits. 

Basically I’m just wondering, does anyone have any true “solution” or advice, because even being my own boss or entrepreneurship is beginning to seem like a crock of shit too. I want to be a writer / artist essentially, but even a lot of those types end up falling into what I feel like is “selling out” by selling dumb merch, more consumerism, more commercialization of art. I don’t find it wrong to make money off of your art, but I do feel like there hits a certain point where it becomes a cash grab. I just want to make enough money to survive, and help my family. I don’t need a lot or want to be greedy, I just am so tired and drained thinking of wasting my entire life supporting causes I don’t believe in and working jobs I absolutely hate.

Interesting!,"Just to be clear, I know he’s 100% the greediest and most litigious bastard I have ever known. I know this is a ruse to make me disqualify for unemployment because he doesn’t want to pay the teeny tiny tax increase that will come from what I’ve collected so far.

I’m honestly not even sure if refusing/not responding to this would disqualify me, because I’m pretty sure that it has to have actual details of the job spelled out. Also, I’m not sure how the CARES “no work search requirement” affects the whole “you must take any job offered to you” deal, but I haven’t actually dropped below my normal hours this month and probably will not again. I’m not really even that worried about it. It’s just a great example of how fucked the system is. Oh and when he fired me, he offered one day of pay + 3 months of health insurance “in exchange for not filing for unemployment,” which was essentially illegal of him to do.


Anyway, THIS is the email he sent me:

“Hope this finds you well I got a notice from the unemployment of folks that you were collecting UC and they charge my from the fund that I had paid into

I am currently building a company, I am 22 years old, I've been working since I was 18 in fast food restaurants, now I am working part time in an ice-cream shop while building the future I want.

347,The thought of going back to my overbearing coworker makes me ill,"I had only been at my job a few months before lockdown began (UK) and in that time I grew to loathe the other person in my department. Let’s call her Mary. 

Mary is in her forty’s. Mary cannot work a computer. She cannot figure out how to open emails. She cannot work Word. Mary believes because I can do these things I am a technological genius. All day every day Mary will interrupt me, demanding I stop what I’m doing and help her. I try to teach her things, but she refuses, on one occasion putting her fingers in her ears and saying “Look I’m no good with this sort of thing! It’s easier this way!” We’re allowed to have headphones in at work to listen to low level music, and one day I noticed that I was not able to get through a whole song without being interrupted and having to pause it.

I made the mistake of giving Mary my number when I started. Her requests extended into the weekend, however these were not work related. She would text asking me things like how to share a post on Facebook, how to unfriend someone, and even explain what Twitter was. 

I have mentioned this to management. I was quite passive at first because I was new and didn’t want to start my new job by complaining about someone. Managements response was along the lines of “Well she’s been here a long time. It’s just who she is” They didn’t seem concerned that Mary was preventing me from doing the job they paid me for. 

Working at home has led to me being much more productive, mainly because I can actually do my job without her driving me crazy. But even then, she would use messenger to contact me and ask for help. And some of these matters would not even be work related. She once called saying she had just purchased a laptop and wanted me to set it up for her over the phone. 

Work started letting us come back part time. They only wanted us to come in once a week basically to show our faces and start getting back into the swing of having a routine. The day we could go in was our choice. Mary immediately called me “I’m going in on Tuesdays!” I decided I was going in on Thursdays. Mary text me asking where I was on her day, and when I didn’t reply immediately she called me repeatedly until I answered, saying that she felt it would be better if I came in when she was in as we would “work better as a team” In other words, “Come in so you can do my work as well as your own”

Work have now announced we are to return full time at the beginning of July. I don’t want to go back. The thought of putting up with Mary again almost makes me cry.

349,Just had my car REPOd because of my job struggles - any advice would be extremely helpful,"So, before this whole Coronavirus situation happened, I was working happily as an Uber driver making about $2,000-$3,000 a month. But then everything went to hell and it was no longer a viable work option. I stopped being able to pay off my bills and switched to Shipt to try and make the money I needed. For the most part it was working well, not nearly as well but it was enough to make some money. I ended up getting lazy, though, and stopped working for a week and a half or so from mental exhaustion, plus I was enjoying spending time with my best friend online as much as possible.

I was going to go back to working super hard with Shipt (12+ hour days plus Uber afterward for whatever crowd I could pull in to make extra income), but went to my car today and found it missing. I knew I was behind on payments and called the company that handles my payments and they confirmed it was Repod. Now I have to come up with anywhere between $1,200-$1,500 (of which I could maybe do like $500 right now) in order to get my car back. They told me on the phone that it would cost $300-$500 in repo fees and I'm about $900 behind on my actual car payment. I could maybe negotiate it down with them when they open tomorrow but I am not sure by how much or if I can get my car back at all. I might have to take out a payday advance loan (despite how dangerous that can be, and assuming I can even get that to work with my currently very terrible credit). But other than that I'm currently not sure what to do.

Does anyone have any advice at all? I'm on the verge of a severe anxiety attack from this happening today and recognize that it is, in good part, my own fault for not working harder.

Sometimes I wonder what society would look like if the cost of housing was more aligned with other usual expenses. I imagine that people would feel more secure, happier, take more risks in business ventures, learn or try new skills, or quit the job they hate to try something else that maybe doesn't pay as much.

355,WHY the system is so screwed,"So much anger at the status quo, so many sad lives, so much hopelessness here. But at least put the blame where it belongs - financial corruption in Washington, especially of Congress, especially by big money, corporate and otherwiise. Sorry, this turned into a rant (please read it anyway).

An example: Universities, the left and  the educational establishment have colluded to jack tuitions for their own benefit, brutally fuck students to the wall, even for a lifetime. They also created a false cover story promoted by the press (mostly corporate shills) that increasing college costs are what drive tuition upward (try: access to easy money). Why on earth would a business whose only real production cost is maintaining buildings and grounds have huge increases in expenses?

Universities ignore a huge conflict of interest by conning students into taking out loans from which the school gets the proceeds - an absolutely outrageous violation of their public trust as educators of young people. THAT is why tuition has gone berserk - no  brakes from tthe market. Everyone on the inside gets loads of money, including the Dept. of Education. 

The universities waste that money on fattening the adults who live in the system - worthless degrees, idiotic courses taught by idiotic professors, bureaucrats who make a living off the diversity scam, a-hole deans and administrators who spend their days suppressing the First Amendment, federal compliance officers, etc.

The truth is the educrats have created a phenomenal source of dirty money, supporting a vast, rotten financial base that keeps a privileged class insulated from the world outside - hidden behind lies that promote them as a force for social justice. 

Take a close look at illegal immigration and you will see a similar corrupt structure. I wish the folks on here would understand that is a big reason why they are stuck in low paying, demeaning jobs. 

That is the reality of social engineering and reliance on government, not of capitalism. So are Obamacare and Venezuela. The biggest issue in front of the US is stopping the flow of corrupt money, corporate and otherwise, to Congress, which creates such schemes and allows its members many ways to cash in personally. Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden are two corrupt politicos who have received billions in corrupt money by selling out the public - both acceptable as candidates for the US presidency.

I think it's the ultimate human tragedy that we only get one chance at life (atheistically) and we literally spend it working it away making someone else rich, and by the time we're allowed to stop we're already old and frail, ready to die. I think about how human existence was meant to be spent exploring the greater mysteries of life; trying to connect with nature through transcendentalism. But here we are - in the middle of a pandemic that is being downplayed by politicians bough by corporate overlords just so they can explore those same mysteries at the expense of human capital hoarding their riches. The depravity of our modern condition is that we were born into this broken social contract under the guise of civility and progress when it fact this is just an incredibly unfair food chain: The rich eat the poor, basically. Sure, we are sentient beings that enjoy things no other species enjoy, like comfort, hedonism, consumerism, etc. But, is it really worth it, though? I think we'd be happier with underdeveloped human ingenuity - sometimes watching a sunset at beach knowing you don't have to worry about anything is WAY better than getting that new pair of grails or that latest smartphone that has a much smoother and seamless processing power to give even more of your identity away to the powers that be. I think our species was meant to be kept in eternal captivity, as if we are paying for past, cosmic crimes against existence.

363,Mental Illness is Subjective Under Capitalism,"Being a sociopath, narcissist, and a psychopath are all rewarded under capitalism. A person can seldom hoard resources without exploiting those around them, and to exploit those around them, they must be completely devoid of empathy. In a system built on exploitation, honesty, empathy, and kindness are weaknesses. People see sociopaths, narcissists, and psychopaths as ""self-made,"" ""go-getters,"" and ""successful,"" whenever they manage to step on others to get themselves to the top.

365,Last night the interviewer asked me what my greatest accomplishment to date was... I had nothing but work or school related accomplishments.,"I had an interview for a part time job last night over zoom. The last question he asked me was “what is your greatest accomplishment or experience to date?” To not look dumb, I quickly said my education. Then I changed it to some award I won in high school, which is the truth. And I find that pathetic.

I’ve done nothing with my life. I’m 23F and the ONLY thing I’ve done is go to school and work. I’m so glad I found this subreddit. As much as I have put effort into doing internships, finding part time jobs, and getting degrees to have a (somewhat) good job, I still don’t really care about having to go to work. I’m studying to be a music teacher... but I know that’s just because I have to and not because I want to.

I want to be a full time musician instead (like most of us music teachers do), but I know that’s unsafe and not secure considering I have over $100k student loan debt and I DO want a house and to start a family in the coming years with my fiancé. Next year I planned on moving to NYC and just taking any job out there just to live in the middle of the music scene. But I was told the other day by a past boss that he has connections and can get me a job as a music teacher near my hometown.

I don’t want that at all. That’s not new or exciting. Why should I have to live in the same area and the same boring state I’ve lived in my whole life just for a job? The reason I can’t move is bc my teacher certification will be in this state, so I would at least have to work here for a year before moving states. The thought of this just makes me so sad.

There’s so much I want to do with my life. I want to travel the US by car and be a musician. I want to travel Canada by car too. I want to go backpacking in Eastern Europe. I want to play gigs every night. I want to have a somewhat decent career as a singer/songwriter. But all of this is going to be plagued by my career. Sure, I have summers off. But I’ve been hearing lately that because of fucking capitalism, teachers don’t get summers off anymore - they have to work a different job. There’s always work to do.

I have no idea what to do. I wish there was a remote job that paid decently enough (that I had a chance of getting) so I could just do gigs, travel, and cook. I’m just so depressed that my only accomplishments up until this point are work and school related. I want to be a music teacher SOMEDAY, don’t get me wrong. But not now. I’m not ready, I haven’t lived my life yet. I just wish I didn’t have to do this.",False,hg6h2n,throwawayyyss4days,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hg6h2n/last_night_the_interviewer_asked_me_what_my/,11,1

368,Wondering how many people here are also childfree?,"I had a hysterectomy two years ago at age 23 and I’m okay with it bc I already feel like I have no life between a 8 hr work day and 2 hour commute which thanks to COVID is now 5 minutes to my laptop on my couch except for going to the office once a week. 

I just get so touched out. Like I can’t talk to people for too much time or be around people all day I just need space. Kids would absolutely overwhelm me and take up any free time.

I just want to be productive in doing things I enjoy. My anti work mindset isn’t laziness it’s just.. I want to create and exist as a person and do things im passionate about. I like other people’s kids but I never ever want my own. Sometimes I get that sad feeling that I *want* a baby but don’t want to be a parent. I *want* to work but I want it to be my definition of work and a livelihood. 

Here’s to starting to pursue other avenues so I can spend the rest of my 20’s at least working part time doing what I want by my own volition and part time slaying away at some office.

I’ve worked as a public servant in state government for a while now and I’m just kinda over it. I was a workaholic for years and I climbed the ladder fast and make a really good salary for my age but my partner who thankfully is also childfree in mindset doesn’t at all understand why I’d want to take a pay cut or leave behind my retirement or the ton of leave time or promised pension (which isn’t as good as his since I started a few years later after they changed it  thanks to older generations totally and completely sucking it dry).

This has become a nonsensical rant but yeah. I’m just curious is anyone else childfree or plan to be? My partner is childfree too but we don’t see eye to eye on the definition of work. How did you get your partners to understand you have more of a free spirit than being a typical 9-5er? I don’t see myself doing the same job year after year. I want some autonomy or start my own small business and I’d tolerate working part time for someone.

In order to get your fair pay, just unionize now while you have the time. No need for revolution right now. We are down to about 10% unionized jobs from more than 30% about 70 years ago. This has been done before and jobs were decent, hence why boomers didn't have much of a problem back then. 

Many people have the time and money now, so there will be no better time than today. I repeat, if you don't unionize now, things will get worse and you will be even more miserable, likely until you die and your kids and grandchildren and so on die! 

I am working right now, but it looks like you can just Google your job title and/or location with the word union after to find relevant unions in your area. For example, ""office worker union"".

I googled this phenomena, out of curiosity, and the overwhelming majority of results are in - YOU are always to blame, and the company? Well, you're just not good enough for them. 

Resume looks nice, you interviewed well - but you don't have a social media presence and that cost you the job, sorry.

You don't ""network"" enough. Anxiety? Introvert? Very niche for the market? Oof, that's a you problem. This other guy has way more friends from college so he got the job.

Speaking of college - you went, right? Because you need a degree for this $10/hr phone job. Oh you have a degree... well you also need this license which costs another $1000+ and 3 months of your time. You have ALL that? Damn, you're overqualified.

This isn't just a vent post. It's alarming that so many people are unemployed for no reason (pre-virus) and are then blamed for their unemployment or even SHAMED for it.

385,"Can't believe there's other people who think this stuff about work , I thought I was alone (rant)","I've been thinking this way about work ever since I got my first job at 15 and had a complete breakdown because I felt so bad for the people who worked at my job and were adults and had been doing it for years. It was working at a farm doing packaging stuff. At like 20 I called my mom sobbing because I was working a job that was ""ruining my life"" not because it was particularly bad, but because it took all my time and I was a young person trying to be free in the world and I was already trapped in this horrible cycle of work to live, live to work. But she didn't get it, and I felt so ashamed for being weak that I blame my depression and anxiety on other things so that people would understand.
I just feel like, how did we all accept that working is what makes you a valuable human being and if you don't do it then you are not worth shit? It's horrible. And the thing is, if working wasn't absolutely required, I'd definitely do some of it anyways, just to help society. I'd gladly do it. But the way we have like limited what kind of jobs each person does means that everything is outsourced and each person is relegated to one form of contribution and I think it just ruins all our humanity and all our community/potential connections. Because when someone needs my help or something if I'm already working 40 hours a week, I'm way more likely to say ""that's not my job."" 
Anytime I've criticized working culture in my life people have made fun of me like I'm stupid and just don't understand economics. Which is partly true, I don't understand economics (it was because I was like what is job creation, if there is a job to be done, shouldn't it already be there? Why are we creating it). But I know that humans are miserable and that should matter. 
I also think the people at the top are miserable, because they've bought in with their very lives and energy and time into this system that makes us all relate to one another in terms of money and production value. They're just rich enough to not be outwardly miserable, but I think this shit erodes your spirit and your ability to connect with other people.  
There has to be a different way to live.
And, I hate that being part of the working class takes away your ability to explore art and ideas and have a forum to like discuss them and be seen and heard about your ideas about the world. You can still do these things obviously by yourself, but it just feels like there is no one who gives a shit about my feelings because if my feelings were correct I would have ascended the magical structure already. Like why do we care about celebrities thoughts on things they have no background in? Just because they are rich and famous we should listen to what they think about dieting, or about education, or child care, etc?

You can be who you want to be and that just doesn't serenate well with me. Why do you think so many people vent after work? Because they have to hold it in and can only talk about their true feelings when the boss isn't there. It's always ""omg, Bill is such a complete asshole, he's so hard to work with.""

- life-threatening mismanagement and subsequent blaming of employees for corporate fuck ups (meaning clients lives were at risk because of policy, and employees were blamed for issues they tried to bring to the company's attention for a full year)


- consistently asking people to work 16 hour shifts and not giving overtime (unless asked directly)


- withholding money needed to buy clients food, clothing, and other essentials


- withholding client's personal funds for months at a time


- consistently paying fewer hours on pay stubs than were worked (I was paid $300 / the $1000 I was owed this pay period, and when I asked my coworker who to contact she just said ""oh, they do that a lot"")

I get home so tired I can't do anything else but go to sleep. I pulled something in my back a couple weeks ago and the hoops I have had to jump through with workers comp is ridiculous!

422,"We need to break the economy of slavery, once and for all","The problem is too many people believe that a slavery based system is the only way to make things work. 

The problem is the slave system has been in effect from the early days of where there is registry of a civilization. 

Capitalism simply changed the style of slavery, instead of directly threatening people and using physical force and deliberate mechanisms to make the slave work, now we have psychological schemes that make people believe that the right thing to do is to be a good slave. 

One of the basic concepts is to switch the idea of slave-work to ""career"" and to ""be professional"". Instead of the physical punishment a lazy or rebel slave would have, now there is the psychological punishment, where the person is regarded as unworthy, valueless, despicable, deplorable, a loser, a waste of space, a self-absorbed parasite, a free loader, an enemy of society, a diseased. A '""jobless"" person is not a person. And the VAST MAJORITY of people hold that type of view. 

Even if an individual is a helpful person, a person that actually does things that would be considered ""work"" if they were performed under an official contract, but there's no paycheck, the person is viewed as useless. If you simply go about helping people, doing lots of work, but has no official ""career"" you would be seen as a bump, a drifter, a hippie, but if you have an official job with a monthly paycheck doing NOTHING, you'd be regarded as a productive member of society. 
Also, in many jobs, the amount of money the person needs in order to be eligible to participate in that kind of work (social position) can be equivalent to the actual pay the person is getting, therefore the person's salary is used only to maintain her as a functional worker (basically, the money they get serves to pay for the lifestyle attached to the job position). That is the very dynamic of slavery. The slave has what is necessary to properly perform their daily functions. I'm not disputing that life quality has greatly improved to most people, and that real slavery with violent punishment was much worse and a horrible thing, but the social dynamics are still prevalent today.",False,hcglhv,JorSum,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hcglhv/we_need_to_break_the_economy_of_slavery_once_and/,5,1

429,A fork in the road.,"Hello all. Just found this community and really connected with the ideas I have been reading about here. 

I am a 28yo nurse. I have been working for about three years in nursing and I’m halfway through my masters degree. 

Some back story. My dad passed away a few years ago and he spent his entire life working 80 hours a week until his last few years where he actually got to live a life he enjoyed. Then he died. 

That shit changed me. I realized how fragile life is and how much I did not want to do what he did. Because of this I have been studying the FIRE movement. If you haven’t heard of this its financial Independence retire early, basically how can you best save and invest your assets to retire at a younger than normal age. This post isn’t about investing strategy, but is a tool I plan to employ. 

Anyhow, I’m starting up my school again in the fall and I have two more years until I graduate. My masters degree will come with a considerable pay raise, but I can’t honestly say that I’m excited to do the job. I can’t honestly say that I like or love my job that I have right now. That’s not to say that I’m not good at it, I’m actually pretty damn good at nursing. But I got pushed into the Career field by well intentioned parents. 

I do have special moments that I will cherish forever, and I am thankful for those. But by and large I view my job as a way to earn income and nothing more. I am proud of what I can do to save someone’s life And I am very thankful for the opportunities that I have had because of nursing. But it is a job. Philosophically, I don’t understand how someone could love something that they have to do. I need to work to earn money. By definition, I am not acting upon my own volition. I am in the sense that I chose the job but you essentially have a list of options that you must choose from, you don’t get to choose to throw away the list entirely. All in all, I want to throw the list away, I want to quit working by becoming financially independent. I’m not sure if I should invest another two years into education and 15 grand. It will bump up my pay considerably, but I’m not sure I can handle the stress of it anyhow. The problem is is I’m so far deep into it I might as well finish and at least have the degree. Who knows, maybe I’ll love what I can do with my masters... or is that just another dream the system wants me to believe. After all, I wouldn’t be getting my masters if it didn’t give me a pay raise. 

I figure this will be the place to ask this type of question. I’m new here I appreciate any thoughts you can share!",False,hbsy42,borborgym,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hbsy42/a_fork_in_the_road/,5,1

man in a round hole. That is, the right man in the wrong

laziness and a good deal of inefficiency are merely fitness,
displacement. Of you are compelled to do the thing you are

efficient at it; if you are forced to do work you are not

443,What are your thoughts on feminism?,"If i were a woman, i would not want to work 40 hours a week. I would prefer to stay home and take care of the children and cook and clean. All of these tasks do'nt add up to the time spent on a job including getting ready and commuting.

Cooking and cleaning can be done in 2 hours. Meal prep to save time. Vacuums, swiffers, dish washers etc make household tasks quick and easy leaving more time to spend with the children. 

Theres no boss. Do everything in pajamas. Play music. Watch spongebob with the kids. That seems like a much better life than going to work everyday. I find it hard to believe that women would give that up to go work a job. 

If i were a woman i would not want to be equal to a man if it means working a 9 to 5. I rather not have to work. Ironically women have given up what seems a better deal in the pursuit of equality.

444,Work schedule change,"In the past four weeks since we returned to work after the quarantine closure, it has been especially difficult.

I’ve been used to having four day weekend and it was so nice. They also changed my schedule. I used to work Mon-Thurs now they have changed me to Tues-Fri. While this helps in some aspects of my schedule, it also extremely complicates things between my boyfriend and I because I usually stay at his house a certain couple of days in the week and now I have to change that. It doesn’t sound that complicated, but it is and now I will be seeing my boyfriend less because of it. I’m just overall bummed out and have the Sunday night blues except now that happens on Monday nights for me :( I don’t know what to do. I feel so trapped in my job.

448,Only 2 Months Into My First Job,"And I can say that this is without a doubt one of the worst experiences of my life thus far. It's fucked up my mental health just as it was starting to improve and my entire life has become about work.

Who the hell thought selling the extremely limited amount of time of our one chance at existence for some bullshit imagined value was a good idea?

451,How long do you think it's going to be before employers start including the deep and dark webs into their background searches on prospective employees?,"Of course it will never happen, you say. It's an unconscionable invasion of privacy and a gross breach of the sacred and implicit but endangered separation of work and personal spaces. But keep this in mind: at least 25 states have passed laws preventing employers from asking for, demanding, coercing, etc., employees to provide passwords or access to social media accounts, such as Facebook and twitter.

Those laws are there for a reason. They weren't developed by forward-thinking legislators taking proactive steps to prevent this from happening. They were responding to employers who were actually doing this. Facebook went live in 2004. It became available to everyone in 2006 (remember, prior to that, you had to have a school email address associated with a participating college or university). I recall the first news articles about the practice of employers asking for the social media passwords of prospective employees appearing in 2008 or 2009 or so. Facebook reported 500 million users in July 2010.

Think about that level of ubiquity. More people than lived in the United States were on Facebook. And suddenly, an entire country's worth of people's social networks were the subject of scrutiny by their employers. Who you were friends with, what they said, what you said, about whom you said it, your political opinions, your sexual orientation; Facebook was a window into all of that data, and employers were predicating people's ability to earn a living on access to that window.

After numerous breaches and scandals (and all sorts of individual travails, no doubt), we have all learned a big lesson about privacy. We have developed a certain cultural understanding about how social media ought to be used, how to curate our image and how to adjust privacy settings in order to create different virtual social spaces with different functions and different levels of intimacy.

But there's still a way into that window. And, if they did it once before, do you suppose that our employers wouldn't try again to gain access to it?

When you get an alert about how Experian or Target or your bank or, yeah, even LinkedIn got hacked and your data ended up on the deep and/or dark web, you're usually offered some complimentary credit monitoring service as a means of apologizing, just in case some bad actors get a hold of your accounts and start opening credit cards or running pump-and-dump scams in your name. But nothing comes of it, and, eventually, you forget it ever happened.

Your data isn't being abused because there probably just aren't any buyers to whom its worthwhile. Most cybercriminals are motivated by monetary aims, and your data is, potentially, the means to that end. Your emails probably aren't exciting enough and your bank account probably isn't big enough for anyone to put the work in to extract that information from you.

But what if that information became valuable in and of itself? What if there was an actor out there who was interested not in converting that information into money, but just in seeing it as it is? What if there was a large organization with funds enough to invest in acquiring that information and examining it in order to predict people's behaviors, to gauge their opinions, to see if associating with them poses any reputational risk? That's what a background check is, right? When you go to take out a loan or get a new job or rent an apartment, this is the kind of information that people want to know about you.

So, if someone gets a hold of this data and uses your name, your email address, your driver's license number, your Social Security number, etc., they can use that data and the data that you have freely provided them to track the movements that you previously thought were invisible: what you say on Reddit, the beer you drink, what kind of porn you watch, your opinions on abortion, what kind of medication you take, what kinds of books you read, where you shop, what you buy.

Some of this information will be available to people who want it without even having to break a law. They won't have to hack an account or buy a password. All it is going to take is a username, in most cases; just one search for that unique callsign that you use could turn up dozens of sites where you have made comments, uploaded photos or left reviews. Everything that we do online leaves behind an artifact, and if someone knows what to look for, those artifacts are breadcrumbs that will lead them right to your window.

And, as for someone being able to purchase your password and use it to climb through that window, take their shoes off and really feel the carpet in your house between their toes (metaphorically, speaking, of course), I think there is actually a lot of opportunity for large, powerful, well-funded organizations to take advantage of their resources to affect changes in legislation such that obtaining our passwords will be either outright legal or associated with repercussions that are so minor as to be negligible.

The primary piece of legislation that covers passwords and accounts is the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), which was originally passed in 1984 and primarily to provide protection for businesses from monetary damages. It's 35 years old. It's been amended a number of times, most recently in 2010, but given the rate that our technologies and the way that we use them change, I think it's safe to say that the law, in this case, was written to regulate a reality that doesn't exist anymore.

Do you remember that spate of headlines that said you were going to go to federal prison for using your brother's girlfriend's friend's HBO password to watch Game of Thrones? Well, that was the result of the court decision over a CFAA revealing that the law is not well-defined. The United States v. Nosal was a trial about a guy who started his own business and hired former coworkers to obtain information on his behalf from his former employer. The implication in the decision was that, if by violating a Terms of Service by sharing a password opens you up to federal prosecution under the CFAA, then everyone who shares their Netflix password is committing a federal crime.

But that seems excessive. Netflix clearly isn't suffering much from password sharing practices; it reports billions of dollars in revenue hundreds of millions in profit every year and it doesn't pay any taxes.

The problem is that if and when the CFAA is amended or replaced with legislation that clarifies what constitutes ""defrauding traffics"" by using passwords to achieve access without or in excess of the authorization granted to a user by a Terms of Service such that it's okay for us to use each other's passwords to watch our favorite Sunday night shows, depending on how that is phrased, it might open up the door for corporations to start using those passwords that they glean from the deep and dark webs to access your accounts and see what you have hidden behind your privacy settings—to look through your window, so to speak.",False,hbkjxq,paraouji,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hbkjxq/how_long_do_you_think_its_going_to_be_before/,0,1

462,Both love and hate 2020 for doing this to me,"I thought I enjoyed working. I liked being productive. But then I got laid off due to coronavirus causing a lack of business. 

I’ve been laid off for three months now and just got an email that my employer is going to start bringing people back. That email made me face a really really awful realization. 

The last three months have been, by far, the happiest of my young-adult life. I haven’t gone through waves of anxiety and depression. I’m closer with my partner, I’ve talked with more friends and gotten in contact with people I haven’t heard from in a long time. I’ve pursued hobbies and finally had time to develop a workout routine that I can actually stick to. My diet is better because I have time to plan meals and cook. 

Don’t get me wrong, I didn’t hate my job. But this time off really made me realize that the work culture of America is so skewed. We value all the wrong things and I hate that we have to spend more time with coworkers and bosses than the people we truly care about. 

I don’t want to go back but I have to. There are bills to pay. I love 2020 for helping realize what really matters but I hate it because I know that my ignorance was bliss to a certain extent. I didn’t know what I was missing so I would dutifully work my life away...because that’s just how it is.

463,In trouble with HR for sharing my negative workplace experiences,"TL;DR: I'm in trouble for honestly sharing negative experiences at my company.  Long rant ahead because I am pissed.

I have worked for Greedy Healthcare Company (GHC) for a mere six months, and it has been a nightmare.  They screwed up my benefits, so it took 5 months to get things sorted, and I was passed from phone line to phone line to email to phone line, rinse and repeat for weeks.  I quickly began to feel like GHC  was doing whatever they could to avoid providing me the benefits I'd been promised, but I didn't give up the fight.  Finally, as of June 1st (5.5 months after hire), it was sorted, but who knows how much I overpaid in that time frame because our pay stubs are impossible to decipher.  It also took 5 months to get my cell phone reimbursement, which GHC only finally agreed to once they required I work from home, and I was using upward of 1000 minutes per month.

Since I've been there, we've lost our previous director, 3 full-time nurses and 3 PRN nurses.  Others in the office are looking for new jobs, and I haven't stopped looking for a job since a month after I started.  GHC is the kind of company that just combines job titles when people quit or when they make cuts, so I'm already working under two job titles, then have also been ""delegated"" a laundry list of other massive projects, including one that is 100% a nurse's job, and I am NOT a nurse.  My concerns have been met with, ""Oh, it's easy!  You can do it!  You're so responsible!  You're so organized!""  Meanwhile, no instruction or training is being provided for ANYTHING.  I trained myself on how to do my highly regulated, Medicare-dictated job...and I know I'm doing it wrong in many cases, but I don't know who to go to for help.  The others with my title had no training, either.

My boss is 90 days late submitting my 90-day review (it's done, she just hasn't turned it in), and she's constantly telling me we should talk so she can teach me how to do some of these ""delegations,"" and even though I remind her at least once a week, nothing ever comes of it.  But the final straw is that they are refusing to give me a copy of the job description I signed on hire.  My requests have simply been ignored.

So I left an Indeed review that gave a short version of all these things and gave the GHC 2/5 stars.  Honest and representative of my experience.  I deleted the review a couple days later when I realized it listed my job title, which would easily identify me, as I'm the only one in my office.  But it was apparently too late, as I received an Outlook calendar invite yesterday that said, ""Conference call.""  The only participants were myself, my boss, and our regional HR person.  I asked what it was about, and my boss just said, ""Your Indeed review.""

Our patients and their families are suffering because Greedy Healthcare Company cuts left and right and demands more and more of whoever is either brave or stupid enough to stick around.  I have a job interview today 45 minutes before my HR ""conference call.""  Please wish me luck.

466,Employers assume their employees are stupid.,"I guess this realisation fully hit me today when my previous employer (temp agency) thought they could try deducting negative/unworked hours from my last paycheck. At least that's what I assume happened because the maximum number of hours they can deduct under certain circumstances is the amount that's missing. I'm still waiting for my paystub for details.

See, the collective agreement that my labour contract is based on is cut and dried in that regard. The temp agency can deduct up to a certain number of negative hours a) if the employee quits on their own or b) if the employer terminates the contract without notice (this can only be done under circumstances, like theft, I guess). 

Neither of which is the case for me. 

All I had to do was find a PDF of the collective agreement and read the bit about deduction of negative hours. It's not even a matter of interpretation or exception. The right to deduct unworked hours from an employee's last paycheck clearly doesn't apply in my situation. And still they tried. 

They count on people not knowing their rights or deciding that legal steps aren't worth it financially. They feel invincible, superior and like they are above the law.

Getting 26 weeks of income for sitting on my ass is a pretty trivial benefit compared to the aggregate amount of years spent working.

0.5 years on UI / 55 years spent at school or work  = **0.91% of your total years before retirement.** So that's compensation to sit on your ass for nearly 1% of your years spent at school or work full-time.

Yet, people shame me if they find out I'm on unemployment. They seem thoroughly disturbed by it. They look at me with pity. Maybe with disdain as well, ""this lazy POS leeching off society, come on, get the fuck back to work you sloth."" This mere 1% of my working years being subsidized infuriates them.

Money has been running tight lately so I was forced to pick up a new part time job at a local grocery store. I had to mentally prepare myself because I heard the horror stories about working in retail and interacting with customers.

Anyway I started working a few weeks ago and was expecting the worst, but my experience so far has actually been not so bad? The pay isn’t incredible, but it’s several dollars more than what I was making before at my old job. What’s more is that my coworkers have all been very welcoming for the most part, and I’ve made a couple of good friends already. In all my previous workplaces everyone just kind of ignored each other and did their own thing, but here people constantly chat with everyone else while they work and it makes the shift go by so much faster.

The management at this new job is also a lot better than what I’m used to. At my old place my manager would get super mad whenever I needed to take a day off, but here they’re completely fine with it as long as I let them know beforehand.

So here’s my dilemma. All my life I’ve been against the idea of working because I believe my time belongs to me and me alone. Why should I put in so much effort so the rich get richer? But ever since I started this new job I’ve found myself being excited to wake up every morning? I don’t know how to feel about this but I’m starting to get worried that I’ll become a bootlicker at this rate.

480,Don't forget: your eligibility to find housing is also dependent on your shit job,"My partner and I have been filling out rental applications lately. I'm somewhat new to the requirements for applying for a lease on a new apartment or house, and I am straight up appalled at some of the requirements we need and the amount of info the landlords need at times. Here's a few examples that make my stomach turn:

1. Credit checks. You need an acceptable imaginary number that is based on your spending and debt. Are you trying to save money by NOT having a credit card? Fuck you! You can't live here. 

2. Income verification. Screenshots of your paystubs from your shit job. Don't forget that they need your managers' name and number so they can verify that you are, in fact, a wage slave. Don't make three times the amount of rent per month for a house that probably has rats and has no washer and dryer? Fuck you! You can't live here.

3. Bank verification. Not only do they need a credit check, they also need to take a peek at how much money you have in your checking and savings accounts, to make sure they can bleed you dry when they require a deposit that is rent x 3. Oh, you don't have enough money for a deposit that we're probably never going to give back to you when you move out anyway? Fuck you! You can't live here.

4. Work history verification and housing verification. They need a list of every job and place you've lived in for at least the last three years. Do you not have the phone numbers, addresses, names, and company titles of every single individual you've ever lived with in the last three years because you were desperately floating from room to room in an effort to not be homeless? Are you not in contact with every single individual you've ever been forced to live with in every single slum you've ever been forced to stay at? Fuck you! You can't live here.

5. Pets........just fuck you, you can't live here. 


So not only do I have to be a wage slave for my whole life, I also have to beg these fucking slumlord bottom feeders to pwease pwease let me live in their shitholes and prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that I am indeed a subservient little robot that works for the capitalist machine.

481,What if slavery abolition had another purpose?,"Foreword, I'm not encouraging slavery, it's been an immoral practice for millenias, wrong and people in this sub know how ""modern slavery"" feels like, so...  

Anyways, I just had a random thought earlier today. What if, back 200 years ago, when slavery in the US at least, was abolished, it wasn't abolished for the sake of the slaves but beacuse some dude in the 1% or top ranks or call it whatever you want, thought ""You know what? Why enslave a few when we can enslave everybody?""  

Put it this way. Inbefore slavery banning, there where pretty much two major social classes. The upper class, made of laid back fat fucks who made slaves do all their chores (sounds familiar?) and the lower class, people who were living by what they were producing, such raising animals and growing vegetables (a point of start where the upper class was at some point in time too). There was the middle one as well, you could think of proffessors or doctors but they were not as common as today. This is mostly for the fact thay cities were not as big and developed as today and most of the population was living in the countryside. Also probably, this is the point where the whole ""work hard and you'll make it big"" bullshit story was born but this is for another discussion.

Yet, the industrial revolution happened and you really couldn't expect to cover all the workforce needed for the different emerging industries with the back then existing slaves. That baby born capitalism needed more workforce in order to satisfy its belly to grow up into what it is today. So they replaced slavery by employing people who needed money to survive anyway and who didn't have a choice but to find a job. Fast forward to 2020 and this sub exists.

494,"Choosing money over happiness, or happiness over money","I grew up in a very underdeveloped, impoverished area of the United States, where rugged individualism and pulling oneself up by the bootstraps was basically dogma. The picturesque images of my country I saw on TV, the lavish lifestyles- all of that did not exist in my hometown. I come from a family of poor farmers. One of my parents left my siblings and I, and the other one died. I spent part of my teenage years living with a social worker and her family, and another part of it with my grandparents, who got lucky and found a 'career' later in life that enabled us to enter the middle-class.

I never understood the obsession with money, mostly because I lived somewhere that lacked the opulent luxuries that many people on TV had. Not really much to do if all you see is fields, one gas station, and one grocery store. I worried more about being bullied at school for having Autism and being gay, the hard-drug addicts that roamed the neighborhood, and whether or not my family would be robbed again, than I did about status and ""what do you want to be when you grow up?""

My educational prospects were severely hampered due to my upbringing. The public school I went to was not up to par with the state's standards, and it was very hard for people to advance to university level. If they managed to get that far, many people were not prepared for the rigor and got very poor grades or dropped out.  I was told that my education was the most important priority, as it would open doors towards a future career. I was forced into perfectionism, and have always felt broken when I fell short of that.

I had a traumatic event happen during high school that gave me severe PTSD. This crippled me, especially later in high school whenever I was taking college level classes and working at a part time job- because my foster family didn't adequately provide for us.  I fumbled whenever I managed to get into a very low-tier university that didn't even offer my STEM major, and despite getting good grades, had to take time off to do minimum wage warehouse work because I struggled academically, was very stressed, and really needed more money.  There is absolutely no industry and no jobs where I live, so you typically have a 2 hour daily commute to even go to a ramshackle city with some fast food joints and Walmart/Target.

This was honestly the worst time of my life. I was in an abusive relationship and my ex boyfriend coerced me into working full time and being his personal housemaid. My feet and back have never felt the same since I was forced to work retail, warehouse, and food jobs. But if I didn't have a job, I was useless to everyone.  Despite the fact that I dedicated lots of time towards learning Algebra, Geometry, Trig, and other subjects I had not properly been taught in school, so that I could return to college.

 I transferred to a respectable school that gave me a full scholarship for Computer Science. Didn't realize things could get even more miserable than when I was wage-slaving full time for Walmart. The stress and the pressure to succeed was suffocating. I never made a single friend, as people were competitive, cutthroat, and seemed to care more about expanding their linkedin network than companionship. My school did not provide me any disability accomodations and seemed to get frustrated whenever I complained about the conduct of some faculty towards disabled students, and how it was impossible to get academic help from them.

 I've had over 10 different therapists, and been on over a dozen psych medications over the course of my lifetime, but none of it helped. I was so drugged up last year at university I could barely function. All because I was not being productive enough and ""depressed"".  When the reality is, I am depressed due to the state of the world and the crushing reality that my whole life has been spent trying to be someone I'm not so that I could succeed in the rat race, not some chemical imbalance.

I realized I could not go on at that school. I was so upset everyday that I couldn't even will myself to go to class. Around this time, I had started seeing someone long distance, and went to his country to visit him over one of my academic breaks. Living in the English countryside seemed like an escape from the dog-eat-dog capitalistic hellhole that I was living in. So in secrecy, I began applying to UK universities. My grandparents pushed me into applying to transfer to other schools in the USA, and I hid that I was trying to move to the UK.

I got an unconditional offer to study what I truly wanted- Neuroscience- at a pretty good Russel Group uni, rather than push myself further in the hot mess general education curriculum here in the USA. The kicker was, I also go accepted to an Ivy League school, and have been pushed heavily to attend due to the ""prestige"" and the career prospects that come from being in the upper echelons of academia.

However, I'm honestly sick of everything that is happening in my country. I don't give a shit if I get paid a lower salary after graduation when I start my work visa, I don't give a shit if I can't buy 10 different brands of pasta in the store, I don't give a shit if I have to give up some of these ""luxuries and freedoms"" everyone seems to treasure so much. I hate the idea of a career, but I'd much rather pursue potential happiness in a place that won't work me to death rather than pulling 60 hour weeks as a minimum wage lab tech here in the states, or being a developer-slave to a massive corporation. 

Everyone is saying I am stupid to give up the chance to go to an Ivy League- if they give me decent scholarship money.

500,There is a difference between Life and Survival. [by CrimethInc.],"Whatever medical science may profess, there is a difference between Life and survival. There is more to being alive than just having a heartbeat and brain activity. Being alive, really alive, is something much  subtler and more magnificent. Their instruments measure blood pressure and temperature, but overlook joy, passion, love, all the things that make life really matter. To make our lives matter again, to really get the most out of them, we will have to redefine life itself. We have to dispense with their merely clinical definitions, in favor of ones which have more to do with what we actually feel. 

As it stands, how much living do we have in our lives? How many mornings do you wake up feeling truly free, thrilled to be alive, breathlessly anticipating the experiences of a new day? How many nights do you fall asleep feeling fulfilled, going over the events of the past day with satisfaction? Most of us feel as though everything has already been decided without us, as if living is not a creative activity but rather something that happens to us. That’s not being alive, that’s just surviving: being undead. We have undertakers, but their services are not usually required; we have morgues, but we spend most of our time in office cubicles and video arcades, in shopping malls, in front of televisions. Of course suburban housewives and petty executives are terrified of risk and change; they can’t imagine that there is anything more valuable than physical safety. Their hearts may be beating, but they no longer believe in their dreams, let alone chase after them.

But this is how the revolution begins: a few of us start chasing our dreams, breaking our old patterns, embracing what we love (and in the process discovering what we hate), daydreaming, questioning, acting  outside the boundaries of routine and regularity. Others see us doing this, see people daring to be more creative and more adventurous, more generous and more ambitious than they had imagined possible, and join us one by one. Once enough people embrace this new way of living, a point of critical mass is finally reached, and society itself begins to change. From that moment, the world will start to undergo a  transformation: from the frightening, alien place that it is, into a place ripe with possibility, where our lives are in our own hands and any dream can come true.

So do what you want with your life, whatever it is! But to be sure you do get what you want, think carefully about what it really is, first, and how to go about getting it. Analyze the world around you, so you’ll know which people and forces are working against your desires, and which ones are on your side… and how you can work together with us. We’re out here, living life to the fullest, waiting for you—hopping trains across the United States, organizing political protests in French public schools, writing beautiful letters at sunrise in Bangkok. We just finished making love in the corporate washroom a minute before you walked in on your half hour lunch break. And Life is waiting for you with us, on the peaks of unclimbed mountains, in the smoke of campfires and burning buildings, in the arms of lovers who will turn your world upside down.

Fuck all other big ticket purchases like the latest iPhone, big houses, cars and other material stuff. I realized long ago that many of these stuff go obsolete as soon as another newer one comes out and only serves to trap you further into financial debt and push back your ""retirement"" years.

Back in 2012, I worked as a teller for a large bank in New England. One morning at around 9 AM, my father (who was only in his early 40s) had a heart attack. I was scheduled to work at 1 PM. When I got to the hospital, I called the manager at the branch and explained the situation to her. The first words out of her mouth were, ""No no no no. We are really busy today and you need to be here for 1 PM."" I explained to her that I was going to stay with my father (who at this point was critical). She would not take that for an answer and kept insisting that I call her back in 1/2 hour and let her know what time I would be in... Not once did she say anything about my father. I was beyond taken back, and yet, unsurprised. I ended up blowing her off because the bank was the last thing on my mind that day.

At around 1:30 PM, and after 4+ missed calls, she leaves me a final voicemail saying ""Hello, I just want to let you know that everything is under control at the branch,"" and then goes into telling me a bunch of work-related stuff. Again, not once bringing up my father or saying any kind of condolence. I found the whole situation to be sickening. Over the years, I realized that most managers and companies operate in this inhumane way; it's always business first and the customers first.

535,"The concept of a ""two weeks notice"" should be ABOLISHED. Employees should be free to quit a terrible job on the spot without it being taboo or burning a bridge.","Feeling the title pretty hard as of late. Can't give explicit details for privacy reasons, but basically, I work for a private company that sends me out to individual clients/cases.

I currently only have one client/case...and it's been a nightmare since day one. I am the only employee who's been able to handle the client, who is the most volatile, demanding, neurotic, and rude person I've ever worked for. I've tried splitting the case with coworkers just to deal with her less, to no avail...she complains about them all, and they've all been promptly removed from the case. For reasons I'm still not entirely sure of, she only wants me. So I've been dealing with her shit for a year and a half now. I find a lot of her choices to be super shady and unethical (choices I often have to personally carry out for her, though they make me feel anxious/guilty AF). All I can do is express my concerns to my equally morally bankrupt boss, who doesn't care.

Early into the case, I was fed up and ready to leave my company. Not only because the case was miserable, but because my pay was absolutely TERRIBLE. So I found a new job and put in my two weeks. Because this case was so unusually big in terms of hours, my boss was making a LOT of $$$ on this case. When I gave notice, my boss and her assistant hounded me almost DAILY trying to get me to stay. They knew that finding a replacement the client approved of would be borderline impossible and they'd likely lose the client if I left. As an added bonus, the client was especially treating me like absolute garbage at work every day because she was so very pissed I was leaving. Then my boss played her final hand: a 5$/hour raise (basically the industry maximum). So I ended up staying.

The client ended up getting a little better for a while. Then the pandemic hit, and it's back to square one in terms of her being a neurotic nightmare with terrible ethics that my crooked boss happily enables. Though I will likely have to take a pay cut if I leave, I'm at the point where I've made the choice to do that. Very soon.

But given how my company and my client handled my two weeks before, I'm determined not to put one in again when I find a new job. I do not want to deal with the hostility from the client (which I think will be MUCH worse this time around) and my boss basically trying to get me to sell my soul for a price. 

In my opinion, even in the best of times, I think the concept of a two weeks is total bullshit and if someone wants to quit a miserable job on the spot, it shouldn't be taboo. I've heard many stories where the company fires the employee during the two weeks (WTF) or the bosses/coworkers are extremely hostile/unprofessional in response to the notice, which the employee has to just awkwardly deal with until they're free to actually leave...something I know firsthand.

I know I'll ultimately burn the bridge when I leave my company without notice (I know a lot of people would tell me to suck up the abuse that'll come with a formal notice, but I just refuse). But I've done good work for this miserable company for 3 years, so losing the good reference just feels so unfair to me.

If any of you have advice on how to get around this shitty situation (or just getting around putting a two weeks in general with minimal issues), I'd be open to hearing it. Overall, I just wanted to vent about this shitty practice/formality. It really should be optional if not abolished outright.",False,hcq7ce,StomachKnots,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hcq7ce/the_concept_of_a_two_weeks_notice_should_be/,61,33

I was planning on doing one of those three night treks just over a month from. So I stop in the shop after work and my employer is there so I very kindly say I'm gonna take ONE day off one MONTH from now after having just given him one extra day of my time. He says he can't do that cause he might need me. No again I'm an electrician and the company is not busy at all right now and even if it was, my missing one day of work won't stop production it just means the crew will get slightly less done that day because I'm not there. So anyways I told him I wasn't asking and to go fuck himself and then quit without a two week notice. Guess now I'll be doing the whole long trail for a few weeks so I ain't complaining now 🤷‍♂️

May seem a bit harsh to tell him to go fuck himself but he is an INCREDIBLY controlling boss who cheaps out on us every oppurtunity he gets. Once some of the guys got in a car crash on the way to work because he sends them so far away sometimes that they have to drive at 3:30 in the morning and fell asleep. (we also don't get travel lat for going two hours+ one way every day) Fortunately noone got too hurt but they were bruised up and first thing he said after asking if everyone was ok was that he would really appreciate it if they went to work today.

544,We don't know peace,"We never get to have a moment of true peace. Capitalism is always pushing us to produce, think, educate ourselves. We can never have the present, we are always working towards something, anxious, with deadlines approaching, the fear of starvation, of falling behind, of not being able to ""be good enough for the market"".

Our psyche is completely molded by capitalism. It's hard to even imagine a different type of social mediation other than the commodity. Anxiety is ever present, neurotism and psychopathy developing, unbriddled, necessary to navigate the world, to produce more, to tolerate more, to push for more, to disdain the value of human life in favor of commodity production and circulation. Our minds atrophied, too focused on abstractions that have come to enslave us, too weak to break the order. Consumerism and anchoring to that which we consume, in a ritualistic fashion, as if it were our personality, expressing ourselves through the commodity. It's all so broken, it's all so pointless, I sometimes wonder if it's even real, it has to be a joke, right? Our society couldn't be more divorced from use-value. We let the homeless die in the streets while we guard pieces of paper and commodities like they were more precious than any living being. How corrupted can we be? What's the effect of the Value-form on us, even? Are we just subject to it, or do we become stronger, empowering our own twisted mechanisms of destruction?

What could we create if all of the limitations and obligations imposed over us by work were lifted overnight?

We have a lot of problems, our economy is kind of f-up, it takes us waaay to long to sort out documentation and stuff, but working experience by itself ain't as bad as people on this sub make it out to be.

551,In conversation with an evil capitalist.,"Just browsing this sub and it's nice to get a different perspective on things.

If anyone wants a chat with someone 'from the other side' then I'm here all day. 

I sympathize with the antiwork stance. Work is troublesome, but I believe it's a necessary evil and if everyone had adopted an antiwork lifestyle, we'd still be in the stone age, so we're actually fortunate that historically, the concept of antiwork wasn't popular. Mainly because no work has always meant starvation. I'm pretty much failing to understand the stance of antiwork and would like to hear an argument against work that gives me an ""ah ha"" moment. Maybe I can learn from you, maybe you can learn from me. Perhaps not, who knows..

&amp;#x200B;

I've heard a few people expect homes, but not want to work for them, this I cannot understand.

An example I like to give, is the house example. Do you have any idea what a technological marvel the modern home is? And you want one for free? I know a lot of people who've built their own homes, good quality ones at that. It's cheaper than buying, but you need project management skills at a minimum. You can too, assuming you've got the skills.

The skills required to construct a home are many and learning these skills is highly difficult. If you don't have these skills, how can you ask those that do, to use their skills and labor to build you a home? They've got other things they'd rather be doing, like not working...

It's up to you to convince them, how you go about that is up to you.

552,American capitalism is psychologically murderous from a very early age.,"If life's a playground, we ought to sue the designers. There are way too many sharp edges and needles buried in the woodchips.

School as such is bullshit and should be abolished in favor of VR-oriented education for higher learning and small apprenticeships for hands-on learning. The forced socialization of public school is soul obliterating billshit on par with factory farming: even those who enjoy the experience do not escape it unscarred. The *only reason it exists in this fashion* - and yes, I am targeting the *public* school system, which isn't magically separate from the society around it - is to ready individuals for the labor force.

 Capitalism produces emotionally flat introverts at extremely high rates. This is again a response to enforced socialization after spending one's formative years being marketed to with bullshit - I can remember GI Joe being one of the early triggers for whatever brand of narcissism I unfortunately have.

The point is that, yeah, capitalism *is to blame*. We *don't* have to blame ourselves. It *is* the system.

579,"Do the ""back to normal"" brigade annoy you?","Because they really annoy me. There was absolutely nothing normal about the before times from the not so long, long ago. Although I recognise the tragedy of the pandemic, the lockdown was sweet! However people/society are in such a rush to resume this abnormality that they value so much. The shops opened where I am yesterday and they were stampeded by consumers. IKEA had queues. I once checked out IKEA to see what all the fuss was about and instantly hated it with every fibre of my being, I wanted out of there immediately, the furniture sucks too. It was like a George Romero film watching zombies shuffle in fluorescent lit, uniform white rooms/halls with the all the accoutrements of a pseudo comfortable, middle class, suburbanite ideal. (In much the same way I watched Transformers 3, having not seen any Transformer films prior to this, to see what all the fuss was about and HATED it, wanting out of the cinema theatre after 30 minutes). People were getting excited about spending the whole day at IKEA the night before the lifting of restrictions. Literally what the actual fuck. I AM on a different planet to these people. These are the same people who want to work 9-5, Monday to Friday. Absolutely nothing has been learned from this experience. Consumerism is still in effect, capitalism will resume operations, pollution/climate change/species extinction/factory farming will bounce back.

584,I wish profitability were the actual goal here.,"Long story short, the management at the place I work at are focused more on appearances than efficiency or even profit. I say this based on what I've seen during the past week. COVID has resulted in lower work orders and less shifts. So someone upstream in accounting must have calculated the minimal number of workers needed to complete work and maximize profit. This meant the guys that sort the product containers in the warehouse didn't come to work and I had to do their job in order to do mine (I load and unload the containers). I did 2 jobs for the same minimum wage. This means I work slower than I normally would and output is diminished. But hey, money saved by not paying workers.

On top of that, I was next to the foreman's office when I heard him screaming. I shortly found out that someone had used their phone on the job and that the section leader was being reprimanded for not policing the no-phone policy. We were 'reminded' to turn our phones in before starting work (I'd never been told this before). I found this a bit inconvenient because the lights on the 1st floor storeroom are blown out and it's almost impossible to read the labels on the products late in the afternoon and impossible during overtime hours. Which is why I used my phone flashlight to check labels. But I suppose appearances are more important than productivity, right? And don't get me started on overtime.

590,600€ for a fulltime job.,"Hey, this is like my third post here, I think.



I'm a trades apprentice. The reason im doing this apprenticeship is solely because I want to have my own brand/ company one day, because I had no other idea and it was time to get a job (at every cost). 



The job was kinda annoying but mostly ok. I liked the field I was in (art supplies; good compromise instead of studying art) and my colleagues, but one, were cool.



Until recently. The company I work for was sold to a much, much bigger chain a few months ago.
Now we will become a normal Hardware store.
My section was removed and even though we are all taken over, I was put in the only department into which I didnt want to go. Tiles.



Im going to try and make the best of it though.
Only 2 years left.
At the moment we're dealing with a mix of the plague crisis and the change of lead crisis.
My job is pure chaos at the moment.



I'm being purely exploited.
I work 32h per week+ school and I get 600€ for that.
I work a bit more than she shift says, every day. Yet somehow my hours are in the minus area.



Im expected to dedicate myself completely to selling goods, heart and soul into it, yet I only get the min. apprentice wage and no boni.



I'm expected to put heart and soul into the apprenticeship but basically I'm almost self taught because the company doesnt give a shit about me and doesnt teach me anything.

2) Is economic success shorthand for societal well-being?  How do we get our politicians to be more motivated to improve the well-being of our societies, rather than improving our economy?

3) How do we reduce the waste of human capital that is stored in the form of hoarded wealth and overproduction, without creating more bullshit jobs, valueless work?

4) If we can't automate it all away, how do we get our toilets cleaned, dead rats swept up without enslaving people to the wage?  Is this a problem worth solving?

5) How do you capture the wealth generation of the most powerful form of unpaid work - parenting?

6) The raising of monks can be done without the direct use of money. Can we raise artists without money?

Candidates must submit the following documents:
1. a recent curriculum vitae
2. a letter of motivation of a maximum of two A4 pages, explaining your interest in the project and detailing your suitability for the scholarship
3. a copy of your diplomas with a list of course grades
**4. 2 letters of reference from academic referees
5. a research proposal of up to 2000 words, covering state of the art, main research question, key objectives, and relevance, the proposed (methodological) approach, a brief description of the relevant literature, and a provisional timetable**
6. a writing sample of no more than 5000 words, e.g. an essay or part of a Master’s thesis.

Honestly, I have applied thus far for 3 PHD's and have been invited three times for a first interview (but rejected in the second interview), so I am not some shit candidate that is lazy or has some terrible resume. 

But a 2000 words essay? Why the fuck should I spent so much time on something, when I am not even guaranteed to be invited in the first place??? Wouldn't this make more sense as a second interview?

A lot of times I feel bad that I am not working and being irresponsible (which I feel is due to social conditioning) but I also realise that many people are unnecessarily working. 

In my free time, I get to think about what really matters in life,how to live life  and stuff like that. Most people who work at corporate jobs think that to be happy you need a better lifestyle, travel a lot, eat at expensive restaurants, buy expensive cars etc. Without a job (or even with it actually) , you  won't have these things and you would have to keep doing what you dislike. 

With this mindset, life becomes miserable and guess what makes you feel better? A bit of junk food or porn or alcohol or anything materialistic. You just want something exciting very quickly so that you don't hate your job so much that you quit. You wouldn't get enough time to even think about what's wrong with your life, or even if there is anything wrong. Over time, maybe people accept that life has to be of misery. 

The other thing is that since I don't consume much, I can afford to have a low paying job or quit working early if I start working. But when someone consumes a lot , because that's how they can enjoy life, they will always feel like they don't earn enough, and they cannot quit anytime soon, and it keeps them in that cycle of consumerism, while never enjoying life as it is meant to be.",False,h882tn,iamamzing56,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/h882tn/work_makes_people_not_realise_what_really_matters/,18,16

608,“[This is] one of those things that comes up in life…”,"Throwaway account

I got that as a response in an email today and it made me furious.

**Background:**

Where I am right now there have been some dangerous environmental issues. Yesterday while working from home, my girlfriend and I received a notice stating that we needed to evacuate the area immediately. I wrote up a short email explaining that I had received evacuation orders and sent it out to my team before promptly turning off my laptop. Over the course of the next few hours we had gotten our emergency bags, work bags, our pets, and some limited supplies into the car, and we had driven out to my parent’s place where they had set aside a single room for us. We then drove back to get my girlfriend’s car and some other supplies before returning back to my parents. 

Overall it took a while and I was offline most of the day.

That evening I logged back on. We have to do our timecards everyday, where we log our hours and explain what we had worked on. If you don’t do the timecard, a nastygram goes out. If you don’t have 40 hours by the end of the week, any time not accounted for is withdrawn from PTO.

It was approximately 6pm, and I did a couple of hours of work, but it was clear that I wasn’t going to make up the rest of the day unless I worked until like midnight, only to then get up at 5am the next day. I did my timecard and logged off for the night with the goal of reaching out in the morning.

So this morning I sent an email asking for some help. I asked if there was a number I could charge to for emergencies, and if there wasn’t, then could I get an extension for my week. Essentially, can I at least make up hours NEXT week and work later in order to balance my week out to 40 hours this week. My hope was to avoid using any of the remaining PTO I had. This year has been rough. Between surgery and a few emergencies, I am down to 40 hours total from now until January.

After a few hours I manage to get a response…

“\[This is\] One of those things that comes up in life, like getting sick or having transportation issues”. They then mentioned that I had 3 options:

1. PTO

2. An alternate working schedule. I won’t get into this since it would reveal a lot of information about my situation and where I am. 

3. I quote: “Work a lot today?”

So I’m sitting here, displaced from my home, with 4 pets (some are my parents), with my girlfriend, with a few backpacks with our emergency supplies and some clothes, waiting to hear back if it’s safe to go home, and I’m basically told:

\-eh it’s not that bad and not unusual

And my options are:

1. Use PTO to survive being removed from my home due to circumstances outside of my control

2. Work 14+ hours today and make up the time.

3. Work 14+ hours today and make up the time.

I’m not surprised. Really I’m not. But it still pisses me off.

I am not seen as a struggling individual in need of a little leeway. No. I’m seen as ‘human capital stock’ that must be squeezed for all my productivity regardless of my mental, physical, and emotional condition.

I mean. I like to think I’m not asking for much and that it’s not a huge request. Honestly tell me. Am I in the wrong here? Is this really all just part of everybody’s normal schedule?

610,"The paradigm of leeching off someone vs. ""earning"" your money is fundamentally nonsensical","Many of you guys still living under the paradigm and narrative of being self sufficient vs. being a leech are not really taking into consideration the reality of how nonsensical the economy is.

You would feel guilty 'leeching off your parents' perhaps if you have to live at home with no income or not enough to get your own place. But somehow would not feel guilty if you for example had a job of slaughtering hundreds of chickens full time for a paycheck in some factory - while having to shit in a diaper standing there killing chickens all day because that work place doesn't allow toilet breaks? (yes this is a real actual thing, look it up if you think I'm making a job like that up)

That money really ought to be given to you, you earned it killing these animals pumped with hormones that will produce cancer in those that buy them to eat while you're shitting away in your diaper you citizen of the land of the free. Way to contribute and make the world a better place, thank God you're doing that for the world you wonderfully contributing admirable citizen, you....

Having kids in this world and telling them: ""When you grow up you MUST work full time or starve to death on the street even if whatever work is available to you is soul crushing stupid pointless made up bullshit - you HAVE to do it, to avoid starving to death on the street. And we will not help you in spite of choosing to unnecessarily bring you into existence to begin with."" Is insane to me. They are responsible for taking care of you as long as they can and if they don't and don't want to, well alright. I just think that's fucked up that they chose to impose all that on you.

We live in a world where a most wealthy people are wealthy precisely due to leeching off of slave wage labor and where a tv star earns in a few days what a firefighter earns in literally 40 years of full time work. (I've done the math no joke)

So whatever money you do or do not have is not legitimately or fairly or justifiably yours. No one's money is ACTUALLY theirs, it's an arbitrary made up concept.

No one ""earns"" their money it's not fair or deserved, it's all arbitrary.

Biological existence in general is quite unequal and unfair to begin with but then even more so is the human man made economic system.

Like imagine a firefighter asking Christiano Ronaldo for a 20 just to help him out in a pinch somewhere.

And Christiano Ronaldo who 'earns' in a few days what the firefighter would earn in 3 lifetimes goes ""nah that's my money I don't believe in hand outs, you need to earn your own money""

You are not in actuality leeching off of your parents at least not anymore than companies leech off their employees or their customers. Because whatever money anyone has is never legitimately theirs to begin with, nor is anyone's. It's all made up and arbitrary. We all just need food and shelter, the money stuff is made up.

Christiano Ronaldo is a multi billionaire because football is an avenue through which companies can sell beer and cars etc.

So alcoholics and the destruction of planet earth through oil over use pollution of the air etc. is the reason why he is so unfathomably rich. He is rich due to fucked up things.

So the idea that someones money is and should be theirs in some justifiable sense is completely delusional to me.

622,My anti-work attitude got me in the hot seat with my boss.,"I work a 8-4:30 shift M-F.  I am currently working from home.  This all happened pre-covid.

I was working in the normal office setting, but I oversee essentially what is a free clinic every Thursday.  I don't do much (as I'm not a clinical person), but I will occasionally stick around for the entire clinic if they are short staffed and I can help with check ins/running meds back and forth/etc.  On these days, my schedule is usually 8-8.  I've been regularly taking Friday afternoons off, if all my work is done, because I worked a 12 hour shift the day before.  If my work isn't done, or if I have meetings, I'll stick around until I'm done with my day.   For the most part, I've left around 2:30 or 3:30 most days when I have worked the extra hours the day before.

My attitude has always been: I'm an adult, my work is done, I'm salaried, there is no requirement to be in the office, I'm on the leadership team, why should I have to stay and putz around for an extra 2-3 hours when I've already hit 40?  This was working just fine, until my new boss started.

My new boss saw me doing this and immediately put a squash to it.  Told me I had to ask permission.  So I maliciously complied, and every Monday I started requesting Friday afternoons off, since I was working 12 hour shifts on Thursday.  He got snappy one week, and asked me why I needed to be out of the office on Friday afternoon?

I walked over to his office, and said, ""Frankly, that's none of your business what I do with my time off"".

We then had to have a mediation meeting where he told me that 40 hours is a minimum, and I should never ""expect"" to get flex time and I needed to stop requesting Friday afternoons off.  I told him that was not the attitude that the CEO wanted for his team (the CEO is pretty progressive, but personal friends with my boss).   My boss told me that flex time doesn't mean I can be flexible with my schedule, and I wanted to scream.

The next two meetings we had as a leadership team, the CEO was talking and asking on how we become a more flexible place to work so we can retain staff and be a desirable workplace.  I almost hit my head against the table.

625,What does it mean to be “lazy”? (Rant),"(TLDR below) Let’s say I, a capitalist, create a job where a person is to simply copy (by hand) the text written to a 1000 page textbook onto sheets of paper 100 times (and I pay them minimum wage). It is possibly, in the modern age, one of the most pointless jobs to exist, but I would be hailed as a “job creator”, “stimulating the economy”, and the worker who does the work would be seen as a “hard worker” with “an impressive work ethic.

Just earlier, I had an argument with my mother and sister on the nature of jobs that exist for the sake of jobs existing, and I mentioned that the 40-hour week is an arbitrary construct design to drain people of the energy needed to rebel against the structure. They then defaulted to the idea that work can be 30 weeks, but I suggested that it could be even less if we evaluated what our real needs as society are (remember, I’m just starting with lesser work hours, I can’t even discuss communism yet). Immediately, I was called “lazy” and that “people need to work”. 

(Conclusion/TLDR)What the hell is this?

Right off the back there’s scheduling conflict, both bosses are being dicks and shitty about scheduling and communication.

My manager was understand in that it’s a difficult time and he was worried about my mental health as a black person due to everything going on. Boss man however said fuck you if you don’t find a cover I’m taking you off. Many people have two jobs and plan accordingly. There’s a lot more going on in my life than *just* these two jobs (therapy and psychiatric appoints for my bipolar but i’m not telling him that). But ever since my current boss became boss man last year things have changed at my job. Anyway I was already thinking about quitting but this was just the nail in the coffin so I said peace ✌🏾 and am going to work at my other place that doesn’t deteriorate my mental health or expose me to covid carrying racists who couldn’t wait to phase three before going swimming. i feel bad bc it was my first job ever and i’ve been there for so long. that job kinda molded me. but it was also the biggest stressor i had during the summer months for four years straight. but i did the math and instacart can easily replace my messily $9 (that took me three years to get from 7.25 from old boss lady but boss man gave everyone a pay raise this year but me) thanks for letting me rant. gotta get ready for work lmao",False,h0at0k,purrifferyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/h0at0k/just_fired_myself/,3,23

639,We're wasting the one chance we may ever get in our lives to protest and strike against modern indentured servitude.,"We are in the midst of a pandemic. The system is in shambles. Some face a dilemma: starve, or potentially send themselves to their death, AKA COVID-19 filled workplaces, in order to put food on the table.

This is the opportunity of a lifetime. Our one chance to kick the enemy while they're down. They realize now, more than ever, that they are nothing without our labor. They are constantly trying to manipulate us into ""reopening the economy"" and ""getting back to work"" whether it's through misinformation about the virus, cutting off unemployment insurance, or who knows what else.

This is an insanely rare opportunity. They are begging for us back, desperately leaning on the support of our poor essential workers. Elon Musk had to threaten his city officials to get his workers back. We need to kick him while he's down. Not just him - the universal him. We must refuse. Once we go ""back to normal,"" this window of opportunity will close, most likely until we die of old age.

Instead of protesting and going on strikes to end wage slavery, the masses are fixating upon one of the many issues in our system: systemic racism. Yes, black lives matter. But are people seriously putting their lives on the line to speak out on that one, singular issue, when they could be fighting against so much more in addition? Against the wealth gap? Against modern indentured servitude? Nope, they're eager to get back to their beloved jobs that they feel ""lucky to have."" They ""miss"" their jobs dearly.

Wage slavery affects all of us, whether we see it or not. All races, ages, genders, etc. Except for the billionaires and multi-millionaires who are hoarding wealth. The 1%.

If people are going to protest, I think they should protest the big-picture injustice we all face *while they're at it.*

People should be going on strike for a **25-hour work week**. For **universal healthcare**. For a **minimum of 1-month PTO**. At this time, these strikes could actually work. If all essential workers go on strike and the large corporations have literally no one for a period of time, I could actually see them budging. No bail-out, no matter how much cash it is, could save them from that. Giving into our terms or at least negotiating would be the only way they could stop a full-blown, anarchistic collapse and the greatest depression to be seen in history.

It's too bad we've been blessed with this unique opportunity at a time during which the masses are too blind to see that their employer is their enemy. They only see the obvious enemy: corrupt cops. But the sly, disguised enemy, their employer, still has them under the spell of corporate stockholm syndrome.",False,gzyva6,tjacob638245,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gzyva6/were_wasting_the_one_chance_we_may_ever_get_in/,8,70
640,Getting ready to leave my job,"I work at a dealership as a manager and just found out that the sales staff I manage make the same or more than me.

645,Memes are proof that money is a lie - and offer a way to spread that awareness,"I know this sounds asinine but just give me a few paragraphs to get some momentum.

You can't exist in 2020 and not intuitively just *know* what a meme is. Even those that exist totally cut-off from the online sphere would get the picture after a few examples. Most typically we think of image macros like [this](https://imgur.com/Sc1nBL7), or [this](https://imgur.com/yW2QUqt), but these are just a couple of modern, digital memes and don't begin to scratch the surface of just *exactly* what a *meme* is, and why the answer to that might be really fucking important.

For example, a picture doesn't need any text to be a meme - similarly, a picture can be *only* text and still be a meme. A phrase can be a meme, or even a single word. A sound. [Symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_S#/media/File:%22Cool_S%22.svg). The structure of the building you're in and the design of the device you're reading this from are memetic artifacts. Musical subgenres, fashion and style trends, social patterns and institutions including family, marriage, property, law, crime, and punishment. Even complex ideologies - religious, political, and philosophical - are essentially very nuanced and enduring memes that span hundreds and thousands of years. 

It's difficult to think of anything that is not a direct result of memetic repetition, as this is the way in which all information, beliefs, and ideas are shared and become socially entrenched - this method of transmission is directly related to, and reveals something specific about the origins of power, authority, control, and choice, and how we relate to those concepts and ourselves.

Human behaviour and response is memetic - a product of pattern, repetition, and context rather than a series of conscious “decisions” we make at every moment - this is not to suggest we are totally bound and determined by fate, but only that we are bound and determined to act only in accordance with our own character - we are not *something* responsible for our decisions, we *are* our decisions, and for that we bear responsibility.

Can you imagine Trump acting like anything else besides a caricature of pure petulance? 

That’s his role - his constitution.

I think the belief that he, or you, or I, ""make decisions"" is backwards - partly a product of the language we use to speak about ourselves and the world, and partly just our basic instincts - it's plainly obvious that I am aware and alive and can consider many possibilities so it only seems to follow that I must exert some influence over my choices.

To me, there is little distinction between *Me* and *My Choices* - I am those choices, not a separate entity that chooses - that stands separate, considers, and then finally pulls the equivalent lever corresponding with the **'choice' I’ve made.**

Those final three words are superfluous - to me they all reference a single thing - a localized *happening* from my specific perspective.

This idea is naturally unpalatable as it would seem to not only absolve one of all responsibility for wrongdoing, but also rob one of their ownership over both their good actions, and artistic creations.

I think this is simply a knee jerk reaction to protect the ego's sense of itself as something distinct and in control, as to accept the opposite comes with a great sense of powerlessness. 

*Responsibility is not something we take - responsible is what we are.*

Language has an implicit kind of magical quality - by that I mean much like the imagined casting of a spell, it is widely assumed that speaking the right words in the right combination (and order) can influence and compel people to act, and this *action* is the source of change. This is why great orators have always possessed great influence over the course of history - someone must be able to give *power* to an idea that can move masses to act as a single, unified force of nature.

I don't believe individual human action is ever the true catalyst to change - I think it is human action predicated on and driven specifically by the memetic concepts we have at our disposal - most importantly, **""What is good, right, valuable, and true?""**.

Language is itself inherently biased, limiting and divisive - **Black Lives Matter** means absolutely nothing until it is interpreted, and language is always loaded with judgments. As much as it is the primary way we communicate, ironically it just as often obfuscates and confuses because the kind of language we have available to us directly determines how we understand and conceptualize the world (and ourselves). It is not a matter of merely being Peterson-ianly ""precise"" in our speech, because precision is meaningless if the principles that precede it are incompatible.

How many proponents of any ideology have *actually* read and engaged with its foundational and supporting texts? 

Probably very few.

How many have absorbed bits and pieces through their specific context - language, culture, family, friends, media, and memes?

Probably almost everybody.

These repetitions of pattern connect us to something far greater than any single one of us - our *collective* human ideas about value, function, purpose, and their relation with each other - memes are a portal to the sum total of all human knowledge, experience, and feeling - memes are threads sewn into the fabric of the tapestry of reality, connecting us to the past, present, future, each other, and something totally separate - something unspeakable that yet demands to be spoken of.

You may have felt it when engaged in something everyday and ordinary, yet struck as if for the very first time by the majesty and totality of all there is - all experience happening right now, billions of distinct and separate simultaneous happenings, disconnected and separated only by virtue of the limitations of their own collective conceptions of what is real, what is true, and what is possible.

This universal need to communicate and share - to be heard - is intimately linked to creative and artistic expression.

Memes are innately communal and creative - they are meant to translate a feeling or thought into a shareable format that can be used, related to, and understood, and community and creativity have a direct and intimate connection to both art and play, two characteristics central to the human experience.

Art is itself its own distinct form of language - a language that transmits ideas and feeling only through its interaction with another. Art is our way of speaking telepathically - a way to contain and convey something enormous and infinite bound in the confines of an object.

Memes and artistic expression both reflect something crucial and universal in the spark of our human spirit - both are inherently creative and communal - they represent the human need to share, something intimately linked with community and altruism. Art can of course be done selfishly, but there is no artistic expression at all without the memetic patterns that allow that expression and an audience to engage with and be receptive to the artist's message.

Memes are thus quite a bit more significant than just funny and relatable pictures we share - what a meme is has direct implications regarding what we are, and our current shared cultural conception of them is simplistic and, as a result, limiting. If we don’t fully grasp what a meme is, we lack the capacity to both comprehend their true power, and the ability to wield that power to our own collective benefit. Instead, we persist in an ordering of society that enriches only a small handful that have fallen to the top through nothing other than circumstance and who insist this *must* be the natural ordering of the world simply because it is the *current* ordering of it.

Can we really trust those who wield inordinate amounts of power to fairly consider how it might be meted out differently?

Is the fate of society directly tied to the fate of the billionaire class, or to the *current institutions* of policing and governance?

From where is their authority and power actually derived?

The primary source is our shared belief that these institutions are legitimate and just.

The secondary source is their ability and willingness to inflict violence on us if we do not accept the first source.
 
Violence is of course the most powerful and persuasive avenue of acquiring and maintaining power - both literal violent acts, and indirect violence inflicted and facilitated by a system of organization that regards the principle of one person's right to hoard obscene amounts of wealth as a higher and more just one than providing the material necessities of life for all people.

That is the basic moral principle that serves as the keystone of the structure of our society *as it is currently ordered*.

Do we really believe those with obscene means deserve it?

What about those with such means that they could lose a thousand yearly salaries in a single day and not have that impact their quality of life in the slightest?

The Divine Right of Kings still rules, although now it's simply the Divine Right of the Wealthy.

We are meant to believe this is just **The Way the World Is**?

I find that idea just as intolerable and narrow-minded as those that believe it.

Society bears little proof of functioning properly anywhere - properly as in for the common good of all people.

If we instead understand ""properly"" as to the obscene and perverted benefit of a small few at the expense of everybody else, then it is functioning tremendously properly.

Individualism is too often championed by those who don't understand the distinction between it and selfishness, and this crucial error acts as the basic foundation for an entire wing of political and philosophical thought which insists might makes right, and ""value"" is directly related to money and money alone, where everything can be spoken about in terms of it's worth in terms of the US $ - one of many currencies that can, in an instant, become as good as worthless due to nothing other than our shared confidence in it.

Now I want to make some statements that are broad and general, but ones that I think are fairly common and subconscious. These are not meant to be statements of fact, merely word and concept associations to get us to see how we arrive at 'facts'.

*The relationship between progressivism and conservatism is like the relationship between masculine and feminine, which itself is like the relationship between individual and community.*

Consider this disharmony between two opposing (or complementary)  principles as essentially the basis of all philosophical (and thus political) thought. Also consider opposing principles as really a **single thing** as opposites always exist only in relation to each other.

This sounds a lot like some meaningless new-age woo, but I think many people make these associations subconsciously anyway, even though we can offer legitimate arguments against them.

Just conjure up some typically conservative imagery and symbols in your head - what kind of qualities are emphasized? What is deemed valuable, good, and of worth? What foundations precede these symbols?

**The inescapable and global grasp of the Internet and the smartphone was a pivotal evolutionary shift in human history, comparable to our discoveries of fire, agriculture, steel, and the combustion engine - all of which are only *useful* through memetic transmission.**

The Internet and our constantly connected culture has allowed us to, in a sense, act as a very rudimentary hivemind. Our access to, and saturation of information, media, and communication is both constant and instant - **it is now possible to share our thoughts with almost everybody there is** - our friends and family, their friends and family, people we don't know and never will, people in another country, and people who perhaps don't even share the same primary language as us - a single sentence spat out into the ether can potentially reach billions of people on the planet in a matter of hours. 

**You, me, and everybody else has a form of direct access to nearly every other human consciousness on this planet - what could we possibly use that for?**

Memes, of course.

*To crowdsource the question of 'what is good?'*, because that is what lies at the centre of all action and belief. The fact that we have seemingly become ever more divisive and politically polarized is not to be tutted at or wished away, but rather acknowledged as the *only way* in which an outcome - Truth - can be arrived at, spread, copy itself, and propagate to the point where its opposite seems wholly and utterly absurd.

Accepting all of this, it is possible to understand *Humanity* not as an abstracted collection of billions of separate individuals, but as a single, *unique happening of organism/environment* that can, given certain factors, act in unison.

The most important factor is, of course, each self knowing and feeling that they are a part of this greater self, which is not something that can be forced, but something, like creation itself, that happens spontaneously.

One can edit and correct and obsess over the minutiae of an artistic object, but inspiration strikes, it is not conjured - it is never willed into being, it is rather being itself which then acts on our will.

Those advocating for either a progressive or conservative approach to policy can not compromise, not because the facts are in disagreement (although that is true), but because what comes **before** the facts is not in agreement - that is, the way the world is structured and ordered, or **The Way The World Is**, which always itself acts as the background for an ideology rather than the reverse.

The idiom *'seeing is believing'* is actually totally backwards -  the truth is that **believing is seeing**.

So, if memes are the true catalyst of human action and social change, can we then ""meme ourselves"" into a better reality? Can we, together, engineer, build, or construct a meme to spread and transform our shared, collective (un)conscious and the ideas that follow about not only what is true, *but what is possible*?

I believe so, and I think a good place to start is to understand the **illusory and mutable nature of money and wealth, and their direct relationship to power and authority and the distribution of these things**. Money is a real 'thing' that performs a necessary function, but our shared understanding of it holds real power over it, and in this way we can collectively shape and alter that power it commands over our lives. 

We can't function without money, but we absolutely can function with a novel way of distributing it so as to lessen the total amount of suffering directly related to poverty and the inability to provide materially for oneself.

**Does Jeff Bezos really have billions of actual, tangible currency, or is his currency really in the form of power and influence *as represented* by money?**

Is the standard work week from Monday to Friday, or Monday to Thursday?
 
Whatever the answer, is it because this is simply *The Way the World Is*, or is *The Way the World Is* directly shaped by our collective ideas about it?

The state-sanctioned brutalization and modern lynchings of black men at the hands of “Law Enforcement” in the U.S. is itself a memetic pattern - “Law Enforcement” tactics are memetic, including their violent response to protest, organization, and the legitimate outpouring of anger directed at the inhumanity of the institutions of ""Justice"". The video of George Floyd's horrific and senseless murder was spread memetically, and so too were the calls for protest all across not only the U.S., but the entire world.

A memetic call for collective struggle has been sounded, and heard by the entire planet - now is the time to take this opportunity to understand ourselves as one, to tear down and rebuild the arbitrary social patterns of power and control that rule *all* of our lives.

The 'legitimized' armed wings of state, police and military personnel, should stand with the people, not as their opposition - stand with them in demanding justice and equality for **ALL PEOPLE** and the dismantling of a system which treats all conscious beings as resources, and like its treatment of every resource, exhausts it to the point of annihilation.

**A single officer taking a principled stand, to cross the illusory barrier of us/other could be the crumbled brick that begins the collapse of the whole structure. All it will take is one person of good conscience to do something difficult, but something good, to memetically begin a shift towards a better, more equal society.**

If you can't bring yourself to do that, you just may be an enemy of the people.

See how compelling language can be? Nested within every word is paragraphs of subtext, assumption, and implication.

Enemies of the people are just that - enemies to a free and emancipated existence. 

To preserve life, violence may sometimes be the only option. Violence can be avoided memetically - you cannot put a bullet in a concept, and it’s just as futile to do the same to those who espouse, exemplify, or believe it, not to mention a wee bit of a moral grey area. Violence can be lessened with the correct memetic foundation that underpins our conception of 'self', 'other', and 'world', and the reciprocal nature of those things - violence is given power by distinction and separation, but that power can be neutered by understanding that not only are you yourself, you are every other self, too.

The global economic and social reaction to the Coronavirus is proof of this shared power our collective thoughts have over the world we inhabit. Of course we cannot simply will it out of existence through a shared psychic exercise, but we can decrease the destructive potential through the memetic spread of ideas like social distancing. 

It has also laid bare that the distinctions and lines in the sand we use to divide and categorize are mostly illusory - the global community, as the aggregate of every other community, group, faction, and individual, is where we must focus our collective efforts. There is no nation but Earth, and to shift our reality in the direction we want, it will take collective effort. 

The emancipation of all humanity must happen together because of the memetic nature of change and our connected world. There is no freedom until we are all free.

Somebody called the police because of a suspected counterfeit $20 and here we are.

Imagine what can be accomplished together, by simply altering our beliefs about what is inherent and immutable, and what is merely a byproduct of antiquated memetic artifacts and the resulting methods of ordering and structuring society?

**We can meme ourselves better.**

Black Lives Matter.

White supremacy does not.

Land matters.

Landlords do not.

People matter.

Profits do not.

Billions matter.

Billionaires do not.

Collective ownership over the instruments of profit, production, and class stratification is **OUR** right.

Food is a right.

Water is a right.

Shelter is a right.

Healthcare is a right.

Education is a right.

Freedom of expression is a right - this includes the right to quell and dismantle the violent rhetoric that enables violent expression.

These things are only true or false based on our collective ideas about what is right and what is valuable.

Justice should not be owned by anyone, it is owed to everyone.

Humanity is an organism - a unified field of conscious relationship and pattern from micro to macro, comprised of each one of us.

Knowing what we are is the first step to becoming what we can be.

While an education is important, it was only later that I realised that the purpose of my ""education"" was to be put in a job that I hated. Self education is crucial in today's world compared to what the schools teach us. The schools are more like factories that generate obedient workers. Most schools still follow a system that has been around since the 1800s. They teach every student the same thing without analyzing their individual skills just like a factory creating uniform products. We see many talented people that are homeless. We see many smart people with no opportunities. Why? Because they didn't ""fit"" in the system owned by tyrants. The workers that pass school are then put into jobs that will feed capitalists and elites.

oh how wise we are because we work so hard

much wiser than the fools

those of the past

who valued the artist and the writer

but not the engineer and the crafter

&amp;#x200B;

how wise we are for our glorious work ethic

much wiser than those of glorious past

those whose life was balanced and static

we are so much wiser with our lives so fast

&amp;#x200B;

We have no need for balance and arts

as those were tools of the fools

we need only productivity stats

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

we have no need for rest or sleep

we need only to hustle harder

Because only when dead we will sleep

This is how we became better

&amp;#x200B;

But I wonder from time to time how much better can we become

I wonder how much wiser can we really be

In truth I emphatically wonder

how much better will we be when we are no longer we.

653,"Is anyone else annoyed by the concept of ""noble"" poverty (Don't know what subreddit to post this in.)","I know some people who work on farms here and there, and make handi-crafts to sell, and work in farmers' markets, and they dress in shabby clothing (they buy second hand clothing to be 'moral') and they've got this attitude of like ""we're so anti-capitalism, we chose the simple life"".

Meanwhile every single time there's an accident or emergency, or f they decide want to save money, or if they simply don't want to pay for something, they call their parents and their parents bail them out.

So they get the positives of ""poverty"", such as a totally cool, anti-establishment image, and freedom from the workplace, but none of the negatives of ""poverty"" such as, (literally the definition of poverty), stress, anxiety, health problems, a lack of money to get the necessities in life or to weather more serious storms, etc.

I'm trying to be open-minded, but everytime they lounge around talking about hating the concept of working a boring job for money, I imagine the physical violence, sexual violence, drug abuse, mental and phsyical health problems that my family and the people I know in real poverty faced and it's a bit much. (No, I can't call them out on their BS because I'm trapped in a small place with small town politics. I'll be leaving soon, I just need to grind through this)

It's probably easy to read into what I'm feeling as jealousy, but it's it's not like I don't like them as people. Yes, I'd love to be able to do what I want, safe in the knowledge that someone else will pay away any issues I come up against, but I don't want them to *not* have these things. I'm glad that some people get to live their lives without being forced into slavery in the capitalist system.

But, I just can't bear listening to them talking sometimes, due to their lack of self-awareness. It's like when someone gets hired straight into a managerial position in their parents' company and then talk about how they bootstrapped their way through life. These people exist in and out of the working world.

The way the system is setup is very clever because you're always in a position where you're higher than somebody else, but of-course somebody is always higher than you as well. So although people feel bad because somebody is above them, they get satisfaction from the fact that there's somebody else below them, and this keeps everybody always climbing the ladder, which is basically just a circle.

At lunch time I had to go to the guy who hired me who was super cool about everything but asked me if I would finish the day just to see if I could keep doing it, I agreed to it because I felt like if I was doing something else I’d be better off

The next stage was me pushing smaller stuff under a different thing but by the time It was the end of the day, my hand was seized  shut and I couldn’t move it. I told the hiring guy that I thanked him for the opportunity and all but it wasn’t for me. He was thankful that I stuck around for the full day and did tell me that some guys just leave an hour in if they don’t like it.

681,Anyone else planning to ditch their job this way?,"Want to know if I'm alone in my plan to escape my ""Office Space""-like job.  My parents are in their 70's, and I'm waiting for them to live out the remainder of their lives, so I can ditch my company.  

I feel like the only reason I still work is for their sake.  Not that they need me to provide for them.  They both work, and are happy to do so. 

But if I left my company while they were alive, I know how disappointed they would be in me.  I had a lot of BS jobs, struggles, so in a way, I'm lucky to have the job I do.  Its just that living my life on a permanent loop, having no spontaneity and being enslaved to a routine is every bit of existentially miserable as I was afraid of.  

Even if I left the job anyway, I'd be entering the worst job market since the Great Depression, and I bomb most job interviews.  I think the only thing that would save me would be a WPA-like program that would put anyone with a pulse into a job.  

But I don't count on that happening, because nothing ever seems to get done in the U.S.  We'll happily let legions of unemployed citizens waste away in their homes than do anything productive.  Been through long term unemployment, somehow didn't go insane (depending on how you look at it), not going through that Hell again.

I hate myself for thinking these thoughts.  I try rationalizing it by telling myself its not like I *want* my parents to die.  I'm not conspiring to murder them.  But I know they won't live forever, and they're the only ones I really feel any loyalty toward.  When they're no longer in the world, I'll feel free to do whatever I want.

Has anyone else had similar thoughts, feelings, plans?",False,h9660b,mg_ridgeview,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/h9660b/anyone_else_planning_to_ditch_their_job_this_way/,3,4
682,My essential tasks at work take 2-3 hours. What do I do for the other 5?,"I'm asking this sub because I know you won't judge me.

So, my essential tasks only take about 3 hours max, and the rest of the time I'm just hanging out, trying to look busy. I don't hate my job, and acctually plan to stay for a bit. It's easy, has normal hours, fantastic benifits, and ok pay. But I'm so sick of just wasting my time. It kills me to know that 1/3 of my day is just being flushed down the toilet. 

I like to learn things, but I have such a hard time getting into a deep study state while at work. My office is the front lobby, so while it is mostly quiet and secluded I do constantly have people walking in and out, check-in in at my desk, making deliveries. This makes study time difficult. Instead of using this down time to my advantage, I mostly just end up on reddit wasting time.

684,Making the best of it,"I just discovered this sub and have never felt so seen. Im currently 23 and finding a job, even as I went through college and got my degree, was always a matter of ‘what do I think I’ll hate the least?’ because the truth is, I don’t want to work. At all. For anyone. I do, however, value my own autonomy and comfort very highly, so I work an easy, mindless job 40 hours a week that covers my bills plus some extra, as I’m lucky enough not to have any pets or children and I live with my boyfriend who also contributes financially. Everyone else at my job has families and all kinds of responsibilities, so they’re all poor and working overtime any chance they get. I feel for these people; I would never, ever work overtime under any circumstances, since my free time is most precious to me. So many people express a need to be busy, even actual inability to stop working. I have never once related to or understood this, though it seems awfully common. I’m either way too sensitive or everyone else is completely decimating their mental health all the time. Since covid showed up I transitioned to working from home which has many perks—mainly that I am no longer being watched by anyone. I work very intermittently, with most of my time spent doing other things. I play animal crossing all day long and still manage to be among the top 3 most productive on the team. I usually relax fully through the first and last hours of the shift and I cant help but feel as though I’m striking a balance, exploiting my faceless employer as they exploit me. This gives me immense satisfaction, but it doesnt seem like anyone outside of this sub would think I should be proud. I grew up in a household that tried to instill the idea that I should sacrifice in my youth to be “successful” later. I rejected that as a child and I still do now, even more so now that I’m conscious that other people, too, recognize the horror that is this ‘live to work’ system (and the fact that my ‘successful’ parents are probably the most unhappy people i know). I just want to chill and be happy. I think I’m doing a pretty good job.",False,h7l20w,spicegardentips,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/h7l20w/making_the_best_of_it/,9,19

686,Sick of being a slave. Need advice/encouragement on self employment.,"Hello. I had posted this on another sub, but felt as though it doesn't really belong there. So I came here. From what I read and feel I have mutual feelings of this anti-work. 
It is my dream to live life to the fullest, but like most understand one has to make money to live. So..I guess I'll do that. 

I would like to become self employed. I'm not sure where to start. I have been dabbling in web design, but can't seem to get my self together and feel a bit of imposter syndrome. So I am unsure if that is what I truly want.  
 I am a chef and have always been a chef and my body and mind are breaking saying it is time to quit that career path. If I have to work with food again I will jump off a cliff. 
Everyone tells me ""Just find another job and still be a chef. You're a chef! You're a chef! Be a chef die a cheeeefff!!!"" I've been in a kitchen since I was 15. I'm 30 now. And I'm still stressed out. And still treated like an idiot. It's not just me. It's everyone in that field of work. Stressing out about frickin soup. It's not for me. And I don't want it and no one gets that. 

  I always think about switching careers, but I don't have any other experience. 

Plus it's still working for someone else on their time. Life is too short for only 1 week vacation and 3 sick days a year. I wish for the luxury of working for myself. I have been miserable for so long. 

 I'm quiting my job soon so I can travel for a month. Because I know they won't let me leave that long and come back. Because I want to travel that long twice a year even. Because maybe I get sick more than X amount of times a year. 

But in order to do that. I have to make money some how. 

Please don't be upset when I ask. How should I start working for myself? I know it's work, but I'm thinking of it more of a hobby people so happen to give me money for.
 I am very organized, creative, and always want to please others experience. I also really enjoy organic and healthy things.  I'm not fishing for a huge company and becoming a millionaire. (Although I have some good ideas) and definitely nothing that will whore myself out like youtube. Or any kind of soulless marketing.  
I'm looking for something mentally leisure, honest, and simple. I can do the long hours of ""work"" creating and producing. (I'm use to that) That's easy. It's more something that I can handle and will get me by. 

 I think I would be good at making some kind of art. I use to paint but failed at selling any of it. Perhaps epsom salt gifts and gift boxes is what I'm looking at. I find joy in preparing something and making it a handmade surprise for someone to be excited when they see it. (Kind of like food)
Maybe t-shirts? $30,000 a year is kind of my goal. 

If anyone has any advice or ideas they would be much appreciated.

708,Interview,"I'm a 17/yo 2020 graduate and been working at places since I was 14. First was cart boy at my local grocery, then later a server at different restaurants, and most recently a cook.

14-15 I was so cheery being a cart boy, sure the pay was shit, but at least I got paid weekly and since there were quite a few other cart people, I only had to work 3-4 days a week for around 5 hours after school. I was always interested in cooking and culinary arts in general so later on I asked my boss if I could work in the baking department, but he said I couldn't be trained for it since i'm under 18, so I quit :)

15-16 was where I started serving at different places around my area, It was also the time I started my dual enrollment in culinary. I live close to a touristy sort of area, and tip was pretty good at some places, but after a while working with only 1 or 2 days off a week, I started feeling exhausted and lethargic all the time. My grades were suffering because of this and my mom told me to quit these jobs, respecting my moms wishes, I quit.

16-17 I started working as a cook, with my dual enrollment, I had a certification with the ACF as a certified fundamentals cook. Honestly hated cooking as a job, I don't know if it was just the restaurant I was working in or not but, I had to cook the catering orders for that night every night, cook up the orders that come up, clean all the dishes, and break down and clean every part of that kitchen. Every. Single. Shift. was like this, and It was only one person in kitchen per shift, but even with all that shit, I stayed working there. But the day my bike gets flat and I couldn't get to work without repairing it, I get fired. Like, what? I was putting up with this stupid system that should have at least 3 people there for so long. I was so pissed at first but got over it because I put it in perspective and realized that job was trash.

**TL;DR**: At the beginning was happy cheery little boy working a little for money for a hobby, then 2-3 years later descend into overworked tired fatigued boy and get fired for some stupid reason.

710,19 and trying to make a decision on a degree that'll help me get a job that at least somewhat works with my antiwork mindset. Help?,"Hi everyone. Hope you're all well :) Sorry for the long post but this is very heavy on my mind as of late.

I'm 19F who's been living in Malta for around 4 months now. Moved here because of my love of international living and my desire to get away from the country that is stripping me of my EU citizenship.

Came here just to test the waters and find a job, but after realising that I can study here for free if I apply this year (degrees here are free for EU citizens but we lose our privileges at the end of this year). I would be a fool not to take up this opportunity as one of the biggest complaints I see about tertiary education on the internet is crippling debt (sending my sympathies across the pond)... but I'm wondering what I should invest my time into.

I am thinking about what I want in the future, and what I want most is freedom. I think I want a job that I can leave and come back to without too much hassle as the job is in constant demand. I don't want to be in a situation where I feel I can't leave my job that has shitty hours because I would risk being jobless for an extended period of time due to the surplus of workers scrambling for the position.

The degree course that stands out to me is speech and language therapy. It combines linguistics, psychology and biology - all passions of mine. It's meaningful in that it helps people live life to the fullest (god forbid I land myself in a soulless bullshit job). But I'm concerned about its transferability to other countries that aren't English speaking. A lot of speech therapists have told me applying the skills you obtain to countries that speak other languages is very tricky as you train in the language you speak, and therefore you lack the skills in other languages. Furthermore its extremely specialist nature and somewhat anonymous status within the medical community makes me think jobs won't be easy to come by.

This leads to me thinking nursing would be better. Travel nursing is a concept that intrigues me greatly. Foreign nurses in the EU, even around the world, isn't uncommon, and nurses are always in demand, simple as. I'm unsure of the nursing shortage in the EU but I know for sure the UK is suffering in this respect.

My first thought was to post here as what I want in a job is heavily influenced by my antiwork values. What do you all think? What are other options that could give me this freedom? In the end I want to be able to work, save (I am a minimalist at heart and feel it wouldn't be hard for me to save a decent amount) and then leave work to pursue my whims, be it travel, hobbies, whatever. I'm sure you all know what I mean. And then when money gets short I can return to work and vice versa, bypassing the 'you've been out of work for a while prioritising your life and well-being? can't have that in our corporate family' shtick due to the job being in demand.

Am I being naive? Advice would be much appreciated.",False,gzup1t,CornflakesAreAce,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gzup1t/19_and_trying_to_make_a_decision_on_a_degree/,1,5

716,Let's take over some federal land,"I believe in working for ourselves and stop giving our money to the elites, so to keep most of our money and freedom I propose massive pacific protests on federal land in the states where it is abundant, start building and/or living in motorhomes.

So many people live paycheck to paycheck because housing is so expensive, society, as it is now, is like a big monopoly game and we all know how it ends. Billionaires get richer every day, rich families get to pass on their generational wealth. We just get stripped out of our basic rights, the right to benefit from our work, that's why we are working so hard and getting nowhere, we are working to feed ourselves and to feed THEM.

Even if I'm lucky enough to buy land, there are so many regulations that make it almost impossible to build something if you don't have the money, but you know what a house can be built of literally anything including the same dirt on your land, why then we have to spend our lives working to serve the rich? 

We have the skills and the technology to do anything we dream of, it is society mostly the ones who already own land to make things difficult for the ones who own nothing, they care about property values, about attracting other wealthy people like themselves, they couldn't care less about the homeless, the vulnerable, people on power positions who order to remove benches from parks, to build everything as uncomfortable as possible for the people living on the streets, even the lucky ones who got to keep they cars after they were evicted face harassment for the police, unfair laws that target them and make it illegal to sleep in their cars, so they can eventually take their cars too, leaving them on the streets.

Being homeless shouldn't be as common as it is in the US, we have smart people, we have the technology, but we lack the political will to do anything. They don't care about us, we have to help each other as much as we can. Our strength is in our numbers and our unity.

Go out take a piece of unowned land, save some money, respect nature as much as possible, maybe even improve the place, it isn't yours but a place to temporarily stay, to recover, to build wealth, let's go out and improve places, make them beautiful, so beautiful that people feel ashamed of destroying them, ashamed of kicking out the people who live there, we can do the world a better place.

718,Most People Live At Their Job,"With the covid pandemic going on most people worked with different schedules and i was one the the lucky ones that worked kinda biweekly.

My experience was great when i was at home. I got most needed rest that i couldn't have. I spent time at my hobbies. I spend time with people that i actually want to spend time about.  I exercised, i lost some weight, felt better. Had time and mental energy for myself. I was happier.

Well things normalized, almost all workers from all sectors returned to work full force and i had a chance to hear from my coworkers and some friends about their experience. 

Well most of them said they actually didn't like it, i asked about exactly what was the problem, did they got so much work or it felt really soul crushing while most people never came to work and they had to work. It was nothing like that for them. Their workload was similar and they had some time off from work which they appreciated. But the problem for them was the social part of the work. They didn't see their friends, they couldn't chat-live at work like they used to. 

One of my friends said that the last 3 months felt empty. I mean i know he had work similar to before and had time offs that he liked. But after this normalization he said this and when i asked what exactly he felt empty about. It was about social aspect of the work, that there was no one at work to socialize.  
My coworker that liked this normalization said that he didn't had any friend outside of work. So he was happy that the things returned to normal.

I mean these people clearly doesnt think that covid is still a threat, that 1 person can infect all workplace and they can carry the virus to their families, they are not sad about losing those free days, they are happy that they could live their life at their job again. Like only meaningful thing in their life was to work at this job, feel useful, socialise with people and live this way.

I cant fully blame them. We work 10 hours a day and its like you are forced to give all your energy to these hours to have a meaningful life at somewhere. You are mostly exhausted at home and you don't have time and energy to build any meaningful life outside of your workplace. I was lucky to have some free years after university and not going straight into some job. Maybe that makes things different for me.

720,College applications are driving me crazy (rant),"Hello people from r/antiwork, this is my first post ever and also I'm not a native english speaker so sorry for any mistakes I made. 
I lived most of my life in a small city near the coast and the farmside and with a good standard of living, but since my dad got a new job in a big city in the south of the country we moved to this city, and this place Universities are driving me nuts. 
In Mexico public universities are supposed to be affordable (only a few are really free, like the National U), the state university of my home state was really cheap even if the campus in my home city didn't had a lot of careers to offer. The state university of the state where I live now is obscenely expensive, something that I think is not approved by the government, to make it into any career you first have to enter a course which costs the same as 3 or so semesters, and they also charge you for the entrance examen the cost of one semester in this university.
They do this because there's practically no other public universities in this city, only a handful of small engineering schools.
This makes me very anxious since I didn't wanted to take on any career that was too stressful or expensive, and now that I have no other option I'm just obsessing over my career election and thinking about what I am going to do now, because I had already paid for everything and while I was doing their expensive course I ended up disliking the career I had already chose since apparently they're giving it an industrial focus (a career in animation!! with an industrial focus!! good I hate this university so much)

I am writing this since I was doing virtual exams for the course even tho I don't want to get in anymore and I forgot this morning I had another one and it just made feel like a failure. 
I don't really wanna do all this college nonsense, I feel like there is no point and I would prefer passing my time learning practical thinks like coding, urban agriculture and how to start a small business, but in México things have been really bad and even my relatives with 'well payed' careers are struggling (hell, my dad is an engineer with 18+ years of experience and he was on the verge of being unemployed last year). 
I just don't now what to do anymore, I don't really have a dream job I don't dream about working for someone else, I like making projects and things like that. I already suffer a lot from anxiety and depression, and I think I have to see a terapist. 
Thank you if you got to this point of the rant.

TLDR; College applications in the state I live in are expensive af, there's only one university I can choose from and I want to choose another career.",False,h8wbp3,breadgurrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/h8wbp3/college_applications_are_driving_me_crazy_rant/,0,1

in which you already have 2 days off per week, leaving 261 days available for work.

Since you spend 16 hours each day away from work, you have used up 170 days,
leaving only 91 days available. You spend 30 minutes each day on coffee break.
That accounts for 23 days each year, leaving only 68 days available.
With a one hour lunch period each day, you have used up another 46 days,
leaving only 22 days available for work. You normally spend 2 days per year
on sick leave. His leaves you only 20 days available for work. He are off
for 5 holidays per year, so your available working time is down to 15 days.
He generously give you 14 days vacation per year which leaves

723,Saving the world means not working,"For the last year, I've been offering my days (and some of my nights) to the deities of marketing and labor. Working at small digital marketing agencies means long hours, underpaid work, and an endless succession of meaningless tasks. A big chunk of my current existence has revolved around producing content to allure low-income people into buying multi-level-marketing products and persuading them into a pipe dream of success. If that wasn't enough, my newest client is an ""opinion leader"" who routinely calls epidemiologists dealing with the pandemic ""economic hitmen"" on Twitter.

Marketing is such an exhausting and taxing industry. Not only to the people who work at it but also to the planet. We manufacture propaganda to coerce people into buying stuff they don't need. Selling overpriced ""detox"" shakes or supplements, Funko Pops, fast fashion, the newest Samsung Galaxy phones, or another pair of sneakers that will likely get forgotten in the bottom of your closet.

We live in a vortex. Selling and buying useless shit, while the significant stuff in life like housing, education, and leisure become unattainable commodities.

Working on marketing made me realize that the solution, or at least an important part of it, relies on a simple premise all of us know: not working. The best thing a marketing expert can do to save the world is not creating an original ad to sell eco-friendly guacamole or reusable diapers; the best thing he or she can (and must) do is stop working. By not advertising useless stuff and getting rid of their own industry, marketers can reshape that world in a more meaningful way than they could have ever imagine.

Getting rid of marketing and consumerism will free us all from work and save the planet along the way.

I recently told a friend about my anti-work views and said to him something I read in this forum: ""My dream is not having the perfect job, my dream is not having a job at all.""

This is only a dream, most likely an unachievable utopia. But at least I hope I can get away from marketing in the near future and begin to change the world simply by not giving my time and effort to the capitalistic machine that sucks our will for a better world.

741,I recently got my first job and it has made me more depressed and anxious than I've ever been,"I (16M) started working at a grocery store about 3 weeks ago. I only got it because my mom wanted me to get one. For the first week and half, I was a cashier. A big reason I hated doing it is I couldn't, for the life of me, remember the codes for the produce. Some of them had the codes on the stickers, but a lot, for whatever reason, didn't have stickers, which meant I would have to look in this binder that had all the codes in it. But it would usually take me a little while, so I would feel like shit because I'm wasting the wasting the customers time. 

One day, I showed up saw how it was extremely busy and got overwhelmed, had a panic attack, and ended up throwing up in the bathroom. Thankfully, my boss changed me to a courtesy clerk, which is what I applied for in first place. If you don't know what that is, cashiers call me on a phone I carry around, ask me to check the price of a particular item. I also have to return unwanted items back to the shelves and sometimes I have to bring carts in from the outside. Whenever the cashiers call me, I have to go looking for the item but I still don't know the layout of the store that well, I can't find it and end up wasting, not only am I wasting the customers time, I'm also the cashiers. 

When I try to talk to my mom about how I feel about it, she says something like ""You haven't given it a chance."" or ""You just have learn to enjoy it.""

Birth

Go to school to get just enough education to be a functional cog in profit machine

Get a job that barely pays enough to put a roof over your head and put food on the table (*if you're lucky*).

Make company tons of money while you never save a dime because anything you need in life is price gouged to maximize profits for whatever company it's from.

Make babies so they can grow up to be more cogs in the machine.

At best you scrape by until you die on an assembly line or at your desk or doing whatever job your corporate overlords have allowed you to ascend to while giving you the lowest, most insignificant raise possible.

This is life unless you were born into wealth, hit the metaphorical lottery with some invention or literally make every single right decision for the short and the long term even though your parents don't have the answers for how to escape this hellscape and your brain isn't fully developed until your mid 20's.

Socialism for the rich. Rugged individualism for the poor. Birth is a promise of profits for your future company and death is your retirement.

We are fucking cogs. We're fucking lemmings. At this point we're here for no other reason than to throw human effort and misery into the profit machine so the CEO can buy a new private jet or buy another house.

Look at the lives of the upper crust of society, the rich and powerful. Now look at how you're living. You work your whole life while the rich and powerful enjoy all the fruits of your labor.

Small things like social distancing and screens to separate work stations were obviously going to be implemented, as well as mandatory facemasks and gloves for staff that are customer facing. The problem comes in the enforcement of these rules. Or lack of. I've been back for 1 week now and every single one of the promised protective rules have been broken or disregarded. 

For instance, on masks, the company states that masks will be readily available, up to three per shift. These are non medical masks obviously, and don't offer too much protection, especially as both staff and managers wear them incorrectly, off the nose and the like. On day 2 I got told it's now 1 per shift, with the reason being they cost 75p each.

On day one they were moved to the middle, and the only stations they cover are the fryers. So the people handling the food are wearing dodgy masks incorrectly and are not separated by screens. 

We were told that everyone would wear gloves, this is not true. We were told it would be a maximum of 7 in the kitchen and during the rush of the first few days back, this was also not true. 

We were promised protection, which was rescinded. The wellness check they provide is a scan with a digital thermometer, which no one has ever seen their results from. No one is scheduled to provide cover for anyone so it's suspicious, especially when I hear co workers regularly break out into a coughing fit. 

At the minute I'm terrified of asking to be furloughed for my own safety, as all staff I've asked have told me that until I have a fever they won't do anything. By then it could be too late, but they haven't thought about that. 

I'm angry, and confused. Why are schools not safe or the government isn't safe but retail and fast food are a ok? Why has no one, not warehouse, not retail workers or service industry workers received higher pay for risking their lives by interacting with potential millions a day? 

Why does the NHS which supports our country right now, continue to not pay their nurses and doctors enough to not have to work 50-60 hour weeks? 

Help me because there of the last days I've accidentally let slip to managers my desire to go on strike.

E: Also our service timer, ranked leaderboard of the UK McD's and out customer satisfaction reviews were supposed to be turned off so we can focus on safety. Turns out the only one that's off is the CSat, which is the only one we lose money on (£1.99 Big Mac and Fries for a review)

751,"No, you cannot have a third of my life! - unixsheikh","Hello, here's a long quote from an interesting blog post from *unixsheikh*, a free software blogger. I wasn't expecting to find something that would fit this sub so much!  


But I thought you guys would want to see that! Here's the link to the [blog post](https://unixsheikh.com/articles/no-you-cannot-have-a-third-of-my-life.html)!  


 

&gt;\[...\] And guess what.. I found out that if you only work part-time you're able to be your very best during those hours.  
&gt;  
&gt;As mentioned, I had my own company for a while, even more than once, and I have had employees. I have worked full-time too. Do you know what I discovered? People will give their best for about half the time, then the other half is spent trying to avoid working, thinking about when they can get home, and doing less than optimal.  
&gt;  
&gt;You want to know something else? You can actually increase productivity by as much as 75% by having only part-time workers!  
&gt;  
&gt;You think time is wasted teaching more people how to do their job, or you think time is wasted in double the amount of management, but you're dead wrong! You can run almost any kind of company you would using full-time employees with part-time employees instead. It's all about attitude and planing. What you'll get in return is a very happy and extremely productive work force.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now, I'm not here to tell you what to do or how to spend your time. We each face our struggles and daily challenges. But I would like to make you pause for a moment.

770,How to retire on nothing?,"I really, really need to retire. I'm 58. After a life of working my ass off, I always struggled, lived off little money, had a great deal of trouble paying my bills, and never was able to save anything. Social security is years away still, and there's not much there for me anyway. I'm disabled but not enough to get on disability because technically (they say) I could still sit in a chair and wash dishes ten hours a day. (I can't do that, physically or fricken' emotionally.)

Right now I get a snap card, which isn't a lot. Plus I have a ""part time job"" working from home that pays really, really bad and just barely covers my rent and utilities. I also go to food pantries two or three times a month. I get medicaid insurance that pays my all my medical expenses 100%. I'm in Central Illinois (way south of Cook County).

My kid has to help me out a lot of months because I always come up a little short. I don't know how to express how much it sucks to ask your adult child for money when you are $40 short for bills. And I assure you, I'm not short not because I am bad at budgeting money. It's because I don't make enough and really can't anymore.

Anyway, this isn't a sob story. I'm just looking at the reality. My health is bad. I need to quit that job because it's dragging me down to an early hell and NOT paying my bills. I really don't think I can wash dishes all day or I would.

So, what can I do? How can I survive? If it were just me I'd vagabond or something, but I have a wife to support, who is also disabled, not qualified for disability for the same reason as me.

772,The New Spirituality,"To briefly introduce myself: I am a social worker of over a decade of education and experience — and multiple times over the last few years I have been caught fighting against the injustices, both against clients and against staff, in my field.  I have seen individuals with severe mental health problems left to the street because they were no longer profitable.  I've seen people taken into the system and their lives ruined because a judge ruled them incapable and failed to install oversights.  I've seen employees threatened every day for speaking up, and I've seen them murdered for not.  I have always stood up tall against these things and on multiple occasions have lost my job because of it  I rarely last more than a few years, as even a good manager will soon find themselves overwhelmed by the corruption, and while they leave, unwilling to put their career on the line to fight, I remain, and while there is never a single person who isn't aware of the problems, and in agreement that something must be done, there is also never a single other who will speak with me, in all these years.  So as a mental health professional, I suffered from severe depression and anxiety, with significant trauma lasting years attached to these jobs, and these people, I had lost — so I began to write, to use what I had learned and create poetry in a style modified from those depicting Greek and Norse heroes, outlining a practice for me to keep my head above water, end my anxieties, and most importantly, to keep fighting.

I'd like to bring up here a novel spiritual system: A method of dispelling our fear, and unifying us; as well as a method of controlling our own depression and anxieties when we are fighting what needs to be fought.  What I'm talking about here isn't religion, or anything centralized, but a philosophical system to unite and inspire us, in a world where we're otherwise ineffective at toppling the powers that prevent real change from occurring.

*Let no greed and striving cause us stress and sadness.*  
*Since we’re born, we’re told to try and work our hardest,*  
*Help withdrawn, though, once we’re grown, we fall to failure.*  
*Frustrated, anxious, depressed, to termination we’re trying*  
*Until at last we die, our eyes then dark and exhausted.*  
*Do not let this plague accost us! Keep our eyelids*  
*Closed and strive for merely living, safe and happy!*  
*See the worthwhile things in the world, as love and fulfillment;*  
*What takes years of work one loathes cannot be worth it.*

This is from the [Nameless Script](http://www.ren-philosophy.org/Rën.pdf) of Rën philosophy, stating that everything we do in labour is for some reward that we're told is good — money — but beyond the bare minimum we require to survive, we don't really need it.  The concept of being rich is an illusory reward, but because of it, this frankly illogical desire, we have these power structures and the resulting violence and inequalities.

This philosophy is monistic, like Taoism and some other Eastern ideas, stating that everything is ultimately of one substance, and it uses this to completely humble the individual, to the point of denying its existence. ""Rën"" is used in the text as a pronoun, to refer to any and everyone.  It puts us all on the same page, so that rather than striving to get rich, to be better than everyone else, and increase the self, we're instead uplifting each other, recognizing that none of us are alone a unit:

*Men of science call it selfish altruism;*  
*Selflessness, a fantasy; charity, happy fiction,*  
*But fables cache residual truth, and tales remind us,*  
*Extolling: To give is as much for the sender as for the receiver.*  
*Instinctive wisdom begs us feed the worn and helpless.*  
*Where there’s a choice, the charity comes to them from oneself, our*  
*Chest to hungry throats, and have no agency process*  
*The help we’re lending, lest they squander the service rendered.*

Although they've been instrumental in gaining us rights in the workforce, unions today have largely failed us, in my experience.  They've become toothless, being themselves large organizations with a disconnect from those they're supposed to be representing.  What we need is a sort of revolutionary altruism, in which enough of us are on the same page, regarding the same philosophy, and can speak up against injustice directly, as unions once did.  To begin with, upon seeing abuse happening in the workplace, we should have the strength to organize together and stand up against the people in power who are propagating that abuse.  As it is, spinelessness is rampant among employees, and that needs to change.

When it does, power can shift, and we will no longer be disposable commodities, but will have the final say in what we are worth and what we can do with our lives, rather than expected to show gratitude for the privilege of giving our lives away to employers that will pay barely a living wage and threaten you every day of your life with your dismissal — because you are not necessary.  We will become more necessary than them.

We can't get there, though, without a drive, and spirituality has historically been a great source of that drive.  It gives both individual and community identity, which is precisely why Christianity has been so unfortunately used by capitalists to support conservative movements in the West, especially the US, which controls the cultural narrative in the English-speaking world.  So I'm hoping to introduce a new sort of decentralized spirituality in Rën, that regardless of one's religious beliefs, or lack thereof, a consistent worldview and sense of justice can exist in a great enough number of people to provide the energy for this sort of revolution.  That, if one practices and loses the sense of the individual, ""Number One"", being the most important thing in the world, then they will lose the fear that prevents them from taking a stand against the injustices of modern capitalism — and by nature of spiritual philosophy, they can take others along with them.

Thanks for reading this far.  This subreddit is an inspiration and it's good to see this much support for those suffering under our current system.  I hope people will in time find Rën to be a useful tool in enacting positive change in ending the exploitation of the working class.",False,gvf9eq,Geckat,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gvf9eq/the_new_spirituality/,2,2

777,Suggestions on how to get fired for performance issues - not “for cause.”,"I feel like even subs like r/unethicallifeprotips wouldn’t understand. I’ll explain a little anyway. I’m sure you guys don’t need me to explain my reasoning.

My job furloughed a ton of people (from my estimation, it seems like full-timers whose health insurance they no longer wanted to cover, as well as people who were the least efficient). Now they’re squeezing every last drop out of the people who are left (part-timers/the most efficient people). 

I’m sick of being a number. I’m sick of being treated like cattle. I’m sick of the rules only applying to them and I’m sick of them only enforcing the rules when it benefits them. And most of all, I’m SICK of constructive termination.

For example, I had two weeks of no pay last year without warning (didn’t know I could have collected unemployment—I’m young and stupid). I ended up with less than $50 to my name at Christmas, with bills still to pay. They didn’t care about enforcing minimum work hours back then, but of course now all of a sudden they do. 

My dream would be to get fired for a performance issue as that’s just about the only way to get fired NOT for cause and even have a chance, however small, of collecting unemployment.

It’s a shitty $10/hr WFH job. I can tell they’re starting to engage in some constructive termination right now, but it’s so flexible they can’t fire people for being “late,” because the only thing that can be done late is turning in work late. I believe that counts more as a performance issue rather than tardiness. Tardiness is easier to fire people for, so guess what they’re doing—switching us from a flexible work schedule to set shifts. Everyone signed up for this job for the flexibility and they’re taking it away. 

I should mention that my unemployment payments, even without the extra $600 weekly right now, is significantly more than what I normally make at this job, so even after 7/31, it will be better for me to be on unemployment.

My question is... how do I get fired for performance issues (not for cause) without making it seem like I tried?",False,gwtsj9,LordFuckwaddle,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gwtsj9/suggestions_on_how_to_get_fired_for_performance/,0,1

779,Is it worth living on SSI (in poverty) to not work?,"Is it worth living on SSI (in poverty) for the rest of your life to avoid not working? I been really thinking about this a lot. Thinking about working ramps up depression and anxiety but on the other hand i don't want live in poverty either............

SSI is a stable source of income especially during pandemic like this but it is also a low amount of money

The biggest issue on SSI is housing and once you have that I mean I feel like you be okay living with SSI. The problem is that rent is sky high in rents are about how much an SSI check is. And subsidized housing apartments have long waiting lists. And once you get into an apartments you be fine and could stay in it as long as you want.

Personally to me though, in the back of my mind I don't really feel ""safe"" inside the apartments just for the fact that the landlords could kick you out for any reason they see fit &amp; you most likely be living right next to troublemaker neighbors too. And their monthly inspections &amp; pest controls &amp; maintenance. Its not like im going to dirty the place up its just I don't like how they can come inside where your living at any time they please. it feels like legal trespassing. I had this happen with roommates I was living with at my previous apartment in the landlords &amp; maintenance felt like they were coming in every other week in if they see or smell something they don't like they can evict you. It's like you have to keep the place squeaky perfectly clean at all times throughout the day because anything they don't like they can evict you because of it.

Speaking of roommates, Just thinking of living with roommates gives me hella anxiety &amp; depression. I don't like sharing a bathroom with someone or a room inside someones house. I don't know the roommates or the landlord from jack adam they could be a troublemaker for all I know.

But because the government says this is how much money you get the only thing you can afford with it is a room like that.

Personally, I rather own my own place. I don't have to deal with anyone else. I can live in it all to myself in peace &amp; quietness. I don't have to deal with ever being kicked out. But there's problems with that too. I don't understand how a basic human necessity such as getting your house/shelter can be this difficult to obtain.......

To be able to get a home loan, you need to get your credit score high in if you don't have that can take about 6 months to years to  get it high enough to qualify. Not only that but you need to get a cosigner on the loan to boost the DTI because SSI is not enough just by itself. So I have to go find someone else willing to just do that &amp; they are responsible on this loan as well? And most likely they wanna live inside the home too so if I wanna live by myself I can't do that???? All because SSI is not enough for the DTI to qualify for the home loan???? It's just ridiculous the stuff that you gotta do just to get yourself a basic human necessity...............................

The other options that I can think of to own your own place is that out of the SSI checks start putting &amp; saving money into an ABLE account because inside those accounts you can hold more money than the SSI limit allows. You can put $15,000 per year inside the accounts vs the regular $2,000 SSI limit.

You can use the ABLE account to buy a small land &amp; I guess a tiny house/mobile home or something? I really don't know how much it costs to buy a complete tiny house/mobile home. But there's all kinds of risks and stuff that you have keep in mind too with the land &amp; tiny house/mobile home. Does the land have the sewer, electric, water if not thats a lot more money? Are there any infestations of animals on the land (like snakes, scorpions or something) And does the home have good electrical wiring, roofing, etc? If not there can be fires &amp; leakage from rain &amp; floods.

What kind of insurances I need?

And the land might not be able to get high speed &amp; low latency internet thats very good for online gaming because thats also the most important to me at least


All this stuff just really exhausts my brain thinking about all this just to get your own place that you can call your own &amp; a basic human necessity................................. 

I'm going through a housing crisis right now in im trying to evaluate all of this.

But honestly once you have housing covered, you could use the free time you would have to learn &amp; research all kinds of stuff like business &amp; skills if you wanted to do that to transitioned into a six figure income or more. That's just an idea if you ever decide you wanna keep working.

I just don't know. what do you guys think? Is it worth living on SSI in poverty to not having to work?",False,gwosp4,JackfruitIcy471,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gwosp4/is_it_worth_living_on_ssi_in_poverty_to_not_work/,12,1

784,First Full-time Job and I Hate my Life Already?,"I just started my first full-time job yesterday, and I absolutely hate it. I have a bachelors degree, and am currently pursuing a master's degree. I've done a few political and government internships since that's the field I am interested in, and have only had 2 small part time jobs throughout undergrad for brief periods of time. Luckily i'm in a position where I don't need to work at all. I live at home and my parents pay my tuition, but I still realize I need work experience for when I do graduate. I mean, how lame would it be if I graduated with a master's degree and had minimal work experience? 

Anyway, I hate the job I just started. It was kind of given to me too, and the pay is great for someone with no real expenses, but it's so drab. The furniture is moldy, the commute is over and hour, the people are dead inside, and the work is tedious and uninteresting. This makes it all worse because I already hate the idea of wasting away 40 hours of my week for something I don't care about, when I could be doing things that I enjoy and focusing on my studies. I just feel bad because my mom has been freaking out about me finally getting a ""real job"". She's over the moon, and it feels like this is the first time in a while that she's shown interest in my professional life. I don't want to quit because I already quit law school after the first day, so it feels like giving up without even trying, but I actually hate it here. 

Honestly, I just need some advice. Am I being overly dramatic? Should I give it a week or two or go with my gut?",False,gvesk3,citrusboyssister,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gvesk3/first_fulltime_job_and_i_hate_my_life_already/,25,2

787,Should I turn down a promotion during a pandemic?,"I got a job as a bartender in December. It was my dream job at first, no complaints. In February, the owners approached me about managing day-to-day operations. I was thrilled. They set a “trial month” (where I do the work with no additional pay or real authority, which kinda rubbed me the wrong way), right before we closed because of the pandemic. 

Now we’ve re-opened, I’ve restarted the trial month, and I’m already feeling micro-managed. It seems they still want to make decisions themselves (big or small), from behind the scenes, while I am on the front line as sort of the messenger/barrier between them and other employees.

They seem untrusting. I have to jump through hoops to do what should be simple tasks (ex: they won’t give me direct access to accounts or company cards, I have to ask each time I need it).

They’re also pushing the boundaries already on what my responsibilities are. I assumed it would mostly be weekly ordering, scheduling, resolving customer complaints, etc. But now they’re asking me to come up with entirely new systems. Still in the trial period.

Also, I’ve been refraining from seeming pushy, but I have brought up pay twice, with only vague responses- no numbers. I’m assuming this will be discussed at our review, but normally when you’re applying or trying a job, you know the details of what you’re getting yourself into.

Now I’m hesitant on whether or not I should even take the position. It’s already caused me additional stress, double the hours, no balance- and I have a feeling their monetary offer is going to be way below the expectation.

My husband recently got laid off from a corporate management position with a similar boss. So on one hand I feel it’s now my responsibility to make more money, but his experience also showed me how draining a vague, micro-managed position can be.

791,Small Business pretending Covid19 is over (venting/ranting),"I live in a southern state that was “shut down” (only clearly non essential businesses, a lot of businesses never closed though) from around the middle of March until around the middle of May. The small business I work for was shut down in that time because we’re a clothing/jewelry boutique, so definitely not essential in the slightest. 
I was given the ultimatum of losing my job or coming back by May 15, so I came back. My boss “couldn’t find” any sanitizing cleaner, so I ended up buying my own Lysol to bring to work to sanitize the credit card pin pad/door handles/etc. (Wasn’t compensated at all for it, either). 
We started selling fabric face masks, and my boss brought down a series of like 150pt huge font printed pieces of paper that say “WE SELL FACE MASKS” to put in the front window. 
The problem is, my state has had the highest reported positive cases since covid started just yesterday - higher even than any single day we were shut down (our percent positive cases increased too, so it isn’t just increased testing, covid is legitimately increasing here). When I got into work today, I saw that my boss had removed the sign on our front door that tells customers our maximum occupancy based on sq. footage and to maintain social distancing, which was part of the governor’s mandate for businesses to reopen. 
I cannot for the life of me understand how you can advertise that you’re selling face masks to reduce transmission of a highly contagious virus, and then just blatantly IGNORE any guidelines that were put in place TO REDUCE TRANSMISSION OF A HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS VIRUS. This is far from the only example I have of him basically pretending covid isn’t happening while simultaneously selling face masks. He literally said almost verbatim, “maybe some people need to die, maybe it’s just their time,” to me the first day I was back at work, so I know for sure he’s not taking this seriously at all. 
I ended up making my own max. occupancy sign and put it back on the front door where the old one was. I work alone usually, so I’ll be enforcing those while I’m here. If it causes an issue, I guess I’ll have to decide if it’s even worth it to keep working here, or if I need to move on to something else.

Now that she is older, her knees are causing her trouble. She’s just older all around. She needs to be able to see a doctor. The company isn’t even giving her benefits on purpose. She’s able to quietly finesse the system so that she can acquire this small necessity.

798,Is self employment the route to a happier work life?,"I've not seen much said about self employment on this forum, and I'm wondering if it's something people here aspire to?

I just subbed to antiwork and have been enjoying going through the range of posts on here.

I love the crossover between politics, mental health and personal freedom that seems to flow through a lot of the posts here.

But I was wondering if you view the idea of working for yourself as a form of breakaway from the system that makes work unappealing - de-alienation of the worker if you wanna get Marxist about it. Or if you see self employment as the further commodification of the worker, still constrained by the shackles of the capitalist nexus.

And if you're interested in where I'm coming from with this, I quit my job last year to go self employed, and have a podcast about it.

812,Humans aren’t meant to sit in an office 8+ hours a day and I can’t take it.,"I can’t take it anymore. Every day I take a long commute to work (I live in an expensive city and my salary doesn’t cover me to not live further out), usually a carpool which in itself is dramatic and uncomfortable (people spending 3 hours a day cramped together really start to get on each others nerves). And the days I have to take public transport, it’s hot and gross and usually so busy that I stand the whole way just wishing the minutes away.

That’s even before I get into work. When I arrive I sit down under the fluorescent lights and take time to adjust to them before starting up the computer and listening to the dull office chatter. The office is open plan so if there’s one loud person then that’s all you hear all day.

Lunch time comes around and I’m so socially anxious and on edge all the time that I skip it to avoid the public lunch rooms. I then spend the rest of the day hunched over a computer counting down the hours until it’s time to get back into a miserable carpool or busy bus. 3pm is the worst, it feels like time slows down at this point.

Some days I don’t even have work to do. Those days I find a deserted toilet and just sit in there to pass the time and get away from everything.

On the way home I often feel so exhausted I fall asleep in the car. Sometimes I’ve fallen asleep both ways. When I get home finally I’m so mentally  drained that I can’t find the motivation to move apart from having food. I sit in front of the tv and just zone out for 3 hours and then it’s bed time with the next day looming over my head.

When it gets to the weekend, I spend Friday feeling much happier because I know I’ll get two days away from this all. Saturday comes around and I start to feel depressed again because I know that I only have sunday left before it all starts again. Sunday is spent worrying and dreading it all starting again.

We are not meant to be stuck in like this for so long every week day. It’s a strain on my mental and physical health but I have to make myself unhappy just so I can live and buy food and a place to stay. I envy the rich so much. Imagine not having to do this?

818,Two years out of college and I'm already sick of working (long rant),"Before I graduated from college, I had several career options in mind. I wanted to be a business analyst, marketing analyst, or financial analyst because they seemed like interesting careers that paid well. I applied to hundreds of jobs before/after graduating from college and kept failing interviews because of my social anxiety/and inability to make myself seem like a good candidate. I dreaded interviews. I was always nervous and messed up no matter how much I practiced/prepped for the interview.

After a year of grueling interviews, I landed a job as a content reviewer. It wasn't what I wanted, but I took it because it seemed interesting and I'd be getting paid. However, it was anything BUT interesting. My mental health slowly deteriorated to the point that I would sigh before getting out of my car to walk to the office because of the content I'd have to review. A month into the job, I decided to quit because my mental health was more important to me than working in a job that didn't even require me to use my degree. 

A few months after quitting, I got another job as an administrative assistant. Still not what I wanted, but I had no choice at this point. I wanted to quit within the first few days of doing the job because they slammed me with training on a bunch of different areas and I got overloaded because of all the technical terms and steps. I decided to tough it out and after two months, everything settled down. I didn't even have to do some of the stuff they trained me on. 

A couple of months ago I had my first break down while driving to work. I started crying because I was tired. I was tired of everything. I was tired of doing the same repetitive work over and over. I was tired of getting paid little. I was tired of not being in the career that I intended after I graduated. I thought I'd be stuck doing this type of meaningless work for the rest of my life, despite having tried so hard to get a college education. 

Most importantly, I was tired of working. I was nostalgic about my college days. The days where I'd see different faces every day as I walked through campus, the days where I was surrounded by like-minded individuals that I could talk about anything with. Being stuck in an office for 8 hours a day, around the same people, doing the same damn thing, and faking being professional is tiring. 

Recently I've been thinking, asides from the obvious reasons for working such as money (to repay debt, repay parents, groceries, material goods, and traveling). What is my purpose for working? Why do I want to have a certain job title when all I'm doing is being a human-robot for a company? Why do I have to work until retirement age? Why is a certain career more respectable than another career? Why do I care about people's opinions about what career I have? Will I ever be truly satisfied with any job that I have? Does a dream job even exist? Why are we stuck in this system of working our lives away for things that we don't even need? 

TL;DR It's been two years since I graduated, had two jobs that I absolutely hated, and am upset that despite having a college degree I'm still stuck doing low-paying jobs that don't require me to have a degree",False,gxyxa9,throwaway-eggtamago,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gxyxa9/two_years_out_of_college_and_im_already_sick_of/,7,1
819,Please don't forget that the 40-hour work week was fought for by WORKERS and not created by or given to us by business owners.,"While the 40-hour work week is outdated and should be reduced without efficiency loss, please don't forget that countless workers and unions fought to get a more humane work/life balance from the previous system that offered next to no workers rights and could enforce extreme work hours without any repercussions. Capitalists and business owners did not create and design the 40-hour work week to keep you bored at your cubicle. Workers fought to reduce 12+ hour days of hard and dangerous industrial labor to a more humane 8-hours along with laws against child labor and better worker safety. This is not in defense of maintaining 40-hour work weeks but it's to remind everyone that many people fought and died for you to rightfully complain about being forced to work 8-hours a day regardless of productivity.

823,Failure to launch,"I shouldn't have bothered going to university. I have a BSc in physics with first class honours (2015) and an MSc in nuclear science (2019). I was given a stipend and a bursary for the master's because the nuclear industry is a shortage area. Ironically, I cannot get a job even in the nuclear sector and every job advert wants experience.

I feel like I am living life on hard mode. I expend vast amounts of mental and emotional energy and in return I am getting absolutely nowhere in life. Case in point; I have never earnt more than minimum wage. I have had to sit an exam for almost every job, job application or postgraduate application I have ever done. Again, I have to put in so much work. I have to grovel for everything.

I should have gone to medical school after my A levels. I have made a huge mistake and wasted the last 14 years of my life (I am 32 now) but how was I suppost to know? To get into medical school now as a postgraduate is very hard in the UK, so again I feel like I am doing things the hard way.

830,Overwhelming sense of guilt.,"I’m a fresh university grad that was done with school 2 weeks ago. My mother has graciously offered to not pester me about having a job for the month of June (meaning I must have a job by July), and yet, I feel so worthless for not even so much as spending my time curating my resume or applying for jobs. I’ve spent the last weeks doing nothing but listening to music and playing video games.

I just saw an Amazon commercial (I know it’s propaganda) that showed a mother who has a son working, and it occurred to me that many people sacrifice their own wants (or at least voluntarily shut off their minds) to do what is needed, and I feel guilty for not even having the motivation to do the same. Why is it that the only thing I currently feel compelled to do is play video games and listen to music? Why do I care that I’m not doing what’s “right” by society’s standards? Why do I feel so guilty?

I work in finance for a hospital and I've got a full plate of responsibilities, easily enough to fill 40 hrs (salaried). But i keep getting new recurring tasks, new initiatives, new responsibilities. People here are expected to go above and beyond for the potential reward of a promotion and more work. I feel like even with a raise, my employer wins in terms of productivity/dollar paid. 

Some people are cool with this trade off, and that's great, but it doesn't work for me. I like my leisure time. I'd happily earn less and get more time back, and I'm aware it is a privilege to be able to say that.

The problem is, if I don't do great work, take on extra, then I'm perceived as a lazy worker or not invested. There's no middle ground. I just witnessed a bunch of folks get fired after being in their positions for years.

835,Worse resignation experience ever,"Told manager I wanted to quit today. I raised the issue of my deteriorating mental health a month ago. They tried to make arrangements for me, e.g. suggesting a break, a transfer. But nothing worked out in the end. Okay whatever that's fine.

Some highlights from the excruciating and inappropriate ""I quit"" conversation:

(also need opinions on whether my resignation talk experience is normal cuz I honestly feel super disturbed by the entire event)

* Manager's first question was, ""What made you so traumatized?"". I replied that traumatized isn't the appropriate word to be used.
* Manager went on to probe about personal issues like: my academic background, my future plans, how long do I plan to rest and what ""elements"" do I like in a job. Lol why was he turning this into a full-blown job interview? To be fair, he made a sound point here that not understanding what you want/don't want in a career would only give rise to the same problems again. But I already knew that, so it felt condescending (he always advises me on super obvious stuff and makes me feel I'm dumb).
* Plus, I am resigning on the ground that I need to focus on my mental health (tbh I reaaaaally need to settle this). Would you force an employee to talk about his/her future career plans if they quit due to ... idk, heart disease? He isn't the nicest to work with and now we're suddenly buddies who could share our personal aspirations and our struggles.
* He went on about how big our firm is (we're growing!) and how I could simply transfer to another department. He also made an underhanded comment about how other places are shit. (*You wanna go into industry B in the future? I knew someone working in that industry. Their hours are shit!)* Basically telling me that I might land myself in a shitty position if I leave.

See, I had to put in extended pauses during the conversation because I was not comfortable with the interrogation. At one point I reminded him that the purpose of the conversation was to work out the resignation process and to plan for transition if needed.

(additional highlights: My interview experience for this job was shit as well because the hiring person spent the entire session tearing my resume apart and insinuated in the end that I should be grateful if I ever receive an offer from their glorious firm. He also stated that they would fire me within 3 months if I don't perform)",False,gwcok9,elderberry520,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gwcok9/worse_resignation_experience_ever/,1,1

Obviously many people end up not succeeding or agreeing to take part in the market and are placed in a position where they are denied access to basic human essentials. 

Then, the people who support this system usually ridicule and complain about the existence of the homeless, free-riders ect. For them to do this is not only disgusting, but it shows a complete lack of self awareness.

Let’s imagine you have $100k in savings. (Most don’t). That 100k would be GONE in less than 6 months. Then you’re on medicare and transferred to an even shittier nursing home.

Because I know if I suddenly got 100k I would choose a less stressful job that I didn’t have to work so hard at and use that 100k to supplement my lifestyle. They would no longer be able to control me as well. 

Nursing homes are also a side effect of our toxic culture. Families work so much they can’t take care of their loves ones even if they want to. It’s horrible",False,gyqvl7,thefutureisbottlecap,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gyqvl7/a_lightbulb_moment_about_nursing_homes/,7,1
857,I am a medical student and I am antiwork,"For context, I am a medical student, dont want to say which country, but I am Indian (non-resident, haven't been there in 10 years or so) and I am completely against work. No, I am not against working as a doctor later, and previously I was a medic. 

I have seen so many patients in the hospital where I am trained whose disease is directly caused due to occupational exposure that it disgusts me. A patient came to the department of internal medicine who had severe heart failure and had suffered 3 heart attacks (myocardial infarctions) and also had lung cancer due to a 40 year career as a construction worker. He was dying because he couldn't breathe anymore and for what? Just so that some real estate owning prick could make a huge profit selling real estate. 

No one should be expected to trade their health, their right to a safe and happy life just to be able to afford to live, have hobbies and pursue happiness. All these weird occupational safety laws do only the bare minimum to protect workers and they all have caveats to save bosses and employers, not the worker. 

No amount of socialized healthcare can change the fact that most people should not have to suffer ill health only to be able to barely feed their families. 

I completely support being anti-work. Medicine is a passion, which is why I joined med school, and the country that I am living in now hardly pays a dime to doctors but I still want to go to work because this is my passion. Anyone who says that people who are against work and employment are lazy or worthless as human beings is nothing more than a corporate slave-driving bootlicker. I am sick of having to watch patients whose only crime was the desire to be able to feed themselves and try to lead a half decent life, and the price they have to pay is their lungs, their hearts, their bodies.",False,gwmhm3,BlackMackSnackCrack,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gwmhm3/i_am_a_medical_student_and_i_am_antiwork/,5,2

862,"Just had a mass exodus at the small coffee/bake shop I work at, kickstarted by the riots. Working on my courage too (Wall of text incoming)","Our manager, who is black, sent a group text to the staff that she would be taking a few days off, and was honest about not feeling safe being out in the world due to the state of our country. 

All personal feelings about that set aside, we all offered to stay late/arrive early for our shifts to provide coverage, including the one other black girl in the shop, who said ""Me too. I'll contact you later for specifics."" 

So the owner misinterpreted both of the texts, thinking they were both quitting, wrote back to the entire group text ""Take care ladies. FYI team, interviewing for a new manager! Fingers crossed!"" and then went on a rant at the shop in front of other employees (no customers). 

I was not there, so I cannot say what exactly was said, but her nephew (also an employee), said that although she did not use any actual slurs, she was very disparaging. The gist of what I was able to gather is that the owner insinuated they would be joining the ""losers"" at the protests/riots, and so were losers themselves. I believe there was also a ""Fuck them!"" thrown in.  

At the end of the day, during my shift, her nephew privately pulled her aside, and told her that she was way out of line and was not acting appropriately in front of her employees. That's when she doubled down and actually brought ME into it, how she is tired of the ""disrespect"" and brought up the previous manager, a guy who helped her open the store just over a year ago, and also left on bad terms. (She seems to have created this fiction in her mind that I was ""tainted"" by the guy, I suppose to help maintain her denial of how deranged and woefully unprepared she is at both business management and people management). To clarify, this was all behind my back. Her nephew informed me of everything after she left. 

Anyway, long story longer, her nephew then informed our manager and the other employee who unwittingly got pulled into the whole thing. This was all on Wednesday. Thursday night, the manager calls me and let's me know that she, the other employee, and the owner's nephew would be quitting, and by this morning (Friday; I was off) they had all contacted the owner to let her know. This all after she apparently talked to whoever was on shift at the time in a ""damage control"" effort. 

Which brings me to me! Kind of in a tough spot because while I do have an interview in the morning, I am scheduled to close, and I will be closing with only her. Now, she has never bothered to learn the front end stuff. She is primarily the main baker, and she has 2 other full time bakers. So not only am I not looking forward to the impending shitshow on a Saturday, I do not want to be in the building alone with her. 

On the one hand, I know it is not wise to quit without having something affirmatively lined up, but I wonder about the toll on the psyche that staying with a passive aggressive and demeaning wolf-in-sheep's-clothing employer (obviously I'm not providing the whole story here). Been there about as long as the shop's been open, and though she didn't get this bad until around the holidays, it has certainly been

878,"My story, and how I cannot imagine living this way for another 50 years","Hello everyone. 

I am a 24 years old student in Canada, about to finish a master's degree. I started my very last internship on June 1st, and it's been the most emotional I have ever been in my entire life.

My first mistake was to apply to a huge company (50 000+ employes, multiple sites, etc). I. Fucking. Hate. It. I'm a number in a database and nothing feels personal nor real for that matter. The work environment is currently fucked because of covid, which implies a lot of work from home. This is the only good thing that has come out of this internship so far. 

Thinking about work makes me physically sick (digestion problems mostly, but headaches and racing heart as well). Every single night, I lay in bed for hours, crying because I hate this job so goddamn much. But I cannot quit because I need to graduate, otherwise I'm not gonna receive my master's.

I feel trapped in this position, and it's been giving me suicidal thoughts. I've been down this path before, and I decided to sign up for online counselling. I am currently waiting to have my therapist appointed to me. 

But the thing that sticks out the most, is how difficult the transition from school to work is. I cannot even begin to imagine working a 9-5 job for the rest of my life. The thought of being chained to a desk fills me with despair and, quite frankly, sends me spiralling down a very dangerous route. 

I'm at the point where I need someone to relate with, because NO ONE in my family understands how I feel. I'm the only person with a university education, and we have very different sets of values. I need to have some kind of direction as to what I'm supposed to do next.

Instead, I'm sitting here helping business owners install software on their PCs. The owner of the company I work for wrote us an e-mail saying how he acknowledges that what has happened with George Floyd was a tragedy, but then goes right into saying how business owners have been affected and deserve our utmost consideration and assistance during this time. Of course, my coworkers reply in aw and act as if he's doing us a huge favor by taking our limited time and selling it back to us at garbage wages. 

I feel like I'm not only a failure to society but also to myself; history is happening and I'm sitting here on the sidelines for the sake of a wage. I've sold myself and my life out.

I'm not sure what to do at this point... The 9-5:30pm is ruining my existence. I don't vent to people much anymore because most just say, ""Well, it's a job"" or ""Be grateful you're working, you could be in the street or worse.""

I recently came across this sub and the concept of it is really interesting to me. I've read a few posts and I'm a little confused. I can't tell if your against working jobs and just having an occupation at all, or if you are against the big business/corporations that get tons of money and pay their workers little. 

Part of my confusion is also that some jobs are really important but not a lot of people want to do them and even if some people can find passion in them what if it's not enough people to cover that field of work.

I do agree that a capitalist society definitely can create a lot of economic disparity, but I am a believer that capitalism has helped spur a lot of innovation in all sorts of fields and products.

Expectations doubled tenfold:

\-we're only given ten minutes to work an account   
\-We have to log every single minute we're not marking an account complete (we're collectors for a   
DME company) and turn it in at the end of the day to explain what we've been doing   
\-Our expected accounts per day doubled, and even if you exceed that goal on a daily basis you'll get in trouble and considered a 'productivity concern' because you had a day where you had to do paperwork heavy tasks like authorizations. 

\-Our task list before we're even allowed to do our main assignment has grown significantly. We've been getting other department's work, we get several emails every day told to drop whatever we're doing and do this instead, and we get bulk accounts back to work again with the simple note 'fix it' and nothing else.  All to get reprimanded every morning when you're behind your actual job description. 

\-Constantly told how 'lucky' we are to still have jobs and constantly threatening to bring us back into the office because it's a 'privilege' to not work in a crowded office during a fucking pandemic when the job is totally doable from home which has been proven for the past 3 months.  

My supervisor has been rude, dismissive, unhelpful and she plays favorites with three of our coworkers who incidentally are the dumbest hicks I've ever had the displeasure of working with. They make everything a racial issue and/or a political issue where they have to 'own the libs'. They have made several inappropriate comments to me as a half chinese woman regarding the virus which my supervisor found HI-larious. HR has been called on them several times, nothing happens. Just this week they used our work chat to make fun of the protestors. 

Yesterday I was in a meeting with my supervisor and her boss about the working conditions and I was gaslit to hell or given an excuse and talked down to like I was a spoiled 3 year old.

899,Finally left my first real job! Also what I have learned.,"On April 8th 2019 I started my first proper job as a Data Analyst. I was very hopeful going in, with high expectations and wanting to prove myself to be the best. 

This quickly changed. After the first week I learned I was very naive and my optimistic mindset turned very pessimistic. During my time I have had serious bouts of depression due to work where at one point it was so bad that I was having suicidal thoughts and took a month off of work. I had planned to hand in my notice right after this month off but due to personal life circumstances I couldn't do that. This handing in my notice was supposed to be in October 2019. I ended up handing it in in March 2020 and was meant to leave on the 9th of April 2020. But due to the pandemic situation I extended my contract by two months. Which leads to today, today was my last day and I'm finished. I feel very relieved and liberated. I know it isn't the ideal time to be unemployed, but I think this decision to leave is the best for me.

The things I have learned are the following:

1) Corporate world is hell

2) Companies do not care about you

3) Rock the boat somewhat and you will get in huge trouble

4) Seniors will give you a hard time if you are not submissive

5) Work in the grand scheme of things just isn't important. You are important, your mental health is import, your hobbies are important and your happiness is important. Obviously, with how the system is structured we're going to unfortunately need jobs but what I'm saying is there's more important things in life.

Not sure how the future looks for me right now, this pandemic is of course problematic, but right now I'm happy to have some rest.",False,gx9avb,prabhjit94,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gx9avb/finally_left_my_first_real_job_also_what_i_have/,12,4

904,Competency based interviews,"I hate them, they're a form of bigotry against anyone who isn't a corporate extrovert type. In fact I've been applying for teaching courses to upskill from my current job, so I can get a secure teaching job, and am surprised to see this corporate nonsense infest its way into education. They basically ask for the life of a fictional character, I've never had any real, overt conflicts in the workplace, I've never worked in a team etc I haven't led that life of the office go getter, I've never even worked in an office and would be remiss to do so if it was ""corporate"". I find the types of people who use them to be also highly corporate and by that I mean they lack any remotely human characteristics, they just come across as arrogant, shallow and judgemental. The kind of person who came up with this and the so called ""STAR"" technique (which sounds condescending as is, I remember this bs from school e.g. stars awarded /being called a star), must be a shit stain on humanity. Any interview which has ever been about the actual job has gone well when these types of questions were absent. The interviewers were comparatively less odd in that disturbing corporate way you get with competency based interviewers, there was way less bs and answering technical questions was easy. 

I interviewed with The Foundry back in 2010. They make a compositing program called NUKE. I read the entire manual for NUKE only to be subjected to a competency based interview, which I bombed. I was baffled why they would use personality questions as opposed to asking about the actual fucking job! Irony or ironies, I knew more about the software than the interviewer and pointed out obscure facts about it which she didn't know, I didn't get the job either way as I had the ""wrong"" personality. I'm still angry about that interview because of how judgemental the interviewer was and how the questions were a kind of personality discrimination in that unless you conformed exactly to Mr. Corporate (tm) you were out.

I have social anxiety disorder, which I can manage well enough to be functional, but it is very exhausting. 
Having to work, any job really, pretty much takes over my whole life because it’s highly draining through the day and I simply don’t have energy for anything else. I get home from work and I just couch potato and go between being anxious in anticipation of the next work day or dissociating until bed and then do it all over again the next day. 
Being off for quarantine is probably the most peaceful time I’ve ever had. I’ve been waking up looking forward to the day, I’ve been doing all my hobbies like sewing and other crafting, I’ve had energy to keep my house clean, cooking healthy meals, journaling, I’ve been more available for my partner, just overall much happier and content feeling. 

And then as soon as y’all about return to work started, I’ve been back in this anxiety, constant low grade adrenaline rush happening.

Like keep in mind that am African not even African American and yet I see exactly what his talking about. I don't understand how racist people think or work do they think we just chose this skin colour? Do they think we're playing The Sims in real life? If you are white I understand am different from you but bro everyone outside your consciousness is different from you whether they share your skin colour or not that's a real person just like you(mom, father, family, dog whatever a person breathing air experiencing life just like you) if you are Racist am sorry am black if I could undo it I would. Even better if I had a choice I would choose not to live. 

I don't see how I can keep living in a world where based on your skin colour you are automatically assigned to a role where just because of that one thing(your race) you are supposed to face so much, just imagine living life everyday fearing police not for what you've done no. But for what they will do to people with your skin colour....i can't go. I hate that their are people who will read this and think am making myself as a victim am not(am not even African American I think these guys have advantages that's we in Third world countries don't, but what am most grateful for is the fact that where am from we don't fear the police nor do they beat us to the point where we die) and if that's what triggers you of all I wrote please reflect on yourself. 

I'm not Christian so I know justice won't be served in no heaven or hell, I know very well that the people who came before me centuries ago whose lives where taken with no second thoughts I know very well that their is no  ultimate justice.

922,A fun game to play at work,"We have all been there. You're running late because you simply didn't have the will to get out of bed. You call out because you can't muster the strength to deal with the petty bullshit in the work place. So what do you do? Make up an excuse to your boss why you are calling out or running late. However my friend and I got tired of the same ole ""the situation with my grandmother or whatever"" excuse and the game was born.

A friend of mine and myself have been competing in a little contest just to spice things up. We make up goofy and sometimes outrages lies to the reasons why we aren't coming in or running late. The point of the game is to get the supervisor to believe it . Points for originality, the more outrageous claims, and of course the boss's reaction to it. 

Two days ago I was about 20 minutes late to work. Of course during the day my supervisor asks me ""what happened why were you late"". Off the top of my head I chuckled and said ""when I went out to my car this morning there was a bird stuck inside my car"". He says ""A BIRD?"" ""yeah you know a bird"". I continue to say "" Yeah it turns out I accidentally left my back window open so when I got in my car I freaked out and thought it was a bat flapping around. I tried getting it out by opening all the doors but it got stuck in the back windshield. Finally when it tired itself out I pushed it out of the car"". 

I am almost positive that he believed me.

While I’m ""[a special need guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome)"" and thus less likely to make a living, I’m also intentionally underperforming, because let’s be real here - getting paid for doing nothing is the TITS! I already researched how to get the most for the least with my condition in my country, when I was a teen.

And sure enough, I only ""studied"" as an excuse to make my parents shut the fuck up and collect benefits for having something my way for change.

Also, I do have some idea of what working 8 hours a day would be like. Getting my media assistant degree included internships with some assholes, who never knew what they wanted.

Until the last few years, I was in a ""rehabilitative work"" in various places, until they realized I won’t become a normal worker by serving all kinds of twats for €9 a day.

Now I have a flat and I pay a rent cheaper than the average of my area. Why? Because I pay my rent for a foundation, that’s been buying apartments for autistic people to rent. I’m telling you - being autistic enough to get special treatment is the best, especially in Nordic countries with their generous welfare systems.

""Everyone has to pull their weight."" Suck my dick. I’ll pull my weight, when I get to do a job that I like and what pays at least 150% of what I get now. Also, I’ll only bother when my employers or customers get their shit together and don’t judge me for my weaknesses. Which is never in this mock of a society. Also, no guarantees = no deal. I’m more than a marionette for a corporate fuckface to play with. I’m a human being, who deserves whatever he manages to suck out of his country’s system, as a life-long compensation for his disadvantaged position as a poorly raised Aspie. That’s right. I’ll respond to the entitlement of employers by being more selfish than they could imagine.

954,"A personal anti-work renaissance, please let me know your thoughts","Greetings, r/antiwork

This is my first time here and I'm glad I found you. I have a brief description of my situation, ending with a question.


I'm a salary worker currently working from home. Nobody before me has successfully performed my job at my company, but I've been doing pretty well and been getting positive feedback. People have even commented that they don't understand how I have the time to do everything I do.

The secret is that I really only do a few hours of real work most days. When I was in the office, this played out in acting busy quite often, which kills the soul. Now that I'm at home, I can practice playing music or something else, but I end up feeling guilty about it. 

I used to read a lot of anti-work and crimethinc books back in the day which helped to uproot just some capitalism-based morality. Currently I want to do the bare minimum in my job so I don't have to do the bare minimum in my life, but on the other hand I want to find ways to be excellent at my job. 

This goes back to the capitalism issue; my company is owned by sales people who do not reinvest in the company. So our internal technology and processes are outdated and weak, making it impossible to do my job as effectively as I know I could with the right resources.

My previous job was truly pointless; I was hired so that somebody could go on vacation. While working that job I absolutely learned how to look busy when fucking off but still getting required work done. 

Basically I'm looking to get your thoughts on my situation. Sometimes I think I'm NOT pounding out the work everyday because I learned bad habits and I'm not motivated, but sometimes I think that if I can get away with doing the minimum amount of work then it is my right to ride that wave. 

I think I can guess the flavor of most answers based on the sub, but I'm really just hoping to hear anything back to help me think.",False,gvbj49,frantalones,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gvbj49/a_personal_antiwork_renaissance_please_let_me/,18,5

Comrades from America and across the World! We live in perilous times. Fascism is knocking at the door; the elites have finally unleashed their servile and armed dogs at the throats of the people. To those who said that It can´t happen here, It´s happening here, right now.

For the future of humanity, we must not stand idly by while our world is plunged into Fascism. The time is right for the workers and the comrades of this world to rise up.

Therefore, someone, not me, has created a call to action. June 5th, 2020, a general strike in America shall begin. It is currently being organized and debated in r/june2020generalstrike. The idea is still in its infancy, but it is spreading fast.

We call you to 1) Spread the news of the strike to everyone you know. 2) Organize with your fellow coworkers and the unions. 3) Prepare however you can to strike and protest.

We call for all those who truly care about the future of humanity to join the ranks of this strike. Let us leave aside our petty differences, and let us rise and reclaim our right to be free! From Anchorage to Miami, and from around the world:

975,I feel like I'm going crazy,"I'm a government employee (who works with the public a little) and I've been teleworking for 3 solid months now due to coronavirus.

I initially started teleworking when I told my boss that I had COVID19 symptoms. I did this on purpose because I didn't feel safe going to work and sitting close to coworkers in the middle of the outbreak. We were still doing business-as-usual at that point (early March). I'm in the NYC area. I was granted permission to stay home teleworking for 2 weeks and told to take a COVID19 test. I never took the test because my Doctor wouldn't order it (they were severely limited at the time, and I was pretty plain with her that I was bullshitting my employer about symptoms because I was scared to go to work.) Due to the scare I created at work, the City decided to let ALL employees work from home right when my 2 week quarantine period was ending.

Fast forward 3 months. I'm more productive than ever. My employees are doing more than ever. I am a low level manager with a 2 person department that I give 10/10 star performance reviews to every year and don't give a fuck what they actually do because fuck this City. We have an understanding that if they just tread water, I don't care. They usually play videos at their desk most of the day and I turn my head because I hate my boss and this city and work in general. ANYWAY, DIGRESSION.

I found out today we ALL have to go back to work in the office 9-5 (not even staggered shifts) and resume work as usual. The same work we are fucking doing right now AT HOME. They plan to put up SHOWER CURTAINS between our desks. There is no plan to clean the staff bathrooms more than nightly. We are told to wear masks as much as possible at our desks. I wrote a strongly worded email to my Boss about how ludicrous this is, not to mention dangerous. He said he agrees with me but there's nothing he can do. He relies on me to run the fundamentals of our department, so I need a good working relationship with him or my life will be even more hellish than it is.

I don't know what the fuck to do. I want to quit, but I'm so deeply entrenched in this organization, and I'm worried I'll never get another job in this economy. I could survive a while and help my partner with his business (he's self-employed), so it's not totally bleak. Just a big risk.

I already requested to continue to work from home, but I don't think it'll be approved. I'm told not even HEALTH ACCOMMODATIONS are likely to be granted. I have considered saying ""Bye"" but the hand-off of my position would take bare minimum 2 weeks due to everything I do and manage. No one in my City department (except my own 2-person department) knows how to even like operate a fucking computer mouse without a 10 page manual, so handing off would be really difficult. I sorta made it this way on purpose for job security. Now I feel trapped.

I'm doubly trapped because my boss relies on me and I need to keep a good working relationship. I can't just be a total dick to him or I might as well just quit in that case anyway.

On the flipside, the City where I work (and other people I know) are making me feel crazy for feeling unsafe returning to work. A lot of things have opened back up despite numbers not going down much. We're in the OG hot zone over here, but people are sick of staying home, and all think it's ""time"" to just ""go back to normal"" so talking to most people is no help.

Anyway, it feels better just getting this off my chest. I have no one I can talk to it about except my partner, and he is giving me really wishy-washy advice because he doesn't know what I should do himself. He's really unhappy about me returning to work, though.
