22,Life isn't fair,"My parents made me start working at age 12. None of my siblings were made to get a job. I was kicked off the family phone plan as soon as I turned 18. I don't know why, but its been 10 years and my entire family is still on a plan together. My sister married into a rich family and now doesnt have to work at all. My brother just got engaged to a millionaire, and hasnt ever had a real job in his life. He now spends his time jet-setting to exotic locations doing whatever he wants. My best friend also married into a very wealthy family and hasnt had to work in 3 years. 

Ive been working non stop for what feels like my whole life, and I make under 40k a year. Im so tired and burned out and I feel like a failure. Money stresses me out on a daily basis but all I can seem to manage is keeping my head above water. I drag myself out of bed every day to go to a job that pays me too little where I work too hard.

Yeah, I am jealous. It doesn't feel fair at all. When I was a kid and going to work while all my siblings slept in or hung out with their friends, I would lie to myself and say it would pay off some day. Some day Id have more money, or be offered a better opportunity, or have some sort of leg up because of all the effort and work I'd put in. Now I get to listen to them talk about what fancy vacations they go on regularly, or what kind of new car they bought, or how maybe they'll buy a nice piece of property down at the shore ""to get away from it all"".

26,Is my depression due to chemical imbalance or capitalism? The world may never know,"ty kurapikawithagun Follow

The abolition of psychiatric does not mean that no one is allowed
to identify with psychiatric diagnosis that they feel serve them, or
that no one is allowed to continue taking psychiatric meditations
they find effective‚Äô. It does mean, however, that the notion of
‚Äòmental illness‚Äô was invented to pathologist logical responses to
the stress and trauma that are omnipresent in a world brutalized
by colonialism and capitalism. Psychiatry has been described as a
‚Äúmedicalized colonizing of lands, peoples, bodies, and minds.‚Äù A
notable example of psychiatric‚Äôs colonial intentions was the
diagnosis of ‚Äòdrapetomania‚Äô: the mental ‚Äòdisease‚Äô that explained
why enslaved Black people in the Antebellum south ran away from
their death camps (the ‚Äòtreatment‚Äô for which was to treat them
more ‚Äòlike children‚Äô). Is China Hills states in Globalizing Mental
Health, ‚Äúdistress caused by soil-economic conditions (and often
neoliberal economic reforms) comes to be reticulated as
‚Äòmental illness‚Äô, readable using technique that draw upon similar
rational to those that led to distress initially.‚Äù

 

Such abolition means that the intended and realized outcome of
he advent of ‚Äòmental illness‚Äô as a signifies is to make folks feel like
they will never get better and that their distress is inherent to their
brain chemistry rather than a reaction to external stimuli. His
logic is essentially victim-blaming and shifts responsibility away
from cycle of violence that create the conditions for
psychological suffering ‚Äî not to mention that the ‚Äúchemical
balance‚Äù theory has been numerous debunked. It means, too,
hat psychiatric was built with a core desire to dehumanize, drug,
and discard those whose behavior and ways of being diverged
from the status que. His status que was and is white, patriarch,
and absolutely clamored with respectability and compliance with
he state‚Äôs self-serving notions of ‚Äúnormally.‚Äù

 

 

Any Psychiatric Survivor have made incredible strides in
pursuit of justice, reform, and sometimes abolition. But the
current nature of such wards, which, for the most part, have
remained violent, degrading prisons at which a majority of ex-
inmates assert that they were not helped and were further
dramatized, arguably indicates that the asylum never died. Why?
Because it was never supposed to. Psychiatry of the ethics of the
asylum, and it will not fall until Psychiatry falls.

56,2018-2019 British perspective of work,"Hello readers, this is an incomplete collection of notes and poems compiled in a talking word script that I hope people can relate too. I am not a writer and I consider this work incomplete and at worst a topical ramble. I have been through some exceptional hard times and I needed to express intense emotions when work induced isolation was ruining my life.

For context I am a young adult with learning difficulties since birth,  I live in the North of England, in a region often ignored by the London centric spending government.
Apologies if my grammar is awful. 

~ ~ ~

Lips whisper, pockets empty, the North forgotten to those with plenty, a region where our T‚Äôs are lost in water, furthest from the south, looked upon as paupers. 
Thought is a gift to which we paint a broader picture, bristles dipped with colour from my hearts own literature.
Tedium is endemic, moods are low, will tomorrow's Brexit be the killing blow, to the essential collars soaked in workmans blue, austerity drains them as the one percenters grew.

Like you, I am Stuck in the cycle of 9 to 5, what is a man‚Äôs life worth when it takes a nosedive? 
Concrete ledges beckon an escape, to stand upon the railings, is prevention¬† too late?¬† Where my desire to pass to the other side, is as equal as the shame that wants me to hide. Seeking a remedy from the daily torments I face,¬† I've turned against myself with the blame I continue to lay.

Our culture born from capitalistic greed, 
We hoard our belongings from the desperate and thieves. 
We are told to want, the allure of possession, 
a shackle we voluntarily apply.¬†

I don't believe that my future is bright. I see exploitation in my ceaseless fight, I yearn for social mobility, stuck in place, trapped in a self-made cage.
Most of us are destined for the scurrying we make, tiresome hedonistic treadmills, in the familiar rat race.¬†

Who else tells themselves that they are better than this... where is the solidarity? Competition is fierce.
Sweat expelled,¬† tears swell, bleeding hands our freedoms knell, we build a society with no thought of the game. A system that forgets the forgotten.
If you want to see reality,¬† look about you and see who is suffering. 
Our country is held together from those shouldering pain, it‚Äôs structure and history wrought from colonial gains.¬†



Why are we this blind?¬†

Cannot see the outcome, selected rhetoric stifles our view, the economy ablaze with the fires of consumption. we must perform our systemic patterns of survival for momentary rewards, 
our bodies have become their machines until we are left in sterilised wards. no room for defects you must fit the mould or you are cast aside, 
what is the purpose of being alive, when profits grow but our share is the same, pushed to give our time for what seems like a handful of grain. It's unforgiving, unrelenting, inside this imprisonment we ignore the outside worlds,¬† thinking we are above the delicate ecosystem that delivered us. we cannot out compete the sun no matter how hungry we get we are all destined to burn out.

Him, her, you and you, no matter creed, religion, race, we threw away our humanity for individuality. Immigration, assimilation, some believe our country should be a British born nation of like-minded Caucasians, look toward the businesses who criminally devour our resources, so why do we bicker about people, just like us, who have a different pigmentation.¬†

Our culture is twisted, we have become divided, look to the corporations who need to be reminded, to value us, for all that we do, they feed and gorge off our labour so choose between the two. The options before me are all I can see, a life of uncertainty or wage slavery.¬†

In the hands of the extremely wealthy we slowly delve, harvesting our data they will adapt with a well-played move, the gap between class is chasm that may not improve. Into a world where none of us matter, plastic, oil, trinkets manufactured served on a consumerist silver platter. 
A number we are, packaged and designed, grasping for opportunities before our class is outlined, betrayed by our eyes, hair and hands, the clothes that we wear let them know what we are worth.¬† We need to talk, all of us have got to listen, learn to say I love you before the only smile we know is on the next-day deliveries that turn up to your door.¬†

Every brother and sister, simple pawns in their game, to remove yourself will bring societal shame, whatever they want us to do we must do the opposite. Collectively we have power, vote with your wallets.

Can you feel it? Pressure is about you, this never seems to change, rent is climbing higher, the weekly shopping list is looking rather dire, that pain you are hiding from which there is no freedom until you retire. you keep it to yourself because the smokescreen is easier to maintain, wrapped around the cigarettes you light, it's just a short break from the train of thought that each and every step there is always something you have got to do. The present seems like a luxury gifted to the few‚Ä¶ stress is what we know, stress is where we go, pressure applied, wasted time standing in lines, relying on our system consumed by white-collar crimes. 
Hidden movements flowing at the top, paper has a price and Panama was the plot‚Ä¶ money laundered, tax evaded, the loops to which they thread will always¬† leave us jaded, as long as their numbers are in the green, we have to live in the red...¬† we are in this together, I want to leave this place but where can we go?¬†

There are no alternatives, so I ask, why must I work so hard for so very little?
Why am I punished for being born the way I am? Where my fall from grace is only respected when I am no more, judgements cast upon me when my heart was still beating.
Questions get you killed or they strip you of your credibility, watch not what they say but why it is being said, my words here will be misconstrued to avoid the truth that have left so many dead.¬†

Turmoil is brewing, politicians hold the ladle, they stir the pot to feed themselves and leave us at the table. They need us, they hate us... they force us to live like this. What options are there when you are tied to loans and debts, mistakes from your past when we didn‚Äôt know any better, the promises of a future, our bones will break under the pressure. Mental health is in decline, NHS is on the line, is that another parking fine?¬†

Rules, structure, bureaucracy, the ideological prisons and rigid tram lines that keep us in our place, all I need¬† is food and water, a roof and a progressive pace. Every single one of us is equal in the capacity to understand the struggles of each other, take the time in this moment to think of how toxic it has become. my hands are like yours and they offer a sympathetic touch, my eyes hold an empathy for anyone finding it too much, are you willing to stare back at yourself when you see this familiar pain I‚Äôm in, the tears I feel, are just like the ones that fall passed your chin, those lips that sit above are staying fairly silent, the truth is often said to hurt as we gaze upon its violence. 

Right in this moment, detached from our own woes someone  is fighting with survival... drip, drip, droplets miss the rim‚Ä¶ they are left to sink or swim‚Ä¶ parasitic infections no strength to their limbs. Can you face it, that not everyone has clean water, overflowing rubbish in our bins and all we seem to care about is our precious little daughters. Young men are killing themselves, one to many, if you have lost someone, here have a penny.¬† The homeless clutch their cups they beg because they don‚Äôt house them, we pass them like they‚Äôre nothing, desensitised how do I arouse you, to care more about each other, its built within ourselves to turn our backs on the hungry and the blind, we mimic the very creatures that push us to merely survive.¬†

Consume, possession, collection, things are all we are ever after. knock, knock... a cardboard smile is at your door, shareholders riches bloating some of us are barely floating. will we make it to the next chapter, where we can raise the living standard, so the pavement is not someone‚Äôs bed, where education guarantees a life where you get fed, we are in this together, let go of that ego that resides in your head. 
Pacing between the roles we fit, is a shared humanity, we are not all that different. Invite humility.¬†


I sit sometimes, lost in my own thoughts. I feel lonely amongst it all... have you ever felt like that?¬†


Abrupt end... change of pace... swiftly moving on with haste, like our lives it never seems to stop.¬†

Money fuels corruption, but our subscription is to blame, the market forces power, wealth and greed a grotesque relation to fame, it‚Äôs all pretty tantalising for those who have access, if we could have but a small taste would we fall victim to its poison? Look at history, it has always been about us, the people who haul the burden, carry the foundations of those in the seat of power, your decisions... our decisions will incite change if we stand with one another. Sadly, we are being used, daily we sink our time into things we should refuse. Tax is inevitable, necessary to be exact, but surplus profits seems to avoid the cut so it is taken from our cheque, spent on things beyond us in a global game of chess. 
Life for most of us is a living debt to servitude to a system designed for those who steer it, 
How many of you who cannot understand me are willing to try and hear this? 
My voice but a murmur below the ivory tower, hidden from our sadness, they know who really holds the power. 
What do they have to hide from, our unsightly struggles, sickness and abuse?
Do they¬† think any of us want to lose?¬†

Is it too much to want just enough, to be without destitution and the intimidation of danger?

I ponder, Where does the time go on the ticking clock? Think about every pot you have ever washed, there are people who look down on us, even when the cards dealt are not always fair. who here does not have a safety net to catch them when you fall, the pit below is endless, and the climb upwards equally tall.
Addiction is a drug healing whilst it hurts, depression hangs across my shoulders like ill fitting shirts, of which I wear to try and seem like I belong, buttons come undone, threads bare and free, what happens now when I don't know who I want to be?


Who even said we must play with these cards, I long for something simple, I am now at the table, nervous and feel like I don‚Äôt belong, outside this casino where I gamble with my life, I once believed there was a world free from my inner strife. The dice is in my hands, do I roll and hope for 6, the lighting here is dimming and I cannot find the fix.¬†

I look ahead to see trials, long and ever winding, self-perceived horrors ever present that remind me of projections that chase me just before I sleep, my imagination running with the wolves and I am the defenceless sheep. through a corridor immeasurable filled with doors that never seemed to open, a story with no middle and an ending abruptly boring, a journey I‚Äôm ill prepared for, a tragedy in the making, I am reaching out for help, someone please answer.¬†

I am scared.¬†

So very, intimately scared.¬†

You think this is just an art piece but all of it is very real, in the coming moment brings with it a silence of which I want to wield, hanging somewhere from these words is my bare and naked thought on a life I no longer want to live, a battle that continues being fought, ignore me as the writer and align this to your will, think towards our collective future and fight them until we have our freedom from their exploitation.¬†",False,lt4kff,Remote_Jicama7931,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lt4kff/20182019_british_perspective_of_work/,1,7

63,"I feel down, and I wanted to vent about the way I have been feeling lately.","I feel depressed, angry, and frustrated that life is the way it is for the average human being. This world is structured in such a way that causes endless suffering for the majority of humans. 

We are very lucky to have been born into this universe through the complex evolution of life on earth. We are lucky enough to have won the lottery of life and have been born in a planet that supports life in such a vast and mysterious universe. Just as Carl Sagan once said, ""Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Sahara ‚Ä¶¬†Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively exceeds the set of actual people. In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here."" 

Unfortunately, humans have been conditioned so that they have to slave away for a company that mostly doesn't give a shit about them in order to survive and put food on the table. We trade 80% of our day for less than adequate income for the majority of our lives until we are too old to do any of the things we aspired to do while we are young such as traveling, enjoying hobbies, spending time with family etc. 4 hours after work is not enough time to do anything we want to actually do. After work, people are generally too tired to do anything but eat and rest before going to bed and repeating the same shit. 

Some people will say that I'm lazy and don't have a hustle or motivation. FUCK what you think, I have worked my ass off to get to where I am. I spent my life so far in school just like everyone else studying and doing homework and chasing a very difficult degree in the STEM field just to end up making less than 40k a year. 
And you may say ""that's just how life is, people have to work."" That is very depressing. That just proves that life is filled with suffering and humans do not live how they want to live, they are slaves to their employers. 

I feel like I am in a prison, I am not a free human. If I don't show up to work bc I'm tired or I'm feeling down, I'm most likely going to be punished for that and will be considered lazy. 
I am tired. I wake up every morning with no motivation to go give away 8-12 hours of my day to an employer. 
How can I be happy with that. 
How can I be happy when I spend 80% of my time doing something I don't want to do. 
How can I break away from this way of thinking. 

I'm too scared to leave my job with a decent pay to pursue something else that may not be as monetarily rewarding bc I have bills to pay. 
I'm tired of being fake at work, I'm tired of playing politics to move up in a company, I'm tired of playing the game of life. 
I'm tired of living in a money-hungry society that values capitol over human life. 
I need a break, and the moment I take a break I will be seen as someone that is unreliable at work and someone that can be replaced.

d- Edited - ¬©

In our earlier Coditas office, we had a problem where we had three restrooms in 3

corners of the office.

 

The problem was, 70 people in the office going to a restroom, finding it occupied,
then going to the next ones (and finding all three occupied in many cases)

70 people into average 3 mind of wasted time per day = 210 mind (3.5 man-hours!)

When we brainstormed on the problem, we realized that it is not a unique
problem. It had already been solved in a different set. In an airplane!

The solution? Three light bulb visible to all, indicating if the restroom isn use.
The three light bulb had a common switch to the restroom light. Whenever
someone switched on a restroom light, the corresponding bulb on the floor area
was also switched on - low cost, not foolproof, but effective.

Project cost recovered within a day of use!

Identify problems. Abstract them. Solve them.

98,"I'm ""greedy"" for making $15 an hour","I'll try to make a long story short.

A few months ago I was a manager at a restaurant. The job sucked and I worked 15 hour shifts and 60 hours and i decided I couldn't take it anymore and stepped down to a lower role. HR tried to lower my pay but I fought them and kept it.


Yesterday I was talking to a corporate manager at work about how our restaurant is losing business because of the ownerships greed and over zealous focus on budget cuts. 


The manager said well, you say they're being greedy but you're making the same wage now ($15) as you were as a manager. 


I told him I had to fight for that wage and I deserve more, I was always pushed to work more hours and on my days off. A coworker of mine was scheduled 7 days a week for a month straight. Another coworker was scheduled 7 days in a row with multiple 15 hour shifts and was told only having one shift in a day was ""kind of like a day off"".


I am well below the poverty line at this wage. My wage covers my bills and that's it. And I'm the highest paid worker in the store. Some of the others have kids and families they're trying to feed. But IM the greedy one for earning a barely liveable wage for myself? I've been at the restaurant for 5 years and started at minimum. 


Looking back on the last year of my life, I was able to save up a good amount and in grateful for that. But FUCK anyone who says you're greedy for being a poor person trying to eat.

109,You put more hours in then you realize.,"Let's take a typical 9-5 M-F work week of 40 hours. 

You drive 15 minutes each way. .5 hours a day, so 2.5 hours a week.

Now you are up to 42.5 hours. 

But there is more to it than that. It takes you about 30 minutes or so to wake up, eat breakfast, get dressed and be ready to go. 

So that's 2.5 hours a week, now you are up to 45 hours.

The bank is only open 9-5 as well. 

Which never made since even in the 60's,70's, and 80's before online banking was a thing, most people could not go to the bank since they were at work. 

It never occurred to the banks to stay open until 6? 

So now if you need to go to the bank for whatever reason, you now need to do it on Saturday, on your day off. 

Most doctors are only open 8-5, at least around here. So you sure can't go after work.

That means you have to get up early and arrive for your 8am appointment, and hope to hell you are completely done by 8:45 to leave for work.

*It never occurred to me that ""anti-work"" was a logical concept.* 

I'm unemployed (since last summer) due to Covid and have been struggling to get back into the ""work force"" ever since. But, why? What am I doing? What are we all doing?

I use to work in a corporate job, office administration. At first it wasn't terrible, but as the years went by, it started to take its toll on me. 

No matter what position I moved to, it all started to feel the same. This numb, monotonous, depressing feeling. Starring at a computer screen day in, day out, ""working"". For who? For what? I wasn't truly helping anyone other than filling the pockets of the higher ups. It *literally* was all a money grab, disguised as a legitimate business. 

Before this corporate nonsense, I was in the military. I did a short gig there and decided it wasn't for me. (Though I do miss it and romanticize it at times). 

The military was a different type of ""slavery"", but at least they had us so busy and the work was so unique that you didn't have time to think about anything. You are taught to think and operate as a team, operating in a very controlled, rigid and structured environment. No excuses, there is an answer and solution to everything and you better know it. It was in a sense, dehumanizing. You are no longer ""you"" but rather a machine. (Classic stuff). 

I've been reading a lot of posts on here about younger people having this feeling of, to put it bluntly, ""wtf is going on"", ""what are we doing and why"". 

I remember feeling that same exact ""wtf"" feeling when I was in my late teens. And so, to feel this at such a young age, what does it mean? What does this show us as a society? A lack of ""true purpose"" ? A lack of ""proper guidance""? A lack of ""caring""? Who is responsible for ""guiding"" us? Listening to us?

Sorry, I'm just venting, stuck here behind another screen, unemployed and paying rent. (Why in the fuck don't potential employers tell us the specific reason(s) why we didn't get the job?. Staffing capacity? Too many applicants? If I ask, and someone reads the email, then that means you have the damn time to give me some pointers!) 

This is just all so frustrating, the days pass by and no-one says anything, no emails, just silence and you keep wondering, application after application. It's really maddening. But I guess this is the game we play yea?

Shoutout to Ithaca To Go if anybody‚Äôs heard of that or is from CNY.

120,"Why Capitalism is not bad, but also really bad","The reason why many of us perceive capitalism as a bad thing, is because of the way it can be exploited. 

I live in Belgium, and i will compare wages from Belgium with The USA.

Minimum wage USA:  $7.25/h  or ‚Ç¨6/h, this equates to $1256 or ‚Ç¨1040 (monthly, 40 hour work week)

Minimum wage Belgium: $10.8/h or \~‚Ç¨9, this equates to $1962 or ‚Ç¨1625 (monthly, 40 hour work week)

Both are before tax, and when it is taxed, we receive some benefit from them, health care for example. Belgium is a capitalist country, but here they don't exploit employees as much as in the USA.

When i finished high school, when i was just 18, i got my diploma in ''metal shaping techniques'', this includes CNC, i got a job after 3 months as a CNC operator, and i started with ‚Ç¨14/h or about ‚Ç¨1750 monthly which equates to $2113 (before tax).

US minimum wage workers get much more exploited than some of the other first world countries, this also includes, vacation, rights, paid leave,...

The fact that the USA has a minimum wage of $7.25 has more to do with the owners/companies/corporations than it has with capitalism. Ofcourse, capitalism is more than just about paychecks, money and workers rights. Capitalism exploits nature and animals in their natural habitat, corporations don't care about climate/climate change and THIS is what makes it really bad.

135,A Retail Nightmare,"This will be a long one so brace yourselves 
This is the first time I have posted on Reddit and I am doing it because this a very important topic for me. Let me start out by saying that I work for one of the world's largest kitchenware companies. I chose this job mostly because it was one the highest paying local job's I could find outside of highschool. I knew before I chose it that I had only three options out of highschool. Which was the military, college or manual labor. And of course calculating the risks I chose to do more laborious work. My mind was set on having no college debt, and not feeding the military industrial complex. Which even at a younger age, I knew a fair bit about. Well here I am now 21 years old and drowning in more anxiety and depression. This being one of the worst lows I have felt in a long time. And it's all due to this corperation. I worked a job before here it was a small parts warehouse for a giant boomlift manufacturer. It was a terrible warehouse and luckily I was only there for nine or so months. I was hired as a temp and got terminated whenever I questioned my boss about being told do his job as a temp. This was my first realisation of how unfair workplace treatment was. I was being used and being severely underpaid to do many tasks that was supposed to be done by supervision. This caused many discussions with my father who is a union worker. He was the one to introduce me to cruelty of the workforce. He recommended finding a union job as well and so I did. The corperation I work for now has a fully established union. But it is blatantly corrupt. Not only my union but this corperation. To set the tone here my union president is the father of the corperate supervisor that watches over me. Which is a blatant example of conflict of interest. I have done a better job representing myself than my union has done for me. And I believe it's because our union and company are working together. After months of failed ""negotiations"" the company and union had finally reached an agreement. The problem I have now is that we were not given enough time to read it and decide on a vote. Our union not only did not show us a printed copy as an exampe to read but failed to tell us the worst parts of it. The union president and his circle had forced in a non strike agreement which is the only weapon we have against my corperations current abuse. We have been working exploitive overtime six to seven days a week at ten hours a day for over a year. The company is continuing to over order and schedule shipments while we are stuck suffering. We are so far behind that truck drivers are refusing to pick up product here. Because they are sometimes waiting over night to be loaded. Which has created little to no space in the warehouse. Making product harder to get to and hindering production as all completed shipments have to be staged. Everyday we get further behind. We have lost most of our staff and the management show no urgency to fix the situation. They keep threatening more overtime which in return is causing more people to leave. And it makes it more stressful for those who stay. They have attempted to hire more but it is failing. Last group they hired 30 people but only two stayed for a few days and quit. Especially as new hires have to work 90 days in a row at 10 hours before given union protection and vacation. The pathetic thing is they pay union dues at the hire date. Which is illegal however the union is working with the company. Several high level management personnel are related to our union president. They have put in a policy that ""union"" employees give up their right to representation until probation is over. Which is a loophole because you agree upon it from hiring date. By the way vacation is only three days for the first year. People are literally being asked to work everyday 10 hours with no days off. It is no wonder everyone is quitting. The job was okay but since Covid our company is taking advantage of the pandemic for disgusting profits. We weren't even entitled to hazard pay despite being essential. We have had 50 infections in a 400 man workplace so far. They still do not enforce safety rules. And everytime they are reported they do the bare minimum to make it look like they are doing something. Equiptment isn't cleaned people aren't wearing masks and they are forcing us to work close together as we are running out of space. Within the year we have lost over 100 employees and over 5 this week alone. Our contract says we are supposed to be at 400+ union employees at all time. But we are falling below 300. I truly believe our president of the union is working with the company to get rid of the union and is doing the bare minimum as an illusion to show he cares. And these problems just scratch the surface. I can't take it here anymore it has made me utterly depressed. I am trying to survive till June  I don't know if I will make it.

141,I'm not sure if I can go back.,"I did everything I was supposed to. My resume is packed to the gills from all the stuff I did to ""get ahead"" in both highschool and undergrad. I kicked ass in school, got a bach and the perfect job title right after graduating. Relocated across the country without help, grew into my role within 6 months. I worked hard, became a power player.

Covid hits, and I'm an introverted guy, right? Who cares? I'll sit at home and focus on work and vidya. Didn't get sick, my family miraculously made it out without any trouble too. 

Work decides that they like how much we are able to push out now that nobody can go anywhere. Executives decide to purposely ""stress test"" everyone by artificially inflating our workload. For 3 months straight, 50+ billable hours a week minimum, no expectation of non-working weekends. We are forced to burn all our accrued PTO time with less than 40 minutes' notice to plan it out.

Things start falling apart. I essentially lose agency of my entire life. I don't see the sun, unless it's towards at the end of another insomnia night. I abandon my hobbies because it's impossible to do any of them anymore. I get a panic impulse whenever my phone goes off. I gain weight, then I stop eating. Then I binge eat.

I try to tell my management that I deserve more respect, and get told I will never make it in the professional world. I try to tell HR my mental health has severely deteriorated, they tell me that perhaps I'm in the wrong industry. They give me EAP resources to look into but none of them have capacity for new patients besides 24-hour crisis/suicide prevention hotlines. 

So here I am, 20 months into my professional life, and I quit my job. I did not pull any punches or keep things polite, I was angry and afraid for my future. I told them exactly what they needed to hear. Maybe that was useless and served only to limit my future career prospects. I just don't fucking care anymore. 

My network is strong and I had many leads to follow, and I was essentially doing the jobs of 4 different people at once for a year, I have an authoritative amount experience. But nobody cares how many names I drop or how many tech interviews I pass; they just keep scheduling more at higher and higher levels of competency until I can't answer with complete precision, then they drop me. None of my old colleagues could help me find a new position, I've been rejected from around 24 companies in a month. 

Suddenly all those things I did during my adolescence are useless to recruiters: ""you shouldn't even still be advertising this."" My academic experience appears to no longer have value, less than 2 years after graduating. And the professional experience I do have, which is an insane amount compared to the year-and-so I was working, is constantly invalidated for ridiculous reasons. I am laughed at and ghosted constantly. My colleagues keep telling me I'll push past this wall eventually, but...

I can't stop looking around. I don't believe I had a future even if I still had that terrible job. I might have crawled out of my starting debt, but that only clears the way for more debt. I'll never own property. My career trajectory will never promise me working conditions different from what I left. 

I have an amazing girlfriend who is going through the same abuse but still thinks she likes her job. She's helped me through crisis after crisis for years. I've had a ring hidden away that I can't bear to show her. I feel like I have no use or plan to be useful any longer, and I almost feel compelled to create an exit plan that would allow her to leave before my life spirals into nothing and takes her down with me.

I wake up every day covered in sweat with my heart beating out of my chest, even after quitting. I have no confidence that the world can be saved or that I have any reason to plan ahead. My therapist does stupid shit like telling me to ""stop worrying about the news"" or ""join the fucking peace corps if you feel like things are so bad.""

The last year has destroyed any optimism or faith I had in others. I want to love this country but I have never been given a good reason to. I want to belong to something but every option just feels like a way to sell my soul and waste my life.

Why did I work so hard, and follow all the rules, and take on 6 figures worth of student loans, to end up more miserable than I ever thought i could possibly be? I did everything right, how did I end up here?

I wish there was any way out of this. I‚Äôm not getting paid nearly what I‚Äôm worth, and I don‚Äôt have any options to do anything that would pay me anything close to what I‚Äôm worth. This degree is functionally worthless outside of this field.

147,School trains us to be corrupt slaves.,"In school we are rewarded for hard work. School is long hours, then we have homework. Overall it is worse than a 9-5 job. By the time university comes you must study nearly 12 hours a day to get a decent mark and complete your assignments. This trains us to do as we are told, or else we suffer the consequences of failure which usually is to redo a class. No where in school are we taught to explore our passions, or to explore ourselves. We are told that exercise is good, but that doesn't even count towards any credits in university. You have 1 chance, if you pick the wrong subject and realize you don't enjoy it, too bad, switching costs money and now you are an adult. Trying to do anything leads to pain, but being a slave and just doing what you're told leads to money. We are studying subjects we don't like, which primes us to accept the jobs we won't like. Trying to escape in anyway to find what you truly like is painful.

Because we already don't enjoy what we are doing, the next best thing is to optimize what we like. And we all like money. Gamblers get a high every time they win, much like this we get a high when we get paid.

When you cheat in school and not get caught, you are pleasantly rewarded with a good grade. There is no reward for hard work but failing to understand. There is little reward for understanding but getting a question wrong. At university level mostly right is near 0 mark for that question. Multiple choice is just right or wrong, you get rewarded for getting the correct answer, whether through understanding, or a cheating technique. Students are being taught purely not to get caught which is corruption. True understanding of the subject is near pure torture. Students are learning more creative ways to cheat, better analysis of which person around you if any has same answer order as you. Or perhaps working together with a group of cheaters sitting in a bubble utilizing hand signals. Sometimes as simple as paying someone that looks like you to do the test.

We want ethics, but fail to make it more rewarding than corruption at the school level. Just like the general world we are in. Corruption is deep, and it's within us all. It starts as early as school. We need to find ways to eradicate corruption from ourselves, and our society. I'm sure you know of cheaters getting higher marks than you. Just seeing such practices can corrupt our hearts, even if it is a little bit. To fight it, we must identify corruption, in the system, within ourselves, within others and educate each other.",False,ltb1v8,poutine_here,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ltb1v8/school_trains_us_to_be_corrupt_slaves/,8,59

149,Too many people,"So this is just my opinion on how our system came to be the way it is now.

I believe one of the major contributing factors of our current system of under paid over worked employees is the simple fact there are too many people.
With a large enough pool of potential employees who are desperate to find work to make ends meet, large companies can under pay employees because they know someone will be willing to work that shitty job at that shitty pay.
There is no incentive for companies to pay more when they can easily find someone to do the job.

The population has increased without a similar increase in available jobs thus leading to an increase of potential employees. So they have been able to increase the required education and skill level needed for so called every level jobs, making it harder for people to get that job without increasing the amount of debt they owe in order to hopefully obtain stable income and comfortable living.

Our grandparents had it easier and better due to the fact there was less competition in the job market. 

I believe if there was a drastic enough decrease in potential employees, working conditions and quality of life would drastically improve.

In reality work hours are for handeling the emergencies and your time off is just for catching up on the long term projects and whatever chores you can manage to squeeze in between it. The closest thing I've had to a long weekend was when I had to use my paid leave to get a cyst removed.

163,Work related rant,"Hey all,
So I'm kinda fuming. I was scheduled to work an 11 and a half hour shift today, which isn't too abnormal, except today, wasn't given a break until i got in a argument with a coworker and mentioned how it was against federal (U.S.) law for this to happen. Which would have been avoided if they had just let me go home early. I had asked for a break several hours before I was scheduled to get off, however I was not allowed anything but a 5 min sit. (which BTW is not the required time for working 8+ hours) so considering I didn't get my break, I asked to go home 30 min early, which was again denied. So I was starting to get exhausted, emotional, and reactive. One of my coworkers said something close to ""if you had been more caught up/faster then you would have been able to get a break."" Which is just not true, and irrelevant. ~~Federal law (which trumps my states' law) says that a 30 min break must be provided if an employee has worked 8 or more hours, and another 15 min for every 4 hours past that.~~ Edit: I looked in to it more and I was wrong about the federal laws, unfortunately. However Casey's does have a policy regarding employee breaks, that definitely was not followed by my managers. So I stated that it was illegal for me to not receive a break and someone should have covered for that time. Which would have been doable, there were others who could cover my break. This apparently startled my management, as I soon had a chat with my store manager and a 2nd assistant. They basically said that Kansas (my state) has no such laws, and I should have communicated my needs better (I asked several times and made it clear how I had not been allowed my break) and that ""these days happen"". Bull. Shit. It is immoral and illegal to force someone to work 11 and a half hours with no break. There is no ""it happens"" I ended up spending the last 30 min of my shift writing this post, probably only because they were scared HR or a lawyer might get involved.

On one section of our newsletter, there is a ‚ÄúAsk [insert CEO‚Äôs name] column‚Äù. An anonymous coworker asked why the pay is so low and feeling unrecognized because he‚Äôs been working here for a few years.

CEO responds that our wages are competitive to companies around us. Yeah, it was competitive... *starting out*, but not anymore. He then went on a tangent about how great our healthcare benefit is, when I have to pay $5.5K out of pocket for braces + several thousands more dollars for other dental procedures. That‚Äôs literally 1/4th of my annual salary! 

I don‚Äôt understand why some companies do not compensate their employees annually for their experience and loyalty at their workplace. It‚Äôs frustrating.

186,"""Well then, you're out of luck!"" - HR department","HR fuckery at its finest.

I worked for a high-profile public sector agency for almost 11 years and left about 5 years ago.  This agency definitely tries to present itself as a good employer, even though behind the scenes it is toxic AF.

Yesterday I contacted the HR department about obtaining some verification of my employment there.  Start and end dates, job titles held ‚Äì very basic factual stuff.

It took three calls and talking to 3 different people to start getting through to them about what I wanted.  And holy hell did they push back on it.

The HR person wanted nothing to do with this and kept insisting that I had to contact my old managers.  I explained that they had all left the agency years ago (and none of them can verify all my employment with that agency because I held different jobs there and had different managers over the years).  HR said it was my responsibility to maintain contact with them.  I asked: What if they cannot be reached because they‚Äôve retired or left the country or died?

HR person said ‚ÄúWell then you‚Äôre out of luck!‚Äù

Is it just me or is that gratuitously pissy?

Anyway, I knew it was nonsense because the current whereabouts of my old bosses has nothing to do with the agency‚Äôs ability to verify that I did in fact work there for over 10 years, so I pressed on.  Finally HR said that they can do an employment verification letter like they do for employees applying for mortgages and such.  I‚Äôm supposed to get it in a few days.

Then HR person started going on about privacy and how they can‚Äôt just answer questions about past employees for any random who calls in.  That would make sense except that I know for a fact that there is NO monitoring of managers who give references at that agency.  Managers DO talk about past employees for any random who calls and they can easily break confidentiality and run their mouths with all kinds of nonsense.  So that didn‚Äôt add up.

I was exhausted for the rest of the day from that phone call.  

I legit have PTSD from working there.  Just dealing with this reference/verification stuff this week has me anxious, sleeping badly, intrusive thoughts, bleakness.",False,lrcmx9,candleflame3,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lrcmx9/well_then_youre_out_of_luck_hr_department/,6,24

188,Is this just an American thing? A rant!,"Ok let me start off by saying I‚Äôm an immigrant working in the states &amp; that I have sadly worked 20 years in retail &amp; only 3 years have been here in the states. My current job is the WORST job I have EVER worked in retail. Everyone who works here feels it is absolutely shitty, especially this last year I have never worked for a company so money hungry, so void of empathy &amp; compassion not just for the employees but for the shoppers too, during a pandemic. I have personally had 4 anxiety/panic attacks at work 2 by my now ex boss &amp; then by her boss (who apologized for causing the attack and then followed it with but it‚Äôs just how I am, which negates the fucking apology) the rest by guests who frequent this establishment. I have literally had things physically thrown at me by bosses in other jobs &amp; been denied higher positions because of the color of my skin &amp; still I‚Äôd rather work there, than spend another day dealing with this shit. Maybe I‚Äôm just done working in retail this is not my path in life, it brings me no joy it brings me no fulfillment I just find it weird that people here push the notion that a job like this is honorable &amp; good. When all I have seen is how fucking disgusting people are to retail employees! YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO TREAT ANYONE BEHIND A COUNTER LIKE SHIT! EVER! The customer is always right is an antiquated term that should not be used anymore because 9/10 times they are wrong. Nobody dreams of working as an assistant manager of a retail store all their lives NOBODY! Only people who dream of owning their own businesses have those kinds of dreams! Look this turned more into a rant, but I think we gotta stop putting certain jobs on pedestals &amp; instead treat them as they are stepping stones, for people to focus on the things they want to do with their lives.",False,lrqa1c,Nicknameskizzle,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lrqa1c/is_this_just_an_american_thing_a_rant/,18,21

&amp;#x200B;

Can't wait to be told that despite being in a historic pandemic, we still have to meet our ridiculous targets and that failure to do so reflects badly on each of us individually, despite the fact that this organization does everything in its power to make our jobs as difficult as possible - and instead of hiring more people to replace those that left, we just have to pick up the slack by doing more work. But even bringing that up is pointless as everyone is too powerless within the structure to affect any meaningful change.

I'm going to smile, read my script, and get it over with while throwing out two or three stupid 'action items' that will never be completed or followed up on.

195,Is it wrong to do as little work as possible?,"Obviously, I have not made it (until retirement) to the point of not having to work. I really hate my job. I do assigned duties with initiative and my tasks are done efficiently with quality. Nevertheless, I fucking hate work and will avoid any new tasks that are not in my description as much as possible. People say, ""don't you want to be promoted, you have to **prove** yourself, take on additional work to so you have more experience and can take it to another job.  If I am doing my job satisfactorily and customers are happy, why not give me a raise then? I do work for the government, and it sometimes seems that once you do your job well and are ""reliable""  your supervisor will not let you go, meaning your current sup. will bad mouth you to keep in you in the dept.

While I see some validity of the last point, (being able to acquire new skills to take to another job with higher pay) but not the others. Anytime I have taken on additional duties not in my job description, it ends up permanently becoming my job. Then people dump all types of shit on me. Yes, I am an administrative assistant, but just because I am a jack of all trades does not mean I want to do higher level work without an increase in pay. I really want to find a job where I can ""mostly"" work alone, like a skill trade. Of course, I would still be working, but I wont be in the office around the political bull shit.

My coworkers look at me funny because I leave at my assigned time every day and I decline OT. (although not mandatory, the previous person in my position took it on because she really needed the money).  Why do people try to shame a person for my mentality, I already know I am not getting out of work until retirement, so why should I take on additional duties that are not in my description and a paint in the ass.",False,lre9ov,Lanabanana43,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lre9ov/is_it_wrong_to_do_as_little_work_as_possible/,16,13
196,Last week I worked 3/5 work days due to a snowstorm and I had never felt so good in YEARS!,"I have been working M-F for lord knows how many years now... the whole never ending 9-5 cycle. I had adequate time for hobbies, exercise, care and maintenance of my home, etc... but I was also very *rushed*

Last week we had a really bad snowstorm and I only worked Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. 

I cannot even begin to tell you guys how much better everything was. I got caught up on so many things but not even just that... mentally and physically I was in another LEAGUE. I felt much younger and I had so much energy. I was happy and in a great mood. All of this while I was stuck inside but I was able to accomplish SO much for MYSELF. I could only imagine what I could have accomplished if I was able to leave my home and do other things for ME.

It got me thinking that this whole 9-5, M-F cycle is literally vicious and is just a modern version of slavery. After last week my eyes were really opened to how we are all part of this horrible facade and every single one of us is being taken advantage of. 

And *for what?* for me to make somebody more money by selling their product? What will they do with this money? Use it to buy other stuff that feeds more and more into this cycle?

So much of our lives is all just made up and we would all be 100% fine and live our lives happily without this crazy cycle of work that we are all forced to participate in.

I always also add, part kissing-butt to make up for the other things I've said but also (embarrassingly?) part true: **I do make an effort to do my job well. That's all I got and that ought to be enough.**

returning, losing productivity, and just having
less time to myself in general when normal
working conditions return? Not so much.

| know most the population are happy about
the return to the old normal, but I've enjoyed
the new normal and wish it could continue
without a anaemic.

I'll miss the world where flexible working
conditions were a thing and having a work/life
balance that wasn't weighted heavily on the
work side.

212,"I don't know where else to talk about this, I feel so isolated right now...","I gave my current workplace my letter of resignation and 3 weeks notice. This was meant to be my last week, tomorrow was meant to be my last day. I had plans for it with friends at work.

Earlier today, I was pulled into an office and told that I needed to leave the workplace immediately and not come back due to social media posts. The posts? Reposting some of the images from this subreddit to my instagram stories. 

My workplace doesn't have a Social Media policy, or anything like that. They don't even have a resignation policy. I didn't mention anything about my current workplace, not their name or anything, didn't mention any workplace, literally just reposted some comics and tweets with no additional text. 

I wasn't even given time to think, wasn't told I had to leave by the end of the day. I was told I needed to leave straight away. I was told it would be preferred not to take my personal belongings as it would cause suspicion. Just to take my bag and leave. I went to the bathroom to gather my thoughts for a moment but I was followed in there.

How ironic, I was told I was a ""valuable employee"" today. I don't think you treat valuable employees like that. I feel so sad and empty, so discarded. Not once did anyone ask me for my feedback on why I was leaving or anything, even today no one asked why I posted those things to my stories and if it was about work. 

Literally what the hell...


UPDATE: I saw my friends later that day when they came to drop off my stuff. Right after I was escorted out, it was announced in the office that I wouldn't be coming back into work (so much for not wanting to make a scene).
They singled out my friends, took them into a room, and questioned them about me. I feel so disgusted, I can't believe they did that to my friends, they had nothing to do with this. I feel so guilty that they'll be targeted now.

216,I remember when I nearly got fired for mishearing something on a phone call because the entire office was singing Happy Birthday.,"Man, not long since found this sub, and I love it. The stories of cesspit employers are interesting, so I thought I‚Äôd chime in with one of the worst places I‚Äôve worked at. Warning, it‚Äôs fairly long!

Several years back, I worked Collections in a loan company. The fraud team at the time was literally just 1 guy. It was a start-up that got too big for its boots REALLY fast. So, this guy literally just couldn‚Äôt take holiday. Course, they‚Äôd never have said that to him, but it was implied. We were mates, so I said if he trained me, I‚Äôd cover for him for 5 days. 

On the day he was meant to train me, the day before his holiday, his manager made him join in a forced lunch - one of those cliquey cult-like meetings where they all ate in their shitty little work canteen and did nothing. He ended up having 45 minutes to show me the ropes.

Because of this &amp; trying to catch up on the afternoon‚Äôs work - approving loan applications, meaning they were all building up in a backlog - he had to rush a bit. He ended up paying out 2 fraudulent loans that day and they told him not to bother coming back from holiday. They then forced me to take the job as the only ‚Äúqualified‚Äù person to do it in the building (thanks to my extensive training!). 

For 2 years, I sweat bullets. I never made a single mistake in 10,000 applications because doing so meant the chopping block. During this time, they offered a job to a 5-year employee who was GREAT at his job in collections. He made a mistake in his first week and got tossed out - of the company, not just the team. 

Anyway, onto the title of the post. One day, as the company just loved fucking making noise, there was the usual weekly occurrence of the entire office signing Happy Birthday loudly to a colleague who sat nearby. Who cares if I‚Äôm on an important call to the bank / CIFAS, ‚Äòcause fuck me, right? 

I misheard a viral piece of information. Paid out a fraudulent loan into a brand new bank account (set up by a fraudster). 10,000 flawless applications, but fuck me, right? Pulled into a meeting within the hour. 

Manager - who was the antichrist - kept asking me why I did it. I said it was a mistake. 

‚ÄúIs it because you don‚Äôt care about your job?‚Äù 
‚ÄúNo, it was genuinely a mistake...‚Äù
‚ÄúBut would you say you didn‚Äôt care about your job?‚Äù
‚ÄúIt sounds like you want me to say I don‚Äôt care?‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to say anything. I just want to know if you care?‚Äù 

I‚Äôm paraphrasing, but this was the really weird exchange. It was an odd place; they were all super obsessed with the job. Most of them were fucking. MOST senior managers who eventually moved on always came back because they couldn‚Äôt hack it elsewhere when they saw what an actual job is like. 

Anyway. ‚ÄúFortunately‚Äù, I have had a hearing impairment since I was younger. It‚Äôs not severe and doesn‚Äôt impact my life. I turned around and basically said that everybody was fucking singing happy birthday in my one decent ear and my disability made it impossible to hear properly. 

Her tune changed immediately and I was let off. After that, I fucking bolted within the month - into another job that eventually fired me because the job, it turned out, didn‚Äôt exist, and I wasn‚Äôt needed.

243,A reminder that self employment is not the solution anti-workers are looking for,"I often get the feeling that people who want to understand our movement want to counter by saying that we should just all be self-employed. While self-employment would fix a lot of the problems many people have with traditional work it wouldn't solve the main problem which is the idea that you are a slave to the market. The idea that your worth is directly tied to your productivity is a terrible idea and anti-workers want to get rid of that.

In her episode [Burning Yourself Out, The Closest Feeling to Death that isn't Death](https://youtu.be/Mt-YuVhsvpY) Jaiden animation who is self-employed talks about her typical day of her work. She talks about how every time she isn't working she feels like she should be even though she's doing something like eating, pooping, or even working because if she's working she could be working harder. This video perfectly illustrates how self employment isn't the solution to anti-work people's problems, and in fact it's possible to work even harder and longer in self-employment than in traditional work because there's no one telling you to stop working. Getting rid of the market's desire to always turn a profit and the constant need to make money in order to survive is what's going to help us, not self employment. If you are self-employed that's great.

249,Consent v. Control,"Reading through people's experiences for me has brought up the question of what things we consent to, whether that consent is genuine and what that means for our society. 

Under U.S. law the basis for American employment is contract.  In order to create a contract you must have a manifestation of agreement by all sides, and a meeting of the minds--i.e. consent from both parties to the same thing, or the same general thing.  Therefore, the legal basis of employment is at odds fundamentally with the theory espoused by some marxists and often reflected in sentiments here that employment can be analogized to slavery.  To be clear at the outset I don't agree with this sentiment, and from a historical perspective find the argument offensive.  But I think examining the distinction can reveal areas where modern society at best manufactures consent from its members.

The legal distinction between undesirable work and slavery is easy to make--an individual employed for minimum wage is not a slave because they cannot be compelled to work by force, or to put it another way they can always technically chose to quit any job at any time.  There is no threat of violence or (as a general matter) governmental authority compelling work by force.  There are of course a raft of other distinctions between a modern employee and a slave most succinctly invoked by the concepts of life, liberty and property--but which are really a whole list of things which if examined closely set out in stark detail why a job you detest is not analogous to the total loss of rights and freedoms that were experienced legally by individuals in the past and illegally today.

That said, there are situations in which contracts may be voidable or unenforceable because we do not believe consent can be adequately given.  And the line between those concepts, and the circumstances which undergird everyday employment for a huge segment of Americans is, at least in terms of intellectual underpinnings, unclear.  There is a concept called unconscionability, which is the idea that where a contract is extremely unfavorable to one side, both in its terms, and in the circumstances in which it is negotiated, it cannot be enforced.  The central question as to circumstances is what is relevant here.  Because what bargaining power can an unemployed individual be said to have when they are dependent upon future employment for shelter, food, and healthcare?  Where on the other side sits either a far wealthier person, or an entity whose needs are nonexistent save the unyielding course for profit? Were there any fair way to negotiate between the two we would have no need of a minimum wage.  Yet without this law the average person's salary would never increase, it seems.

Which is to say that if we are concerned with the circumstances under which a contract is negotiated, we cannot give our blessing to the vast majority of contracts an employee signs.  This is not to say that employees possess no leverage, but it is to say that the bargaining power employees possess is largely not enough to ensure terms we as a society would deem equitable.  This suggests that consent to employment may be analogous to the concept of social compact theory.  Social compact theory holds that a government governs by the consent of those it governs.  I.e. governments are, or should be, created and developed through the consent of their citizens.  This concept, while influential in crafting democratic policies is obviously aspirational.  No child, any more than they choose to be born, chooses the rules their parents place on them, and so too no man, woman or other the mesh of laws that they must abide by or sacrifice what rights had been set aside for them.

Society may value particular freedoms, but it cannot value choice.  Because where an individual has the choice to leave a society, there can be no authority and no rule.  Therefore every society creates fictions like these--which imitate consent and curtsy to our desires--all while keeping us firmly within the track we are told to keep upon.

Wage slave you are not enough,

You can never be enough.
  
Buy more, sell more, work more,

Consume more.

You must sell your youth, your passion, your energy. You must sell your strength, your intellect, your ideas.
  
You must sacrifice your time, your relationships, your mental health and your morals. 

You must sacrifice your standards, your happiness, your hopes and your dreams. 
 
Pour everything you are into the machine. 

Maybe then you can be enough.  

Maybe then you deserve to find joy, to rest, to play. 

Maybe then you deserve to breathe.

Maybe. 

But you have spent your life in the pursuit of more.

You have traded everything you are for more.  

More is all you have left, and you will always need more.

Secondly, tell us how much you are going to pay. I don't wanna waste my time on you if you're going to be paying peanuts. This is the most important part of the whole job. Include it.

Thirdly, the advertisements are the most fake things I've ever seen in my life. 'Looking for another family member for our happy hard working team.'. Straight up verbal diahreea. What about this is true or even enticing at all? And then they want a resume where you basically bullshit the same way back. It's completely pointless and incredibly frustrating to try and assimilate.

Fourthly, what the fuck is with cover letters? You want us to beg for a shitty job so you already have a leg up on us in your sick little power play? Shit is not okay.

Google automation requires google api and they have all of that blocked out for us. Idk man. I‚Äôm just tired this morning after six hours of sleep. 

I‚Äôm trying to learn some computer science to get a higher paying job but if I‚Äôm working eight hours every day (because we have always had more work than people in government) then I have no time to study professional development stuff (even though they offer free online class videos as a benefit and encourage it). I‚Äôm too exhausted after work and have no time after cooking or other chores to do it. I feel trapped and I‚Äôm just tired of being tired. 

I‚Äôm having to finance a $500 nightguard for supposedly clenching my teeth at night and causing tooth damage. I was just off for 9 days and never woke up with my teeth and jaw hurting. I‚Äôll be damn if I haven‚Äôt woken up every day this week after getting back with my teeth and jaw sore and hurting. I don‚Äôt consciously feel stressed but it‚Äôs obvious that my body does.  

People think working in government is cushy and government workers ride the gravy train. I will say that every stereotype has some truth to it that comes from somewhere, but everyone that I‚Äôve worked with works harder than anyone I‚Äôve seen in the private sector jobs I‚Äôve had. The main reason is because year after year our work load demand increases while budgets stay stagnant. 

We‚Äôve been understaffed since I started because budgets have stayed the same each year or even been slightly cut. On my team there are 3 of us that split about 215,000 accounts, but it‚Äôs more like 2.25 because the third person is our team lead that works on other stuff as well. For simplicity let‚Äôs just split in half and say my coworker and I each own 107,500  accounts at most and let me preface this by saying that we work through only accounts that come in with flagged errors. I even have the data of how many accounts there are each quarter and I‚Äôll use 1Q20 so that the increase from covid doesn‚Äôt throw off what‚Äôs normal for us. 

So for 1Q20 there were 1,952 error accounts. Divided out that‚Äôs 976. Well the average number of business days in a week is 21 give or take. So in a quarter that‚Äôs around 63 days which means each working day I am expected to work through  15 accounts. That doesn‚Äôt seem like much right? But that‚Äôs one aspect of my jobs. 

I also have to do 1000s of lines of data entry, hundreds of lines of account coding, etc. now, I know the private sector is known for cracking the whip and having either too much or too little work to do each day. They don‚Äôt crack the whip on us but I don‚Äôt know anyone in government that has one of those ‚ÄúI only have 3 hours of work to do each day‚Äù jobs. I empathize because those jobs are boring but I never get days where I have nothing due or that I should be working on for eight hours. I would have to work 10-12 hours just to get all of this done but can‚Äôt because the government doesn‚Äôt give over time except in rare cases. 

It‚Äôs unreal and it‚Äôs government so we aren‚Äôt even for profit! We aren‚Äôt working for billionaires! We are public servants working on important things to make sure people have UI benefits, businesses pay their taxes into UI, people have food benefits etc. And we don‚Äôt have enough people to do what we should be able to do. Imagine if we had more funding. We could have more people and be even more efficient in program management. Idk y‚Äôall. I‚Äôm just tired and venting. I‚Äôm not downplaying anyone‚Äôs job.

But the problem is I‚Äôm not making the money I‚Äôd like‚Äî after being unemployed for 4 months and denied for unemployment I pretty much burned through my meager savings (which is one of the factors that put me in this situation)- so when I got hired in this retail job in Jan I was so excited to just get anything, only now it‚Äôs been two months and my last paycheck (for FULL TIME work) was below $600 and it‚Äôs just really discouraging trying to save when it‚Äôs so little. 

I like my job and my coworkers but after the car, helping out w groceries and the phone bill, I‚Äôm not putting much away and I see us staying much longer than anticipated... (which would be okay except living here is STRESSFUL and I‚Äôm over it) I‚Äôm hesitant to search for a new job because it took me SO LONG to get this one and it was so much hassle to get this.. I‚Äôm worried all go through all this additional stress looking for work as I‚Äôm working full time and I won‚Äôt even be able to find anything much better. 

Clarification: I live in a very rural area‚Äî my pay is $11 an hour before taxes and this is considered NORMAL. Factories/ warehouses would offer more (at $13/hr) but do I go through all that paperwork again for a job I‚Äôd only need for a few months before (hopefully) moving out and doing it all again in the new city or do I just stick with this, save my pennies, and accept this for what it is (for now)? 

Additional info: my retail job is in the city we want to move to- I am commuting there 30 miles every day (again, not uncommon where I live). I was hoping to stick it out because I could just keep working there when we move until I find something better, but I‚Äôm worried this job is so low paying we‚Äôll never be able to leave..

Whenever I was old enough to comprehend how bad off me and my mother were my childhood ended and my mindset changed. My childhood was short but joyful. I realized around age 10 there is only one way out of this hellhole so I started mowing/shoveling/trimming/ whatever manual work people would pay me outside of the housing complex. Teenage years I had 9 consistent clients and usually their relatives/neighbors every so often. Dont have very many memories of my younger years just turned into a zombie. 

I always felt I was too smart for school so it just took up 1/3 of my day. You get the career/college talks early on and going in debt never clicked to me. I got an opportunity to get into a skilled trade before I graduated high school. I was the only kid I knew that was anti-college. Wasnt going in debt when I could could earn it instead. I worked for that company 2 summers before I graduated and my intentions were very clear I was here to build a career. 

Currently 22 years old with the same company and Ive made no progress in the trade. Ive done everything in my power to advance and its nothing but disrespect. Perfect role model employee, everybody else makes me look like a million bucks yet they get everything handed to them. Im not a sellout like 90% of this world and refuse to kiss ass.

Ive come to the conclusion that this career is over with. I must find a way to work for myself again. You put your life in someone else's hands they will screw you every time. Everybody around me says I have nothing to complain about. Young and a ""great"" job.
They only see what is on the outside.

Ive never been this miserable before and that is astonishing to even write. Should I say fuck it and pack a duffle bag and run off to Vietnam? Ive got $86,000 in savings and can sell my toys for roughly another $30,000. Funny thing is Ive never been more than 100 miles from where I was born and Vietnam looks like a place I can escape to help heal my mind/body/soul.

304,"Manager trying to micromanage a year into WFH and coworkers starting drama. Why can‚Äôt I just clock in, do my work, and go home? As if things aren‚Äôt stressful enough we are now engineering stress??","I‚Äôm so sick of this kind of shit. Like I just want to clock in, do my work, and be left alone. There‚Äôs another manager in our division that I‚Äôm cool with. When in the office we would talk about shared interests. Since working from home idk what his problem is but he has stirred up drama through miscommunications twice. 

Yesterday he IMs me to small chat. Then asks how things are going. I say fine and make some jokes about us being behind on some processes but that this other coworker (who he manages) is working on it and we have other stuff to do until then. Well oh boy. He takes that and runs for some reason. Comes down on my other coworker asking why our stuff isn‚Äôt done (he manages this coworker for stuff on his team but technically doesn‚Äôt manage him over the stuff he does for our team) and then asks MY manager why I‚Äôm asking him about stuff going on on our team. 

I immediately get a call from my manager because now coworker is pissed since they‚Äôre extremely busy and she thinks I‚Äôve gone to another manager about issues. I was so hacked off but I calmly explained and she pretty quickly realized what happened and left me alone. Even though it‚Äôs petty I copy and pasted the entire chat transcript into a document and sent it to her and I‚Äôm going to start keeping all records if this is going to keep happening. It‚Äôs ridiculous. 

Then on the phone she decides to tell me that she wants me to do all of my work out of a shared network drive instead of my personal network drive. She doesn‚Äôt even want me keeping two copies and updating the one on the shared drive because she says this adds extra work (I‚Äôm doing what I want on this. I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm not having all work lost by having it only in one place). She says it‚Äôs so that if we are out sick people can jump in and view our stuff to work on it. What it really comes down to is micromanaging and I have a feeling she has been micromanaged into a micromanager from the person above her. The other pot stirring manager may even be going through the same so I‚Äôll give them the benefit of the doubt while carefully interacting with them going forward. 

They‚Äôve been acting weird the last few months wanting to be able to view everything and have us check off as we work then asking why do we have back logs on our work. All we are doing is working off of data in PDF and Excel reports do it‚Äôs not like they can see things change in real time... It‚Äôs honestly one of my biggest pet peeves. I can‚Äôt stand managers hiring me because I‚Äôm supposedly competent enough to do a job but then treating me like a child that has to be parented.

313,I'm so f*cking done,"I made a post on here a couple of weeks ago about how my job treats me like absolute fucking shit, and that I needed to figure out how to get through until I could quit. Welp: let's just say that i'll be leaving a lot sooner than expected.

Quick backstory for those who didn't see thee last one, basically my job hates me, for no clear reason but probably because I'm doing a PhD, so they're not my sole priority and that I have other things more important to me outside of work (though as a part time job with no mobility opportunities without another degree, I don't know how they think I plan to make a career out of it but I digress), and that I reported my supervisor for using a racial slur against a student (which obviously went nowhere) and they've made no efforts to hide their hatred for me. They've given me ultimatums, threatened to fire me, and then when they asked how they could ""help"" me, refused outright to do what I asked them to do (communicate better.....), and the way they've scheduled the probationary meetings and how they've labelled them have made it clear for going on 6 months now that they had no intention of passing me and letting me continue work. 

Basically, I received the outcome report today of my last meeting. I did everything I could to defend myself and even stayed calm no matter how upset they made me, no matter how they twisted my words. They could either give me another 2 months to ""improve"" or decide that I've had enough time (despite covid, lockdowns, and two appendectomies--yes, two) and move to fire me. Guess which one they (obviously) decided to go with? The exact wording of the report was ""dismissal is sought"". Look, I know management isn't going to stand up for me. The union's done all they can. So I'm quitting before they can go through with it.

I don't give a fuck if it's petty and I DON'T give a fuck if it makes me look bad. I'm leaving on my own terms. They have made it abundantly clear that nothing I could say or do would make a difference anyway, and that I've been fucked since the start of this mess over a year ago. So why should I care what they think about me? They have entirely fucked over my mental health and I need to focus on my thesis. I'm getting a doctorate.

323,Management sent out an email telling us we'll be working 11 hour days through April 15th and led to the most beautiful mutiny in the Teams chat.,"I am a technical support rep for a company that produces a major tax program. I honestly have no idea of the market share, but there is definitely an infinite supply of asshole CPAs who call in and expect tax advice from people who aren't even required to have a college degree. I accepted the job as a recent college grad with a worthless degree thinking I'd struck gold making $20/hr. Although I was hesitant about a call center environment, I thought surely it couldn't be so bad...they're professionals after all, right? LMAO 

The program is absolute trash, especially this year. The IRS already made things difficult with delaying the start of efiling, and people constantly call bitching about forms not being ready in our program yet but other programs have them! The developers are in their ivory tower and don't provide information so trivial as a future release date, as if they could meet a deadline anyway. The GUI looks like it's straight out of Windows 95, and almost every single call I take is something that's already been documented and ""will be fixed on a future release"". 

Because it's a tax program, our hours are already extended for tax season to help our dear CPA patrons. January through April is hell, then we get another busy season when extensions are due in September and October. Last year, it was like busy season never ended after the deadline was extended until July. They still waited until the last damn minute. 

We've been working 10 hour days most of this month, which after a lunch break is pretty much 11 hours of my day anyway. Despite this being a relatively high paying position for little required skill in my area, people keep quitting and management pretends to understand the mental health aspect, but just makes the rest of us work more. Everyone's tensions boiled over in the department-wide Teams chat at the end of my shift after management sent out an email saying the first week of March will be 10.5 hours schedule shift, then through April 15th will be 11 hours - essentially 12hr days. They also scheduled people for this Saturday with just a few days' notice after failing to incentivize enough people to volunteer and receive points that can be used in this ridiculous market place the company teamed up with to buy random shit. That's not gonna pay the bills. 

All it took was one person to bravely post how the email attributes the recent attrition to the need to schedule more hours, yet they continue pushing people out the door. The responses in solidarity flooded in. My favorite response in the whole thread was a GIF of Tituss Burgess with the caption ""Me reading the email: If you wanted me to quit, just say so.""

342,"No matter how many articles suggest that working less increases productivity, employers will never get it","For those who have ever felt burnt out or overwhelmed at work, I believe that many of you have searched for and read articles about the negative effects of burnout, how productivity falls down a cliff when people work 50,60 hours a week, and the benefits of working less. However, despite these things being absolutely true from our experiences and in most studies, employers seem to never get it- or get it, but refuse to acknowledge it, even if it benefits both the worker and the company. 

This week I‚Äôve been overloaded at work and have been putting in minimum effort on each project because anything more means that I won‚Äôt be able to finish my assignments, or will have to use my non-existent free time and risk burnout. My work quality has been suffering, but I couldn‚Äôt care less, because this is a result of bad scheduling on the company‚Äôs side. 

No amount of productivity hack or time management skills will make the situation better.

Behind my overstuffed desk ( had to move all my little items from my travels to make room for info sheets for my job) is a big window. It's beautiful outside, sunny and a high of 72. It Looks like there is a slight breeze and birds chriping, its a fucking Disney movie out there after weeks of rainy and dreary winter. 

 I love taking long walks, I would love to just be outside right now listening to music. However I am stuck in a video meeting with 38 people talking about stuff I do not give a shit about. I am stuck here till 6 pm when the weather will start getting cold again. This weekend, when I get to live my life, its gonna be back to the 50's and rainy. 

Overdramatic maybe, but I feel like a performing seal. Jumping through hoops for my boss and coworkers who might get poisoned from all the shoepolish they are ingesting. Stuck in a tiny tank when the ocean is right there. The pandemic already took away all the fun things I thought I would get to do in my early 20's. Late nights walking around the city with friends, concerts, dating, going to bars. The things I have left are the gym, long walks, cooking and art but I have to schedule that not only around the time I am on the clock but around the anxiety and exhaustion I feel from work. 

I don't even not want to work. I'm a passionate person, I like helping people and learning, but jobs that focus that don't pay enough and have their own exploitative and toxic environment. Corporate knows the job is shitty so pays me the bullshit tax plus benefits.

""And that depressing book The Selfish Gene? It fit right in with 1970s-era thinking ‚Äì a time hailed as the ‚ÄòMe Decade‚Äô by the New York magazine. In the late 1990s, an avid Richard Dawkins fan decided to put his take on Dawkins ideas into practice. Rather than making him feel pessimistic, the book inspired CEO Jeffrey Skilling to run an entire corporation ‚Äì the energy giant Enron ‚Äì on the mechanism of greed. Skilling set up a ‚ÄòRank &amp; Yank‚Äô system for performance reviews at Enron. A score of 1 placed you among the company‚Äôs top performers and gave you a fat bonus. A score of 5 put you at the bottom, a group ‚Äòsent to Siberia‚Äô ‚Äì besides being humiliated, if you couldn‚Äôt find another position within two weeks you were fired. The result was a Hobbesian business culture with cut-throat competition between employees. In late 2001 the news broke that Enron had been engaging in massive accounting fraud. When the dust finally settled, Skilling was in prison. These days, 60 per cent of the largest US corporations still employ some variation of the Rank &amp; Yank system.35 ‚ÄòIt is a Hobbesian universe,‚Äô journalist Joris Luyendijk said of London‚Äôs financial services sector in the aftermath of the 2008 credit crisis, ‚Äòof all against all, with relationships that are characteristically nasty, brutish and short.‚Äô36 The same goes for organisations like Amazon and Uber, which systematically pit their workers against each other. Uber, in the words of one anonymous employee, is a ‚ÄòHobbesian jungle‚Äô where ‚Äòyou can never get ahead unless someone else dies‚Äô.""",False,ls3ahs,Frequent-Professor-8,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ls3ahs/opinion_weve_been_brainwashed_that_this_is_how_is/,21,29

372,My bf is all about the work life and im...not,"I worked a job for 3 years that took a massive toll on my mental health (near the end i was actually suicidal and ended up quitting at the urging of a therapist). I missed weekends, holidays, events, time with friends and family. I remember crying in the bathroom at work christmas eve the first year because that was the first time in 25 years id ever missed christmas eve (my family is european and thats the day we celebrate...i tried to explain to management but they said it wouldnt be fair to my coworkers if they let me take the day off). It was also starting to ruin me physically (back pain, early symptoms of carpol tunnel). Im now working a job that pays crap with 0 benefits and supEr high turnover. The management is a joke and unproffesional to say the least.  They keep cutting my hours and tbh, im seriously considering quitting. Im also doing online courses so i can go back to college at the urging of my bf.

My bf works 5 12 hour days a week. I see how it affects his moods, how he counts down the days/hours til friday night. And he wants me to work the same kind of job. Hes basically the one pressuring me to go to college again and told me how attractive it would be to date a career girl.

378,Advice on my work/life position,"Hi /r/antiwork! 

I found this subreddit whilst browsing for similar circumstances as mine. If you check my post history I recently made a post to a UK job subreddit where, probably quite rightly, I was advised to stay in my current job due to the uncertainty around Covid and the potential economic downturn/bad job market in the near future. The TLDR of that post is I really hate my job, it's having a negative impact on my mental &amp; physical health, I have no long-term plans to stay in the industry and I am considering resigning in the coming weeks with no alternative job lined up.

My financial position is approx ¬£19,000 savings/cash in bank, no debts, no dependents, ¬£500 monthly expenses including rent/food. I currently live at home with parents - I'm 29 years old - I'm currently earning around ¬£1,850 take home a month. Full time, office based, management role.

I had initially taken the job to get money together for a working holiday in New Zealand - I was aiming to go last summer, however, Covid hit and ruined those plans. This past year has been terrible and I have just had enough of this job giving me anxiety and bringing me down mon-fri. I'm WFH, barely doing any exercise and I feel like I'm wasting my life away in front of a computer screen doing boring work with people I don't like. I don't have the mental energy to be job hunting on top of working and feel like packing it in and starting fresh would be good for me. 

I've been fighting internally about whether I'm making a too risky decision and would appreciate some feedback or sharing of similar experiences. My plan is to hand in 1 months notice on payday this month, work the full month whilst looking for a place to rent in a new city in the UK (a town I am familiar with and would really like to live in). I'd offer to pay 6 months rent up front as I will fail affordability checks based on no employment (this would be approx. ¬£5,500 at most). Move to new place in April and spend a few weeks settling down, picking up good habits again like exercise and eating well, and then knuckle down to finding work that I want to do/can tolerate mentally. 

The other option I'm considering is to resign, stay living with my parents whilst job hunting, and then make the move when I have found work. My only hang up on this is having to stay at home - I really feel that it is time for me to move in to a place of my own, and really start to build myself and my life. The recent lockdowns have highlighted to me that I would really like my own space.

If anyone can give me their thoughts, advice, a little pep talk, or otherwise tell me what an idiot I am for considering leaving a stable income with no alternative lined up in the middle of a pandemic I would really appreciate it.

388,Wanting a discussion on why you should be paid the full value of your labour when you did not take the risk of creating the possibility of your labour.,"I know I will get downvoted, my goal is an honest discussion out of curiosity.

According to the current economic system  (correct me if I am wrong, I am not too well informed but I am trying to learn), in order to create jobs and wealth you need to provide value to those around you, you need to take a risk to create the means of producing that value and you are rewarded with the profits you acquire, generally the higher the risk the higher the reward but this can vary from industry to industry (barriers to entry, volume etc.)

Now I have seen some people in this subreddit suggest profits is essentially stealing (if this is not you, I am not directing this post towards you. Just does that do). But if we do not give profits as an incentive for this transaction to take place then why would it occur? Even your local farmer from the Babylonian era wanted to make a profit on his goods or else why create them. What he paid for the seed to grow a crop is not what he sells the fruits from that crop for.

Work has become a never-ending slog of newsletters, mandatory ""corporate town halls"", performance evaluations, and meaningless mountains of paperwork. Nowadays I feel like I work for Initech from *Office Space*.

I had to take a day of PTO today for a doctor's appointment. For some unknown reason, I decided to take a different route home. I cut through an old part of town where the speed limit is far slower, tuned into the local college radio station, and cruised all the way home.

For the first time in years, I felt alive. I hadn't felt this good since I was unemployed. For that fleeting half-hour drive, I felt like my time was ***mine***.

* **You like baking?** Make a job out of it (but only if you can‚Äôt be an engineer).

405,New job tommorrow,"I've been struggling to really find anything. I've been gunshy about anything more than 30 hours a week, and I finally just bit the bullet and took one that's 40 or 50 depending on the week. 

430pm to 3 am I'll be in a loud, chaotic car-part factory for a measly amount of money. It was sensory overload walking around in there for five minutes. I won't be on my feet the hole time, which is a literal first for me, but I'll likely be on my feet at east 40% of the day. 

We get a 30 minute unpaid lunch and 30 minutes total unpaid breaks. So not enough time to do anything but shit and shovel some food down my throat, and poke at my phone a bit. An hour lunch and I might have gone home and cooked something easy sometimes, but no. And there's something so petty about deducting all 10 minute breaks.

I don't know what the pace is going to be like, because I don't speak weasel well enough to ask that question and not get ran off. So it's possible it could be reasonable, but it also could be one of those ""if you're not behind it's because someone died,"" type jobs. 

I had to pull connections to work this out. This wasn't just a ""walk into a temp agency and take what they give you,"" type deal, I had to spend money on a cert and strain my family members and ask for a favor from a friend's wife. This took the full extent of my support system to make happen. I had to *claw* for this. 

And this is better than the alternative of just starving in the cold. I have to get up in 5 hours and I'm having a panic attack imagining doing all this on like 2 and a half hours of sleep. 

This is by far not my first job, and not even my first factory job, but it's never going to not be hell and I'll never be used to it. I don't know how long ill be able to handle this before I have to explain to everyone I bothered for this that sorry, I'm just not mentally resilient enough and I'll never be able to tell them what's wrong with me.

406,Have any of you guys seen the anime Golden Boy? After lurking this sub It made me think about this show,"This 90s anime is a goofy and extremely perverted comedy but it has a message that I think relates in one way or another to this sub. 

 *Kintaro (main Character) is a freeter, and has done various jobs as he quests around Japan in pursuit of knowledge. His ventures include computer programming, housekeeping, teaching, the culinary arts, and most of all, studying. Kintaro is also often seen demonstrating the skills he's learned in previous chapters to overcome challenges faced in the current one.* 

So the show goes to explain every episode that he is what is called a ""freeter"" and I always found that interesting. Apparently young people were living this life style in japan for one or more reasons.( ill go back to this)

A freeter is a Japanese expression for people who lack full-time employment or are unemployed 

In Golden Boy the main character jumps from job to job not being tied down to one thing and taking the experience he learned over to the next job. Jobs including computer programming, housekeeping, teaching, the culinary arts. They also mention that the main character went to law school and is very intelligent but intentionally dropped out right before getting his last credits to get a degree to live this life style of being a ""freeter""

So in real life Japan people chose this life style for multiple reasons including:

 

* *to enjoy life, and deliberately chooses not to join the rat race of the* *Japanese work environment**.*
* *having specific dreams incompatible with a standard Japanese career.*
*  *not finding a decent job before high school or university graduation in the system called ""**simultaneous recruiting of new graduates**"", which is unique to Japanese society. Those left behind are forced to take low paying irregular jobs. This usually has to do with their* *dropout* *status from previous educational institutes. Those who dropped out of high school have the worst prospects.*

So I naturally drew parallels to this sub, people not wanting to get caught up in this lifestyle of soul sucking corporate lifestyle but to live life to the fullest. The main character realized that he'd be happier going to job to job, meeting and helping new people instead of finishing his law degree and living a mundane monotonous life behind a desk.

I've always wondered if anyone actually took inspiration from this show and traveled and lived the freeter lifestyle even for a little and how it effected their life, positive or negative. It always made me think about life. Even if the show is not that deep on the surface and is just a silly comedy.",False,lr3p9m,Koopakid64,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lr3p9m/have_any_of_you_guys_seen_the_anime_golden_boy/,15,17

416,"You're right.....I'm just here for a paycheck and am not invested in the store/business' success. No, I don't see the problem.","Quick summary: I'm a grad student with a part time job in a shoe store.

A couple of my bootlicking co-workers have expressed annoyance at me lately because I don't seem ""invested"" in the job and that my attitude seems to be ""I'm only here for a paycheck"".

Damn straight I am only there for a paycheck. What other reason would I have for working a boring job selling overpriced shoes? I would never work an unfulfilling day in my life if I were to win the lottery and would spend my time travelling, being in nature, being with friends and family, and my ""job"" would be volunteering with animals. 

No, I'm not ""invested in the store's success"". I don't get paid enough to care if the store thrives or not. I am a part time worker with no managerial responsibility. That is in intentional decision. I don't want that responsibility, so I didn't sign up for it. I'm don't get paid a cent over minimum wage, and I'm not paid for my time opening or closing the store. I come and do my 12 hours a week every week and they are the only 12 hours a week I think about the place and give it a second thought (other than this post lol). 

I don't care if I close a sale or not. I'm still getting paid the same crap hourly wage whether a customer buys the shoes or not because the business intentionally makes the store's sale targets unrealistically high (especially in the current economic climate) so they don't have to pay the promised bonuses if it is achieved. And the bonus is so pitiful anyway (something like 1% of the amount made over budget divided among us according to hours worked) that it doesn't really work to motivate me. I'm not going to bust my ass and stay 15 minutes after my finishing time in the hope of making a sale to get an extra $2 bonus at the end of the month or something.

The other day, they got angry at me because I said I couldn't (ie: didn't want to) go in on my weekend off because my co-worker was unwell. They demanded to know why. I told them my University semester started on Monday (I'm in NZ) and I needed to prepare and start things for my classes. The truth is that I just didn't fucking *want* to. I was tired and wanted to enjoy my last free weekend before having to dive into readings and assignments. And that is my god damn *right*. I had done my 12 hours for the week and was on my rostered time off where I owed them nothing. They were also angry I didn't answer my phone at 7am on a Sunday. Fuck *off*. I don't owe you being awake early on my days off. You are not entitled to my time at any point outside my rostered hours. I don't have to take your call on my day off. You're lucky I was I nice enough to phone you back when I woke up at 10am instead of waiting for my next shift to see what you wanted. 

They were pissed because they had to close the store early and they expect me to feel bad about it. It is not my fault the business has been short staffed for weeks. That is a ""business"" problem, not a ""telepathy99"" problem. I showed up for my rostered shifts. I don't owe them keeping my weekend off free. Another co-worker got in trouble for being out of town and being unable to come in when I said I couldn't.....they asked her why she went away knowing they are short staffed and they only have 1 or 2 people ""spare"" at any point. The fuck? Again, that is a ""business"" problem, not a ""her"" problem (or a ""me"" problem). Hire and train another staff member if you want more backup when someone is sick, but keep in mind that people don't owe it to you to drop everything and come in on a day off unless we are being paid a part wage to be on call during that time, which we are not. 

I don't care about the business. I don't care about making sales. I am not going to keep my schedule clear outside my rostered hours in case you need back up. It makes no difference to me if someone buys the shoes or not. I don't fucking care. The business isn't my baby or my livelihood. It is a job I have while studying and living at home to have something on my resume for the future when I need a better job, and to pay for things like my phone bill/clothes/going out with friends so I'm not asking my parents to pay for those things.

It is a minimum wage part time job.

Anyone with any ideas on what degree to study?","Hello. I currently work as a cook and am just sick of it.I am done busting my ass for minimum wage when the people who work the store that I cook for get to lounge around and get paid the same as me. I work so hard and constantly for hours for so little pay. I am so close to quitting but everything else is closed in my country due to corona so I am pretty stuck and because this place counts as essential they have luckily gotten to stay open.

This year I have enrolled to a process and food technology degree / food science in hopes to get a job that pays more after graduation to have a better lifestyle and hopefully make enough to retire early. However I am wondering if this is the right path. I just want a job that is above minimum wage which seems impossible to get without a degree. Anyone with any ideas on what degree I should go for?

436,"Thoughts on ""Dirty and Dangerous"" jobs in an anti-work society.","I think one of the main reservations a lot of people have with an anti-work society is the ""removal of incentive"" for dirty and dangerous jobs, like dealing with sewage, building infrastructure, etc.  To this point, if we think logically we can actually imagine a much better ""scheme"" even if some form of dirty or dangerous labor is still necessary.

1. Many dirty and dangerous jobs are only necessary because of capitalism.  Sweatshops are only ""necessary"" because of a consumer culture predicated on consumption meant to ease the stress of work life, for example, and wouldn't need to be done under a more civilized social order.  When thinking of the ""necessity"" of dirty and dangerous jobs, we must remember that many jobs we think of as dangerous are not actually necessary.

2. Capitalism adds to the dangers of jobs by cutting corners on protective equipment, healthcare, and will abandon workers who are ""broken"" by their jobs.

3. Capitalism necessitates the expansion of dangerous jobs, such as updating infrastructure, by diverting resources away from what is good for society in the long term (for example, roads that last 50 years vs roads they can service yearly). 

So we can logically assume that a more sophisticated social order can exist where we accept the destruction of useless dirty and dangerous jobs and the non work of people in these jobs.  By ensuring everyone a livelihood and care regardless of work ability, dangerous jobs that are still necessary are made less dangerous since a society with the goal of improving human life would definitely provide as much protection to these types of workers as possible.  Healthcare for these workers would not be something left solely up to their responsibility, and people would be cared for even in the horrible scenario that they are crippled while doing dangerous jobs for society.  Furthermore, if society adopts a ""long term, sustainable"" approach to design and infrastructure, there will be less and less of a need for ""dirty, dangerous, and necessary"" jobs.

Moreover, actual dirty and dangerous jobs that are still necessary would no longer be alienated from their work, and would see the fruits of their labor in the direct benefit to a society that actually values them.  A society with different values might find people tripping over themselves to assist those doing dangerous jobs, by taking care of their families and residences when their work is necessary.",False,lqf0f0,capnbarky,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lqf0f0/thoughts_on_dirty_and_dangerous_jobs_in_an/,2,8

462,The positive psychological changes I experienced after working for myself,"In an attempt to maybe one day escape the 9-5 grind, I started working on a project that I‚Äôve always had in mind, but never put to action- Opening an e-commerce shop that imports and sells things from my country.¬†

To my surprise, the sales have exceeded my expectations. People who came from the same country as me have been buying things from me like crazy, and locals are interested in the unique things I sell as well. I made about $500 in profit in my first week, and a consistent $600-$1000 every week since. But that‚Äôs not the main point, because this business made my life so much better in other ways besides money. 

Here I‚Äôm going to share the positive psychological changes I experienced after starting my side business

1.I found out that I‚Äôm not as lazy as I had imagined:

Though I‚Äôm always seen as a pretty solid employee, the truth is that there has never been a job where I felt motivated to do my best. I maintain a slightly above average performance to keep my job, but I also fuck around on Reddit and Facebook whenever I can, and is just better at hiding the corners I cut. I try to never arrive a minute early or leave a minute late, and absolutely hate it when anyone from work sends me a work related message when I‚Äôm not at work.¬†For many years, I thought of myself as a lazy person who lacks drive and the determination to succeed. 

However, with this business, I‚Äôm always thinking about ways to grow it. I make sure to maintain a high quality standard for everything I sell, and when a buyer sends me a message to ask about a product at 1am Saturday night, I‚Äôm answering that mofo with great joy. Though it may just be due to the honeymoon stage, this has never happened in any job I had.¬†It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve turned into a different person as soon as I started working for myself. 

2.My self confidence is improving¬†

I think this has to do with the fact that¬†¬†in a job, you‚Äôre inherently inferior to your manager and superiors(especially if you‚Äôre young). However, if you own 100% of a small business, you‚Äôre the king of it. You can do whatever the hell you want with it as long as it works and it‚Äôs legal. You don‚Äôt report to anyone, and have the power to choose who you want to do business with, on your own terms. Even though I do need to satisfy customers, the power dynamic is much more balanced compared with that of a boss and an employee.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

3.Less stressed about money and my job:

Though a couple of thousand dollars a month isn‚Äôt enough to make me rich, it allows me to spend money on wants without compromising my long term financial plans. In addition, the diversified sources of income relieves the stress of losing all income (like I did last year when I got laid off from my last job)¬†

My job is okay now, but if it starts to suck and I decide to quit, I can always do so and rely on this income. This option gives me more negotiating power on work related issues, and reduces the feeling of powerlessness. 

 

4.Boosted Creativity¬†

Since I started this business, I‚Äôm always thinking about how I can make it stand out against competition, this resulted in me coming up with creative solutions to unique problems, and the learning skills (such as graphic design) which I wouldn‚Äôt have learned in jobs within my field. 

 

5.A sense of purpose¬†

There‚Äôs something special about working on something every day and seeing sales/Instagram followers/number of loyal customers grow little by little. Whatever I do for this business accumulates over time if I keep working on it, and whatever content I create will forever be mine.This aspect seems to be lacking in most jobs, where you sit in your desk doing the exact same thing every day. The only thing that accumulates is years of experience, but whatever is produced still belongs to the company, and could be taken away at any time, leaving people with nothing to show for their years of hard work other than a new column of experience on the resume. 

At first, I started this business only to earn a few extra bucks, however, it has improved my quality of life in so many other surprising ways. If there is a project you have in the back of your mind that you haven‚Äôt taken action towards, I would encourage you to do the same; If it turns out to be a success and you need to hire employees, always remember to be the type of boss that you dreamed of working for!",False,lph15a,thelacklustregatsby,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lph15a/the_positive_psychological_changes_i_experienced/,13,1

467,A Suggestion,"So I've stumbled across this group and although I agree with most of these arguments, I think you guys REALLY need to evaluate the actual meaning of the word 'work'. See 'work', as defined by Oxford Dictionary, is ""Activity involving mental or physical effort done in order to achieve a purpose or result."" In other words, it simply means doing something, either physical or mental, to reach a desired result. And once you grasp this definiton, you'll realize that just about everything we do involves work. For example, writing takes work. Cooking takes work. Cleaning takes work. Exercise/playing a sport takes work. Making music/singing takes work. And if you want to apply it to the basic necessities of life, growing/producing food takes work. Buiding shelters and buildings takes work. To produce clothing takes work. Traveling takes work. Generating electricty takes work etc. etc. etc. Even animals in nature work to obtain their necessities. For instance, a bear isn't just given all the food it needs for its entire lifetime; it has to travel or hunt to find their next meal. Hell, even plants/trees have to work (by science) in order to grow. And a lot of you advocate being self employed/running a buisness but fail to realize that you'll still be working. Point being, it is absolutely unnatural and impossible to thrive or survive without doing ANY sort of physical or mental activity. NO human being, even in agarian/ancient times survived by doing nothing, nor any species for that matter. Therefore, your aversion should not be directed at the idea of 'work', but more so at 'job' or 'employment' as these are more specific and are what you're referring to anyway. While I am against employment as a FORM of working, to claim that human beings shouldn't do any work AT ALL is absolutely absurd. We need to differentiate between 'work' and 'job' as they are two separate terms, so I suggest renaming this group to 'antiJOBS' to avoid such confusion.

Like the lot of you, I'm pretty damn against working, the thought of scraping pennies while some rich fuck yoinking up almost all the profit I'm making, then demanding I thank them for it really makes my blood boil, and I refuse to live like that until my death, however sooner it will probably come living under a system like that.

No matter how little or how late I work, whether I work 4 hours or 12 hours, I still feel exhausted and unfulfilled, like nothing I had done had any point in my life. What did I do it for? Whether working for a for profit or a non profit, all of it leaves a sick feeling in my stomach.

I'm already horribly depressed and anxious on top of a whole host of other issues, and no doubt working 8 hours a day 5 days a week will drive me into the grave sooner.

Well. It got worse than this.

My boss was already constantly crossing boundaries and texting and calling me after hours. Since then, she has decided to do the following:
- Blame me for posting a blurry picture that SHE TOLD ME TO POST and started yelling at me for ‚Äúallowing that to happen‚Äù
- Stalking my social media. I know this because my Instagram is private and I constantly reject her follow,  but literally an hour after I reject it she will try to follow me again. Also she made a comment about a ‚Äúpicture she saw of me, but doesn‚Äôt remember how‚Äù and she wouldn‚Äôt have seen that picture unless she went on my social media
- Said it‚Äôs ‚Äúgood‚Äù that her business partner died from a drug overdose
- (the worst) Yelled at me for posting an Instagram picture (on our business account) WITHOUT MY NAILS DONE. Yeah. I didn‚Äôt know I had to spend money and time on my nails to work for you. She made me take it down and said I‚Äôm not allowed to have my hands in pictures anymore (and it‚Äôs basically a Bookstagram... how can I not have my hands in pictures holding books???)

I have an interview today for a different job, and I hope to GOD that I get that job. I can‚Äôt stand the heaviness in my chest anymore.

499,Help me pick a degree / career I want to get out of minimum wage desperately while I am young to be able to retire early. Have an opportunity to go to uni for very low tuition / no debt.,"Hello I really need advice on careers. 22 / F / based in Europe. I currently work as a cook and am fed up. I get minimum wage, work constantly on my feet running around and am sick of it. The place I cook for has the kitchen in a seperate location and the food gets sent to the store. The people who work in the store get paid the same / more than me and do literally 0 work. They stand around chat, and have essentially nothing to do but mind the store while I am at work killing myself to get everything done cooking for hours. 

However this is the only place really open as they count as being essentialy at the moment due to corona and everything else in my country being closed. I want to quit so badly but am lucky to even have this job to be scraping by with 20ish hours of work a week and 10 euros an hour. 

This year I have an opportunity to go back to Uni for very low tuition so I won't get into any debt. I was considering food science / food technology and have enrolled into the degree as I love cooking and creating food however am nervous that this won't lead to a profitable career. I have looked into it and a lot of people say they are happy with the food science industry but I am scared I am making a wrong step and wondering what other options I could look at for degrees. I was considering something like a dental hygienist even.

Looking for something potentially work from home, Day shifts preferably but could be open to night work Anyone with any ideas of which degrees lead to a great work life balance and being able to retire early? 

I desperately need to get off minimum wage please help me. My parents are extremely poor and I have no one to fall back on.

522,You can only spend 28% of your time with your family if you work 40 hours per week.,"Some numbers I came up with 

The only time I could spend time with my kids, that I don‚Äôt have yet, during the 9-5 work week is after work before bed. So about 5:30pm-ish to 10pm-ish. Kids, on average, go to bed at 9-9:30ish. So 5:30-9:30, 4 hours per day. 4x5= 20 hours

Weekends let‚Äôs be generous and say on average, 8am-10pm. 14 hours per day, times two is 28. 28+20= 48 hours per week of time to spend with my kid. And that‚Äôs before chores, errands, tasks to do, an unrealistic number. 

So out of 168 hours per week, I get at MAX 48 hours to spend with my family if absolutely nothing gets in the way. Only 28% of my week with family.
62% if you include sleeping time but I don‚Äôt include it honestly. 

28% of my week. Or 43% of time spent awake during the week is with family.

528,"Burnt out at work, exhausted but financially trapped to stay","Throwaway account for semi-obvious reasons.

Just needed somewhere to get this obvious reasons - just feel like I want to quit my job as a doctor. It's maddening and frustrating when you go to work at 6am on weekdays and work continuously until 7.30pm - any sort of lunch break you have is taken up by meeting and tutorials (half of which you don't attend because you are busy with patients in the ward - which gets you into serious trouble with your department). On weekdays you will work from 6am until 2pm.

The overnights are bad - when you work shifts from 6am till 2pm the next day without a fucking break or more than 1 hour of sleep - and get called the next day by another team to be told they think you've been over cautious and done too much for a supposedly straight forward case. (Amazingly you must declare when clocking in your workplace hours that you work from 8am to 5pm on weekdays, and 8am to 12noon next day for night shift days, so you don't get called up and accused by your department of violating working hours - thus you do not get paid for any over time work. However you will get screwed if you go into work the same time as your boss (8am) and have not prepared adequately for ward rounds, and you will be screwed if you haven't finished your work and left at 5pm or 12 noon on the dot)

The days are bad - when families and patients complain continuously about not being updated often enough or early enough in the day. It is frustrating when you are tired, burnt out but need to be constantly ""on"" and paying attention to every little detail in a patient's charts / in a history, you need to be ""on"" when you communicate with your patients and their families, you need to be ""on"" when you sit in a meeting less you get shamed for lack of participation.

You find yourself denied leave or having been ""missed out"" in an email for leave requests and being told you are not allowed to have a break although its been 6 months since your last day of leave.

You are told by your department, your patients (and their families), your superiors that you are never enough. You are never caring enough, never meticulous enough, never concise enough, never detailed enough, never clever enough, never as skilled as enough, never as hardworking enough, never enough.

It's not that we work for appreciation or we even need the acknowledgement.

Just a fucking break from the hate and constant criticism over small things would be nice.

Am trying so fucking hard and giving every ounce of my being to my patients, to my work - and it is fucking ENOUGH on my end to be told that I need to be doing more. Am sick of the passive aggressive conversations from nurses/seniors/patients ""oh sorry to be disturbing you now - I know you are probably on a lunch break"" - NO I am not because I have not been on a lunch break in months - if you would like to know I once wet myself in the ward because I was so busy I could not even fucking pee.

I do my best to be polite and respect to those around me but am reaching a point where I'd like to shoot myself in the head after all the shit that happens.

Am tired of my own family implying I don't come home early enough, don't reply texts early enough, am not mentally present enough when I'm home.

Every single minute of every fucking day - people are bitching about something or another and in all honesty - I would say this is the main job of a doctor, to be bitched to and make sense of things and coordinate things while enduring a barrage of bitching from everyone.

Would change speciality but have heard from other juniors elsewhere they are similar drowning and flailing

538,I‚Äôm new(ish) to the working world and it‚Äôs so nice to see people echoing my feelings! So happy I found this group,"I‚Äôm new to Reddit &amp; I‚Äôm so happy I have found this thread. I‚Äôm a 23F, I joined the work force in 2019 after being hired at a cooperate firm. 

I had worked since I was 15 but, as I was in school it was always part-time &amp; this meant I never fully grasped the realities of working full time. It took me around 5 months of full time work to know that I hated it. 

None of it made sense to me. I instantly felt like they wanted me to work at a capacity that wasn‚Äôt just or fair, then I realised this wasn‚Äôt a unique problem and was pretty standard. 
A few things  that shocked me included (but not limited to) : 
- The work hours 
- I wasn‚Äôt paid for my break 
- Only 21 days of holiday 
It felt (and still does feel) like a huge scam! 

I remember I got sick once during my probation. I had tonsillitis and literally couldn‚Äôt talk, eat, or swallow. I lost ¬£120 in pay those 2 days I was off because I was on probation and apparently hadn‚Äôt earned the right to be sick yet. WTF?! I was still sick when I came back but literally couldn‚Äôt afford to lose more money.

In addition I feel that in order for me to ‚Äúsucceed‚Äù in my job I have to put in overtime constantly. I‚Äôm never on-top of my tasks because, frankly I‚Äôm not willing to work over the weekend nor am I willing to work till 8pm most nights nor work at an inhuman like pace during my work day. Some days are productive some aren‚Äôt... I‚Äôm not a machine. This is created issues around my anxiety levels &amp; stress. I don‚Äôt like to feel like I‚Äôm not doing my job well or be behind, especially when I‚Äôm surrounded by people burning the midnight oil regularly and ‚Äúgoing the extra mile‚Äù. I constantly feel like I‚Äôm lacking but I don‚Äôt like the path I have to take to reach success. 

Also, my corporate job pays but the pay is one of the only good thing I get out of this job. I hate that we put money in front of joy/ fulfilment &amp; money is one of the biggest indicators of ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù. That is very backwards to me. Yes money is an aid, yes I would love to be rich but I‚Äôm am not willing to give up most of my waking life to have it. I‚Äôm  more than willing to work hard when I work on something I enjoy or find it meaningful. I think this is true for most people but why do so many meaningful jobs pay so low?! It all feels so unbalanced and exploitive - I hate participating in it but what‚Äôs the alternative?..

I think it's even more interesting that many people who work non essential work are almost forcing the majority to believe that the non essential is actually essential when it is not. People trying to find meaning in something where there clearly isnt any meaning. Like a physchopath trying to convince his victims that he loves them before he kills them.

How in the hell fo people trade the time they will never ever back to go to work and make slave wages? Or even if you make decent money, many people are still unhappy with the work. 

Who the fuck invented this concept? 

Money. *People*

And what was working suppose to help society achieve? 

What has a working society divided into ‚Äúclasses‚Äù, actually achieved? 

Division in equality. 

I see so many continue on in their mundane daily lives that consist of work and they are unhappy, unmotivated, worn down, and worst of all? **WORKING HARD**.

I‚Äôm changing that belief), for the first hand experience, and I don‚Äôt like or agree with it. 

I don‚Äôt believe life is about that- all work, no play- or even minimal play. No. Life is meant to be lived, happily. Not struggling for the simplest of necessities. What we have created and allowed is futile to the many. Life as we all live, know and accept - must change. 

Work is not normal, not in the way it is exploited nowadays, and reform is a must.

544,I like my job,"Before you go and downvote me, let me explain.

Like a lot of millennials, I've had quite a few jobs, some I took just so I didn't starve, some that sounded fun but turned out to be hellholes, a few where I made good money at the cost of my sanity and soul.

But this is the first job I've had that I enjoy. That I feel like my work makes a difference. And that I look forward to going to on most days.

While my core beliefs are that of the way of thinking this subreddit holds dear, and no matter how much I wish I could live in the perfect world, I don't mind my little pocket of the planet and I don't mind the labor I do.

A little bit of context if you have gotten this far.

I work at a regional food bank that serves 7 counties in my state.

It's a non profit (duh, maybe?).

I make $15 an hour.

I work 8 hours days.

I get an hour for lunch.

I get 2 weeks of sick and personal time a year.

I get 2 weeks vacation a year.

My boss doesn't set unrealistic expectations.

I don't have strict goals.

I don't have to stay late if I'm not needed.

They hire as many people as needed.

I don't have to beg for time off.

I learn good skills.

I get free certifications.

I get to interact with the communities I work to help.

I get to see people have their lives changed by getting food with no questions asked.

I meet people from all over, even other countries that have immigrated and need help starting out.

I get to know that the kids I see don't go hungry as much as they could.

Our society likes to believe everyone should be happy and depression is not a suitable response to any problem. You will be told that you have a mental problem if you are depressed in life, without any further investigation into it.

Listen, if you spend 8 hours flipping burgers a day at Wendy's, your life is not going to be satisfying. It is going to be depressing. But society will wrongly claim that the reason you are unhappy is because you suffer from depression, that you should not be unhappy.

I'm not picking on a Wendy's burger flipper, as the vast majority of jobs out there are just as dismal.

This depression is CAUSED BY the shitty life circumstance. It is cause by the daily 8 hours of burger flipping torture. The problem isn't the depression. The problem is the life circumstance which is CAUSING your depression, IE work. It's the burger flipping job, the office job, the construction job, fill in XYZ job you have here since so many jobs are unfulfilling and will lead to deep an unescapable depression.

579,Why don't we force the issue?,"Forgive me if this has been discussed before. I'm kinda new here.

I worked long enough to know that union talk will get you fired. But we've also seen the power of social media several times over the years. So, why can't we use this to our advantage?

Just pick a day far enough in the future for everyone to get ready, and get the word out. Let's say May of next year. I say May, hoping most of the poorest working Americans will have their tax returns around then. Then we just come up with a clever name, post some memes until it takes on a life of its own, and wait.

Then, on May 14thish next year, nobody go to work (unless actual lives depend on you). Yeah, a lot of people won't have the balls to do it. But they'll be the people running the stores short staffed and would likely give up after a day or two.

America would grind to a halt. No fast food, Walmart, Uber, Disneyland, hotels, or gas stations for a few days and everyone would start backing us.

We hold out for better pay, better benefits, shorter work days or weeks. We just grab corporations, politicians, and economies by the throat and don't let go until we get our way.

I know it can't or won't be that simple. There are thousands of reasons why it may fail. But where is the organization, the planning, and where are the people having this conversation?

580,Exploited for free labor at 16,"This might get kinda long cuz the more I write the more I remember hahah. Scroll down for tldr

This happened over ten years ago but it‚Äôs only just struck me how fucked up this was 

I was homeschooled at 16 and wanted some spending money so I started looking for a job. I was a pretty edgy teen, so I didn‚Äôt want some boring McDonald‚Äôs job or something‚ÄîI wanted something cool and unique. I picked up some weird jobs due to this attitude, including making file trees filled with images stolen from the Home Depot website (no idea why someone posted me to do that but they paid me, so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). 

I eventually stumbled onto something I thought would be perfect. It was to work security part time at haunted attractions. Now, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs legal for a 16 year old to be a security guard in CA, but I figured myself for something of a badass and applied anyway and they told me to come in for an interview. 

When I got there, the place was absolutely packed. There were no joke at easy 20-30 people there. Eventually I get called in, and there‚Äôs these 3 guys sitting at a desk in the middle of a large dance room, the kind with floor to ceiling mirrors along all the walls. 

They told me they knew I wanted to work security, but they had everyone audition for the role of maze monster first anyway. I thought that was weird, but whatever. They gave me a few different roles‚Äî‚Äòyou‚Äôre a clown in a straight jacket, and you‚Äôve for an itch on your nose,‚Äô is the one I remember most clearly, they were all like that. 

It was tons of fun, and they seemed like really cool guys. They told me a little about the company, said that it‚Äôs spent XX years doing this and that they‚Äôre opening a new location in (home town) and yadda yadda. They told me the hours (Thurs-Sun, something like 6pm-12AM or whatever) and the pay‚Äî$10/hr. For a high school student, that‚Äôs perfect. 

I get an email a few days later saying not only was I hired, they were so impressed with my acting skills that they‚Äôre making me part of the ‚ÄòElite Team‚Äô‚Äîmuch cooler than the average maze monster, I‚Äôd be working in front of the haunt to encourage people to come buy tickets and keeping people in line entertained. I was unbelievably flattered, because I‚Äôd never acted a day in my life‚Äîand here were professionals who wanted me as part of their elite team!!! 


Some time goes by and they announce when training will begin. It‚Äôll go on for about a month and a half before the scare season starts. 3 times a week for 6 weeks, we‚Äôre to meet up at the local sports park for 3 hours. 

Wear exercise clothes. 

Kind of weird, but ok. 

The next six weeks are hellish. There‚Äôs about 20 of us, all varying ages, and health status. They make us run laps to start, push ups, sit ups, all sorts of other things. A bunch of people quit on the first day. They announce one day that we‚Äôre going to be making our characters for the haunt‚Äîthe way they do this is line us up and tell us to ‚Äòget in character,‚Äô and they‚Äôll come up and ask questions. If we hesitate, they make us do push ups. Mind you‚ÄîI‚Äôd never created a character in my life, let alone a fully developed horror character that I can also act out. I did a lot of push ups. They also berated us, made fun of our characters ‚Äúall of your characters suck!‚Äù ‚ÄúThey all just have daddy issues, come up with something unique!‚Äù (Unique? These guys also had characters, btw, and one of them was literally just ‚Äòkiller clown.‚Äô) 

I made some friends with the other ‚Äòemployees,‚Äô one of whom was a man more than twice my age. We‚Äôd run the laps together, joke around, etc. He eventually made a Facebook group for the employees where we would bitch and complain about the bosses. He in particular would imply that they were gay in pretty derogatory ways. As a closeted gay guy, I mostly didn‚Äôt interact. (Hilarious side note, this guy would also call me at weird hours and hit on me saying my voice was sexy, so there‚Äôs that) 

Fast forward a bit, and the season is about to start. They gather all of us monsters, along with all the other workers‚Äîconstruction workers that are going to build the maze, concession workers, security, etc etc, in front of the building we‚Äôre going to work at. They pump us the hell up about this. 

A week later, they fire everyone except the elite monster team, because they couldn‚Äôt secure a seasonal contract to rent the building. Seems like a pretty big damn oversight for such an experienced team. 

But as I said, they didn‚Äôt fire the elite team. We were given a time and a place‚Äîand by now, there were only like, 6 of us. They had work for us. We were going to work at various haunts throughout SoCal, in mazes that ‚Äòneeded help‚Äô because we were ‚Äòso well trained‚Äô and elite. 

We worked at I think a total of three different haunts. Each night everyone would pile into MY car (as I had access to a big van that would fit all of us) and drive to the haunt we‚Äôd be working at. 

This was when I learned that I wasn‚Äôt going to have the costume I thought I was going to have. I wanted to be kind of a zombie in a straight jacket. Instead, they had a purple frilly dress for me to wear. I was actually pretty down with that, and it was fine‚Äîuntil one of the original workers at the maze we were at started harassing me about it, trying to figure out if I was ‚Äòa chick or a tr*nny‚Äô. Another night, the bosses would come in like every few hours and berate my performance and say it sucked. 

At one point, I had to basically move to LA for like the whole month of October to work at a haunt. We stayed in a warehouse full of old movie props, which was actually pretty cool, but at this point I had no money because we hadn‚Äôt actually been paid for any of our work yet. I was eating those 99 cent bread loaves from Walmart and free tea from the concessions stand. Sometimes at the end of the night, the owner of this haunt would buy everyone pizza. So that‚Äôs what I ate for weeks. 

The season ends, and there‚Äôs no word from the bosses for a few weeks. Then, finally, I get a call. I have to go meet up with them to get my paycheck. 

I get there, and it‚Äôs a lot like my audition was. Three guys sitting at a table. I sit down, and they slide across the table not a check, but a print out of a bunch of postings from the Facebook group. On top is the only post I interacted with. My friend, implying the bosses are gay, and my comment‚Äî‚Äòlol‚Äô or whatever it was. something noncommittal and innocuous. They say that this Facebook group counted as defamation, and so they were only going to pay me the gas they used to get to the haunts. They gave me a check for something like $23, not nearly enough to cover a huge Chevy suburban‚Äôs gas driving all around Southern California. 

But, I was 16. It was my first ‚Äòreal‚Äô job. I thought I was in serious legal trouble. I took the paycheck, said sorry for calling them gay, and left in tears. 

The worst part is, I‚Äôd really liked these guys. I‚Äôd wanted their approval so much, and I‚Äôd worked harder than I‚Äôd worked in anything to get it, and it didn‚Äôt work.

596,"My job has definitively proven to me that no matter how good you are, you‚Äôre still ‚Äúaverage‚Äù","So every year the managers all get together and rate people on a scale of 1-5 and your score determines how big of a raise you get. I started working there late 2018, so I had my first yearly performance review last April (for 2019). For that year I was given a 3, despite my manager constantly singing her praises and telling me I‚Äôm one of the top 3 employees in the office. She said with full transparency, ‚ÄúIf it makes you feel any better, you were a very high 3, very few people got 4s, and no one got a 5. And I personally think they have the bar way too high for someone to reach a 4.‚Äù 

Ok, I said. I spent my entire summer helping other teams get caught up and doing other peoples‚Äô work and I took every development opportunity that my manager threw my way. So how could someone go from a 3 to a 4?

She said I need to make a bigger impact across the office. 

Ok. What does that mean?

I‚Äôm not sure, she said. I‚Äôm a little confused too. I‚Äôll need to ask for clarification from my managers.

So this past year (2020) I once again did every extra side project they threw my way on top of a doubled to tripled workload. I volunteered to manage a difficult customer, I mentored a new hire, I spent two months working overtime every week to help another office get caught up, I took 30-40 calls daily, I lead a customer audit, I came up with several process changes to help lessen workload, I did weekly customer calls with another difficult customer...you get the gist. 

I had my 2020 review yesterday. Guess what I got?

A fucking 3. 

I‚Äôm under a new manager now since my other one is on leave. He said do you have any questions?

I said nope.

I think he could tell I was irritated because he said don‚Äôt worry, most of the rest of the office got a 3 too. 

Fantastic. That makes me feel so much better. So until I finally fucking find a new job, I‚Äôm just going to sit back and relax like everyone else because evidently extra work doesn‚Äôt mean Jack shit.

598,Work hard and you will succeed?,"I want to start by saying that I absolutely hate working, however have always seen it as a necessary means to an end. I've often worked 2 or 3 jobs simultaneously to make ends meet, as I've lived in my own place since I was 21 and always had a car, so wage slavery has had me hooked for a while now. I worked 6 days a week over two jobs for a year and a half until the pandemic hit and had no life.

I'm 27, based in Scotland and work for local government (or council as it would be called here) within their HR services department. Prior to the pandemic I had an hour commute to the office 9-5 and then same again on the way back - now I work from my bedroom. I grew up in a deprived area, living with my non-working single mother and siblings, although my Dad has always been in the picture. Like any working-class person my age, I was brought up to believe that if I work hard, I'll get on in life. This idea of social mobility is what's sold to you throughout your youth and what ultimately pushed me towards university, where I spent a number of years achieving a 2.1 in Business (Hons) and an MSc in Human Resource Management while sacrificing a lot in my personal life. I do not like HR.

I have worked in my organisation's HR services department since summer 2018 and in my current role for almost 2 years now. For the most part, local government workers have a bad reputation here in the UK, as they're very safe jobs (although not paid very well) which are great for lazy people. I knew this before starting but figured I'd be able to get on in the organisation with my education once I'd gained some experience, as they don't typically recruit graduates. My understanding was that if I work to a high standard, take on extra reponsibilities and show that I'm keen then I'd be able to progress after a year or two.

This week though, I've been unsuccessful for a job that I am very familiar with, and one that I do a lot of already, in favour of a colleague who's worked for the organisation for 30 years or so without progressing. While I'd agree they are capable of doing the job, this person does not have the education I have and is not nearly as outgoing as I have shown since I joined the team - I've been a tremendous yes-man and always the first to take on extra responsibilities, to air my thoughts in team meetings and to find solutions to the issues we face. In fact, after their retirement plans were announced, the postholder inferred on several occasions that their job would be mines before interview. When looking at it, it was hard to imagine how it couldn't be - after all, that old mantra is what I've been assured all my life. I'd worked hard, done well on the job and gone above and beyond regularly and always understood I'd be rewarded accordingly.

On learning that I hadn't got the job, my manager advised I gave a strong interview but was ""pipped at the post"". They didn't offer much meaningful feedback beyond the old ""work on your interviewing skills"". There is an implication I am supposed to take the knock, continue with my head down and continue to work towards getting the promotion. It just wasn't my turn. My conclusion is that I simply have not occupied a seat for long enough to warrant a move up the ladder - there is an unspoken queue and I need to serve my time first. My experience to date has also shown me that my education is of no value here at all - which is ironic as I was recently asked by my manager to host an online recruitment event at my old university. My eager, people-pleasing self obviously agreed.

The last few days have obviously now given me plenty of food for thought about the way forward. I don't doubt that if I carry on I'll get a promotion eventually, but now I'm not sure I'm willing to. If I don't show I'm willing to and stop offering to take on extra responsibilities etc, it'll be held against me as I've set such a high standard for myself since I started. Never mind feeling like a dick for going above and beyond, I've actually shot myself in the foot a bit going forward.

I have a colleague who has got incompetence down to an art form and they earn more money than I do purely as they've worked there longer. Let's call them Steve. I always find myself picking up after Steve's mistakes and I suppose you could say I've looked down on them for their laziness. Now I'm beginning to look at this in a different light - Steve just wants his bills paid, shows up to the mind-numbing 9-5 doing bare minimum and lives a reasonably comfortable life. 

Maybe Steve has it all figured out and I've been too naive to realise? There is quite an uncomfortable realisation there.

While I haven't read David Graeber's book, I've listened to a good bit of his stuff and can comfortably say this is a bullshit job and the work is brutally unfulfilling. However in my pursuit for promotion and better pay, I've tricked myself into enjoying it as a challenge. Even going back to university - I told myself I'd put up with it as long as I'm paid well. While I'm not exactly paid well, I have now been working from my bedroom since March 2020 and will likely continue until the end of the year (at least). As before, there aren't many safer jobs to have in this pandemic and economic climate, and this allows me to save a decent amount of money per month and so I'm left in quite a fortunate position going forward.

I am completely disillusioned and have told myself I'll take a few weeks to figure out my future plans. I have a feeling that moving organisation won't be any better though. I could also change career - for example, I've always thought about doing teaching, which I suppose would be more fulfilling work. I'd also like to work for myself but I don't have any skills etc to make this a reality. In a way, I'd be far more content cruising at the minimum in my comfortable job for the next year or 2 and saving my energy for my free time. 

I understand this sub is against the concept of work altogether, but what's the alternative or the best compromise in the current system? Do you still believe that hard work gets you places or have you abandoned this mantra altogether?

I've been pretty consistent with my work during the pandemic. I am lucky enough to work from home with no major bills. In January I got a bad performance review, which okay fair, I wasn't doing my job properly and was late on a lot of deadlines. I was anxious and depressed so most days I'd stare at a computer screen beating myself up for not doing the work, which led my downward spiral.

But then it really pissed me tf off that for someone like me, a consistent performer who was regularly applauded at work, suddenly dipping off in terms of performance wasn't a cause for concern for my supervisors. I never expect my bosses to care about me, but it really just opened my eyes to how stupid it is for people from all types of industries (from small businesses to non profits to the Amazons of the world) to expect us to just be okay during a pandemic and consistent (awful) historic events happening.

636,Feel like I can‚Äôt function in normal society,"No judgement please, just need to vent. I‚Äôm 25 now and been on my own since I was in highschool, my relationship with my parents had gotten better but they can‚Äôt do much to help me financially and I can‚Äôt live with them. I have a mood disorder that makes maintaining a job difficult. I can do it for a while but I always screw up somehow by taking too much time off, being late too much, having an outburst or forgetting to show up. 


Im in college because I can get grants and loans, and I am interested in my degree but as the classes get harder I‚Äôm struggling and have dropped quite a few over the years. Now I‚Äôm in student debt with not much hope of being able to pay it back if I can‚Äôt maintain a job. I wish there was an opt out but there just isn‚Äôt. I know people who train hop and travel and busk and live out of a backpack but that life can be really rough and a lot of them are on opiates, it doesn‚Äôt seem like how I want to live personally. Paying rent is sucking me dry and I just feel like I‚Äôm constantly spinning my tires to get nowhere. Landlords can eat a d!ck. My city is full of homeless people and empty houses and condos. The winters are brutal. 


When I have time to focus on being healthy I can feel ok and because I was self employed when the pandemic started I was able to get unemployment since my contractors shut down. I‚Äôm terrified of what my life will be like when unemployment is over. I have my rent paid in advance until September. After that I don‚Äôt know what will happen. 


I often fantasize about living in a tent in the woods. Life makes more sense that way, it just seems easier. I know how to get food and water, but living in a tent even remotely close to a city is dangerous so that makes getting resources too hard. It‚Äôs not realistic.

Also just a note I‚Äôm not opposed to working for a purpose. If I had a farm, garden, kids, stuff like that I‚Äôd gladly work hard to care for them. But it‚Äôs this weird bureaucratic nonsense job kinda stuff that baffles me and drains my life. If I‚Äôm 5 minutes late to feed a goat, the goat doesn‚Äôt fire me.

646,You CAN'T be yourself during a job interview,"I recently read an interview on how to successfully apply for a job. In the comments, there was an opinion that above all at a job interview you have to be yourself and that is the key to success!

Unfortunately, you cannot be yourself during a job interview. You have to say what they want to hear.

I  can't say I left my previous job because I was a victim of mobbing and had diarrhea from stress - I have to lie to ""not speak unfavorably about my former employer"" because it's unprofessional and say that this position was ""not exactly what I was looking for"" instead. I can't say that my hiatus on my resume is because I was depressed and ill. I have to say that I was working illegally at the time for my uncle's company so I wouldn't come off as a slacker or someone who's going to take a  sick leave every week. I can't say that I changed my job on average every 2 years because I have neurosis, anxiety and it's hard for me to find a good job for people with my ailments - I have to say that I want  to grow in many areas and try new things because I am feisty. When asked  about my education, I have to say that I plan to go to college because I  wanted to gain experience at work before, but the truth is that I could not afford to go to college and my parents did not pay any attention to my education and all I heard was that I should stop being weird and go to work, preferably as a cashier or cleaning lady at Walmart.

649,"Why should I bother trying to get a high-paying, full-time job when my country (the U.S.A.) disincentivizes it?","I went to school to get my degree, getting myself into a decent amount of debt (not terrible but a significant amount).  As such, I was able to land a decent job, making a few more dollars an hour than I had been previously.

In a way, this seemed worth it, as over time this added income should, in theory, eliminate the debt.  Additionally, I should have (again, in theory) been able to increase my income even further with hard work and pay increases/promotions.

However, I was laid off when the pandemic hit and collected unemployment for ten months before finding a similar opportunity just this past week.  During that time, my income remained the same and I received both stimulus checks.

So now I can't help but think ""what's the point?""  Why should I bother working 40+ hours weeks, feeling exhausted and miserable, when I can do just as well, if not better, not working or working shorter hours?

During those ten months, I was much happier and healthier and my income actually went UP thanks to the stimulus payments.  Working harder and moving up the proverbial ""corporate ladder"" would simply force me to pay more taxes and miss out on stimulus money.  This is in addition to the aforementioned happy/healthy hits I would take.  Furthermore, the minimum wage is also set to be bumped up to essentially what I was making then anyway.  At that point, the hard work and money spent to earn my degree will have provided me nothing.

It seems like there is a disincentive to ""better"" yourself and work harder.  The best strategy seems to be keeping a modest paying job for around a year, getting laid-off/fired, and collecting unemployment until it runs out.  Doing more just doesn't seem worth it.  Making more money and working harder just makes you miss out on government assistance and forces you to pay more in taxes.  And even if you run out of unemployment, you can always go on welfare.

So where is the incentive to work long hours, get the promotion, etc?  Where is the incentive not to get fired from your job or laid off after a certain amount of time?  I realize that the U.S.A, though moving in a socialist direction, is far less so than many other countries but they almost seem to be discouraging hard work and high achievement (the importance of and value of which was stressed to us our entire lives).

654,My anti-work semi-solution,"This solution isn't for everyone I'm aware but its my 2021 plan and I thought you might all be interested. 

Ever since the pandemic started I have only paid a few months rent and almost no utilities. The rent moratorium saved my ass. I started learning to build a tiny house last year while receiving enhanced unemployment and more or less finished learning how to weld the trailer and mostly finished sheathing the walls and getting the subfloor before snow hit. I'm hoping hoping have it fully insulated by summer so I can move out of the house I'm in now. Tiny housing imo is the modern solution for millennial and zoomers since we arent in the housing market. This way I can take it on the road and actually travel like I've always wanted to.

My 15yo Jetta with 5k still on my loan (lol it was my uber car) is getting repossessed and I'm going to start my project Audi 5000 which was 500 bucks I've kept in storage. No more car payment.

My last major undertaking will be designing a food cart I can take into town and serve folk. I'm already sourcing used restaurant equipment since so many are liquidating their assets and again, anything tiny you can reduce overhead on will at least save you some cash even if revenue doesn't happen immediately. I always knew I'd own a business at some point so I'm totally fine with this solution for now.

I realize a lot of folk won't have this same oppurtunity but if you have to go to extreme measure like forgo as many bills as necessary them go for it. My credit is trash and refusing to pay most bills doesn't keep me up at night lol. 

Fuck work and fuck the system. I'm 28 and never did I think after becoming an adult would it take a decade to figure out how to actually enjoy life. Good luck.",False,lngq0q,BlueEyesOpen,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lngq0q/my_antiwork_semisolution/,3,3

Slavery was never really abolished, they just made more subtle and inclusive, so now we're all slaves.

Anyways, I spend some of my time making music (which is what I'd like to do to make a living) and trying to find inspiration in different places. Recently I came across a documentary called 'Dirty Girls' about this group of teenage girls in the late 90's who were bullied at school because of the way they dressed and what they were about. I was expecting it to be a sad documentary but I was surprised to see that the girls who were bullied actually didn't give a fuck and they just did their own thing, without worrying about fitting in.

One of the things that stood out to me was when one of the bullied girls was being interviewed and she said: *""I can be whoever I want to be, I don't have dress for anyone, I don't have to look for anyone, I don't have to do anything for anyone. I can just be myself"".*  I'm pretty sure the girl who said this was 13 or something so I thought was pretty cool coming from her. Anyway, once I watched the whole documentary I felt inspired to write a song based on it, so I did, and I also used clips from the documentary to make a video for it.

&amp;#x200B;

But when I apply for an IT support position that pays 13/hr, fuckers ask for multiple years of experience, a couple of different certs, and a host of different platforms/software. Mind you, this is a position where all you have to do is troubleshoot customers' PC problems (which my coursework in IT adequately covered I would say) And as I was saying, it gets more asinine as you look at jobs paying &gt;20/hr.

692,I turned 28 on Tuesday. First thought I had waking up today was that so many years of my life have sped by while working full time,"Good morning, existential crisis. I‚Äôve had them since I was 23 when a friend committed suicide, and they‚Äôve at least gotten better. Sometimes I still get so sad, though. Especially when I think about getting older and seeing my parents age and pass away, me passing away. 

But this morning I realized that I‚Äôm 28 now. I‚Äôm almost 30. And when I look back at how fast 18 - 28 went, I feel basically 40. Like 40 will be here in a year and me being old and dying is close enough to feel it following me year after year. 

This is melodramatic. I realize. But I started thinking that college went by at a steady pace. It wasn‚Äôt until I started working full time that the years sped by. You spend so much time waiting for two dats each week to try to cram in things you need to do. Then a handful of hours for hobbies. I just don‚Äôt have time to do the things I want to do or used to do. I have to choose. Do I devote time to computer stuff to potentially change careers and better myself or do I play video games, learn languages, etc. 

I read once about some theory that said that time only seems to go by faster when you‚Äôre older because you‚Äôve had more stretches of time to compare against. A 7 year old feels like a summer lasts a lifetime because they haven‚Äôt experience many summers yet. 

While that may be true I think the reason time goes by so fast is because of work. Toiling day in and day out waiting for the weekend. Waiting for the major holiday. Waiting for another vacation. You blink and before you know it another year is gone. I go back to work tomorrow after taking 9 days off and I didn‚Äôt want to go back 72 hours ago. It feels like I just barely had enough time to let my hair down for once and have freedom. It was just enough time to put the house back in order and feel okay with that, but I didn‚Äôt spend much time on hobbies. Just recuperating or trying to. 

I‚Äôm privileged. I have a relatively good job with some minor flaws. I make enough money to be comfortable (pay rent, pay car payment, pay utilities, pay groceries, etc) but little left over and barely save. I‚Äôve got medical bills up the wazoo I‚Äôm trying to pay off and each month I wonder where my money goes. But I‚Äôm housed, clothed, and fed.

695,Any other 18-19 year olds dreading entering the workforce,"19 m. Right now I‚Äôm a full time student and I live with my parents and I don‚Äôt have a job. I have a scholarship that pays for most of my school. Ever since I was a kid my mom always drilled the idea into my head that I better enjoy life now as a kid because your gonna hate it when your older. 

My degree is in a field I don‚Äôt give a shit about but before I could realize I didn‚Äôt give a shit about it I was almost done with it. I graduate this summer with a useless bachelors in Psychology and no motivation to find a job. I have no knowledge about Psychology even though it‚Äôs my major, I pretty much just googled my way through college and still made good grades. My mom said that I have to start looking for a full time job the day I graduate from college. I‚Äôm very fortunate for this because most parents make their kids do this straight out of high school.

Now this brings me back to where I‚Äôm at now a socially anxious, awkward 19 year old with a useless degree and no drive to ‚Äúbe a working man‚Äù and spend 8-12 hours a day working a job I know I‚Äôm going to hate. I hate my life bad enough as it is right now I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm gonna cope with a shitty job on top of that. Due to my social anxiety I know I‚Äôm gonna end up letting bosses and managers walk all over me and make me overwork myself for nothing.

I have such dread about my upcoming work life in a few months that I can‚Äôt even enjoy the present. I can‚Äôt let myself relax and play video games or work on my YouTube videos or practice music production which are my hobbies.  I lose sleep overnight thinking about getting a awful job that I‚Äôm too afraid to quit and letting my 20‚Äôs go by with nothing eventful ever happening.

Sorry to ramble on about my personal life but I had to document these thoughts because I just feel so alone in this mindset. Everyone around me had this ‚Äúmacho man‚Äù must work 80 hours per week at the coal mines mindset and it‚Äôs driving me crazy and everyone in my life makes me feel like a piece of shit for actually wanting to enjoy my youth instead of wasting away at an office.

I know work is an necessary evil and I understand I am being a financial burden to my parents by still living under their roof at 19-20, but i just wish things were different and not so corporate minded out there.

For some background I am still pretty fresh out of college with a year of white collar work experience under my belt. Now I‚Äôm pretty proficient at my job, I meet deadlines and take on extra work even when I don‚Äôt have to.

I just had my first ever yearly performance review and I got graded as medium, which basically means average. To me it sounds like in order to be rated at‚Äù high performance‚Äù you basically have to clock in 20 hours of unpaid overtime and the company takes all of the surplus value for themselves.

703,Is most software development work a massive waste of time?,"Past year or so, it seems like most work I have been doing is just satisfying someone‚Äôs whim instead of creating something valuable (or creating anything at all).

I spent over a month making an application compliant with BigTech‚Äôs policy, implementing features that will not be used by the company nor any of the users. No one benefits from this effort other than some middle manager at BigTech that gets off on ‚Äúfeature adoption‚Äù metrics.

My current project is to implement functionality X on a mobile app. This functionality X already exists on the website and works OK through the browser, so I am being asked to reinvent the wheel just for the sake of it being on a mobile platform (it‚Äôs not even using any mobile features such as phone, camera or GPS, functionally, it works the exact same way)

Last year, after developers spent several months on 3 different projects, management scrapped all of those projects. Team lead would throw out and rewrite other developers‚Äô code if it did not fit his preference or ‚Äústyle‚Äù. Meetings were spent fudging numbers to satisfy metrics and finding work to ‚Äúkeep everyone busy‚Äù.

So, quite a lot of time spent with no real results. All while being paid a rather high software developer salary. Part of me is OK with this, it‚Äôs good money. But also, i don‚Äôt feel good about this at all, especially since many of company‚Äôs clients are public entities like schools and libraries.

708,It takes a lot of work to create no work.,"tldr; activism requires work

I hate work. I absolutely hate it. The idea that we *must* sell our bodies for a fixed amount of hours per week, set by people who have been dead longer than I've been alive, is an absolutely disgusting concept to begin. Even worse, the system that was meant to be ended up even worse than when implemented primarily due to lack of raising min wages for the last decade for people.

I live in the USA. A very capitalistic society. If I was born rich -- with capital -- I'd be set. Zero work required for a boatload of income. Actually, it's not even considered ""income"" when the investments are older than a year [capital gains] -- which being born into wealth, all the investment would be older than a year.

There's a reason why capital gains taxation rates are separate from income tax -- because it benefits the rich. 0% taxation rate for the first $40,000 (single filer, $80k joint filing). That's enough money to live pretty easily (in a lower cost of living area) without lifting a single finger -- just cashing out *profits* from previous investments and paying the federal government **ZERO** in taxes.

Anti-work exists. It just exists for those *with* everything.

---

With that in mind, to summarize the system is rigged *for* those that have, and rigged **against** those who do not have.  The problem is where many people **think** they have, but they do not. Or even worse, those who **believe** they will *eventually* have.

President Lyndon B. Johnson once said, ""If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you.""

I believe that plays true today, rather it be based upon wealth, race, class, sex, gender. A scapegoat to hate to be 'better' than, to feel superior to another to feel better about themselves; to feel 'lucky' that they're not the ones worse off.

---

USA is a democracy. Those who *have* are absolutely outnumbered by those that do not have.

An individual is limited on how many seats they can occupy and the system is set to where no single individual seat has the authority to change the entire system. No individual person has the unilaterally authority to force progress on this specific issue (regardless of what the mass media implies when it comes to Presidential powers).

Going back to my title, it takes a lot of work to create no work. We can only force the changes together. With a supermajority of any parliament, rather it be US Congress, state assemblies, local councils, associations (such as state BAR (legal), unions, hell, even Parent-Teacher Association); anything is possible.

When like minded folks start to occupy these seats, we can make real change. In Germany, auto unions have been able to get a [28 hour work week](https://www.businessinsider.com/german-workers-can-now-work-a-28-hour-week-2018-2).

If majority the of members on a city or village council held antiwork ideologies, they'd be able to set all local government employee work weeks to 20 or 30 hours if they desired. Local change made within the communities they live; while it's not solving 100% of the problem, it's solving part of the problem.

If the antiwork individuals were to run and occupy local school board, board of education seats, and similar; they'd be able to set 30 hour long class weeks to create shorter school weeks for teachers and perhaps even students.

There's a lot of change that can be made at any level of organization, but it takes work and effort to become members of these associations -- to engage in these activities -- to become active.",False,lnnlb0,redingerforcongress,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lnnlb0/it_takes_a_lot_of_work_to_create_no_work/,0,1

729,Crisis Capitalism job is eating my soul,"I'm one of the millions that was out of power in Texas. I spent the last week in a freezing house, melting/boiling snow over a fire for ""potable"" (ha ha!) water. The state has notified us that tap water isn't safe. Also, doing super-fun *completely normal America* things, like toting water up from the local lake in buckets so I can flush my toilet.

On the very first day -- when I didn't even have cell service to get this fucking email -- the owner sends out a demand that we IMMEDIATELY create marketing campaigns to target other people in the same situation, so he can profit from it. He gives us 48 hours to do it.

This guy then follows that up with a flurry of emails demanding to know why nobody is answering the phones. He has to be told that's because there are only 2 people (out of hundreds) who have phones/electricity/21st century. 

He is obviously pissed off, and keeps pushing everyone... but he doesn't pick up a phone himself, of course. He does, however, have time to give us detailed descriptions of the commercials he wants us to do... none of which are feasible to do in 48 hours with one person working on it (there's only one person in the department who has the magic trinity of phone/electric/water).

I still don't have water (yup, still toting buckets to poop!), but I have power, so that means I'm ""safe enough"" to work. I immediately had to pull a 24 hour shift to get this campaign turned around, so he can profit off of this tragedy.

When I told him that this was my condition, I got a ""Sorry to hear that!"" That was it. No offer to help, no understanding, just ""sorry!"" My direct boss, who is a decent human trying to get by in this shit too, immediately offered to help me personally at his own expense. 

Thank god, because I really need it (he offered a place for me to shower). But, that somehow made it worse.

Understand: the owner of this company is very wealthy, has multiple homes staffed with people who do things for him, and he spends the majority of his time out of state (because Texas sucks). So, he does not have to live here and deal with this.  He just wanted to know the campaign would be done so he can capitalize on this crisis before someone else does.

After having to put together a campaign that promises that our company will help people in the same boat I'm in, my soul is now a tiny black speck of despair.

Despair, because it's just goddamn awful to make a splashy campaign promising people that they are going to get help from a company that it won't offer to help its own employees... not because it can't, but because it never occurred to the owner to do it.

746,My job wants be to work tomorrow during snowy conditions I‚Äôve never had to work with.,"So, to give some back story. I live in the North Texas region and it‚Äôs been snowing and icing for the past couple of days. It‚Äôs snowed before in Texas but, it‚Äôs never been this cold for this long since as long as I‚Äôve lived here (since I was 2, I‚Äôm now 27) and it‚Äôs definitely never been this bad . I‚Äôm a person who doesn‚Äôt do well in cold weather (I might hypothyroidism since I get cold so easily and have other symptoms) and I‚Äôm incredibly worried something might go wrong, a couple of days ago there was a crash that happened on a major highway that killed 9 people but, had 133 cars crash into each other and the weather wasn‚Äôt as bad as it is now. My boyfriend had his water pipes burst in his apartment and one of my co-workers had the same issue with their house. Certain people in Dallas have suffered power outages for hours. My house goes in and out of power and the pipes are frozen in our kitchen (closes to the outside). My job has been closed for the passed two days the commute for my original place is about 30 mins usually driving 40-50 mph. It‚Äôs an essential job (not a grocery store but, still apart of infrastructure), since it‚Äôs a corporate job they don‚Äôt like to be closed for very long. Higher management wants to open up some locations up and asked people how live near these locations to volunteer to work tomorrow, which to my luck I happen to live close to one of the locations. There‚Äôs still ice on the road I don‚Äôt like the idea of driving on ice, I also have to drive up hill to get there and I don‚Äôt feel comfortable doing that. I‚Äôve worked countless hours for this job when I didn‚Äôt need to, I‚Äôve gone above and beyond for this company but, this weather is where I draw the line. I‚Äôm not even supposed to be scheduled tomorrow. They don‚Äôt mention hazardous pay or paid extra for people who would do this. I know I might sound whiny but, it‚Äôs unfair that I have to work so hard while most people stay home where it‚Äôs usually safe. I joined this sub because I‚Äôve never liked the way company‚Äôs will even put the risk of something bad happen to their employees just so they can make money from it.

When I‚Äôm out there, I love to work, I love walking 15 miles in a day with a 70 lb pack, love to set up camp, build fire, shelter, labor over a delicious meal for my hiking group. It‚Äôs the most basal form of  human survival. If you get lazy out there, you freeze to death, or starve, or get your face torn off by a bear. 

All this to say, I don‚Äôt think most of us are against work. It‚Äôs just that the modern conditions has , for many of us, alienated us from that primal desire to work and contribute to the survival of the ‚Äú tribe‚Äù. A lot of the cynicism is justified, wage labor is usually not contributing anything to our collective survival, merely contributing more excess to the fat cats at the top. Most work does not feel like it‚Äôs actually urgent or necessary in any way. ( those people that say they just want to lay in bed all day and get high, you people have an issue) 

This is the cope: until our system is changed in a drastic way, this menial bullshit work is in fact necessary to your personal survival, as much as it sucks.

I took welding as a skill , just to end in a production plant where they just need production and I didn't expect that.  So been working for almost 8 months. I have been kinda slacking as am just mentally tired of production and doin same thing over and over and my supervisor been pushing me lately to get the target numbers and go beyond that. And been comparing me with people who want to impress the company by making more numbers than target. So last week I was given a short termination (suspension) for not giving them the target.  And today I was really not in mood to work I felt am just wasting 8 hrs of my life doing something over and over again and again for some reason I just can't do it. So production manager gave me a warning etc. Well you know am not a fucking property he owns me for 8 hrs I talked back I said "" why don't you do it, or why don't you tell your son or your daughter or your wife to come and start working as a labor and make those target numbers"" he got furious and said ""you can't speak like that to me"", then I was like ""ok how much profit did company make ? Can I know, can I know how much profit I made for the company and if you guys are paying me with that"". 

That's it I got kicked out.. given a termination letter for bad behaviour etc. 

I was just thinking what I said like would he make his son or daughter work as a labour ? Like these guys push us to do so much work but will they do that to their own family ? Will they even be labour?

761,Exploitation: An Antiwork Math Class,"What is exploitation?  It is not just the conditions of laborers in the developing world, it is merely the utilization of a resource in more and more expansive ways.  Oil is exploited as fuel, silicon is exploited as computer components, and humans are exploited as labor.

The simplest exploitation of people as a resource under capitalism is profit.  Imagine you are in a simple fast food chain where you are the only employee.  You work for a wage to produce hamburgers which your boss sells for a profit.  This simple exchange is exploitative, since by the nature of it you are adding a certain amount of value to a product but only receiving a percentage of that value back as a wage.

You may be okay with this relationship.  Although you are not able to retain all of the value you add to the hamburger, your job offers you a certain amount of stability.  You would not, after all, be able to create the hamburger without the resources your capitalists owns, their industry connections also may provide you with a certain piece of mind that your job is more secure than it would be if you were managing the resources needed to produce the hamburger on your own.  This is exploitative, but it is not that bad.

One day your boss hires a second worker and installs a drive thru window.  You don't think much of it, having an extra pair of hands is helpful, and the extra business makes you feel like your job is more secure.  Conservatively, the job can handle 2x the business now, and both you and your coworker are 2x more efficient than you were on your own.  However, your pay does not increase.  You are doing the same work (at a more efficient rate) and putting out twice the value, and your boss offers you, as the senior employee, a healthy 10% raise.

However, this is already getting screwy, because you are now working twice as hard but getting an even smaller portion of what you are creating despite your raise.  The boss hires another two workers with the profits in the business and now the restaurant, and each worker with it, is able to put out 4x of what you, as an individual, were originally creating.  You, individually are given another 10% raise.  You are now working 4x harder for 1.2x the pay.


And this can be extrapolated out into the entire working class.  This is basically the math behind that commonly shared [""wages stagnation"" graph](https://aflcio.org/sites/default/files/migrate/files/Five-Causes-of-Wage-Stagnation-in-the-United-States.jpg) .  Every year the capotalist class is able to double or triple the amount of resources and money they are under control, while we (in comparison) are given a smaller and smaller share.

This doesn't stop at wages either.  Employers used to include a decent amount of job training, even for basic things like professional writing.  These days?  They don't have to do that, you pay for it now with your higher education, saving them money on the clock for when they train you.  The pandemic is another example.  Can't stop the growth of businesses, so instead we'll force nurses and other healthcare workers to work 5x harder so we don't have to close anything.

Exploitation makes it a mathematical certainty that the rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer.  Unless you are doubling or tripling your income and resource acquisition, you aren't even keeping up pace, so save your fantasies of ""escaping the system by working inside of it"" if you still have any.

790,"Punishing or giving ""points"" for calling in sick is archaic and needs to go away already.","I could literally write 10 pages on this, but I will keep it brief as possible. It's something that really gets under my skin.

Why do we supposedly punish employees for calling in sick, or give them points? Ask any business, and their response 99% of the time will be ""so people are encouraged to come to work and not staying home all the time"".

This has to be the most dumb as fuck argument ever. 

For starters, if you completely got rid of the punishment, points, or any negativity ***AT ALL*** for calling in sick, I doubt very few would abuse this.

Why? Because people need money. Employers seem to think without points or other systems for calling in sick, people would just call in all the time. 

**Bull.Shit.** 

The point of a job is to work for money to pay you rent, car payment, bills, etc. The only people who MIGHT be breaking the rules is either teens living at home and thus little or no bills, or people who are so filthy rich, they work ""out of boredom"". (yes, these people exist)

So if someone is fired, they make no money. If someone stays home ""playing hooky"", then they aren't making money either. 

It also is a highly discriminatory practice. Some people have poor immune systems and thus get sick more more often than others. I've seen people rarely get a cold or flu.

People also have chronic illnesses and managing that while being berated at work for being ""sick too much"" only adds stress which is highly unhealthy for someone already in that position. 

I can't help if I'm sick. I do not make myself purposely sick or go around licking doorknobs. 

**WHY THE FUCK SHOULD I BE PUNISHED FOR THIS?!?!**

In what fucking world does that make sense? 

On top of this, if people were not goaded, guilt tripped or had their job and financial security dangled in front of them like a god damn carrot, I surmise many people would actually get LESS SICK, as I've observed all too often people coming to work sick.

ESPECIALLY when companies give out awards and other bullshit for ""perfect attendance"" or adjust your bonuses if you miss any days.

I'm currently at the precipice of losing my job for calling in to much. I have a myriad of health issues. Sleep Apnea, ADHD, Chronic Fatigue, Chronic Pain, etc.

Some nights I get 1 hour or no sleep. 

Work would think it would be better if I drove into work on no sleep and risk crashing into a car and killing myself and possibly others then take the day off.",False,ln2qws,_Raspootin_,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ln2qws/punishing_or_giving_points_for_calling_in_sick_is/,13,1

794,"Planning to quit my job, advice and input needed","Sorry if formatting is weird I‚Äôm on mobile. 


I‚Äôve decided that I‚Äôm going to quit my current role and just be jobless until after I finish my Masters degree in May. I‚Äôm in a pretty significant transitional period with my career and I‚Äôm honestly just burnt out with my current role. I work in human services with children with disabilities. It‚Äôs rewarding work but it never ends. There is no clear end of the work day or start of the next. It‚Äôs constant, ongoing decision making for others who need you and I‚Äôm exhausted honestly. I can‚Äôt even focus on my own family and my own home because I‚Äôm constantly making decisions for others and being needed. I work from home, client files are kept at home, and the line between work and life is so blurred it really doesn‚Äôt exist. I‚Äôve contemplated suicide just to end this feeling. I‚Äôm out of that space but I still need a solution. Not to mention I‚Äôm in graduate school online, full time. 

So now I‚Äôm thinking if I quit this job at the beginning or middle of April, I‚Äôll have about a month off to finish up school and just do... nothing. My field is in pretty high demand and I think I could easily secure a job in about a month or so when I start looking. I just need a break. If my partner and I keep our typical spending habits and nothing catastrophic happens, we would need less than half of what is currently in my savings account for me to not work April-June, we could also probably be more conservative with our spending and I‚Äôd be saving so much on gas and car maintenance (I currently drive about 350 miles a week to client homes). If our tax returns come on time, we wouldn‚Äôt even need to touch my savings. Then, ideally, I can find a contract position that pays enough for me to only need to work part time. 

Is this plan reasonable? My partner is supportive but I think he‚Äôs just being nice because I am on the verge of breaking and he doesn‚Äôt want to push me over by challenging this. I don‚Äôt want to end up homeless. We have a ton of family nearby that I could lean on. Worst case scenario we‚Äôd move in with my parents if I can‚Äôt find a job. I feel like this is my only option right now. 

I need a break or this is going to kill me. I‚Äôm burnt out, I have decision fatigue and it‚Äôs driving me into compassion fatigue, which is a death sentence for the field I‚Äôm in. I get anxious when my phone rings or buzzes with a call/text/email. I‚Äôm currently avoiding getting ready for my next client. I‚Äôm not built to do this every day. I know I need a break before I move into a more senior role.

yacht. They work hard and they are disciplined with their money and since they save it
and don't spend it, that's how a lot of people can become millionaires even without
having a six figure salary.

Of the goal is for poor people to not be poor and to gain wealth, then it needs to start with
their own spending habits, like not buying food at McDonalds. His isn't making their
situation worse, you can eat healthy at low cost if you don't eat out all the time. There are
also food banks that the poor have access to if it helps them save money to pay off debts
and things like that.

Of you want to stop feeling sorry for yourself you need to change your own life with some
discipline. The vast majority of poor people do not have budget and they don't actively
save every penny for emergencies and to pay off debt. Of you can point me to a poor
person who does all the finally responsible things and is still poor, maybe that is a
discussion for charitable things but the truth is that you can't help someone who isn't
willing to put on the effort to help themselves. He can't keep giving men fish who are
unwilling to fish themselves and that's what the welfare state has been doing, or at least,
giving them money has made them lose incentive to make money because they would
lose the free money otherwise. It's sad when people make more money on
unemployment than they would if they simply worked even a minimum wage job.

833,Many posts here revolve around the theme of hating on work. I hate work as much as you but we need to start asking the important questions - and start taking actions.,"Content on this sub should focus on ""How do we lead a work free life?"" or at the very least ""How do we lead a life in which work does not play a significant role in?""

And no, I am not talking about huge revolutionary cultural changes on a national or global level - I have long given up on that. Greed will always win the hearts of the majority of people - that's the driving motivation for many of the people in power, so things will never change.

I am talking about how we, as individuals, can lead a work free life, or something as close to as a work free life. This sub should be us - the community, fostering and cultivating that vision; by helping each other lead a work free life.

So I will start - has anyone figured out how to do this yet? Please share your valuable knowledge and leave your advice in the comments down below!

841,My Pandemic Workplace Meltdown,"This is just a vent / rant meant to get this off my chest. I made this account to post here after lurking for a while. Writing this at work because my employer doesn't deserve any better.
The pandemic has absolutely ruined my perception of my workplace. For context, I work for a small business that employs a handful of people (maybe 10-20). I actually know the owner. For the most part I enjoyed working here, the coworkers are nice and not too uptight. Of course, heading into the pandemic the owner sat all of us down and gave us the classic ""we have to be a team and help each other out"" speech. I reel every time I think of it and how little help anyone here has gotten. Everyone since then aside from myself and one coworker (who take care of the actual day to day tasks) had been reduced to half the amount of hours they used to work and some were let go entirely. Did I received hazard pay for showing up to work? No. But at least they will give me the dollar raise I requested to help me stay afloat right? Nope, not in the budget. But I know the budget isn't as tight as the owner claims. How do I know this? Well apparently it's still in the budget to continue to send their kids to European private schools. Apparently it's still in the budget to take frequent international flights. Apparently having 3+ antique furnished houses in different states is still in the budget. Meanwhile unemployment benefits for my coworkers is near an end and there is no talk of returning people to full time. 
So as a consequence of this pandemic I have learned that ""work as a team and help each other"" means that I have more responsibilities, less help, and stagnant pay, while my bosses life is,, exactly the same. What's the cherry on top of it? I now question why I had a manager at all. Clearly if I take care of the daily operations and my manager isn't required full time because I take care of the responsibilities here, then I don't need someone to tell me what to do. Yet I don't get help or pay to match. What's worse is that the nepotism in this company is rampant. One of my coworkers is the bosses relative. This relative is not a manager, just a coworker. However they feel the need to report to the owner that somehow my one other full time worker and I don't work hard enough (despite us working harder than ever now). So on top of all my other grievances, I have been putting up with slander. At this point, why don't I just find another job? There's so many possibilities around. Which reprehensible corporation do I want to work for? Amazon? Walmart? Grub Hub? Doordash? Ooooh! What about one of the many other small business around? Ah, of course, they don't cover the cost of rent! Silly me, guess I'll just bootstraps myself until something comes along. I hate this all so much, watching my coworkers struggle while the owner walks around as if nothing is happening. I guess this end my rant, sorry for the long post and probably bad format. Hope everyone else is sticking it to their boss somehow

843,Thinking about quitting my job but I'm nervous.,"Warning, this is basically just a rant, I'm sorry. I'm just looking for validation I think. I don't know.
I've been at my job for a bit over 8 months and it is my first real job. I'm 19 and in college as well. When I first started I was full time in college with 5 classes. A combination of online classes and work not listening to me needing less hours resulted in me dropping 4 out of my 5 classes. When I first started we had 7 employees if you include me, now we have 4. I am now only taking 2 classes but I keep asking for 20-25 hours. My manager will put me on the schedule for that originally, but then scratch out my hours and tack more on without telling me. This results in me working 28-35 hours a week. I enjoy the money but it's affecting my mental health very severely and I often cry in the cooler at work when I'm alone. I also work nights now, I never ever wanted to be the person to close the cafe. Never. I've been doing it alone for nearly 3 months now ever since the new manager came. Not only this but she constantly talks shit about me behind my back even though others have said I'm the hardest worker there. I get out of work at midnight most nights and this combined with my depression causes me to sleep around 9-10 hours a night and limits the time I can study or even relax. Even getting a concussion a week ago was not enough to get less hours, my manager added even more actually and then called off her own shifts twice in a week but guilt tripped me the two times I've called off in the 5 months she's been there. I hate her, I do not mind my job one bit when I'm working with coworkers and not alone. I work 7 hour shifts alone often and it stresses me out beyond belief. I have to cook all of the orders that come in, prep, put away truck all by myself on days it comes, clean, make the 200 donuts we make every night, and clean the store all by myself almost every night. I want to quit but only working somewhere for 8 months looks bad on a resume and the anxiety of finding a new job also makes me feel sick. I like the comfort of knowing how to do my job and my family would be incredibly disappointed in me for quitting. Plus, I have an apartment with my boyfriend who also has a part time job and it would be so unfair of me to quit. I hate my life so much and the only good thing about working so much is that I'm so stressed about my job and such that I can't even worry too much about killing myself or my mental health. Another thing I'm worried about is that since it's my first job that I must be blowing this out of proportion and that everywhere is like this. People have said ""at least you're not at a factory"". I just feel so worthless at my job and I feel like it's not worth the $8.25 an hour I make. It feels unfair that my manager make more than double the amount I make even though she works less and calls off more. I just hate my life so much and I think quitting would only make me feel more hopeless and starting a new job is too stressful and scary. I just wish I could exist without working. I want time to make art and do crafts without people pressuring me to do it for a career or to sell my art.

A lot of people lost power, and our water isn‚Äôt even safe to drink right now. I am 21 and I haven‚Äôt seen snow since I got my drivers licence. I‚Äôve called in the past 4 days, since the beginning of the snowstorm. I have a small car and Im terrified of driving in snow. Obviously I would not do this if I was a CNA or a nurse, but everything will be fine without me there and I texted my boss and offered to do what I can from home. He never texted me back and no one has reached out to me at all. I just checked the Facebook page and it seems like everyone is there except me and I just feel so panicked and guilty. I‚Äôm scared they‚Äôll be mad at me when I go back and I‚Äôll be in trouble or that they‚Äôll fire me. I think I‚Äôm a good employee, and I plan to quit soon anyway, but I hate confrontation and just the thought that they might be mad at me when I go back scares me. But also, I think it‚Äôs ridiculous that I have to be worried about this and that so many employers around here are making people come in despite the weather conditions.

Thankfully, I finally got power back today and unfortunately had to get back online for my job. With our two main offices in CA and TX, I half expected some message from our CEO or upper management making sure the TX employees were doing ok. Nope. In fact, I came in to messages and unreasonable requests about projects being behind schedule. Do they not watch the news? Or do these people in upper management positions really lack empathy that much? Or is it that they simply not get it? Even some weirdos in the texas office straight up asked me for stuff without asking how I was doing... Like I legitimately want to know that they and their family are ok, but do they seriously only care about pointless work?

849,It‚Äôs Okay To Be Angry,"I have a lot of people come at me, sometimes in person, but especially online, say that me getting mad at managers and owners is only because I‚Äôm envious and want what they have.

Nothing could be further from the truth. I‚Äôm angry at the injustice of a global economic system that forces people to participate in laboring for others against their will just to obtain the barest necessities of life, (and oftentimes not even that).

I‚Äôm not envious of the workaholic bosses who have sorry excuses for relationships with other people and rub it in others faces. I‚Äôm even less envious of leeches like Jeff Bezos who work a few hours a day, and still sleep like a baby while knowingly pushing workers to inhumane limits. No thanks, I‚Äôll maintain my dignity against all the incentives the system throws our way to sell each other out for a little more cheddar.

It‚Äôs okay to be angry about all this; a lack of anger probably means you‚Äôre one of the people profiteering off this fucked up system. Even if it‚Äôs commonly perceived as a ‚Äúnegative‚Äù emotion, our anger is different from their selfish gaslighting. 

Our anger can lead to bonds being formed, first in mutual passion against something, then out of love and respect for one another and our positions in society. All their sneering does is leave them alone to sit on a pile of money. OUR money, off OUR work.

864,My Work Experience,"I recently started a new job for a company in a low cost of living state making 'items' (intentionally being vague for several reasons). My previous employment includes an engineer role at a major corporation.

I am paid $12.00 an hour with no benefits (yet). I work 10 hour days every day. There are 10 of us on a single 'item' and other teams working on different lines for different products but the 10 of us make up our entire production for that product/'item'.

These items sell for approximately $50.00 each and we produce about 6-7 of them per minute, for 10 hours each day. That means that in the first two minutes of I have paid for my hour worth of labor. (Or in the first 20 minutes I have paid for my entire 10 hour days salary cost with my labor alone)

These items are also very inexpensive to make and don't require any expensive equipment you couldn't afford to put in your home garage. They purchase wires, glue and the other stuff in bulk and very very cheaply.

In the break room there are several anti-union posters and we live in a right to work state anyways so they are doubling down there. They also placed all of the losses on a bulletin in the middle of the room that shows how much we lost to warranty and several external issues. 

It annoys me so much that people see the 0.36% of items were warrantied and cost us $80,000.00 dollars and go 'wow we need to work harder to make up that money, I only make 24k per month and that is 4x my annual salary, yikes' (slightly edited real conversation I overheard, edited with the 24k part) instead of realizing that 0.36% is out of 99.64% of items that made it and produced a massive profit for the semi-quarter (2 months)

The product we make is a requirement under OSHA as well. There are no demand or outlook issues. This company has us working like slave labor, while criticizing us for 0.36% and telling us unions are evil and will steal our rightfully earned peanuts.

866,"I've never had employment/income, and don't know what to do with my life. [VENT]","To start off, I apologize if I come across as childish or lazy. The best I can do is speak honestly and genuinely, and hope that my intent doesn't get lost in the process. I know that most of you have had or currently have jobs to make a living that you're unhappy with, and I'm aware that for me to be in my current position relies on some amount of privilege. I in no way intend to imply that I'm any more worse off than anybody else here, and I think it's impressive that some of you guys are managing to earn a decent wage despite being unhappy- imo it takes a lot of strength to maintain a livelihood that you're unhappy with to such an extent, even if it's not particularly ""good"". 

I (26F) have more or less just lived off my dad my whole life (minus 3 years spent with an abusive ex boyfriend), after dropping out of high school and never going back for a GED. As a child, I never really had a career aspiration I genuinely cared about past the surface level. There's many reasons I've ended up doing so little at my age, but a lot of it can be blanketed under two main reasons. 

1) I have struggled with mental illness as far back as I can remember;
- Diagnosed but untreated depression/anxiety combo, present since teen years.
- Potentially undiagnosed ADHD.
- Low stress tolerance my entire life.
- Dissociation, selective mutism, and freeze response (rather than fight/flight) is my typical reaction to a high pressure situation.
- Something similar to agoraphobia? (I don't really have hyperventilating panic attacks, refer to above point) 
- Shy, nonconfrontational personality, and only competitive with specific interests. 
- Family history of anxiety, depression, and paranoia. 
- Mentally ill but untreated parents, who didn't teach me responsibility or independence.
- Trauma from abusive past relationships + childhood trauma (parental divorce, emotional neglect, alcoholic father) 
- Have never really felt safe and stable, I don't know what that's like. 

2) I don't feel motivated to have a job because;
- To be employed means filling a job slot somebody else may have wanted/needed more, and I have never wanted to get in anybodies way.
- Most employment opportunities that would potentially be available to someone in my position wouldn't pay enough to be worth it.
- Careers that sound significant/meaningful to me in any sense are either poorly paid or require too much education/training that I wouldn't be able to get.
- I don't like interacting with people, doing repetitive tasks, high stress situations, or heavy responsibility, so I don't feel suited for any sort of work (that I know of). 

I do have some interests/hobbies that theoretically could build into a career, but I don't have the stress management skills needed to actually do so. I do digital illustration (sometimes watercolor), and I enjoy some areas of medicine (biology, psychology, some philosophy). On the art side, I have tried taking commissions several times, but as soon as money is involved I get anxious and start procrastinating, despite being able to whip out a fully colored piece within a day if it's a free request. I usually end up passing the deadline, then just doing the piece for free and apologizing. I also really struggle to find clients.

It sucks. I'm absolutely a curious person, I enjoy learning, I enjoy trying new things, and I enjoy keeping busy. I'm the type to go down a Google rabbithole and research a topic just because a question about it crossed my mind. I love giving people advice when I can, and have a lot of patience and a generally cool temper. That is to say, I know I have several very good traits. I know I'm relatively intelligent too, since I did well in school in subjects I enjoyed and across the board the semester before I dropped out (usually didn't do assignments or homework and got F's, but would still do well on tests). I really feel like I could thrive in the right environment, but it feels like there /isn't/ a right environment for somebody like me. It feels like the things I'm best at aren't seen as valuable enough to make my weak points insignificant. I wish employment in itself didn't seem to rely on people pleasing and 'professionalism'. Since childhood, I've always felt that sense that I don't belong in this society, and that I'm just not built for survival. I just feel so hopeless, like I'll never find a way to survive happily. 

Sorry that this came out so rambly, I'm not great at condensing/organizing my thoughts in a tidy way, though I have tried to revise the post several times for clarity and readability. I'll be happy to explain things or answer questions in the comments, should anybody want such. If any of you resonate with this, I'd be happy to hear how you've made progress overcoming similar hurdles in your own life. It's especially hard when caught in that loop of being too ill to work, but too poor and dependent on others to get help.",False,lm60nd,Blixtwix,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lm60nd/ive_never_had_employmentincome_and_dont_know_what/,10,1

@ Coming from a fellow a that worked
with you:
You have called out, you have used COVID
multiple amount of times when it started
and have called out because you had a
cough but you smoke a pack daily.
Leaving the store when blocked in is not
something you can do being the only shift
there, in charge. Does not matter if you told
a partner or not you have an obligation to
be there with your partners, making sure
they are okay and the store.
The sense of discomfort is what you have
made other partners feel on your shifts,
building them because they ""wouldn't stay
late for you"" , making comments towards
them that offended them calling a partner a
boy when she is clearly a woman,
questioning partner's sexuality, and saying
to them do as | say not as | do.
The list goes on.

886,No longer working from home.,"Just venting, our office is calling people back. The psycho in charge says they can't trust people to be working from home anymore. Really feeling like shit, gf broke up with me earlier this week, my stomach has been hurting all morning today. I don't miss being here at all, almost none of my work requires me to be here. I made one mistake, which was an honest one because I wasn't trained properly, but now I get to suffer because of it. 

Fucking tired of it, the only reason why I could stand this job was because we transitioned to working from home. The psychological abuse I have to endure from those in charge was something I could deal with at home. Now I'm back to spending 9-10 hours a day wasting my life away, getting yelled at for things out of my control, rather than doing 7-8 hours of work in peace and being done. Driving in traffic makes me want to die, dragging my ass out of bed and drinking coffee every morning ruins my guts. I can't stand this, this week has been fucking hell and I can't get a minute of peace to collect myself. I feel hazy and just lost.

On top of it I hate how they fucking ask how I feel about coming in to the office and if I have any concerns about covid.

900,Tired of applying for jobs,"I lost my job in the pandemic. I don't know if it will ever return because my industry disappeared overnight and i wasn't far enough in my career to call it established. 

The constant jumping through hoops to apply for jobs is ridiculous. Why do i have to make so many goddamn accounts for different websites just to be able to apply for a job I'm probably not getting??? Why do i have to do tests before even getting my application looked at?

When applying for jobs that only give you an email address to send your resume to, what the hell do you say?? Copy and pasting my cover letter as the main part of the email seems like it would be off putting. 

Trying to find a job is exhausting. It kills my confidence. I've been applying for things since last year. I have gotten a handful of interviews for the absolute most basic jobs yet i still haven't actually been hired. I feel very unemployable to be honest. My career was kind of niche but I at least write my cover letter and resume in a way that describes how my work experience applies to other types of jobs.",False,lmy67y,Canadabalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lmy67y/tired_of_applying_for_jobs/,2,1
901,A thank you to this sub,"I was fired from my job 7 weeks ago today in part thanks to this sub. 

I was working 45-50 hours a week for the last 7 managing a medium sized office. Yes I was getting paid decently well for my area but everything fell on my shoulders. It was as if I owned the business from a burden standpoint but didn‚Äôt get the perks of making millions of dollars. It wasn‚Äôt my business yet I felt like I could never escape work. I might have only worked 45-50 hours a week but my mind was on the job for at least another 15 hours planning things out. It was like I couldn‚Äôt get away from work. I was always thinking about the next thing that needed done because if it wasn‚Äôt done right it fell on me no matter who‚Äôs fault it was My weekends were never spent care free I was always concerned about what would need done the next Monday so that I could get though the week without even more work. Most of the other people that worked with me were barely making minimum wage and on assistants. while the owner worked less than 5 hours a week and spent a month in Europe ever year plus many other things.  He acted like we owed him something for being allowed to work there and him said he was doing the commodity a favor having his business here. While we were all paid a salary the potential commission were a joke compared to how much harder anyone would have to work. We‚Äôd get 5% of what he made off it and it isn‚Äôt like any other expenses he had to worry about. 

My previous employer was also very prideful in the fact that he had non competes in his employee contract. Last December I‚Äôd had enough, he refused to allow us to work remotely (I could do this job completely from my phone should I need to) and had a general belief the pandemic was a conspiracy theory. I started to formulated a plan that would allow me to smoothly transition to starting my own business doing the exact same thing. My employer always said we were ‚Äúfriends‚Äù and he said felt like I was a son to him. So believing we were friends I went to the owner with my proposal for me to leave in the coming months to start my own business while also not negatively impacting him or going after his clients and training a replacement. He practically spit in my face and said I had no morals for wanting to start my own company off of things I‚Äôd learned working for him. When he threw the non-compete in my face I simply handed him the law that prevented the non compete from being valid or binding. On the spot I was fired. 

Distraught and hurt I went home to tell my wife. Over the next few days while I worked to set up of my company my now ex employer sent me quite a few texts that ranged from him saying firing me was his best decision in years to I was risking my families well being and then finally he stated he would sue me. I filed for unemployment and even that he contested until I sent the state the text messages he‚Äôd sent to me.  It hasn‚Äôt been an easy or unstressful transition at times but I couldn‚Äôt be happier. The. biggest change is I no longer have the contestant and unrelenting cloud of stress and worry over my head about what needed done. The first two weeks after leaving my previous job I would lay in bed at night and start trying to plan everything that would need done for the next day or week until i‚Äôd realize I didn‚Äôt work there anymore. I get to work from my own home and not worry about things outside my control. I‚Äôm now working less than 30 hours a week and when I want to. There‚Äôs a lot less of that Sunday dread when I think about working on Monday. 
I‚Äôm not yet making half of what I made before but in a short time i should make significantly more then before while still being able to pay those I hire a good wage plus 75% of any commission.  As I plan things out I hope to only have my employees working 32 hours a week maximum while still being paid full time. 

Nothing is guaranteed but now that I have some time I just wanted to say thank you. While my thoughts have always aligned with those in this sub being on here really woke me up from the regular 9-5 grind and made me realize I was worth more and I needed a change. I was always worried about leaving the safety net of having a job but now I wish I‚Äôd have done it years ago. I hope that through my new business I show others the same.",False,lm0nug,thorkc,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lm0nug/a_thank_you_to_this_sub/,15,1

921,We did the impossible. Management still ironic about not being 100% on schedule.," Last 3 months were hell at my job. My managers without any technical or managerials skills discussed with a client (also without managerial or technical skills) about a complicated project. They presented us the project and demanded the final product on three months. My senior colleague who is in charge consulted with us and said its possible in five months. I was the most negative of the team and told him to ask for eight months, because of the pandemic and in order to get at least 5-6 months.   
Our director, who is a major asshole, when he heard my colleague asking for five months went off saying ""20 years in my career I never said something cannot be done"". So we got three months.  


Project starts and I have an assistive role and not a major one. Project employs 2 people from my team and another 3 people of a different. We were promised that we wouldnt be bothered by other managers or projects or for support stuff during development. Of course that never happened we had all at least one other project to support.   


One month down the project the client does a major change to specifications which results to another version of the project, version 2. The change is so big that I have to join the project in order to develop a whole subsystem. We start the preparations and two weeks later another major change in specifications happens that leads to version 3.   


Clients gave us an extra month and our managers accepted that. The project I undertook was 90% stuff I never worked on again.  


1 month later we have a semi functional version 1. Two and a half months later we have an functional version 2. Version 3 is an extension of version 2 and we never started it until we saw version 2 running and until we had the proper equipment.   


Management just went ape shit because version 3 was not ready yet. We did the 2/3 projects that would need at least 8 months to develop properly each, in 4 months. We were really proud as a team for what we accomplished yet management is being a dick.

924,"Care workers, social workers, nurses: Why are you anti-work?","I've seen a lot of posts here by people who work in offices, in the service industry, manual labor etc. I'm curious if there are more people like me here in the anti-work sphere, who work in what could be called a ""caring"" profession. Most of us choose these jobs because we enjoy helping people and because we feel our work is meaningful. At the same time, the work can be physically and mentally exhausting, working conditions are often shit... so my question is: Why are YOU anti-work? 


My own background is in social work and I have worked in several different group homes for people with mental/physical disabilities over the years.
I have found that even though I love what I do and I care deeply about my clients, I still hate work. I think the  pressure to join the workforce and be a functional adult  was what really made my depression and anxiety spiral out of control when I finished school. I'm almost thirty years old now and I still haven't adjusted to the pressure of work. My social anxiety makes it that I'm terrified of conflict and I'm scared to make any kind of mistake at work because I'm so scared of my co-workers thinking badly of me. It consumes me, and I can't switch off after my shift is over. 

I like working with the clients and I feel like I'm doing something meaningful. But everything around it: the employer/employee-relationship, the stupid in-fighting and gossiping in teams of co-workers, the time constraints... It all sucks. I never take a break at work (maybe one or two quick smoke breaks a shift), the rest of the time I'm on my feet, trying to finish my list of tasks. I almost never finish on time. Almost nobody finishes on time... I would claim that it's impossible to finish on time if you actually do your work properly. 
Its exhausting... being so directly responsible for the well-being of other humans and being so under-staffed that you will never have enough time in your shift to actually give every client the attention they need.",False,lmr03n,terminalyoungthing,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lmr03n/care_workers_social_workers_nurses_why_are_you/,9,1

927,I‚Äôm not depressed but I seriously would rather die than waste the rest of my life doing what I‚Äôm doing right now (badly need advice),"So I started a new job in my field today and I came to this realization:

After all the time, effort, and money it took to get my degree and get to this point, I‚Äôve realized that I hate my pointless career choice and it feels like nothing more than a complete waste of my life.

Quickly, I‚Äôd like to explain how I got here though:

All my childhood, up through high school, I felt motivated to be a high achiever. I always got straights A‚Äôs. I was on sports teams, in a bunch of school clubs, etc. For whatever reason, I felt purpose and enjoyed being a high achiever. I graduated near the top of my class and though I wasn‚Äôt necessarily always happy (starting around 11 when my parents split, we moved, etc) but I was doing pretty well.

Then, when I got to college, everything changed. I went through a few phases of pretty deep depression. My anxiety and OCD worsened as well and a lot of my time was filled with simply feeling a decent level of pain and anguish. It was difficult and I felt like quitting a lot but eventually I got through it. It took me about twice as long as everyone else (8 years) due to a combination of not knowing what I wanted to do my first two years, my mental issues, and simply struggling to adjust to the speed and difficulty of college classes. But in the end, I got through it and got my Accounting degree, with a good GPA (granted with many drops/audits), from a good school.

So everything seemed great but for some reason I just had little motivation to find an accounting job. I don‚Äôt know why but I just felt more comfortable at my menial, fast food job, with a few good friends. Sure, the restaurant was horribly run, they had me on the night shift, I worked 40-45 hours a week, and I traveled about an hour there and an hour back every day but that just seemed okay and I didn‚Äôt really want to leave. I was well liked, got a bit of OT, and I did really well handling customers and honing my customer service skills. 

Living with my mom again, however, she forced me to get an accounting job. So I applied and got one pretty easily for last tax season (Jan-April 2020). The job was okay but it was often boring and tedious. I once again traveled an hour each way a day and worked 40+ hours. I did fine but it just wasn‚Äôt appealing. I was also always tired, being that I only got a few hours of sleep a night (I‚Äôm a night owl, who hates mornings; I will legit stay up until the sun rises and sleep into the afternoon, if I can). I had hoped they would keep me on once tax season ended but, due to the pandemic and the fact that they didn‚Äôt have enough work after tax season ended, I was let go.

So, over the next ten months, until today, I was unemployed and I finally felt truly happy and fulfilled. To some that might sound crazy (I‚Äôm 27 and I was unemployed living with my mom) but to me it was such a refreshing time. I felt free and got to learn about myself, educate myself on what I wanted to learn about, spend time on hobbies, and work toward the things I was passionate about. Most of my friends are also online, so I got to talk to them and play games online with them a lot and just relax, having much less stress and feeling content. Truly, those 10 months felt like actually living. They felt meaningful. And hell, the craziest part is that ordinarily those 10 months would have seemed horrible (and there were small periods of times when they were). For example, the two worst things in my life happened: I lost my dog and my grandfather, both whom I loved dearly. There were some very difficult days but thanks to overcoming my depression in the past, I was able to continue moving forward and was able to regain my happiness (honestly, I feel like beating truly dark depression and being able to move forward no matter what comes at me is my biggest triumph).

But now I have a job again and I hate everything about it. I hate getting up so early to go in. I hate going in and being around strangers. I hate having to feel ‚Äúon‚Äù for people. I hate the stress and time pressure that I am/will be put under. I hate feeling judged for my germaphobia (which has only been amplified thanks to the pandemic, even though I don‚Äôt even fear Covid that much) and other small quirks. Frankly, I hate it all. I‚Äôm the type of person who needs a pretty significant amount of alone time and when I work, I obviously am unable to have it... Though it‚Äôs obviously much different around family, friends, etc, even being around them too long takes its toll on me a bit...

I simply like my alone time. I don‚Äôt need much at all. Just the basics and maybe a computer with a few friends to talk to and play games with. That‚Äôs my dream lol. Not working or working very little, having a modest lifestyle, and having a lot of free and alone time to do what I want as I choose. Do I enjoy going out and doing things? Do I enjoy trips? Do I enjoy visiting family, watching sports games, shows together, etc? Absolutely! But if I‚Äôm working a lot of hours, I simply don‚Äôt want to do very much of that. I go crazy without my down time lol.

I used to think I wanted to get married, have children, etc but I don‚Äôt think I do anymore. Maybe if I found a woman who feels similarly to me but as far as having kids, I don‚Äôt know. I feel like my life will always be run by them and other than caring for them (which obviously holds a lot of value), the rest of my life will be pointless. I‚Äôll never get to do the things I like to do and feel happy and/or at peace. Just thinking about the permanence of it and potential for being constantly stressed and unhappy gives me a small feeling of anxiousness.

I don‚Äôt know if anyone can relate to any of this but it‚Äôs how I feel. I don‚Äôt have a motivation problem at all and my depression isn‚Äôt much of a factor either. I get myself insanely motivated and excited to pursue my hobbies and the causes I feel are important. It‚Äôs just unfortunate that A) I can‚Äôt make money through them and B) I‚Äôm not particularly efficient (though I‚Äôm thorough and accurate). It‚Äôs not even that I dislike accounting. I like messing with numbers. It‚Äôs just the going into work, the time pressure, the early and long hours, etc. I tried looking into some independent contracting, where I could work remotely and get paid by the return or document (not by the hour). That honestly sounds great bc I can take my time and won‚Äôt have to start so early. Unfortunately, I got hired instead lol.

I know this is a very long-winded post and might even seem like a stupid post to some people but it‚Äôs how I feel. Maybe I just haven‚Äôt found my passion that can make me money but I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll ever get that opportunity. I can do what I‚Äôm doing for awhile. I can suck it up through the tax season even. But doing it my entire life just seems unbearable. Hell, I‚Äôm sure I could even eventually pass all four parts of the CPA exam (I did spend $2,400 on a course) but the traditional career just seems horrible to me.

Thank you in advance to anyone who actually read some or all of this and is kind enough to respond. I figure I‚Äôm not the only person in the entire world feeling a bit this way.

P.S. I‚Äôm not helped by the fact that my family, even though they are great people, are big on working long hours, even if you hate your job.

933,"Introverts, extroverts, social skills and ""office politics""","Just following up on another post about this.

I don't see it as so much of an introvert/extrovert issue.  What I have seen in my 30+ years of working is that it's much more about how much you are willing to be used by your boss and co-workers to meet their emotional needs.  If they want you to be their Therapist, Best Friend, Son/Daughter, Mother/Father, Sidekick, Drinking Buddy, Emotional Chew Toy, or just join in when they are trashing or gossiping about other people, you better do it.  Having healthy boundaries can actually hurt you in the workplace.

Now, of course, no one ever talks about it like this.  Most people probably don't even know they are doing this.  They just think they like and get along with one person, and not so much another, without ever thinking about why that is.

I think it falls along a spectrum with stuff like sexual or racial harassment at the more extreme end.  Notice how many stories involve the target feeling like they couldn't do anything about it because it would risk their job or their entire careers.  The boss has the power, whether their agenda is to make jokes about your tits or tell you all the gory details of their divorce.

It's just as difficult for an extrovert to set boundaries as for an introvert, because in both cases it is about challenging power dynamics.",False,ljcroq,candleflame3,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ljcroq/introverts_extroverts_social_skills_and_office/,10,1

Threw chips into a fryolator and got my arms burnt up for 8 hours a day. Couldn't help but remember thinking, ""Is this really it?"". Is this what my life is going to be like? 15 years later, I'm still working jobs for 8 hours every day. I'm too tired to be a fun, attentive dad, I'm too mentally exhausted to have meaningful conversations with my wife.

This thought prevents me from ever really enjoying my weekends. I can't get away from this feeling.

Wtf for) but 20 additional requests and a project were allocated to me when I wasn't even there with the normal deadlines expected of me. I would have had to work 2 days unpaid just to catch up. What's the point of even taking leave then? I'm entitled to it.

I've always been on the very high functioning end and even then I can't even get my foot in the door for a job. Even with my STEM degree, I can't get a job. I may as well have just followed my passion and done Arts all along rather than be pressured by others to study a more ""employable"" degree. No wonder that only like 10% of people on the spectrum have full-time employment. 
I have applied to hundreds of jobs, even have had a few interviews. As soon as a prospective employer notices my Autistic mannerisms I can tell they've made a note not to hire me. I can't even get a job at McDonald's for goodness sake!
The maximum welfare benefits I'm eligible for is a measly $200 a week, and I live in one of the most expensive countries in the world so it's barely enough to not starve.
Sometimes I wish I lived in a place like The USSR where EVERYONE was guaranteed a job. Better than that, I wish we lived in a society where employment wasn't necessary. Where people  had the opportunity to thrive and live to their full potential instead of being forced into work or even worse living on welfare benefits that are well below the poverty line.
I constantly feel like a burden on society, when the real takers are the mega rich who exploit us all. It's scapegoating, pitting poor against poor and many seem to fall for it. Trust me, living with Autism and conforming to neurotypical expectations is a fulltime job in itself.
To end this I'm just going to say that I'm going to hang on. I will keep living my life as I am despite the poverty I've found myself in.

979,It's nearly my one year no-work anniversary,"Last March I was furloughed from work due to the pandemic, then at the end of August I accepted redundancy and have made minimal effort to look for more work since. I'm fortunate enough to be in a situation where I can feed and shelter myself with the small amount I have in terms of savings and the allowance I get from jobseekers. Why exactly would I look for work? It's not like there is anything fun I can do with the extra money I would make.

It's hard to say whether my interminable boredom and malaise is a result of the complete lack of structure my life has due to no work obligations, or the lockdown, or both. What I do know, however, is that I have no desire to return to work. This situation can't last forever though, eventually something has gotta give and the longer I put it off, the harder it will be for me to find a job that won't make me want to kill myself. I can physically see the window where it is acceptable to have a hole in my CV because of the the pandemic get smaller with each passing day. But then again, isn't this future me's problem? .

987,Employer refuses to pay my payroll taxes.,"This is a sub that I identify strongly with so I wanna share this with you. I'm gonna copy/paste from my legal advice thread:


*I've been working for this job since June of 2017. It started out by the book getting direct deposit and payroll checks and then after a few months my boss started cutting paper checks with no stubs. It didn't take long to realize what he was doing. He was trying to pay me less by not paying my taxes. 

My gross is supposed to be $45K. In 2018 my boss only paid the taxes on $30K, in 2019 28K, and in 2020 only 26K. 

I confronted him about it and he told me to move along if I was unhappy. After over three years working for this prick he says you don't like it leave, as he's stealing from me and breaking the law. So I want to know what exactly I can do about it. 

I am ready to call the IRS. I'm worried that I'll be held responsible for letting this happen for so long. I didn't confront my boss because it is in my interest to keep my income down. I have a bunch of student loans and my payment is based on my income. I have pay stubs saying I make $22/hour and work exactly 40 hours per week every week that is taxed. On paper it's obvious I'm a salary employee being paid as hourly. It's clear as day what my employer is doing. 

Also want to add he's also my landlord. Complicates the situation for me. Basically ruins years of my rental history. 

This is Pinellas county Florida.*

Can I get some support?","25 years old and I've just finished a bachelor's degree of business in Australia after spending almost 5 years in a shitty accounting firm I can't stand. I'm at a point where it's time to start looking for work again after a little bit of travelling (pre-covid) and I'm instead looking to try become a private guitar teacher full time to avoid the shitty boss, slave grind, no fulfillment, and horrible environment dynamics. Even looking at job listings for what I'm qualified for makes me physically sick and mentally very scared (I know I did that to myself with my useless degree).

I'm fairly experienced with the guitar (10+ years experience playing with 3.5 years experience teaching) and have found some locations in my country that I think are fairly untapped, but I'm still not sure I want to take this risk. I have the savings to take it, and will likely look for a part time job with set hours to top up my savings to get it going, but ultimately I wanna be doing my own thing. However, I'm worried about lots of little things, as my anxiety is rattling my brain around and it's making me fearful. I think I just need that kick from someone to tell me to do it and take a calculated risk. Someone or some people to support me in not working among the garbage hierarchy that suppresses us. Can I please request that people help me in some way? I don't even know how, (maybe with getting my name out there at some point?) and I get this is pretty rude to just ask for help, but I figure maybe it's worth a try.

993,And the system keeps chugging along...,"I realized that the reason people leave is because of two things

1. Your pay is stifled the second you accept and offer. It will stagnate from that moment on.
2. Simultaneously, the employers' demands and expectations of you will increase from that moment on. They want more, while not giving you better pay (marginal amendments, if that).

Thus, when you start a new job, it's worth it --- its a lot of new work, but you're being paid really well.

However, there will come a time, likely in 2-3 years of your start date where the effort required no longer is worth the income. This is because your pay hasn't really increased to match your new workload. This is when you leave the job.

I am an idiot and have been here for too long. I hate them and they don't like me. They're trying to make me do more, when I know new hires junior to me are making 20%+ more than me.

And thus this is the 2-3 year career switch churn cycle! And the system chugs along.

What she fights to acknowledge, I did not choose to go. It was my only option at that time, so I could avoid living at my NEET mother's and being underpaid at my former job. I just wanted to move forwards in life for a bit.

What I get is having my partner as my only friend, not being able to socialize the way native do, and generally being unaware of anything administrative that could favour my lifestyle a little.

1008,Looking for references - please help!,"Hey everyone, and kudos on your awesome subreddit. I've been obsessed with the idea of eliminating the need to work in order to survive for a long time, and I want to make as large a contribution as I can towards that goal. I'm a little bit sceptical that governments will implement universal basic income any time soon (since that would emancipate us from wage slavery, which the corporations do not want), though I do support activists who are pushing for reform (or even revolution) in that direction. On the other hand, I am optimistic that we can find a decentralised solution through social enterprise. The kind of thing I have in mind is to mass produce a cheap self-contained system which would be relatively self-sustaining and provide all of the basic necessities. Something involving a DIY housing kit, solar panels and batteries, an automated allotment, etc.. It doesn't have to be exactly that - those are just examples - the main idea is to leverage modern technology to eliminate survival pressures, in a way which can be scaled up and distributed to as many people as possible. In theory, one might even be able to do this under capitalism (not ideal, but just a thought), with the product marketed as a one time cost to permanently buy yourself out of work, and made cheap via an economy of scale.

Are any of you aware of people or organisations who are working in this kind of area, or with this kind of approach to solving the problem? If so, please could you point me in the right direction?

1016,is anyone else on this sub genuinely poor?,"i've seen a lot of ""what do you do and how much do you make"" posts on here and the majority of people have been on high salaries. some on more than 100k even that i've seen. 

and i completely understand and accept that you can still hate your situation and work when you're earning more, and that it can be incredibly stressful and that of course there are different costs of living in each area; but there's a huge disconnect between someone saying they hate going to work when they make 80k and who have opportunities and funds to fall back on if they did decide to quit, and someone who also hates their job or working but who is living paycheck to paycheck on low income with no savings or potential future. 

i work what's considered a low skilled job and many would say it's my own fault for being in this situation, maybe if i'd worked harder i could have done better and i wouldn't be having anxiety attacks every night. but i work for my local council in a library and that's fine i enjoy parts of the job even (although working your entire life is a concept i am completely against as a whole), but i'm payed so little that i had to take the cheapest place i could find in my town which means i'm living with 4 other people who hate me for being trans, and so i dread coming home each day too but can't afford to move anywhere else. 

every month i have to put something else off, this month i had to put off my eye test and glasses so i have another month of intense headaches due to fucked up eyes, and next month to be able to afford new glasses i'll have to put off going to the dentist which means i'll have to live with these tooth pains for another 2 months and it just carries on and on. i cant afford my medications most months, and by the end of the month i'm always rubbing two pennies together and have nothing i can put into my savings so when my job goes tits up, and it will because funding is always being cut for community services even though we're also considered essential support, i will have maybe a week to hopefully find a new job before i would end up homeless again. if my landlord puts the rent up by even ¬£50 i'd have to stop eating altogether to be able to pay it. 

i can't afford a hobby or self care, i don't have the time to just relax at the end of each day before going in again tomorrow. the single day off i get a week is spent doing all my laundry and cleaning and cooking for the week as by the time i get back from work i have maybe an hour at most before i have to sleep as taking the cheapest place available also means i'm an hour away from work. my entire life is just working and worrying about money and i cry every single day knowing this is my life. 

i'm just so tired of everything. i genuinely have no hope for the future anymore, i do feel like i'm going to work myself into an early grave not because the job itself is stressful but because i cant afford to survive for much longer and i'm 22, how can i carry on like this until i'm 50?

1030,Do you ever just cry out of sheer frustration?,"It happened to me this morning. I logged onto my laptop and just suddenly felt really tired. Then I just cried... and cried... and cried... until I felt like I was going to throw up.

Nothing bad even happened - in fact, I‚Äôm actually really lucky to have a good job. It pays pretty poorly, but the people are nice, the company is well-regarded for being an amazing place to work and my job is something that a lot of people would fight for. I get to work from home currently and management are so chilled that I was once told I could go home for an hour nap (I live around the corner) as I yawned in front of my manager. The job is almost too good to be true to be honest.

Yet, WHY do I still feel this way? Why does my job feel so meaningless... why is my motivation so low... and why does it make me so anxious? Why does it feel like I‚Äôm trying to fit into a pair of jeans that never fitted me in the first place?

I think I figured it out recently... and it‚Äôs because the job IS kind of meaningless. Nothing I do directly helps anyone on a human level... I‚Äôm just churning out content for businesses to make them more money. If I do a good job, then what happens? Some CEO is happy because his already high profits are up. Not because I‚Äôve helped anyone on a personal level... I‚Äôve not taught a child to read or helped a patient or helped a vulnerable older person get ready for the day. It‚Äôs all to help a system that essentially is just... made up.

You could just say ‚Äúwell go and change your career‚Äù, but is it that easy? I‚Äôd have to retrain and spend thousands of pounds that I don‚Äôt have. Then be exploited for doing meaningful work that is paid far less than the corporate jobs.

I have my own side business that is more meaningful, but I‚Äôm so damn exhausted from working full-time and being at home not doing anything fun in a pandemic that I just don‚Äôt have the energy to work as hard on it as I need to. I so desperately want to... but I‚Äôm tired... we‚Äôre all so damn tired and the way we have to live is just so disconnected from the very essence of what we are - HUMANS.

1040,I hate working. **rant...sorry **,"I know this is not the right subreddit but I think you guys would understand. My bosses are awful. I was hired as a manager, but really I'm just an associate. I've run far bigger wineries than this one, single handedly. The husband sits in the office all day, watching TV, just so that when I lock up he can check that I've locked every door. I'm salary, and he insists I come in at 9 am, but we don't even open until 11, and I'm finished with my morning tasks by 915. I just stand around looking busy. He blames me for everything. It was an ice storm yesterday, so after a few hours, the wife sent me home. I said I'd stay on top of social media and emails. At around 3 I checked my email again, (I was checking every 30-45 minutes) and I had like 10 emails within a 30 minute span scolding me because they were ""slammed and the customers said the roads were FINE!"" and asking me ""ARE YOU EVEN THERE! PEOPLE ARE ASKING US QUESTIONS ON FACEBOOK AND YOU AREN'T ANSWERING!"" the message on Facebook they were referring to was from the husband. He had messaged the business page, saying ""do you have a question"". And I had responded to it. So the wife tells me to drive back in. I get there an hour before we close. the wife is in her snowsuit going sledding with their grandson. He has a newspaper open on the bar.  I check sales, and it was not busy. The husband has terrible time management skills, and can't adjust his service speed when it's busy. He starts telling me how crazy busy it was, but how he can handle it, and then pulls up the reports. I know he thought it would be much better than it was, but I just stood there. I can see the moment he realizes his numbers weren't great, and then he starts scolding me for ""refunding all the reservations instead of rescheduling them"" and asked if I even tried. He was trying to find a reason his numbers sucked. Problem is, I only refunded 1 reservation, and rescheduled the rest. I told him this and he tried pulling up different dates to like, trick me into thinking I refunded more? I don't know. It was insane.

They don't let managers send out basic emails without getting approval. Seriously. Last week, I sent an email out, that the wife had literally written and emailed to me for me to send out. Apparently that wasn't approval enough? I was somehow supposed to know it wasn't ready to send? It contained a link to the website of a nearby bnb. They were angry I sent the email (that they wrote and sent me) without getting approval? And said that because of that email, that I had redirected the bnb Facebook page to our Facebook page. There was literally nothing about Facebook in the email. No link whatsoever to any Facebook. I said it wasn't possible, but they maintain that I did this by sending the email.

I got scolded for not checking to see if he used the correct gate code. Didn't know that was a thing.

We switched software, to one I've used extensively, and he knows that, and he's never used it, and he is insisting that I'm doing it wrong, and it won't look good. I know exactly what I'm doing, and he's not even seen what it will look like. That's all after the fact that I told him for the first 3 months I was here that our software was compromised and not secure, and he would get sooooo angry at me about it. I was right. 100s of people had their cc info stolen. 

FedEx picks up on Friday. An order came in on Sunday. I told the customer it would go out the next week. The wife asked me on Sunday if I needed anything from town over our weekend (Monday and Tuesday) and I told her that I had a package. She said she didn't want to go to FedEx. I said OK. Friday comes, so does FedEx, and I get scolded by the husband because we didn't get the package out earlier. I told him what his wife said, but it was still my fault.

I just am wasting my life here.

now im working in a library which i do think is an important job. we're a community space free for anyone to come in with no purchase necessary or expectation of them to do anything and so we do get lots of people spending all day here just for the shelter and warmthz we are often the only people available for certain members of the community to come in and talk to just for the chance to not be alone and to be listened to. we are a place that offers free help and support and allows people to read and learn and use the internet to access more services also. before covid we also did lots of fun author events and kids groups and random classes for people which again provided a way for people to get out and socialise and also give them the chance to learn something new or have fun with no purchase needed. i met a wonderful group of russian grandmothers through this who would bring in some baked goods each time the group met. 

through the library i also work with a local homeless org that provides emergency housing and mental health support for homeless people in and around my area too. i've been homeless myself before so feel very empathetic towards the people i meet this way, and whilst i dont think your work has to be the meaning of your life i do find it fulfilling to be able to help people in this way; much as i also wish it wasnt necessary and we were provided for already just because we are alive and deserve to live our lives comfortably without worry.

Then we'll have a large repository of information about businesses that are shit to work for. We could publish for all to see. And the power would be in our hands. Because the pool of people that a business could employ will shrink. Eventually they'll have to meet our demands. Because if not then they'll go belly up.

1089,The interview I had the other day really re-established my loathing for corporate America,"Last month I was fired from my assistant manager position at the local United Post Savages retail store when I came back from quarantining/testing after a COVID-19 exposure (negative test result, thank God) under the pretense of ""not being a good fit,"" despite my work history in the position with stellar feedback from customers and praise from two out of three co-workers. In reality, the store manager didn't like me, didn't like the fact that I learned my job quickly and did it well, and hated the fact that the two associates liked me better than her. However, that's a story for another day.

Naturally, I was back on an exhaustive job search because, you know, I need to live and whatever. Fortunately, my former employer didn't fight my unemployment claim so now I'm making more money not working than I did putting in 40 hours plus overtime in retail hell. Thanks COVID bonus money.

I'd applied for an administrative position and, being a guy, this has always been a difficult task since apparently in my state, it's weird for men to work in an office unless they're somewhere at the top of the food chain. But since no employers were hiring CEOs without 85 years of experience and three college degrees, I had to start somewhere.

I ended up getting a call regarding the position and we scheduled a Zoom interview. I left my pajama pants on, put on a good dress shirt, and positioned myself awkwardly in front of the camera waiting for the interviewer to begin the meeting.

Just by looking at this disheveled carcass of a once-human, I already knew this interview was going to be filled to the brim with buzzwords, gross expectations, and the importance of it being a ""family company."" I'll jump to the sweet part of the interview.

Interviewer: So, walk me through your work history.

Me: \*explains what's listed in broad daylight on my resume\*

I: Why did you leave your last position?

M: It was a mutual agreement that my departure would allow me to pursue a position more aligned with my goals and desire for growth.

I: Okay, we'll circle back to that later. \*Interviewer then proceeds to tell me her experience with the company and how she's dedicated the last 30 years of her life to this place, etc.\* In short, I'm looking for someone dedicated that wants to grow with the company.

M: Understandable.

I: I'm not getting the impression that that person is you, however. Your work history shows that the last time you worked in the same position for more than a year was back in 2017 and most of which were entry level positions. It doesn't seem like you've really moved the needle in your career journey.

M: \*visibly taken aback and mildly annoyed\* Well, when one has had a rough work history of holding positions in toxic environments, under concrete ceilings, unrecognized achievements, supervisor plagiarism, and other growth-stifling situations, one doesn't exactly stick around. With that being said, having no college experience due to personal reasons and despite having a collective 5 years in administration, I haven't been able to secure any positions in a higher tier than entry level.

I: What reasons do you have for not going to college?

M: May I ask why you're keen to know?

I: Well, it just seems peculiar that someone of your age has no college degree and only has experience in entry level positions.

M: With all due respect, is this an interview or target practice? Quite frankly for the past few moments, all I've received from you are insults and I find your demeanor to be highly unprofessional and inappropriate.

I: I beg your pardon?

M: You asked me to walk you through my work history, all of which I've said is visible on my resume, and you subsequently stated that you don't believe I'm the dedicated candidate you're looking for and criticized my work history and lack of college experience, which raises the question of why you'd even schedule this interview with me in the first place.

I: Well, I wanted to give you the consideration of explaining yourself and convince me that you are, in fact, an ideal candidate.

M: You mean beg? That's not going to happen. And the ""consideration of explaining myself?"" I don't have to explain myself to you nor do I need any consideration from someone who would raise their nose at another individual without the same occupational background. I'll be withdrawing my application from this position. Please do not contact me further.

I then ended the Zoom call. Maybe I overreacted, but I felt very insulted and my work history was nowhere near as bad as she made it sound. The buzzwords ‚Äúcircle back‚Äù and ‚Äúmove the needle‚Äù made my eyes twitch. And the audacity of her judgement was just disgusting to me.

1094,I worked at Petsmart in the beginning of the pandemic,"Workers didn't get raises or bonuses, but managers did and those bonuses got cut. They fired half the staff, didn't change our hours, and opened online ordering while not even placing any safety procedures. We were the only store in town, including WALMART for fucks sakes, that still had our regular hours.

People flooded to our store, profits were doubled (almost trippled tbh) while they had usually just 1 cashier and 1 manager working, and that cashier had to clean and still talk to every single customer that came in.

If you don't know anything about petsmart, they have a policy of giving a, ""Disneyland experience."" Meaning, we had to talk and be cheerful to every. single. customer. Probably suck their cocks if they asked for it. 

Anyways, so we're still open till 9pm and don't have ANY precautions, no masks required, no hand sanitizer, no 6 foot rule. We have hundreds of online orders needing filled weekly, along with our store being well over the 10 person limit constantly. There's talk of cutting our wages, barely above minimum, down to minimum. We didn't get covid pay. The government gave petsmart the money to do covid pay, but it never went out. 

Not only did they not care about the safety of their staff and treated us like absolute dog shit, they treated the animals horribly. Animals were still shipped to us before knowing if they could spread the virus, and we had to handle customers above all else so these poor animals wouldn't get the care they needed cause we were just run ragged.

1099,"Erosion of Worker Compensation, Unlimited PTO, and Demoralizing Situation","So my company recently switched me to salaried (exempt from overtime pay), froze my accrued PTO, and instead gave me ""unlimited PTO"". I will still get paid my accrued PTO upon termination or when I leave the company, but the payout dollar value is frozen. My accrued PTO hours will be reduced by the same % as any future raises, so they can still say that they're paying you out at your ""final rate"", but the final PTO payout amount will still be the same as at the end of 2020, regardless of how much longer I stay at the company.

Its obvious no matter how HR try to spin unlimited PTO, that its a scam, and companies are just trying to minimize the amount of PTO employees take every year, and reduce the amount of money they have to pay when employees leave. I searched for unlimited PTO posts on Reddit, and it seems widespread across industries and being increasingly implemented at more and more companies. I know my company's policy is at least better than those people that completely lost their accrued PTO after their companies switched to unlimited PTO, but it still seems dirty.

Looking through my employee handbook, apparently this PTO payout policy doesn't apply to California, Colorado,   
Illinois, Louisiana, Montana, and Nebraska which require employers to pay the remainder of unused accrued PTO at the employee's final pay rate. My state of New York, and [many other states](https://www.paycor.com/resource-center/pto-payout-laws-by-state#:~:text=Does%20your%20state%20require%20employers%20to%20payout%20PTO%3F,employee%20contrac%20...%20%2010%20more%20rows%20), just defers PTO payout requirements to employer policies, so we're just at the mercy of our employers.

I reached out to my state assemblyman to see if NY labor laws could be amended to be similar to those other states, and they told me that the NY Assembly Labor Committee responded back saying the ""*committee staff have concerns that this type of legislation may discourage employers from voluntarily instituting a paid time off program*"".

This is just demoralizing. We're powerless as our employers continuing eroding worker compensation and conveniently using the pandemic to justify these ""policy changes"" despite record profits and our government is too scared, or corrupt, to act and look out for the regular people which they're supposed to do. I think in the upcoming future, once a majority of employers have implemented unlimited PTO, earned PTO will just be another worker benefit lost to history just like pensions, severance, right to disconnect, and probably the 40-hour work week.

The only reason I'm here is I don't have a degree, and this job pays very well and has great benefits. The catch is the job is very mentally draining and stressful. I speak with angry customers all day. Last year I got on anti anxiety medications just to cope. Ill forget things as I'm speaking, and a few times I have accidently left the stove on. Its incredibly embarrassing and I'll feel like I'm going to burst into tears when my family brings up how bad my memory is getting.

1105,"What options are there for making money, but with the least amount of time and effort involved?","I've spent my adult life, and even most of my adolescent years, thinking about and working towards the career I'm currently in, and I'm now in a place that I should be very happy about. The problem is, I'm neither content or fulfilled. I've come to realise that the industry I work in is very exploitative, relatively poorly paid, and I think much of the work is very monotonous and there is little room for creativity. 

Most people would probably think I'm emotionally unwell to be questioning whether I should continue in a career I have spent my life focused on.  

But what I've come to realise is that I don't particularly enjoy working. Before finding the job I'm currently in, I was out of work for a couple of months, and I found that I was comparatively happy in this situation. I had a better feeling of self-worth, I was much less anxious, less miserable, and I spent the wealth of my time reading and writing. For some people a job gives them confidence and strength, but for me it seems to be the opposite. I feel stronger when I am completely in control of my life, and when I feel that I'm using the precious time I've been given to improving my understanding of the world or being creative. I'm not someone who slips into inertia. I'm never bored because I always enjoy learning, and books are cheap and the most extraordinary resource is at my fingertips. It seems quite sad to me that some people are completely lost if they don't have a job; surely you can find satisfaction in life without being forced to turn your waking hours into profits?

When I speak to people about my concerns, the usual response is along the lines of ""Ah, well, what you need is just another career!"", or that old hackneyed quote, ""find a job that you love and you'll never work a day in your life"". It's a bit like being a heroin junky and people suggesting other drugs you could choose to become addicted with instead. 

The other stock response I hear is ""well, you have to work hard if want to make money"", or ""there's no easy way to become rich"", as if the only possible aim I could have in future is to become wealthy. I've realised I'm not that bothered about having money, so long as I have enough to pay the rent on a little flat, keep me stocked up on food and books, and very occasionally go travelling on a shoestring budget. I don't want a car, nor am I interested in gadgets or expensive clothes. I'm happy to live a frugal existence if it means I'm able to spend more time doing the things I enjoy.

Because words matter, essaying matters. Now are you treating

may seem like a small thing, but it's generally indicative of much
more than that. People who say that the title doesn't matter as
long as the salary is right are wrong. The title matters. It dictates
your career path, what you can apply for next, and who i
interview you for what roles. It also dictates your salary range.

However, in my 20+ years of Chaffing and of (mostly

something called ‚ÄúEntry Level insert title"". For the sake of
argument, let's use Engineering since it's IINNINN's post. Of
anything an outward facing title is ""Or Software Engineer"" or
""Associate Software Engineer"" or just ""Software Engineer"" and if
you have a bachelor's degree and 0-2 years of experience you
would most likely fall here. Of you have a Master's degree,
Lockheed will hire you in as level 2. By point is saying
someone/something is entry level is fine, but there are no titles
I've seen calling it that. (Yes I'm sure Google will actually find a
posting with Entry Level in the title). There the confusion comes
in is when Recruiters like myself post something here on

you click the the link and it says 1+ years of A

I was in a lot of pain yesterday, so I told my manager before the shift even started that I volunteered to be sent home if the opportunity presented itself. She said she'd check on my department at some point to see if she could send me home (spoiler: she never did), and I gave the other guy who works in my area a heads up that if I was given the option to go home early, I was going to take it because I wasn't feeling well. 

He seemed disappointed by the prospect of me potentially getting sent home, but said, ""Well, if you get to go home, I hope you enjoy it..."" which is a rather kind and empathetic thing for him to say, so I responded with a, ""Thank you."" But then he finished his sentence, ""because I never ever get to leave early."" 

Oh, cool. So it was going to be one of those 'suffering Olympics' kinds of shifts. Nice. I don't like playing that game, so I just put my earplugs in and didn't talk to him for a few hours. 

Anyway, because my pain never subsided and it was my Friday, I made the decision to do the self-compassionate thing and clock out at the designated end time for the shift instead of staying the extra 25 minutes the company has come to expect from me. My mistake was making the friendly suggestion to my coworker to maybe do the same (because we were both having a bad day and screw being taken advantage of by this job).

He got irrationally frustrated at me and made the 'Please don't attempt a coup,' comment above. It was everything I could do not to facepalm as he started blathering about how he would be the one to get in trouble for me 'walking out' and pulling another suffering Olympics card like, ""I work twice as many hours as you do and I always stay until they tell me I can leave!""

Because I was in pain and consequently a bit pissy, I told him, ""If management decides to lay into YOU because I'M deciding to clock out ON TIME for once, then YOU NEED TO CALL THEM OUT ON IT on it and tell them to talk to ME if they have a problem with it. I already talked to my manager about wanting to go home, and now that I can go home, I'm going to."" 

He looked really dejected after that and said, ""Well, I'm not going to stop you if you want to leave."" 

""I do want to leave. Have a good night."" And I left.

1138,Yes I'm rushing because I want to go home,"I make 10 an hour right now. In a previous post I said 10 an hour places wouldn't hire me, but that was before this job. I enjoy the job enough (I'm a dog bather, it's easy but I get kicked bitten and scratched all day) and I leave when the dogs are all done. I have to he here at 7 am, and I usually leave around 2, which was pretty much perfect to me other than getting up at 7 am every day for that little.

But this week my boss tells me the ""good news"" that he hired another groomer, so I'll be having 6 more dogs a day, and working longer hours. Why would I want that?? I had no issue with my hours. I get told constantly that I rush through things here and first its cause thats just how my brain works, I always go fast. And secondly, I want to go HOME. From my bosses side of things I think he thinks of it like more hours = more money, but at 10 an hour I can donate plasma twice a week and make 2 days worth of money. I could sell my clothes, feet pics, go on fiver, literally anything because of how little 10 an hour is. 

I'm working up the courage to change my availability, theres a good chance I'll get denied or even fired. I'm the only bather and I'm here 5 days a week while the salon is open.

1141,Does anyone else get really annoyed when people talk proudly about their boring office jobs,"I mean the typical types of convo where someone is boasting about how proud they are of their work or when someone is talking in detail about work projects. I feel like most of my friends from school talk non stop about their jobs, coworkers and projects with nothing but happiness and blissful ignorance. I never discuss work it feels like a chore to talk about it on top of having to do it. I talk mainly about my interests and relationships, but never work. 

All I hear when someone talks about their work or projects with joy is that they are happy making some corporation money. There is no personal advancement in this. Yet they have been tricked into thinking there is. The main goal as an individual logically should be to make enough money to be able to stop working yes? Not to keep making a corporation millions (if not billions) through their output to *maybe* see a low six figure salary for all that effort, stress and effects on their health. I had an economics teacher who put it perfectly- to work is to literally trade your time for money. If you make 40 an hour you are comfortable trading an hour of your life for 40 dollars. If you make 150k a year you are selling away a year of your life for 150k. 

Seriously, all the old school friends I have who are like this look so much older than their age. Working so hard for essentially no return has aged them. Meanwhile, there is me who doesn‚Äôt  care at all about my job who passes for much younger than my age consistently (born in the 90s and yet consistently assumed to be from 00s). They also have developed serious (as well as minor) health conditions brought on by long hours and stress.

I‚Äôm stuck in a job I hate as well at the moment but I‚Äôm taking steps to get out of this type of life. I save everything, I keep a very low cost of living and make extra income so hopefully I can soon switch to part time work or retire in my 30s-40s. I can‚Äôt deal with this type of environment/ life much longer. I‚Äôm just so sick of hearing people proud of wasting their lives away. And for what?

For reference, I'm a research technician with a university. I have my bachelors and am currently doing a masters while working.The job is not permenant (as are many academic jobs) and it is grueling work, but I have a very flexible work schedule and I'm loving the big picture of being part of moving knowledge forward and doing applied research.

The discussion with parents started with them asking when me and my wife were going to move into a house together. I explained to them that I am currently doing a masters while working and hope to pursue a PhD after and even after that there may be post-doc positions, so it could be a relatively long time before we settle into something permanent like a house (Ive discussed these plans with my wife and we are happy with where our future is headed). They scowled and said something along the lines of ""you are too smart to go down the career path you've chosen. You could get a job anywhere in industry and make so much more money."" I told them I'd rather do something I love doing and live rental to rental than hate my life for 40 hours per week just to live for the other little bit of time in each day.

They think I have some sort of mental illness for thinking like that, but it is the absolute truth. I'd rather stay where I am now heping to make impactful discoveries than move to industry where my labor makes more money for some company.

I hate being micromanaged like this. He can never let little things go. He always feels the need to bring them to me and try to make me feel dumb, yet he messes up all the time and I can't say anything to him. 

A few days before this he tells me I didn't assign someone a license to an app. I absolutely did (I made other changes to the account that cannot be made without them being licensed first), but he proceeded to give me a long talking to about procedures and how I can't be missing things even though I didn't and he wouldn't listen. 

Other times I ask a simple question. Like ""I need an answer to X"", and he'll be like ""Okay here we go again, give me the ticket and I can take a look at it"" or conversely just ignore me altogether and let the issue sit there untouched all day. He even admitted to me once he purposely doesn't help me right away when I ask questions because he thinks ""it helps me learn to figure it out by myself"".

I agree low wages are bullshit.

And at least the difference isn‚Äôt in orders of magnitudes like it would be at a huge corporation. I don‚Äôt want to take that kind of risk, so I get a smaller reward. That doesn‚Äôt bother me.  
  
 I work in an industry with often troubling health and safety issues, and protection of labourer rights is virtually nonexistent. I knew that before I signed up for trade school, and frankly it doesn‚Äôt bother me that much. I have a threshold of acceptable risk I won‚Äôt cross and my boss respects that. At least healthcare here is free, you Americans are absolutely living in a hellscape on that front.  
  
40 hours a week doesn‚Äôt bother me since I used to work almost 80 at a shitty company, so that‚Äôs fine by me.

I think my free time is fine, though idk how the fuck I would have kids like this, so there is that. I‚Äôm not sure I really want kids though.
  
Automation won‚Äôt be coming for my job for a long, long time. Way too many one-offs, random chaos, totally unpredictable things. People wouldn‚Äôt trust a robot. Not worried on that front.

Anyways, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a unicorn in that I‚Äôve found a decent hands on job. I don‚Äôt think jobs like these are particularly rare and I think they genuinely contribute value to society in a way you can feel good about. Hell you can even have loads of fun doing it if you‚Äôre the right kind of person. It‚Äôs not for everyone and I‚Äôm actually very much pro-UBI because no one should work a job they hate and still struggle. But not all work is bullshit, in fact a lot of it isn‚Äôt.

1175,feeling completely defeated,"i honestly just snapped today. 

i finished a month of 60 hour weeks cash in hand at pay below the min here in australia. i felt so lucky when i found it, finally i have a job. its hard for me to get a job, and the owner was nice and seemed to care about growing his business and treating people well. 

i was supposed to manage the store and i have management experience so its not out of my comfort zone. but deliveries come and are unpaid and then returned, and my pay gets delayed and pushed back. i don't mind being patient, whatever, as long as i get paid, but the lying and delaying just dug under my skin. 

today is tet, and i asked for today off to celebrate with my partner. my texts and messages were completely ignored and so i showed up to work. another delivery unpaid, returned, my pay still not here. i give the owner a call about the long hours, the missing pay, my shaken faith, ""i thought you said you wanted to work"" he said. more delaying, more explaining, he's talking faster and getting upset. i just gave up at that point. i put the key on the desk, closed up shop, and blocked the boss. i feel immensely guilty about it, completely leaving him out to dry, but if he can ignore me and leave me to work myself to the bone with no guarantee of pay, then i can block him and move on. i at least texted him to let him know i wouldn't be coming back, more courtesy than he gave me. 

i'm foolish sure, but i'm desperate. but not so desperate that i will work without pay. the pay is the whole point.

1181,Crazy crazy,"So I commented a story about my old work last night and a few people thought it was crazy, it wasn't the craziest story from there &amp; I said I'd post **the** crazy story. 

Tl;dr version; poison and intrigue 

I took a job working as tech support at a large telco in Australia, I won't say which but most Australians will probably work it out, if you work it out &amp; don't believe the story you can google the name of the company &amp; the main aspect of the story &amp; you will find a new article confirming it.

So anyway, went through the training, made a few friends through the training, one guy in particular I got along with pretty well as he had a dark sense of humour like me. I also made made my first enemy I guess. A drone with pink hair that decided her path to power was to take it upon herself to police the milk honor system for tea &amp; coffee (20c for those that used milk). Hardly anyone at the company would pay &amp; I don't drink milk, but that never stopped her from confronting us over it &amp; chairing stupid meetings about it at least once a week, which was especially frustrating as it wasn't her job and as a low level employee, she had no kind of authority.

At the end of the training someone high up from corporate came along for what would be the first of many corporate wank sessions. She asked us how many of us had our internet with them. No one raised their hand. She laughed &amp; said ""well our standout feature isn't our price nor our speed, it's our support. So it makes sense that tech support wouldn't need that"" my buddy raised his hand and said ""well actually, it's because paying to have internet with you is like paying to go down on a hooker.""

Buddy was fired on the spot. It's a perfect line that still haunts me on the nights I can't sleep.

Anyway the next morning we were all called into the meeting room again. We all got in there and one of the managers asks the question ""who hear drinks tea or coffee?"" everyone in the room groaned, expecting it to be one of the usual honor system witch hunts. She actually looked pretty nervous and said ""come on guys we need to know"" pretty much everyone raised their hands. The next question was  ""keep your hands up if you drink milk"" there was a groan again, but the manager persisted. ""So, ugh, how are you all feeling? Ugh, no one's um coughing up blood or anything?""

This led to puzzlement so she spilled the beans. ""we found rat poison in the milk""

Anyway the whole thing went mental from there. The homicide squad were called up from the state capital. Turns out that particular rat poison a fully grown person would have to eat about 1kg worth to kill someone, but had a pretty good chance of causing bleeding from the gums and a few other areas. We all got interviewed personally by the homicide squad. I was talked to a lot about my buddy, as he had been fired the day before, so he was suspect number one. 

I did not believe that it was him, as he wasn't that kind of person, that I could see him possibly punching someone in the heat of the moment after being fired, but not forming a plan, coming back &amp; poisoning his coworkers &amp; told the detectives that. They asked who I'd suspect, I said pink hair &amp; explained the history. Anyway nothing ever came of it, they eliminated my friend through security cameras, timing etc said it couldn't possibly be him (this was after months of borderline harassments mind you). They did narrow it down to the worksite though. It was a poisoning attempt from someone that worked at the building.

The corporate environment is the unhealthiest kind of workplace I've ever worked in and I believe this story is a perfect example of that environment.",False,li144p,ganjabutweed,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/li144p/crazy_crazy/,7,1

1184,Reading an Extract from Yuval Harari‚Äôs Sapiens doesn‚Äôt make me feel any better ...,"While people in today‚Äôs affluent societies work an
average of forty to forty-five hours a week, and
people in the developing world work sixty and even
eighty hours a week, hunter-gathered living today in
the most hospitable of habitat ‚Äî such as the
Kalahari Desert ‚Äî work on average for just thirty-five
to forty-five hours a week. They hunt only one day
out of three, and gathering takes up just three to six
hours daily. In normal times, this is enough to feed
the band. It may well be that ancient hunter-
gathered living in bones more fertile than the
Kalahari spent even less time obtaining food and raw
materials. In top of that, foragers enjoyed a lighter
load of household shores. They had no dishes to
wash, no carpets to vacuum, no floors to polish, no
naples to change and no bills to pay.

The forage economy provided most people with
more interesting lives than agriculture or industry
do. Today, a Chinese factory hand leaves home
around seven in the morning, makes her way
through polled streets to a sweatshop, and there
operate the same machine, in the same way, day in,
day out, for ten long and mind-rubbing hours,
returning home around seven in the evening in order
to wash dishes and do the sundry. Thirty thousand
years ago, a Chinese forage might leave camp with
her companions at, say, eight in the morning. They‚Äôd
roam the nearby forests and meadows, gathering
mushrooms, digging up enable roots, catching frog
and occasionally running away from tigers. By early
afternoon, they were back at the camp to make
lunch. That left them plenty of time to gossip, tell
stories, play with the children and just hang out. Of
course the tigers sometimes caught them, or a snake
bit them, but on the other hand they didn‚Äôt have to
deal with automobile accidents and industrial
pollution.

He asks this girl ""Why is milk cheaper at a drug store than a grocery store?"" and she pauses then says ""Your guess is as good as mine."" We didn't make these prices, we are paying too much for food but not by choice.

I‚Äôd really like some support, peeps, please tell me all about how you‚Äôve quit a shit job and gone on to be happy. Please tell me there‚Äôs no shame in quitting. Please tell me I‚Äôm worth more than this shitty job. Please tell me it gets better, I‚Äôm really needing some support right now. Anything after this is just me ranting angrily, so you don‚Äôt need to read it if you don‚Äôt want to. Thanks for your time, kind stranger ‚ù§Ô∏è

My job fucken sucks, hey. I do online customer service and it‚Äôs just non-stop complaints, abuse, and aggravating dumbfuck questions. I have customers telling me they hope I get COVID and die, they hope I get r*ped to death, wishing death on my (non-existent) children, calling me a cunt/bitch/worthless/useless and other misc horrible things. The cherry on top is that I‚Äôd say 80% of the shit I deal with is caused by the customer themselves, so I‚Äôm getting blamed for their mistakes. There‚Äôs no structure, the goalposts are ever shifting, and there‚Äôs no support from management. 

They‚Äôve also railroaded us into taking on dedicated domestic violence traffic, it was never in our contracts but we were told if we didn‚Äôt take this traffic that we‚Äôd be moved sideways into call centre work - fuck that hey. I have a history of domestic and family violence, the things I‚Äôve been through would make your hair curl - suffice to say, I didn‚Äôt handle this news well. But hey, nearly an hour of hysterical crying and my manager says I don‚Äôt have to take the traffic as I ‚Äúclearly have genuine reasons not to‚Äù, so generous, thank you kind overlord.

They also play favourites, I‚Äôve been one of two good employees (going above and beyond, working 15 hour shifts, training others with my prior experience, taking on anything and everything outside my nominal role) and yet they passed over me in favour of someone I trained to be promoted. My manager adores this person and even has said to them ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you move closer to my house so we can hang out easier‚Äù, fucking nepotism of the highest order. 

I have many more complaints I could expand on, but this is already long. 

The fact that I wear my bleeding heart on my sleeve is why I‚Äôm so good at customer service, I genuinely care about people and their problems, and I want to help. I can‚Äôt change the world, but if I can make things better for people I‚Äôll do my absolute best to. All I want to do is help, but it just gets thrown back in my face, by customers and management alike. I can‚Äôt ‚Äústop letting it get to [me]‚Äù, I take it all personally even when I try not to. I‚Äôm so sensitive and raw to the pain of others, even if it‚Äôs unjustified I‚Äôll try and take other people‚Äôs emotions on and absorb them, and this job is tearing me apart. I don‚Äôt want to lose my compassion and empathy, but I don‚Äôt know how to harden myself against this shit. I‚Äôve been doing customer service rolls for only 6 years, but it feels like a lifetime in which I‚Äôve been incredibly depressed and angry at the world.

My partner (bless his socks) is telling me to quit, that he doesn‚Äôt mind supporting us so I can go back to study and get a qualification to escape humiliating customer service rolls, but I just can‚Äôt do it. The guilt is so strong even though he‚Äôs telling me I can, that he doesn‚Äôt mind taking on our finances, that he needs me to be happy, but it‚Äôs so hard. I don‚Äôt want to burden him, he‚Äôs so good to me and I don‚Äôt want to be a cause of stress. I‚Äôm a mess every shift, weeping and feeling utterly debased, I‚Äôm self harming again from how awful it all is and how hopeless I feel. It has to get better right?

Something happened a few years ago where I just kind of woke up. Woke up to my place in the universe, woke up to the bigger picture of life itself. There is no evidence of a god, an afterlife, no significance to being me anymore so than any other living being that has lived and died before me billions of times. So I ask, what does one out of billions upon billions upon billions (current humans + humans that have lived and died) do with their time here? Do I watch YouTube all day? Podcast after podcast? Do I kill myself with stress trying to accrue as much money as possible so I can possibly relax; if I make it to see that day?-So much-if not all-of my limited precious youth, my one and only life-is spent working a job that pays too little and is completely fuckery, sleeping, commuting, and maintaining responsibilities(laundry, cleaning, gym, cooking, etc)-where/when does life actually begin? 

I can‚Äôt help to be incredibly fuckingg anxious and depressed in this world-and the urge to escape reality is one that is absolutely constant. I wish I didn‚Äôt feel this way...but it‚Äôs like, do I live on the fringes, refuse to participate like I am now, mentally and spiritually tortured from existing as an absurdist/nihilist resenting existence and civilization itself i.e. corporate culture, h.r., unauthentic living like interviews and corporate culture and work environments that dictate and encompass ones entire life, their job. Or do I play the game, pretend like a give a fuck about any of this horseshit, start at the bottom, call other humans my ‚Äúboss‚Äù and be grateful for a few dollar raise every couple years and live in fear of fucking up and losing my livelihood. 

What have we done here?

circumstances totally unlike those in which it arose. To
wonder the result has been disastrous. Met us take an
illustration. Suppose that, at a given moment, a certain
number of people are engaged in the manufacture of pins.
They make as many pins as the world needs, working (say)
eight hours a day. Someone makes an invention by which the
same number of men can make twice as many pins: pins are
already so cheap that hardly any more will be bought at a
lower price. In a sensible world, everybody concerned in the
manufacturing of pins would take to working four hours
instead of eight, and everything else would go on as before.
But in the actual world this would be thought demoralizing.
The men still work eight hours, there are too many pins,
some employers go bankrupt, and half the men previously
concerned in making pins are thrown out of work. There is,
in the end, just as much leisure as on the other plan, but half
the men are totally idle while half are still overlooked. In
this way, it is insured that the unavoidable leisure shall cause
misery all round instead of being a universal source of
happiness. An anything more insane be imagined?

1256,my goals towards antiwork,"Hi everyone. So for years I've hated the idea of working 9 to 5 for the rest of my life until retirement where all my youth is gone. plus no guarantees. I may never make it to that age because you never know.

I also make only like 35 k a year. So now I've been investing. Started with 15k. Now have 62k as it has grown. Will be adding a few thousand to that and moving it all into accounts that grow on average 10 percent a year rather than the 7 percent a year average interest my current investments provide.

My goal is to hit 100 k, and buy a couple tiny houses (look up tiny houses), and buy each for about 25k to 30k. That way I have two homes in different parts of the country as my home bases. They'll be paid off meaning I won't have to worry about rent or a mortgage and they'll fit my minimalist lifestyle. Then from there my shit paying job will enable me much more freedom even though it pays shit because my earnings mostly can be saved. Then each year I'll be able to put a good 23k plus away (since I also do a few thousand in under the table work each year). At that point by my mid thirties I should have another 80k or so, which I can use to travel on the cheap, living in places like Thailand, doing Workaways or WOOFING, and just enjoying a mild life where a lot of my time is spend relaxing and doing music. 

Anyway it may bit be glamorous but it'll make me happy.

But from the perspective of whether the people should have to work, I guess I don‚Äôt understand how the cargo we want as consumers gets to us.  How does the cargo that other countries want from us get to them?  Without work...what happens?

1296,A question for the antiwork community,"tl;dr As an outsider to this community, I'm just interesting in what you all think about some questions I have. 

So,

While I wouldn't identify myself as a part of this community, I understand where you guys are coming from. I am lucky enough to enjoy the work I do, but I get how many people are fed up with capitalism and believe that life should be less about work.

But what I ask is: what is your solution? Nothing will happen unless the laws are changed. Do you argue for a universal basic income like Andrew Yang? Democratic socialism like Bernie Sanders? Do some of you identify as socialists or communists? I guess I just want to know what you guys think the solution to this is. I know many people would combat many of these ideas and say that socialism will never actually work. I think it's interesting, although I don't like to take sides in this debate. 

Another question: Are any of you former supporters of Donald Trump? Whether you like it or not, he has appealed to the populist movement in the US (although maybe you're not from the US). I could see someone being angry with the system, angry with being given an unlivable wage, and turning to Donald Trump for answers. Just a question, though. 

Last question: Do any of you enjoy work? I find it sad to see this community because I personally believe that fulfillment comes from having a meaningful life, and that often comes from one's life work. I am not saying that I think you all are sad. I am saying I think the conditions that have lead people to become anti work are sad. I just want to say that work can be fun. It can be the best part of your life. So I want to know if any of you enjoy work. Or maybe you don't enjoy what you call work, but you enjoy the art you make on the side.

For anyone that's interested, my ideas about having a meaningful life come from a book called Man's Search for Meaning by Victor Frankl. The author was a psychologist who survived multiple concentration camps in the holocaust, finding a will to live even in the bleakest of situations. He talks about the meaning of life. The book changed my life, and I don't doubt that it could change yours.

1318,I hate the fact that I have to go back to work tomorrow. I rather stay home and collect unemployment.,"Said everyone ever. Sigh.

This isn‚Äôt supposed to be a huge debate post of anything like that. I‚Äôm just kinda sad that I can‚Äôt stay home or at least work somewhere else that makes the extra unemployment boost income. I‚Äôm in New York and I‚Äôve been laid off twice since I work with a college. When the colleges open, I gotta go and do what I gotta do but it sucks. 

I‚Äôm forever grateful that NYS changed the rules and I‚Äôm able to collect unemployment still(I only work 20 hours a week, 4 hours a day) but I never liked my job. 

I have no friends there or anywhere near my home. All my friends live 8 hours away in nyc. Even going in today to take my covid test, none of my coworkers talked to me. Just to each other. My own boss didn‚Äôt even welcome me or say hi yet she talked to everyone else. Maybe they can sense that I‚Äôm over it and don‚Äôt want to be there. I‚Äôm the type of person that is friendly but stays to herself anyway. I‚Äôm never good at these ‚Äúimage‚Äù jobs that want a happy character all the time. It‚Äôs hard when you have ptsd and deal with flashbacks. 

I just wish I didn‚Äôt have to depend on the government and had the skills and qualifications to get better, meaningful opportunities in the work force. That‚Äôs why I rather just stay home, work out, learn skills at home like I‚Äôve been doing this whole pandemic. Work life is a sad life.

The people who do the checking, though, are in short supply lately. So this morning there was a considerable backup when I arrived at 7:55 like usual for my 8:00 start time. I didn't end up clocking in though til 8:06

When I walk in, the morning meeting is happening, and this fucking asshole, this embodiment of bootlicker mentality, starts looking at his watch all exaggerated like a silent movie actor and asking if there was full covid tests going on this morning. He knew they weren't. He was just bootlicking/thinking he was demonstrating his superiority, as he so often does. Seriously this guy can't talk for more than a sentence without calling someone a dumbass.

I was gonna let it go, but the subject of screeners being understaffed came up in the meeting. I spoke up and said ""Yeah they were backed up to the street this morning. I actually got here on time, but I'm glad to know (name of bootlicking piece of shit asshole)'s watch works. 

In his defense he did then do a little ""touche"" kinda gesture, nodding sagely and turning up his palms. But what really sucks is what my boss said next, annoyance clearly in his voice:

""You're supposed to clock in at 8:00. Anything beyond that and you're late""

I repeated that I was only late cuz we're understaffed at the screening area.

Nope, still my problem, according to my boss. And I guess only the bootlicker can fuck with other employees. Cuz I defended myself and my boss snapped at me.

I usually work 9-5:30 in chemistry but because I'm multi-skilled (have lots of previous experience and have worked at this particular company for 2 years now) I got roped into doing a night shift packing boxes in our warehouse and shipping orders from 11:00pm-7:00am for the next 2 or so weeks in order to clear huge amounts of backed up orders due to postal courier going nuts over Brexit, this was with a day's notice and has fucked up my body clock attempting to adjust my sleep pattern to fit, this was Thursday last week and I've been doing these shifts through until early this week, after finishing at 7 and driving home at 8:30 Tuesday morning I get a message telling me that we had in fact finished whatever task we were needed for and to resume normal hours the following day, so naturally pissed off I went back to bed and slept, the entire day.

All the way through from around 9:30 Tuesday morning till about 10:00 this morning, and obviously I overslept and was late for my shift, I woke up to no less than 6 missed calls asking me where I was etc and I panicked so I tried to collect myself and get my story straight but my head was pounding and I felt awful so I called in, explained myself and was honest about the situation and how my body clock wasn't used to such rapid changes in shift patterns and it has caught up with me.

I proceeded to get chewed out on the phone and lost a day's worth of holiday to cover my absence and honestly I'm pissed off.

I could have lied, I could have made something up or made an excuse but I was honest, and the way my manager spoke to me made me feel so worthless, I called up my parents and just asked for advice on what to do and essentially they reminded me that ""oh in today's working landscape you are more replaceable than ever because C19 &amp; layoffs etc"" and it just further frustrated me.

It's now around 11:00 and as I'm typing this I'm just wondering what is the fucking point man, like why is it so deplorable for me to be honest and admit my mistakes but when the company screws me around and asks so much of me that I have to keep bending myself to fit their mould or else I risk losing my job, house etc...

If you‚Äôve been fortunate to work from home during the pandemic, the work experience I‚Äôm sure, is light years than slaving in the office. Here‚Äôs the thing with WFH, it can be decent if you learn how to adequately finesse the system. The technique I‚Äôm going to teach you works with varying degrees of success depending on how robust your IT department is. I‚Äôve got tons of techniques that free me up. I chill pretty hard everyday. 

I‚Äôve got some many tricks in my toolkit, that range from psychological judo to technical hacks. Seriously, I hardly ever work, but that wasn‚Äôt always the case. The key to stress free chilling at work stems from first developing a reputation of quality work. This is one of the foundations of becoming a master bull shitter. You‚Äôve got to put in the work up front. 

Now on to today‚Äôs lesson. This technique is one of my favorites. If you need a break use this at your pleasure.

Step 1. Browse to Youtube. Search for a video related to the type of work you do, preferably something educational. Make sure it‚Äôs at least 30 minutes long.  

Step 2: Start the video and make sure its in full screen mode. When its in full screen mode, the computer does not go into sleep mode. It makes it look like you‚Äôre there working, especially if your job has a communicator tool like skype. You‚Äôll be green all day.

Step 3: Walk away. Have a glass of lemonade while you‚Äôre at it.

The US government absolutely hates entrepreneurship, we have one of the lowest rates of sole-proprietorships in the civilized world, believe it or not. 

Why is this? Well for starters, self employed people pay twice as much in tax. I think as a way to dissuade people from being self-employed. 

A normal employee working for an employer only pays half of FICA taxes, while a self-employed person pays 15.3%. 

You also receive no benefits. A full time worker might get a couple weeks paid vacation. Self-employed people not only receive no paid vacation, any time not working is a good chance of not earning money those days. Same goes for any sick or personal days.

If you are a full time, your employer might chip in around half of your dollar for a 401k. So if you put in $10, your employer will add $5, at no cost to you.

Self employed people don't get that luxury either.

1352,The problem isnt the wage you get per hour. Its that your wage is per hour and not per work.,"This is the real problem. Most of us are assigned jobs that we go to to work X hours for X wages. 

For example. A lumber mill worker goes into work and works his shift for 8 hours. If in that time he creates 100 boards ready for sale, the day is done and he goes home. 

Now if he is a boardmaking genius or works super hard and makes 200 boards, he receives no extra money. 

If he likewise makes 100 boards in 4 hours, he will be told to continue making boards for another 4 hours. 

It is established that 100 boards per 8 hours is acceptable, yet neither if the other two outcomes is deemed a success. 

The call center employee making 10 dollars an hour is expected to clear 10 calls an hour, making the value of the call 1.00 a piece. Yet clearing calls faster or better yields no bonus or benefit for working better. 80 calls is the expected workday, yet the employee clearing 80 calls doesnt get to wrap it up and say ""okay I did my part and my job""

This is why work is so oppressive. Because we are designed to never be done with our work and can never be satisfied with the work we have done. 

The worst statement in the modern world. ""If you've got time to lean, you've got time to clean"".  Cleaning isnt my job. General labor isnt my job. Being a miscellaneous task robot isnt job.

I cannot handle a 40 hour week like this anymore, especially when it requires a 40 minute commute to the office again like it does right now.

Today I remembered there are sanctions in place for converting to part time. It would be the perfect compromise for me, honestly. I'd probably be more productive even.

But when I actually read the rules for it...it was so depressing.

* You have to pay more for your health insurance, because you're working less hours 

* You earn less time off

* Your ""experience"" accrues half as fast (so one year of work counts to the organization as six months experience)

* They explicitly state ""working part time is a privilege that can be taken away at management's discretion

...so I looked into the organization's work/life balance resources, and found two powerpoints about work/life balance, and dealing with burnout.

Some choice concepts from those...

Work/life:

* You have five buckets to put your life tasks into. Don't overfill one bucket at the expense of others! 

* Be sure to exercise, get enough sleep, eat healthy, save all your money for the future, and teach your kids to do this too! (But don't forget you have to be here 40+ hours a week)

* The US is one of the lowest happiness ranked countries in the world, and only has 12 weeks maternity leave in some companies. But *your* time management is the problem.

Burnout:

* Relax! Take breaks! Do things differently! (Like wear a silly tie to the office!)

* When in doubt, work as hard as possible so you have something to achieve and get you through it! (Literally, one of their suggested distractions was ""work as hard as possible"")

Why the fuck is it an either/or situation here? I want to have a job that pays enough to live, but I also have mental health issues (and capitalism issues) that make it very unhealthy for me to be forcing myself to work full time. Part time would be perfect, but I already barely can afford to live...cutting my salary, my leave, and my mandatoryretirement contributions significantly are the opposite of what I need. Not to mention the whole ""working less is a privilege only for the best employees who have proved they earn it"".

So here‚Äôs some context: I‚Äôm 22, did my 4 year degree because my parents wouldn‚Äôt allow me to not attend university, (I actually enjoyed school however because I felt my liberal arts degree actually taught me a lot about humanism and such)

I was a ‚Äòhigh achiever‚Äô (whatever the fuck that means) all through school and had huge goals for myself (or more to feel like my parents were proud of me I‚Äôve now come to realize), and now I just don‚Äôt care about achievement or work or anything like that. 

I‚Äôve been unemployed the last year because I‚Äôve had zero luck finding a job in a rural part of the UK. Luckily I had barely enough money saved and a parter that can get us by financially. But I‚Äôm now moving back to the US and job searching again because I feel like I need that financial stability to pay my loans and afford things like my own family and nice vacations. 

I had an interview yesterday, psyched myself up for it, spent a whole day practicing talking points and researching the company- all for just one hour of my time with a recruiter. Now I just feel like shit after realizing all this work is essentially for nothing. 

I really really don‚Äôt want to dedicate my life to some giant companies money making operation. But I also need mental stimulation and to not be delinquent on student loans- so I‚Äôm considering graduate school (but I also feel like it‚Äôs just gonna put me in an even shittier financial situation in the long run but I do enjoy learning and higher education).

I just hate that my parents have brainwashed me my whole life to believe that we have to work to get by. They get so judgemental when I won‚Äôt just accept any random job or work my ass off for a place that just wants nothing but for me to overwork myself for shit pay.

So basically sacrifice your entire life hoping that you‚Äôll somehow geat ahead of sky high prices and inflation.

But it‚Äôs just bullshit, at least where I am, home ownership is decreasing every year, while house prices are shooting up thousands of dollars every year, and rent isn‚Äôt dropping anytime soon.

We‚Äôve also heard things like ‚Äúmove to a more rural location, rent and houses are cheaper‚Äù and so I did. The median house price in the rural area I live is $500,000 USD. 

‚ÄúWell, buy a bit of land and put a house on it‚Äù Land is $180,000 for a small block. Oh, you need to subdivide the land? That‚Äôll be another $80,000. Oh and don‚Äôt forget about all the infrastructure levies as well.

The fact is, you can work as hard as you want, but there are so many things stacked against you. Governments won‚Äôt even do anything about it as investors and home owners can have such an influence when elections come around. 

And the other fact is, not everyone can just go get a higher paying job either. Plus if everyone had higher paying jobs, take a guess what would happen.

1411,I perform a bullshit job but still there are significant responsibilities,"Hello,

I have been working as software engineer for a corporate company. (like for 5 years) The platform I work on is an enterprise solutions platform(software) . I don't want to give out much details but It is like SAP...

Why do I call my job bullshit? 

The owner of the platform allows you to do some customisation on their solution based on your company's need. You have to be admin and / or developer to be able to do these customization.

 Things like, when you click on a button, It shows alert on screen or when you select value x from field y, another value z will populate on field b etc  Or department abc wants to move their inefficient and ancient processes to this platform by copying and pasting the same process into this platform because ""It is how they have been doing their job"" since years.

That's all I do as work and It is meaningless so much. It is not hard or challenging but working environment is chaotic and I still have responsibilities on the platform. It is demanding all the time and  other business departments do try to change and improve their existing process frequently because they also have to keep themselves busy somehow. Who cares about these things seriously?

I mean, If company decides to ditch this platform all the work I have done will be gone into black hole. They will opt about another platform to boost the abilities of the business and this cycle repeats Itself for each 3 - 4 years...

I can't handle the meaninglessness of my job anymore but I also can't deteriorate my performance as It would be realised rapidly ( as I told the job is demanding) and don't want to lose my job during the pandemic.

Is there any suggestions for me to have less stressful and laid back job in couple years?",False,lgtw0f,dortmund-ist-gut,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lgtw0f/i_perform_a_bullshit_job_but_still_there_are/,1,1

1433,The obsessiveness with productivity and performance,"I feel I am at a new breaking point due to facing another and new highly stressful work environment I am in. I always try to comply with my co-workers' expectations of how they want me to be as I am afraid of getting into verbal dispute confrontations with colleagues who just don't accept no for an answer and keep on accusing and blaming me for having a different opinion than theirs and threatening me that I'll lose my job if I continue to let them down for being assertive.

I expect a lot of myself and often feel apathetic and harbor subconscious regrets about waiting long to act in an environment that is very competitive and therefore wish I could confidently present myself instead in such surroundings, blend in easily, and be quick to respond and answer without hesitation and waiting for turns and just stand up for what I believe in as if it's no big deal but the stress of negative looks and responses just gets to me that I can hardly breathe normally.

The truth is I can no longer bear being mocked, humiliated, and rivaled with by other workers and being told that I am slow, stuck-up, even weak, too soft, too modest, lacking vigor, and impaired in level of professional skills or even timid for processing stimuli deeply and introvertedly and so I am judged as half-hearted and absentminded and unfit to take center of things fearlessly.

I feel hurt and upset by the constant commandings and argumentativeness in the workplace and so I have become adjusted to just tolerate it as if 'numb' from seeing how aggressive co-workers successfully dominate colleagues with a more sensitive nature and I therefore feel no inspiration and added value to go to work anymore as I want to do only good unto others and not feel guilty and ashamed anymore for not being able to always do this hence I feel burned out with all this anger boiling inside of me in response to constant unnecessary conflicts at work just because everyone wants to exceed everyone else.

I cannot deny how emotionally trapped and remote I feel within as if I am hiding or walking away from work incidents and positions with the highest resistance and the biggest responsibilities despite knowing that only making efforts to contribute is what matters and not how big or small it is or wanting to be in control. I wish I could take the front lead without spurting or stammering and handle negative and unfair criticism, hostility and rudeness steadily without going red of embarrassment.

I feel despicable because I am an open and easy-going person and talk frankly about my shortcomings and honest views and colleagues just seem to take it as a means to manipulate me on it so I get to serve them in whatever they order me to. I just don't want to be condescended on when I set my boundaries. While it is self-absorbed to want to escape the every day hassle of social struggles, it doesn't mean I am lazy or irresponsible but to face new episodes of mental anguish for being misjudged and not be approved as an equal member of the so maniest company in my career is frightful and humiliating.

I feel hesitant and afraid of how to say no sometimes at this stage, knowing exactly how my co-workers will argue bluntly why not and act as if not convinced, finding me rather odd, until I give up and just tell them that they are right. I feel aggravated with myself for opting out last minute at times now instead of to continue giving my full potential. I just don't want co-workers to push me to do more until I snap and that I might not be able to handle it as they want me to and so I keep dimmed at the background. I am tired of the insolences of getting criticized as unsure, not showing myself enough, not daring enough to take on new initiatives and for saying too little.

All the bullying has led me to become so self-conscious when speaking in front of my co-workers that it is nerve breaking and I'd rather take the day off or work alone without any supervision which also doesn't help in the long run because the lack of connectivity with other colleagues leads me to become aggravated. I try to be amongst the firsts to try something new or offer help but may just stand frozen busy with analyzing everything while I am expected to act on the spot.

It pains me how not just I but also other people in the workplace face so much strain on their shoulders to always overperform and not being appreciated as valid and worthy real individuals but rather be treated as objects that are replaceable anytime. It is traumatizing how stepping up to the wicked ways of any company's policies only worsens the situation because of the hierarchical order of the senior positioned having all the might to have the last word even if it is so nonsensical what it concludes. I don't know and understand where such highly egotistical attitudes are leading the nations of the world to but it is worrisome.",False,lfpfci,Mystical-Prince,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lfpfci/the_obsessiveness_with_productivity_and/,1,1

As if that isn‚Äôt enough, we must feel grateful for the opportunity.

There are certain professions that one can be passionate about such as healthcare. But for the most part, passion for work is a fabricated lie we tell ourselves and our employers due to the fear of being let go. 

How can we be passionate about a job that constantly degrades us into thinking we aren‚Äôt good enough with performance reviews? How can we be passionate about something that scolds us for taking days off for being sick or simply just needing a mental health day? How can we be passionate about something that will replace us immediately if we run into hard times outside of work that force us to take time off?

1441,At what point do you just say ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù?,"I just worked from 6 AM to 9 PM. I get up at 4:00 AM every day and usually go to sleep around 10. I am a security system service technician for a massive corporation. I make roughly $50,000 a year. I have not eaten for more than 24 hours. I drove more than 370 miles today. Tomorrow I will do the same thing, and the day after that too. My boss yells at me day in and day out for things that aren‚Äôt even a problem, like needing to come into work early every day and pick up parts and equipment I need. He reprimands me in group chats in front of my coworkers who all hate my guts for some reason anyway. I need all of this equipment every day because of the volume of work I am required to do. Despite all of this, I am still late to work nearly every day because I commute about two hours to the city they have arbitrarily decided is ‚Äúmy area.‚Äù

Most of my job is done by someone else in an office in New York. I plug devices in and then have to call or text someone light years away to actually make the devices work. This waiting period can be anywhere from five minutes to more than an hour, with no indicator of how long it will ever take. I spend 100% of my day either driving or in strangers‚Äô homes.

I don‚Äôt even get two days off in a row, and on my days off, I sleep between 14 and 16 hours to make up for my lost time. I don‚Äôt get paid for my first and last drives of the day, which equates to about three hours of what is essentially unpaid overtime. I regularly fall asleep at the wheel. I am not able to use my personal vehicle anymore as it has company equipment inside it at all times. It is full of boxes, tools, and wires to the point that it is difficult to shift gears. I will post pics tomorrow if anyone wants them. I regularly go several days without showering, washing my clothes, or eating because I simply do not have time to do so. I buy between one and three tanks of gas every day.

But, do you really think I have time to work full-time, go to college full-time, and work on pieces for my portfolio? And even if I did, the stress from my job is exhausting me. All I want to do after 5pm is lay down, maybe read a few chapters of a novel, and go to sleep. I'm too tired to even play video games which is normally a great stress reliever for me.  

Just to have time to work on my portfolio, not even considering the fact that I am very burnt out and have physical symptoms of anxiety every day, I'm thinking of quitting my job. The problem is that, while I have savings to last me about a year (including college tuition) that doesn't include the fact that I'm going to need surgery soon that will cost &gt;$10k and that my car is kind of dying.

1477,Why aren't more countries like Northern Europe?,"I'm European (but not the nordic paradise Europe, the southern complicated Europe).   

My country has a lot of problems with low wages, high cost of living (due to a lot of tourism and richer Europeans coming to live here, increasing the prices for everyone), a toxic work culture where you are expected to work infinite hours with no extra pay, ridiculous hierarchical companies where you treat your bosses like gods, infinite meetings, and everyone is always late, which shows 0 respect for people's time. However, we do have social security, with free healthcare and education.    

I lived in nordic Europe, where you can see how a civilized country should function. Let me just exemplify some of the features:   

* Not only is education free, kids actually GET PAID to go to school. As you go up from primary to secondary education, you receive more money. In University (I studied there) you get paid around 850USD per month.
* There is no stupid hierarchies anywhere. I called my University teachers by their first name. People just don't expect to be treated in a special way because of their status.
* Government officials, such as Ministers and even the Prime Minister, use public transportation or ride a bike to go to work. No fancy cars, chauffeurs, or whatever for daily things. No, they are normal people like you and me.
* High wages which are adapted to the cost of living - obviously with high taxes to support the incredible free healthcare and education systems they have. Even with high taxes, you can have a lot of money at the end of the month.
* Meetings start and end at the stated hours. People don't tolerate delays, or people who just like to hear themselves speak or who are speaking with nothing to say. 
* You are expected to leave the office at the end of your work schedule. If you stay longer, you will get reprimanded as it is seen as you are not competent enough to do your job in the time allocated to it.
* Lot's of paid vacation days, and sick leaves are just normal to take. Maternity leave is fully paid and you can take up to 1 year, if I'm not mistaken.
* The work hours are short, you are generally free by 4PM, unless you work in shifts. 

And then they are always ranked in top 5 of the happiest countries in the world. People live well, feel safe and it works well. There is no need or tolerance for corruption because people are getting paid fairly and have time to enjoy life.

I'm looking through the internet seeing so many websites and articles saying that the work week is bad and all that and I agree but how the hell do I personally not work and at the same time not starve to death on the streets?

Is there no answer yet?

Is it work until I can't take it any more and off myself or starve to death? Are they my only options?",False,lh3djf,BadJungleratm,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lh3djf/what_are_my_actual_options_other_than_work/,23,3

What time do you wake up and what time do you clock in/start working?","Pre-pandemic my schedule was 7-3:30 with a one hour one way commute. had to wake up at 5am to get ready and go get on the train. My pandemic schedule has shifted over time. 9-9:30am is probably the latest I can get away with clocking in but I try to do 8am to not work so late.

On days like every day this week where I‚Äôm extremely tired for some reason I set an alarm for 7:30, take Adderall, alarm goes off at 7:45, snooze, alarm goes off at 8, pull my phone out and try to wake up groggy af, sleep for another 10-15 or try to wake up, get up around 8:30-8:40 to get ready, start work by 9. 

Every two weeks I have an 8:30 one on one with my manager and it‚Äôs a struggle to get up and eat cereal before the meeting starts.

1486,How Are People So Rich?,"Hello All,

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 24 year old American male. I was lucky enough to land a job in my field after finishing college. I am the head of my department, yet I make less than what an Assistant would make in my field. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do not make enough money to live on my own yet and I am nearing completion of the first quarter of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I took an alternate route home today and the houses were completely ridiculous. I saw one house that had an entire street that led to its driveway.

&amp;#x200B;

Something is really wrong with this. There are multifamily households living in 1-2 bedroom apartments. There are tons of homeless people, and thousands of people are in danger of losing their homes or businesses.

&amp;#x200B;

I really hope that society will figure out how to deal with the super-rich.  It's just completely bizarre to drive by multimillion dollar homes and also see homeless people within the span of a 15 minute drive.  

&amp;#x200B;

I used to think that once I graduated and landed a job, I would be able to move out and I could be myself. It's crushing to see the goalposts of that dream shifted further away. I could get a second job, but I already have a 9-5, and I receive calls after 5 sometimes. I am doing the work of 3 people for the price of 1. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure where I could work part-time where it would be profitable. If I did find that job, when would I sleep?

&amp;#x200B;

I am sure many other people ask themselves the same question; and I'm certain that many others no longer have to ask.

1489,Start with the liberation of desire | CrimethInc.,"Growing up in this society, not even our passions are our own; they are cultivated by advertising and other forms of propaganda to keep us running on the treadmills of the marketplace. Thanks to indoctrination, people can be quite pleased with themselves for doing things that are bound to make them miserable in the long run. We are locked into our suffering and our pleasures are the seal.

To be truly free, we need leverage over the processes that produce our desires. Liberation doesn‚Äôt just mean fulfilling the desires we have today, but expanding our sense of what is possible, so our desires can shift along with the realities they drive us to create. It means turning away from the pleasure we take in enforcing, dominating, and possessing, to seek pleasures that wrench us free of the machinery of obedience and competition. If you‚Äôve ever broken an addiction, you have a taste of what it means to transform your desires.

Super creepy. They said the put them in so people don‚Äôt steal from the register, which is a problem we‚Äôve had before. 

So I just work the drive thru window and I get tons of tips. Like $20 during a 4 hour shift, which is a lot considering they only pay me $8 and hour. So around the same time they put in the cameras they decided they would split the tips between everyone who worked that night. I was kinda mad about that since I‚Äôm the one getting all the tips by being all jive and polite, but whatever.

So lately I management hasn‚Äôt been giving me my tips at all. I asked my boss why and he said he thinks someone‚Äôs been stealing from the registers because there‚Äôs been money missing. And he‚Äôs been using the tips to cover the losses. I asked him why he doesn‚Äôt just check the security cameras to see who is stealing and he said he doesn‚Äôt have time to go through all that footage. 

THEN WHY TF DID TOU BUY THE CAMERAS JN THE FIRST PLACE? 

And the kicker is that they aren‚Äôt even supposed to have me working the window, only managers are supposed to do that. Know why? BECAUSE IF THEY LET EVERYONE DO IT SOMEONE IS PROBABLY GONNA STEAL.

Meanwhile I could give a shit if I work 4 hours (my shift is 5-9) the pay is abysmal anyway and I was making more off unemployment.

My dad has been on my ass for a full time job since I graduated in May. He wants me to have everything he does: 401k, full benefits, good insurance. 

 In all reality, I don't mind being looked at as lazy because I know education wise I'm not.  I feel like I'd be more willing to go to work If the pay wasn't trash and if my dad didn't put relentless pressure on me.

I envy people who can make a living off hobbies and stuff they enjoy. All I have going for me Is being an excellent student. Too bad I can't make a living off being a professional one

1528,You Cannot be Anti-Work and a Consumerist,"Summary: You cannot be ‚Äúanti-work‚Äù while also buying things that force you to work to pay for them. The better solution is to unplug from capitalism so you can work as little as possible. 

I have been lurking this subreddit for awhile now. There‚Äôs a lot of interesting stuff. 

I joined the sub because my two favorite books are ‚ÄúEscape Everything‚Äù by Robert Wringham and ‚ÄúThe Freedom Manifesto‚Äù by Tom Hodgkinson. If you have not read these books, stop what you‚Äôre doing and get them.

I read 2-3 books a month, and these two books are the absolute best at questioning how stupid modern society is (they‚Äôre also hilarious). We wake up, get dressed, and get into a car to go to a place to pay for the clothes, car, and also the house we just left. It‚Äôs all so stupid. 

But here‚Äôs the thing ‚Äî there‚Äôs two parts to this. Work is stupid and boring and futile. 

BUT SO IS ALL THE CONSUMERIST CRAP ‚Äî and it is that consumerist crap that is making you work. 

New car? New clothes? Newest iPhone? 15 subscriptions? Netflix? Prime? Cable? Hulu? Unlimited data plan? Takeout every day? 

IT IS ALL BULLSHIT. All of it. 

Money can only buy two things ‚Äî (1) consumerist stuff/services or (2) time. Do you want your money to buy stuff or time? If you are anti-work the answer is time. And that means not falling for the consumerist trap. 

If your monthly expenses are $3,000 per month, you need $18,000 to take a six month vacation. But if your monthly expenses are $2,000 per month, that same $18,000 gets you nine months off. 

Extrapolate this further and you eventually get to the FIRE/early retirement movement. But that requires a plan, and part of that plan is not falling for all the consumerist bullshit. 

I‚Äôm not going to pretend to be a visionary because others have said this before me, including the authors I mentioned. But here‚Äôs the point ‚Äî you can‚Äôt quit work if you‚Äôre also a consumerist. It is definitionally impossible. 

Are there systemic issues worth discussing? Of course. Predatory lending, systemic racism, student loans, etc ‚Äî all of it is worthy of discussion. 

But while you engage in civic debate to right these wrongs, you have to focus on your locus of control. That means making a plan to escape the rat race, and that requires not falling for the consumerist trap.

1541,I‚Äôm 26 and don‚Äôt want to work ever. I want to be a housewife but haven‚Äôt met the right person. What should I do?,"I‚Äôm a 26 year old woman. I went to university and studied nursing for two years but dropped out. Even whilst I was studying and we had work placements, I felt miserable, I was forcing myself to go there everyday. The day I quit felt really good. Having a job has always felt like a depressing concept to me, I don‚Äôt understand how other people enjoy it, I am introverted and quite shy and sometimes socially anxious. So interacting with most people is not fun for me. I also like doing things my own way and in my own time, I don‚Äôt enjoy telling people what to do and don‚Äôt want a boss who tells me what to do either,l. I don‚Äôt like routine and following someone else‚Äôs commands. Also I daydream A LOT and find it difficult to concentrate. I think I have some of the symptoms of ADHD but not received a diagnosis. I have been diagnosed with dyspraxia though. I also lack strength and energy, so find some types of work too physically tiring.

I had a Job recently at Amazon, it wasn‚Äôt difficult but it was mind-numbingly boring! I felt like a robot, having a Job doesn‚Äôt give me any satisfaction or self-esteem, I feel much happier when I am at home. Over the past few years I‚Äôve worked in healthcare, admin work, warehouse and I didn‚Äôt like any of them. I quit each job soon after starting, I‚Äôm not materialistic but I do want financial independence . I live with my mother who is helpful sometimes but toxic, she‚Äôs very difficult at times and I feel miserable being around her. All I want is to live a simple happy life, be married and be a mother. Although I‚Äôve grown up in a dysfunctional family, I am very maternal and know I will be a good mother and wife. It‚Äôs all I‚Äôve ever dreamed of.

I‚Äôve tried dating since the past year through apps but haven‚Äôt met the right person yet. I‚Äôm not willing to marry anyone just because I want them to provide for me, I want to vibe with them emotionally and physically. So my dream of becoming a housewife and mother hasn‚Äôt come true yet. Also I have faced a lot of judgement, when I‚Äôve been honest and told men I don‚Äôt have a job, I got the famous question ‚Äòwhat do you do all day?‚Äô And see men weren‚Äôt interested in me after that. So then I lied and said I have a part time job. After that I got the question, ‚Äòwhy only part time? What do you do the rest of the days?‚Äô Lol I was still judged. I don‚Äôt think many men are interested in a housewife these days. Does anyone have any tips for me?

My interests include religion, organic and natural living, being in nature, travelling, spending time with family, watching films, I enjoyed English and writing at school, cooking although I‚Äôve not a pro chef yet! Is there anything I can do that will make me some income, based on my interests? I want to find something I enjoy but I lose interest and concentration in things quickly. I know I don‚Äôt want a regular job but I‚Äôm not sure what to do in life that will make me some money and won‚Äôt make me feel miserable and depressed!",False,lc40ww,sa5800,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lc40ww/im_26_and_dont_want_to_work_ever_i_want_to_be_a/,22,12
1542,Is my boss out of line for doing this?,"Hey guys. I‚Äôm in a little bit of a pickle here with my job.

I work for a small security company with only a handful of guards. It‚Äôs an easy job that allows me to have a lot of free time during my working days and the days that I‚Äôm off. I really do like it and I want to stay. However, my boss has been doing/saying some alarming things lately. I work 4 days out of the week and we agreed when I was hired that it would be my set schedule. I was also supposed to only be a temporary seasonal employee but I am now permanent. I have a busy life outside of work with commitments I can‚Äôt just give up, so this job worked for me in the beginning. But recently, I‚Äôve been getting calls almost every week from my supervisor to work on my days off. Often times I don‚Äôt even get a 24 hour notice and I get called late at night. A week or two ago, I had to give up 2 out of the 3 days I had off just to cover shifts. A few days ago, my boss said something to me that raised up many red flags. These are her exact words: ‚ÄúIf we call you to come work and you say no, we‚Äôre gonna have to just let you go. Guards think they can just get a paycheck without doing the work, but nope. There‚Äôs people out there who are unemployed and hungry who would love to have your spot so we should be grateful.‚Äù


Obviously most of you can see how that‚Äôs a major problem. Today she called and said that one of the workers said they had called me on the radio and I didn‚Äôt respond. But immediately after she brought that up, she asked me to work on my day off AGAIN. It would have been 3 weeks in a row if I said yes. She also asked me to work 5 days a week now instead of only 4. All I could mutter was a ‚Äúuhh.. um, y-yeah I guess thats... okay‚Äù (sucks being an introvert that has a hard time saying no). At this point, I‚Äôm just scared of saying no because I don‚Äôt want to be fired. This is the first stable job I‚Äôve had in almost an entire year. I‚Äôve only been employed for 4 months. I need the money right now and I don‚Äôt want a termination to be etched on my job history. So what should I do? Should I quit before they fire me? How should I handle these situations? I thought this was a good company at first but they‚Äôre proving to be pretty dodgy. I should have listened to my mother to not agree to the job when the boss called me just an hour after I first applied.

1546,"I was closer than I had ever been, but I threw it all away.","I used to work a job that had a non typical schedule. I worked 48 hour shifts but had 96 hours off in return.  I generally only actually worked about 4-6 hours per day when I was on shift- 630am to 1230ish each day depending on the situation.  Once all tasks for the day were complete, I would go to my bedroom/office at work and play video games, watch movies, play guitar, read, do other hobbies or hang out with my coworkers until I went to bed, and then rinse and repeat.  After the 48 hours I would be free to do whatever I wanted the next 4 days.  If I took off for a shift then I just used 2 days PTO and had 10 days off.  My coworkers were great, my boss was extremely levelheaded and was never the type to impose his authority, and most of the time he was right along side us.  Plus everybody had the mentality of ‚Äòlet‚Äôs get work done ASAP so we can go fuck around and relax faster.‚Äô

At the start of covid since we were essential, we changed our schedules to limit the amount of traffic and reduce the spread. We started doing 1 full week on shift and 2 full weeks off.   

It was amazing!  In all honesty it was like I was just hanging out with my friends, we cooked for each other, had poker games, halo tournaments and just in general had a good time.  The work itself was even fun for the most part.   I had never been so relaxed in my life, I never or rarely ever dreaded coming in to work I looked forward to being there at times even.  And I was paid pretty well for it!  It was hard to beat.  

I could still be there, but for personal reasons I had to move across the country and took another job in the same industry, but with a more standard work schedule.   I now work 4 10 hour shifts a week (which I know is still better than some have) but I had gotten the taste of essentially not having to work.  

Now I have micromanaging bosses, ‚Äúfast paced environment‚Äù BS, and I dread going to sleep because I know I‚Äôm going to hate waking up the next day.  I try to maintain a positive attitude, I‚Äôm a happy person but every day that I walk into work I feel my sanity slipping away, and the shitty part is that my life outside of work has improved tremendously, but I can‚Äôt truly appreciate it because work is taking a serious toll on me.  I contemplate never showing up again, walking out midshift, I job hunt at work, and all I see is a bleak future.   I saw the light and I‚Äôll never be the same again.

Fuck those people. $16.34 in my area is bare minimum despite being 233% times the poverty line. 

* I drive my car into gas stations with so little gas the car has stopped calculating the remaining miles -- even before the pandemic I barely drove anywhere. 
* I eat beans and rice for most of my meals.
* I live in the cheapest apartment I could find that wouldn't give me cancer, accounting for 38% of my total monthly income.
* I feel privileged to have bought a gaming computer in better times but it remains my sole source of entertainment as it costs pennies in electricity to operate.
* I can't afford clothes. 
* My credit score is above average for my age. I have zero missed payments.
* I pay $2400/yr for health insurance that I can't afford to use.

$15/hr is borderline starvation in this hellhole of a country. The economy is NOT the best it has ever been. Fuck these people, I want my labor to be capable of feeding myself but apparently that's too much to ask for.

There is already a program like this on BBC. I can't remember what
it's called. But it takes families who are wealthy and ones living in
poverty and switch them. Its very entertaining, but not like ""ha ha""
or outrageous like of reality programs. It's actually more real reality.

Most of the time the rich family admits that they really had no idea
how hard it was to live like that, and often they offer to help get the
poverty family a better job and stuff. One even funded the started
costs for the husband in the poverty family to start his own business,
and that made a huge difference in their life.

One-way video interviews are increasing in popularity with organizations around the world as they are more convenient for candidates earlier in the process and they allow you to tell more about yourself than a traditional screening method.‚Äù

In our system we get a bigger raise based on our performance. My boss pretty much exclusively picked out the bad things in the year and ignored all the extra effort just to keep my score low enough to not have to give a better raise.

That one fucking time that I couldn't make a deadline was highlighted, and the 10 times I busted my ass to make it weren't even discussed. 

She also pretty much just invented excuses on the spot. I was accused of being inefficient. The whole goddamn year I get told I do it well and during the review it's suddenly not so good anymore.

1563,There is nothing wrong with not caring about being an ‚Äúintellectual.‚Äù,"Humanity has always received value from all areas, art, science, literature, sports, entertainment and especially straight manual labor. There are clearly many valuable traits in humans beyond their IQ or studiousness. Roles that were once accepted as a noble part of society are now condescendingly referred to as ‚Äúdead end jobs‚Äù by out-of-touch middle class assholes, stripping away any dignity that working class people may feel for their work. So they‚Äôre already underappreciated by their employers and now they work hard serving people all day only to have their customers think less of them too. There is no reason that you can‚Äôt appreciate your maid as much as your doctor. 

Did people ridicule all the ‚Äúnon-intellectuals‚Äù before modern society and STEM got a chokehold on human perception? Nope, because then they would‚Äôve had to ridicule the majority of society. Nowadays, there seems to be this narrative that once you‚Äôre deemed one of the ‚Äúdumb‚Äù ones, people can go open season on your character and you don‚Äôt deserve boundaries. It‚Äôs even worse with millennials and Gen Z imo, a race to see who‚Äôs smartest in every single social interaction. I blame the toxic, hypercompetitive school/work environments and the myth of an intellect-based meritocracy being anything but dehumanizing. If we really want to reduce the increasing suffering in this world, EQ matters WAY more than IQ or creating the latest gadget. We‚Äôre getting to a point where science and technology are becoming invasive parts of our lives, I felt this way as soon as things like Amazon Alexa came out. And no I‚Äôm not a Boomer, I‚Äôm 21.

What‚Äôs sad is that people just eat it up and think ‚Äúmore technology is good‚Äù no matter what. There is no room for nuance, as a society we are willingly giving the keys of the future to a bunch of out-of-touch privileged techies and hackers. And we rationalize it by saying ‚Äúthey are geniuses for inventing this tech, they deserve to be the ones driving us forward indefinitely.‚Äù Never mind that post-2000 tech has arguably created more problems than solutions. Social media was a mistake and the greatest cause of increasing mental health issues. If tech was really as flawless as commonly perceived, we‚Äôd be a lot further along in fighting climate change than where we are, just starting to truly care on a global level. It‚Äôs time to pump the brakes and see if ‚Äústagnation‚Äù might actually be a good thing. Progress for the sake of progress is a path straight to AI taking everyone‚Äôs jobs. And with how religiously many worship capitalism and the illusion of meritocracy, it‚Äôs hard to imagine the majority agreeing to a post-work society. The point of technology is to reduce the amount of work done by humans while improving their livelihoods. And yet here we are, more tech than ever, mini-computers in all of our pockets, still working 40 hour weeks like 100 years ago and wages (relative to purchasing power and productivity) continuing to decrease. 

Not sure how many here have read ‚ÄúThe War on Stupid People‚Äù but it was an eye-opener for me on how the world is becoming more and more elitist by default. There is a certain level of entitlement people in this era seem to have when it comes to disrespecting flat earthers, anti-vaxxers, religious people, antinatalists, autistics, so-called losers/underachievers, antiwork-supporters, and anyone else not perfectly in tune with the values of society‚Äôs out-of-touch ‚Äúleaders‚Äù or ‚Äúsmart people.‚Äù People are allowed to believe what they want and each person has their reasons. They‚Äôre also allowed to be content with lifestyles deemed ‚Äúunsuccessful‚Äù by the neoliberal masses as long as they‚Äôre not harming anyone. The false belief in ‚Äúmeritocracy‚Äù is often used to mistreat those perceived to be on the lower end of it. A lot of people have stopped playing the game because they see it‚Äôs pointless and putting in more labor than necessary serves the corrupt capitalist system more than the individual in the end. Better to live frugally and work less than the ‚Äústrive for more status symbols‚Äù culture that fuels consumerism. Screw the arbitrary social hierarchy and people who define others by their place on it. 

As long as they‚Äôre not trying to tell you how to live your life or effect public policy, you shouldn‚Äôt ridicule someone for their beliefs. No matter how ‚Äúanti-intellectual‚Äù you perceive them to be. Being an intrusive, nitpicky asshole who wants to suck them into debates and try to make them look ‚Äústupid‚Äù doesn‚Äôt accomplish anything and just makes people want to avoid you.",False,lcbagp,[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lcbagp/there_is_nothing_wrong_with_not_caring_about/,1,10

It would be more fair to allow people to work 28 hours. Then it is not slavery. Because if we think that people can work 8 hours a day, then a full week would be 56 hours (7*8).

A lot of people view laziness as a negative of a person‚Äôs personality, when its just the opposite of the desire to work. We cant work forever at all times without literally dying, so everyone is inevitably lazy at some point, but we cant be lazy forever either for the same reason. At some point we‚Äôll have to put in some sort of effort to accomplish some task, like making breakfast or reading a book, whatever makes us feel good. Because we want to. This obviously doesn‚Äôt work in a capitalist society though, and so in choosing to follow our desires in what work we wish to do, it is labeled lazy and unproductive. Its a demonization of people who don‚Äôt make money, and its an immoral way of disrespecting another person‚Äôs use of energy and time. This is why I just cant see laziness as a negative trait anymore, its like putting someone down for their expression of free will. 

I know in posting here Im going to get a biased response but this is just something thats been on my mind for a while and Id love to hear from people who feel similarly.

Sometimes in life you get obliterated by drunk-driver running a red-light and sometimes you just happen to be born to a particular family in a particular place - and sometimes the second is the only thing it takes to manifest the first, no matter what happens in-between.

There's absolutely no amount of ""personal responsibility"" or a set of ""alternate decisions"" that can change ""What Is"" and just because we can imagine a different scenario that doesn't mean anything other than that we can imagine a different scenario. 

You can certainly *imagine* the brick that was improperly secured and flew off the truck-bed in front of you *didn't* just smash through the windshield and pulverize your partner's face to a bloody pulp - but it *did* and there was absolutely nothing you could or could not have done to prevent it.

This is such a significant part of life that we all mostly  ignore because to acknowledge it is to acknowledge that terrifying lack of control, the exact opposite of what our sense of 'self' inclines us to believe - that 'I' is something 'in control', a comforting illusion maintained spectacularly well until confronted with the uncaring randomness of death.

But life is just as uncaring random.

1583,She Quit After One Day,"Hey everybody, I'm currently feeling that deep Sunday night dread for the coming work week, and before I get high to try not to think about it, I just wanted to vent.

I work as a Production Assistant for a TV series. 12 hours a day (minimum), 5 days a week.

I feel so fucking lost. I wanted a life in the film industry, I didn't want my life to \*be\* the film industry, but here I am. 

The thing that's pissing me off most is when I complain about the 60-hour workweek, my family and friends don't seem like they're on the same page as me. They tell me I'd enjoy it if my boss wasn't so shitty. I find it hard to believe anyone could enjoy signing their life and identity away to a minimum wage job, but here I am. 

I worked my ass off in college to graduate a semester early. Ended off my time there at the top of most of my classes. I had two professors giving me gifts, telling me I was their favorite student and that they see me going places in the future. 

And now, here I am, getting chewed out daily by my boss for not restocking the chips in the breakroom to her liking. 

And I'm aware my boss is fucking toxic. Hell, we hired a new PA last week, and she left after one day. As we were leaving the office she asked if it's always this toxic here, and I gave her an honest answer. The next day I find her name placard in the trash. She never came back. Boss never said anything. 

But the thing that's CRAZY to me is that when I complain about this job, everyone's just like ""you'd like it if you had a better boss""

Like, WHAT? I can't even wrap my brain around it. How can anyone enjoy having their entire life be meaningless tasks around an office? 

The other reply I get a lot is ""well, you'll work your way up the ladder and it'll get better.""

EVERYONE works 10 - 15 hour shifts. The only people who don't are the accounting department and the fucking showrunner. We're expected to work through our lunchbreak, so the only time I get a break is when I'm on the fucking toilet. 

And it just crushes me. I have no time to play videogames with the friends I've spent years getting to know. I've had to cut people out of my life. I don't even make dinner most nights. I just crawl into bed and cry. I'm exhausted at all times. I don't have time to work on personal projects or visit my family. When the weekend hits, I spend most of it asleep or doing the chores I couldn't do during the week.

And I'm really young. I'm only 22, and this is my first job out of college, and I'm just sitting here wondering if this is all my life will ever be. Are the next 40 years of my life really just going to be me working, sleeping, working, sleeping, working...

My mental health is deteriorating because of it. I can't do this job. I'm having a breakdown right now, at work, and I want to just walk away. 

For some context: I work at a lumber mill in rural Montana. I commute 2 hours total in a day to get there, and get paid 16$ an hour with no benefits yet. (I‚Äôve worked here for 3 months)

I'm so pissed. The company just went bankrupt two years ago, and was bought out by another company to assume all their assets. The place is a massive dump, dirty, disorganized, generally chaotic and grimy. Their equipment doesn't work properly because the boss doesn't prioritize proper maintenance; and because machines are falling apart, that means orders are way behind. So, naturally, the boss is stressing us out by putting insane amounts of pressure on his TWO production employees (me, and another guy) to run 4  massive machines that are constantly breaking down, with unrealistic deadlines; not to mention each machine should have two dedicated employees and a maintenance employee. 

I'm not happy here and it's deteriorating my mental health significantly. 

The company is on the verge of going bankrupt, again, and I want to get out. 

I feel like I might be in an irrational state right now- but it's triggered by the shitty conditions here at work. 

They treat their employees and customers like shit; the boss literally told me that I'm expected to do overtime and stay late frequently. He's pressuring me into not taking two 10 minute breaks and a full 30 minute break, which I‚Äôm told is just a ‚Äúhard work culture.‚Äù My coworker simply doesn‚Äôt take breaks if there is too much to do. I'm exhausted mentally and physically at the end of every day. 

My question to you; is how can I immediately leave and opt out of the work world? I want to make art, grow food, and spend time with the people I care about, but there is this constant gap between saving and paying bills, groceries, and gas, that I can‚Äôt seem to save enough to make it for a short season, before I can start staying home and making food and starting my own business.

1589,Any advice for coping with 50 years of hell?,"Hi everyone,

I started working two months ago and this is my first job (apart from a year long training contract which was also a full-time job but as I now realize, much easier). As a newcomer to hell, I have three particular issues that I can't quite comprehend and need advice on.

First things first, I am totally anti-work. I just want to be free and lazy all day and don't care about the rest (like what would happen to world if no one works) but I am also a realist so I know that I will spend 45 years of my life as a modern slave.

Now, here are my three issues:

1. Does anyone have any advice on how to comprehend that life is work? It's been two monts and I am already burnt out. And seriously, my mind simply cannot comprehend that I will be working 40-60 hours weekly for the next 45-50 years, I am just not cabaple to digest this. I mean I am 25 and now it is expected from me to work nearly twice as more than I've lived so far. Any advice about this would be appreciated.
2. There is nothing to strive/expect for. In school or uni you have long breaks which are also the source of motivation. You carry on with shitty assignments and all-nighters by knowing that there is a long-rest at the end. However, when you are working there is nothing. Weekends and 2-week annual leaves are jokes, nothing more. It is just time for you to spend more and do some chores. So all you have is work, for 45 years. I cannot become so miserable that I would be passionate about weekends or fake annual leaves. But I also need something that I can look forward to. Any ideas what that could be?
3. My job seriously screws me up. It is so demanding that you have to be analytical, think critically etc. all the time. I fail all the time, I am not smart enough (in fact, I am fucking stupid) and stress about me failing at work even when I am not working.  And my parents spend their wealth on providing me good education so I cannot switch to a less-demanding job. Any advice on how to cope with this stress?

This has become a long post and I am sorry about that but I'd really appreaciate any comments.

successfully seeing your boss you are never getting your money back

besides you act like those aren't essential items a communication device that needs to be constantly purged to the labors system so they can get you to do stuff outside of work, a
computer to do the drone work of management filling out spread sheets and constantly having someone looking over your shoulder. not to mention the fact a programme is expected to
create a system in their free time for no pay just so they can get higher

 

microwave fair enough that just a heating machine primarily used by lower income houses due to a lack of unfordable option due to low wages and no time due to overfilled schedules

@J Park First, so you are saying you don't win when you have luxuries? Really? Are you saying you are the looking party in capitalism. Oh sure, you have lost because you can work when
and where you want. You have lost in being the most economically prosperous country in the world. You have lost by being able to afford luxuries that most people around the world can
only dream of. You have lost by having rights that, once again, many people only DREAM of. Freedom of speech, freedom to work where you want, freedom to own a forearm, good

Samaritan laws (these laws prevent you from being sued for trying to save a life, this happens in china and is why a small girl was ran over, and no one tried to save her as she slowly
died), freedom to start a business, the list goes on!

 

Your profits aren't stolen. First of all, if you want a higher wage, bargain for it or get a different job. To one is forcing you to stay in that particular job. One reason we have competition is
so that business can not only compete for customers by making better and cheaper products, but they compete for YOU. They offer better benefits and higher wages so they can
attract YOU away from their rivals.

the machines, has to pay to maintain machines, bought the wood, bought the eager from some foreign country,

he the metal etc. Or the person who can put graphics into a piece of
wood. Those people risked millions of dollars to try to make a profit while you risked nothing. You don't risk anything by taking the job, so who deserves more, the person who potentially

risked everything they owned, or the person who risked only his time? And when the factory doesn't do well, do the business owners say ""we aren't going to pay you until we start making
money‚Äù, no they don't. They do that to themselves. You are still making money when they are looking it.

Were's more proof that your profits aren't stolen. Imagine for me that you work in a pencil factory, who deserves more money, the people who leased the land, bought the factory, bought

Are you really complaining that machines make your jobs easier? Are you really saying ‚Äúwell they bless my life, but people use them to make working easier!‚Äù To you really want to fete)

1628,Found out my work cancelled the employee rewards program...,"... more than a fucking year ago, without fucking telling me. 

We used to accrue points at a rate of one point per hour worked per year of service without a serious safety incident (lost time injury), and redeem them on random stuff from a website. Rewards included stuff like camping gear, golf clubs, electronics, kitchen gear, etc. A lot of the cheaper things were just trash but you could get decent stuff after a while.  Last time I'd checked, I was sitting around 35,000 points, approaching the bottom end of stuff I'd actually consider.  For context, we could also get fire retardant coveralls for about 15,000 points, and the same ones are available for employees to purchase for about $130, so at the time I would've been sitting at a ""gift"" worth around $300, and probably closer to $400 today if they'd kept accruing.  Objectively speaking, not really all that significant, but still more meaningful than getting an ""Atta boy"" and a company branded ball cap.

1631,Capitalism and the automation of the work force. The realistic reasons we will need to tax the rich and implement UBI.,"We need to tax the PRODUCTIVITY produced by workers or machines. Here's why:

When a worker produces something, money goes three places. First, it goes to the owners, who then pay some money to the worker who produced it, and finally the worker pays taxes to the government to keep society functioning.

The problem with this model is the removal of the worker from the equation through automation. We all see it; things that should be reducing the workload on all of us and making life better are instead being used to throw workers in the street and put more pressure on everyone. When production is automated and the worker is removed, the owner gets to pocket all of the money, and none goes to the worker or the government.

So when the rich don't have to pay taxes thanks to their bought-and-paid-for politicians and the workers aren't paying taxes because they have no income, who funds the services that keep America alive? Roads, education, emergency services. The rich? From the kindness of their sweatshop-owning hearts?

As less and less work becomes available to people due to automation (which SHOULD be a good thing), less and less money is going to the citizens. And even ""fuck you, got mine"" people will dislike that because hey, GDP relies on citizens spending our money. And even after that, the government is receiving less in taxes to keep society together.

So what do? UBI is what do.

When people against UBI imagine it, they see it as a money in, money out problem between citizens and the government - people receive money, ""lazy"" people stop working, income tax dries up and the government has no income. 

This is not how UBI would be implemented.

First, it's important to understand the money in, money out problem is already underway. Fewer people have income as jobs dry up, so less money goes to the government in taxes. 

UBI would involve the government directly taxing the capital, then paying to the citizens what we lose from the elimination of jobs and ""cutting labor costs.""

The UBI would likely not be enough to survive on alone. However, it would provide security, and reduce the amount of work needed by one person to survive. By reducing the number of ""work units"" each person needs to survive, we would have enough jobs for everyone because what constitutes one job now could become two under the new system.

The same amount of work gets done, but everyone gets to eat.

What's more: elimination of jobs would be good for society, because as jobs become fewer, the money saved there increases the UBI. If we ever reached a point no one had to work, the UBI would still deliver to us the same amount of money as if we had been producing by hand and making wages.

TL;DR: Tax the productivty and distribute UBI to make up for job losses due to automation. Ensure citizens, owners and government each get a slice or it all goes to shit.",False,lbsmpn,Hoorizontal,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lbsmpn/capitalism_and_the_automation_of_the_work_force/,1,17

So the group interview is what it sounds like, there were four applicants and we all sat in the same room and the interviewer would do ""popcorn"" questions for each of us. Group consisted of 3 young guys and a middle aged man.

I was a one of the 3 young guys. I have experience with public speaking and its no problem for me and I react fairly well to questions I'm not prepared for, so the actual interview wasn't a problem. But it freaked me out as we went along and learned more about the other applicants,

So the vast majority of people do not react well to being put on the spot in a group of strangers. Hell, I'm only decent at it because my time in the military forced me to. And the middle aged gentleman struggled a bit with it. I don't want to give away too much info but the man was asked the question ""If you could have any super power, what would it be?""

While I didn‚Äôt hate it and made decent money, it took a tremendous toll on my mental health working 50+ hours a week, a lot of times until 3am or later, never seeing my friend or family with a ‚Äúnormal schedule‚Äù, and becoming engulfed in the toxic addiction and party culture of the restaurant industry

1674,The Way Out Of This Mess: Design and Housing,"Medium link: [https://medium.com/the-way-out-of-this-mess/how-to-implement-the-solution-design-housing-fe2f68408fc](https://medium.com/the-way-out-of-this-mess/how-to-implement-the-solution-design-housing-fe2f68408fc)

I am writing a book about how to bring forth a world with no work with detailed solutions to production and distribution I've been posting it in parts all over the internet. Below is my solution to construction and housing.

Now that we know what must be done, and why it must be done, we can finally focus on how we can start to do it. This society is contingent upon a few axioms:

1. The Axiom of Choice/Free Association. If someone decides to join this society it‚Äôs completely a free choice of theirs.

This axiom means that we have to locate this society in a place that has little to no current population. This also means that people born in this society must retain the citizenship of the parents and that there will be no native citizens of the society.

2. The Axiom of explicitness. There are no agreements that have not been made explicitly clear.

This axiom means that any social contracts are actual contracts signed by all whom they pertain to.

3. The Axiom of Self-Reliance. All basic necessities for the whole population must be provided by production in the society

Were this not to be the case then foreign powers would hold the real power.

These axioms when they interact limit the scope of possibilities, to several lightly to uninhabited locations (because of axiom 1). That are either geothermal active or, near a geothermal hotspot(because of axiom 3 applied to energy). When mapping all the remaining locations out this is what it looks like with somewhat loose criteria.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n7fdqk8i2xe61.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65d5412090c03c0f825c9e424600eba5427eb7ab

After narrowing down to the possible locations we can start to in detail plan out a human and environmental centered economy.

We have the most information on what a current typical first-world human needs so let‚Äôs start there.

Obviously people food, water shelter, and clothing

Modern construction is reliant on three core materials those being, wood, concrete, and steel.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3xxq6sup2xe61.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=337b15da0f67ead39826e5780dc34e069a01fa6b

When we get into the specifics of how these materials are made we see that steel and concrete are both composite materials meaning they‚Äôre made not grown or harvested.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kveo3oqq2xe61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11302b3750bf0a93ca430b6cf17cd85b93ad295f

The modern processes for making these materials make up at least 10.2% of global emissions([https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector](https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector)). Yet there are known materials that perform better and are made of industrial waste products. One such material being GGBFS(ground granulated blast furnace slag) a steel industry by-product, or fly ash another blast furnace waste product. After doing lots of research you can then rework construction to take advantage of this fact and the fact that when you use prefabrication as the only means of production you can automate and control the whole process.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/or2xm3sr2xe61.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be0e9642c548833e15ea49e212f2eb33ebdcb968

Housing

Zooming out of construction we can now start to talk about housing. The home is the center of most human activity. By focusing our design on making the individual homes of a society as self-sufficient as possible, we can ensure that residents will be fine as well. However, not everyone desire‚Äôs the same living conditions as others. Some people prefer to live more communally and some people prefer to live more solitarily. To account for this several different living styles of living should be provided. Below are my proposed styles.

Rural: High Concentration

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g5kbv0gu2xe61.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=248737bfc42613543287397bf71ca68fce290d99

Rural high concentration living is a lavish communal living style in which 20‚Äì30 people all live in one big mansion. This living-style is based on modern housing cooperatives. Each house would have its own distinct culture, sewage system, and both rooftop garden, and basement marine garden. They‚Äôd also be situated each in a permacultural food forest which gradually transitions to a traditional forest.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hkte588x2xe61.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80323565d9849a6cd4706ffd99f1741207e3cf62

Rural: Low Concentration

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2q3a8pky2xe61.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0413fe3b7327fc788c7b94af473c6b043840cc1b

Rural low concentration is a living style where the community is spread between separate houses that are spaced out quite a bit. Each house is a part of a loose community with neighbors being there but not visible. Think rural Kansas or Michigan. Each house is still surrounded first by a food forest and then that transitions to a natural forest.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qe1chby03xe61.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f65ae50e83b3836fb0965a5142a309df55f806b

Urban: Low Concentration

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ygsuufz13xe61.png?width=918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96bd5c029a2ff1d690932beb69b8d0d431580d08

Urban low concentration or suburban is a living style where many small groups of people come together to form a decent-sized community with greater density than that of a rural community.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qiabm4133xe61.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a525197ca929b2adcd84ad322f321a5e5a639d8f

Urban: High Concentration

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5wdup8e43xe61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ece876c1f3e6d48dfe930d68e5852f3ec4ebf2bc

Urban high concentration is a living style where many communities exist is a small space sometimes even right on top of each other. This type of living style is comprised of single-person apartments, all the way to huge urban co-ops. It‚Äôs characterized by its diversity, plurality, and busyness.

1691,Work has ruined my health,"Full disclosure, this is a vent post on a burner account because some of my colleagues know my main reddit account.

I don't know who else to talk to about this but I'm miserable. It's only been 2 years since I've started working at my current workplace and I'm already done. I was one of those new grads who were eager to perform well and settle into my career but it has made me so miserable and unhealthy I do not know if this is what I really want. 

My ""project team"" has awful communication and did not train me on anything, I was just expected to pick up with absolutely 0 work experience, I was an anxious mess and worried I'll mess up at any given time and cause trouble for everyone, this thought literally keeps me up at night, the last thing I want to do is make others pick up my trash.

My manager is not so bad but absolutely awful at communication and isn't able to convey what's expected of me, abysmal management of tools, I wasn't even provided company tools I need to work and STILL expected to do work. I just...i'm so done. There are no designated work hours everyone is just expected to be available all waking hours of the day.

As a result, I was doing what I can, running after people, sending e-mails and asking to be trained, trying to put in extra effort to learn how the project worked, I would work 12/14 hours- go to bed and start back again in the morning, YET expected to be available on weekends,workdays I'm miserable. 

I have a past of eating disorders and didn't know when it started interfering again- I got my blood tests back and everything is out of whack, all the nutrition I'd worked hard to gain back is ruined, my sleep is awful, I have night terrors and sleep paralysis again, I don't feel like moving and randomly have breakdowns in-between work days. My ADHD is kicking my ass, I just hate my life and don't know how to get out.. I just needed a place to say all this because I know if I try to talk to irl's they'll try and tell me I'm being ungrateful.

It's stupid, I thought i had to scan ONLY at my assigned-unit. NOPE. turns out if I finished up with my unit, I had to go to someone else's unit (some on the other side of the BIG warehouse) and start scanning theirs. I wasn't allowed to just chill at my unit and wait for packages to come. Basically all the scanners have to play MUSICAL-CHAIRS in the entire warehouse (again, realize how BIG the warehouse is) until they find something to scan. No, not all packages are envelope-sized, some big ones come in succession, are 25kg each and really wears you down. This lowers your speed, accuracy and productivity which is monitored and when your scanning-speed isn't high enough, they will put you on the bottom of the employees-list making it easier to kick you out (like it happened to me). They know they can finish all the scanning before closing (even during peak-time) with enough time to spare, but they don't care. They treat it like university and see your marks (productivity) isn't good enough, they will expel you because how dare you not have superhuman speed.

My idiot-brain focused on the flashy details of ""must scan 3 items within 10 seconds"" when i didn't realize i had to blitz-scan whatever i found and quickly move to the next.

1698,Not an all workplaces thing but just pissed me off,"So I (f25) speak French and English. English first and French I'm fluent but I'm obviously not a native speaker. I have 2 degrees and I'm working towards my PhD in Neuropsychology. 

So back in September I applied for a role in a clinic that speaks both langyages and it's a requirement to be fluent in each. I got an interview in October which I was interviewed in both languages. I spoke fine and understood fine, and I didnt get the job which is cool but it wasn't because of my language skills. 

Fast forward to last week Jan 27th or so I get an email and a call from the clinic/ centre asking me to interview for a different job that is available. Mind you I NEVER applied to this job and it wasn't really in the field I wanted so I took the interview out of courtesy and if I got the job I would gladly take the experience. 

The next day is my interview and it's with the same panel that interviewed me previously plus some others. SO this is what pissed me off. They have heard and interviewed me in French before for over an hour. This is not new. I spent the day leading up to the job studying the requirements for the job and making sure I was knowledgeable on the subject because I dont want to be ignorant or make any decisions that could endanger a client. Like I said it's not my field of preference or knowledge. 

The whole interview is in French but I've translated it for everyone. 

The first question: Why would you like this job?

Second question: How have your previous jobs given you experience in this field?

Third: What can you tell us about your volunteer work? 

I get 3 questions into the interview THAT I DID NOT APPLY FOR. THEY INVITED ME. And one interviewer (Who I've talked to before in French)  has the audacity to stop the interview and say in French ""You do not have presentation French, I dont want you presenting to immigrants with that French. I'm going to end the interview here."" 

And we ended the interview there. I get that my French is not the most Ted Talk worthy but they have heard me talk before, she insulted my language skills infront of a panel of other people bluntly, and I spent time preparing for a job I never applied too. It was rude beyond words and a waste of my time.

I was talking about how my two sisters that I pay rent to to live with treat me like utter crap and some folks said, ""You're almost 30, you are an adult, they don't have an obligation to take care of you you should have had your shit together a long time ago"". I know I'm an adult tell me something I don't know. The point of the post was to talk about the pain I was feeling from mistreatment from my own family. But all they could pay attention to was the fact I was almost 30 and living with my sisters who are in their 40's. And they don't ""take care of me""; I feed and clothe myself and I pay them rent. Just because they let me sleep on the living room floor doesn't mean I'm some incompetent child that they ""take care of"".

What does age have to do with the fact that most housing these days isn't affordable for most folks regardless of age? Most folks are one paycheck away from being homeless. I live in Los Angeles CA and $18.50 an hour is still not enough to live out here; the average rent here is $2700.

My own sisters used this ""if you live under someone else's roof then you are a piece of shit who doesn't deserve respect"" too. But ironically, what they are forgetting is that technically they are living under someone else's roof too: the landlords', so they should show more sympathy because if they were to loose their job tomorrow the landlord wouldn't give a shit and they'd be in the same position I'm in. Housing belongs to no one really but to the banks, so I hate when people say ""oh you aren't an independent person because you live under my roof so therefore I should treat you like a child"".

Anyways I‚Äôm at the last few steps of setting it up.

I don‚Äôt want to become the target of ‚Äòeat the rich‚Äô or ‚Äòfuck [insert name]‚Äô smear campaign.

1713,"Tips for leaning into the ""anti-work lifestyle""","This may be long winded and a cookie cutter story on this sub but I feel this is the only place where my frustrations will be understood. I've been evaluating my life and have realized that I've ignored myself for far too long at the benefit of my employer. I'm tired of pretending I don't have dreams and desires and that 8 hour days, 5 days a week plus a rotating schedule of Saturdays and Sundays is normal. I want to experience life, traveling and spending time with my wife and hopefully my future children instead of going through the motions in a farm of florescent lights.

I work in physical therapy. I have received ""exceeding expectations"" reviews every 6 months for the 2 years I've been in my career. I agreed to my current pay 2 months before I graduated and passed my licensure exam and agreed to below average (but at the time, fair) pay. I have since requested 3 pay raises in order to advance my pay to the state and national average for my job, performance, and experience. All 3 were denied. I never say no to my employeer and have never called out while I've lost count of the number of times my days have been extended because of having to cover for co-workers (funny how people only get sick on Mondays and Fridays;) ) It is frustrating because my career is much the same across all possible settings and employers.

I want my life to be different. I don't want to be an underpaid slave. I'm not looking to get rich, nor am I looking to take a dump on the CEOs desk. I do enjoy the basic fundamentals of my job without corporate choking the life out of an enjoyable and meaningful career.

1714,Upskill for a better life?,"Bit of context here, 40 years old now, I‚Äôm a high-school dropout from a small rural town, it was a repressive and backwards place I wanted to leave asap, difficult with no income or prospects.

I sold some things and twenty years ago made my way to the big city, worked jobs unloading trucks, stacking things, a variety of low-paying though ultimately low-responsibility jobs. Looking back, it was a good time. Society at large may not value ‚Äúthe poors‚Äù as it felt, but when your circle of friends are in similar situations then there is a unity and bond. Keep in mind twenty years ago, living with a couple of room mates, we could rent reasonable places very close to the city. These days, I imagine it‚Äôd be a lot harder or a lot scummier.

It was hard to save any money though, what I wasn‚Äôt spending on weed alcohol food rent was very much nil. But life was simple, I could sit in the sun with friends and it was enjoyable. 

Thoughts were creeping in, sure early 20s this is great, is this the life you want when you‚Äôre 30? 40? 50?

After some 10 years I went to architecture school. It had always appealed, I‚Äôm a creative sort. I was accepted based on a portfolio of drawings and an interview that went well, I was honest about having dropped out of high school and what I‚Äôd been doing the last decade. I had no money to pay for it, so in comes the student loan. Gulp. But that‚Äôs okay, surely when I‚Äôm working I can pay it off. It‚Äôll pay off in the long run. 

I did well while studying, was snapped up by a studio before even finishing, so I could work parttime while finishing and have a job lined up. Seemed great.

Here‚Äôs the thing though, this doesn‚Äôt just apply to the architectural field I‚Äôm sure, but it‚Äôs not a great life. I make more money sure, I even paid off my student loan just this year. But I‚Äôm stressed all the time, I have responsibilities beyond my control dumped on me. I‚Äôm expected to work hours and hours extra for free. It‚Äôs awful. I‚Äôve grown to loathe the industry. It‚Äôs exploitative. The stress (and extra money) have lead to my almost doubling in weight, constantly tired, with zero motivation. I am still renting too, it‚Äôs a trap where mortgage payments would be cheaper but it‚Äôs a struggle to get the deposit. Years away. I‚Äôm not smart with money. Neither were my folks.

I‚Äôm now sitting here, wondering if I wouldn‚Äôt have been happier with not much in the world, but not much on my shoulders either. Smoking a joint in the sun without a care in the world sounds wonderful.

Now contemplating what‚Äôs next, I don‚Äôt think I can keep this up. Honestly if I had a secure home, and universal income, I wouldn‚Äôt work at all. I‚Äôd smoke pot and draw in my notebook, sitting in the sun, being my best self.

junk food is everywhere, cheap and easy to get, the perfect product of capitalism in that it costs nothing to make, can be sold at a huge markup, and stimulates a desire for more junk food. don‚Äôt fucking eat it.

if a job requires you to sit (or stand) for hours at a time, do not stay. they* don‚Äôt care about you, they just want you to be a battery until you give out. sit if you need to, get up, walk around and stretch. it is going to stimulate blood flow to your limbs. your blood flow is your life force and it is worth more than the shitty wage they are paying you.

they* are trying to get you worried and anxious about shit you will never be able to fucking control, spamming your mind with endless noise. if you live in fear, you are easy to control. if you can‚Äôt change it, shut it out. 

ill health will make you a big spender, endlessly fruitlessly searching for a relief from the pain: pain pills, back braces, high blood pressure medication, anti-anxiety meds, weight loss ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù, alcohol, sunlight lamps, white noise machines, adult coloring books, anything advertised with the phrase ‚Äútreat yoself‚Äù, goddamn junk food. capitalists heard ‚Äúan oz of prevention is worth a lb of cure,‚Äù and knew where the big profits were.

NOTHING is worth your physical health. protect it with everything you have. your body is your only constant companion in this life. everywhere you go, there you are, and you will never escape yourself as long as you live. you may be disposable trash to them*, but don‚Äôt let that influence how you view yourself.

Why do I need to justify my existence? Why do I need to put in so much effort just to not be considered a burden on society? I live in one of the wealthiest countries on the planet, there is such an incredible amount of technology here which multiplies productivity to absurd levels. But everyone is still forced to work 40 hours a week and compete for the jobs that devalue your work the least. All of that to keep the endless cycle of capitalism going.

Of course I can't do it in my own way. Learning about the things I'm really curious about isn't considered productive, and I need to do it in my free time.

I have been thinking hard about the alternative solutions, but none seems to fit the bill...what ever has been tried by us humans ends up with disaster, due to arrogance/lust for power/greed.

I've come to think that maybe there isn't an alternative, because humans are the way they are: as soon as they will see an opening for some power/profit, most people will go for it.

So my sincere question is this:

What do you think the alternative to the current system might be? And how will this system tackle the problem of greed?

1733,Existential rot from the inside out,"At the beginning of the pandemic, I enjoyed the solitude and peace of no social engagements‚Äîno pressure to perform in front of other people, no stress, none of the typical bullshit where we wear unnecessary masks just to keep everyone else happy in their illusion of freedom. I was working at home (I have a bullshit office job that is certainly not ""essential"" by any means, which makes it worse), going day-by-day, and blocking out all of the apocalyptic media about the virus just to cope and enjoy the break‚Äîthe clear skies, the halt of pollution, you know‚Ä¶ the ideal, slower world we probably should live in anyway. I‚Äôd crack a White Claw at 3:00pm, listen to podcasts while working on spreadsheets. or whatever pointless tasks my job wanted me to do, which seemed to change week-by-week as our executive folks tried to keep everyone ‚Äúbusy,‚Äù whatever the fuck that‚Äôs supposed to mean, and just relax on the couch, doing work while lounging. Not too bad, right?

A few months in, I realized that every single day during the pandemic I was dying inside a little bit more (have you seen Office Space? Like when Peter Gibbons tells the hypnotherapist every day he works is the worst day of his life--""wow, that's messed up""). I missed playing shows with my band‚Äîthe catharsis, the relief of playing something musically intense and extreme that could connect to other people and release the intensity and rage I feel when I think about the extreme inequality of the world, injustice, and victimization of billions so a couple of pieces of shit who are convinced they are saving the world (fuck off) can get richer. I play in punk and metal bands: loud, fast, pissed, and intense--it‚Äôs wonderful and incredibly good for my mental health to get all of my negativity out in performance, which in turn essentially turns the seemingly infinite negative energy I have into community and appreciation of one another's art. It's a beautiful, beautiful, weird fucking community and I miss it so much.

But it was silent. There was no intensity anymore. Just silence, every single day. My significant other (who is a wonderful woman and incredibly patient with me) would watch her endless stream of television shows. I couldn‚Äôt enjoy any of them. During the George Floyd protests I turned off my social media, sickened by all of the (well-intentioned, but annoying) egoistic posturing of (white) people I actually like, but were performing like they were martyrs. It‚Äôs not about YOU, people. It‚Äôs about justice and ending racism--not posting on social media. I was so, so, so tired of it all. A fragmented pandemic response, endless police brutality, structural racism, endless brutal inequality I'm reminded of every time I go to the gas station to buy beer‚Ä¶ living in 2020 United States is like living in a god damn developing country despite the fact ‚Äúwe‚Äù have the most wealth in the entire history of the world (of course most of that is hoarded in offshore accounts to avoid taxes‚Ä¶ ugh).

My partner and I bought a super nice house in June in the height of the pandemic‚Äîgreat price and interest rate (capitalism rules all, fucking apparently) due to the viral apocalypse going on around us‚Äîand we moved in. Once we were in, I found myself just retreating to sitting outside, drinking beers, smoking cigarettes, and listening to podcasts just like I did during the pandemic. What else was I going to do? I couldn‚Äôt go to shows. I couldn‚Äôt play shows. I couldn‚Äôt go out of town to watch wrestling (my cult obsession, don't knock it 'til you try it, AEW and NJPW are fantastic). I couldn‚Äôt just go to a bar for no reason (remember when you could just go to a bar for no reason?). Bars were open but I‚Äôm not trying to become a carrier and kill my dad, who essentially has every preexisting risk for Covid complications.

So this is what I do now‚ÄîI work a pointless fucking administrative job that is certainly not essential four days in a week in my office, one day mid-week at home (some bizarre semi-work-from-home fantasy that assumes we are somehow reducing everyone‚Äôs risk by doing this one day a week? Whatever man‚Äîgoing to enjoy it, but sounds like a load of bootlicking administrative bullshit). Every single day I feel completely dead inside. There just feels like there‚Äôs nothing left. I used to LOVE the rush of live music‚Äîwhether aggressive, fast, slow, sad, happy‚Äîwhatever‚Äîit made me feel alive. The only joy I get is band practice, and fortunately, I do have two bands and great guys (and their partners) to socialize with, which is probably the only thing keeping me from losing it. I drink as much as possible with them and listen to metal and punk to get the negative energy out.

While it‚Äôs fun, I long for the days where I can share the music we play and energy live with other people. I feel like my soul is rotting from the inside out and all that‚Äôs left is a guy trying to bury his feelings with booze, cigarettes, endless podcasts (so, so tired of looking at fucking screens), and the occasional pro wrestling event on my TV that gives me a little shot of dopamine to keep me alive enough to wake up tomorrow and do it all over again.

I know this isn‚Äôt a permanent condition (fucking hopefully) but Jesus fucking Christ. How does anyone want to live in this world? What‚Äôs the fucking point? Endless exploitation and no time for joy? And people have the nerve to tell me to do yoga and meditate‚Ä¶ what a fucking joke.

inside a frigid poultry plant, pulling
guns and stray feathers from
slaughtered chickens destined for
major fast food restaurant and
grocer stores.

There wasn‚Äôt much substance abuse

And he worked for free. CAAIR
pocket the pay.

‚ÄúIt was a Slave camp,‚Äù McGahey said.
‚ÄúT can‚Äôt believe the court sent me
there.‚Äù

The program has become an
invaluable labor source. Over the
years, Commons Goods repeatedly
has laid off paid employees while
expanding its use of CAAIR.
Commons now is so radiant on the
program for some shifts that the
plants likely would shut down if the
men didn‚Äôt show up, according to

supervisors.

CAAIR rarely receive long-term help

I tried explaining what work does to me, the jobs I've had that caused me anxiety and trauma, about not making enough money for it to seem to matter or make up for the stress and physical wear and tear they cause, getting punishment for making mistakes anyone would make, etc. I come in every session with their first question of: what have you done this week to improve yourself? I really hate mentioning that I wasn't looking for work, knowing they'll say something on the lines of 'while you're unemployed, you should be using that free time to look for work and for many people, the job search is considered a full-time job. They have no empathy for me when I would vent about past jobs where I was empty as a janitor and the bullying I got as a housekeeper, scrubbing dirty vomit off toilets, getting pressured to do other employees jobs because they weren't keeping up with timing on their end, etc. They just tell me they had to scrub toilets in the past too and that I'm not the only person who's had to do minimum wage jobs. They asked if I applied at Wal Mart and I said I'd rather look for less demeaning work...their response was: 'it's not demeaning, it's an honorable job, like any other.'

Contrary to popular opinion, quitting
is for dinners.

Knowing when to quit, change
direction, leave a toxic situation,
demand more from life, give up on
something that wasn't working and
move on, is a very important skill that
people who win at life all seem to
have.

However, because the PC I use has important software on it (that I use everyday!), and the company only has one license for this software, management has now decided to move my PC - but not me! - into its own office. 

Now I have to use multiple desktop PCs to do my work, since my desk is in the middle of the building but the software I use everyday is in its own office.

I get along great with my parents and I do my best helping with around the house. I feel ashamed though I‚Äôve never dated or been able to move out. My mom sometimes makes comments like you need full time you need another job we can‚Äôt take care of you forever 

But like how??

I don‚Äôt understand how we are all expected to move out when there aren‚Äôt even enough full time positions anywhere not that I want full time hours like my poor mom who hates her life

1771,Ended with toxic client even though I needed $,"I work freelance and met my client on a freelancer website 3 years ago. We worked really cohesively and well with the CEO for 3 years. Last year on summer, I started to work with the Founder. It was going good until a client PM'ed him about me and how I didn't confirm that I was going to do the revisions in the group chat, he became furious and started the passive aggressive attitude. I asked what was wrong and why he keeps doing passive aggressive attitude and he pretended that nothing happened and just said he was annoyed about client PM'ing him and he was fine now.

It started with the Founder would tell me what to do but without giving me any information about it and when it wasn't done right, it would be my fault. Example: apparently they have limited type of packing and labelling that I wasn't not aware of. I discuss with the client  and what they want. apparently, it's not this company does and it would be my fault that I mislead the client without knowing it. They would send me a list of labels to show the client, client picks the most expansive one and I would get scolded as it is expansive and it shouldn't be shown to the client at the first place. Small and annoying incidents like this kept going. Interacting with the client and chasing after them wasn't in my duties and they never paid me to do it but after working for so long, I did it anyway (I know it was stupid) 

After a few months, they started to give me less work and because of that, I got another freelance job. Later, they officially hired someone to interact with the clients, gave him a full salary and a business e-mail address. If they would've kept their promise of how much work they were going to give me, I wouldn't be looking for anything else. This made me upset because I was never considered as a part of the team and instead of offering me a position in the company, they hired a brand new guy.

&amp;#x200B;

I had covid on September and I was in no shape of working at all, couldn't focus, felt very tired and dizzy. After I told this to my client, he responded as in the picture. He laughed at me. What kind of psycho responds like that?  


Another incident: I made an invoice covering September and October, the client wanted me to prepare it separately, so I did (X+Y=XY amount). Last month he wrote to me and said ""the amount in the invoices ( A+B=AB) and you asked for XY amount of money. Why you asked me to pay you more?""  I sent the invoices again and screenshots that they were not the amounts that was in my invoice. He answered me: ""I divided the invoiced myself and forgot to include one of the projects"". I told him would never ask him to pay something extra or something I didn't work for. He replied as ""Just checking :) "" After 3 years, he treated me like I would be stealing and wouldn't even apologize for the accusation because he made a mistake?

&amp;#x200B;

It was obvious the Founder didn't wanted to work with me and kept bugging me like this. I don't understand why he just didn't fire me instantly but kept harassing me and treated me like this. I really hate working freelance, the clients never seem to get I'm not their employee and they think they can treat me like shit anyway they could.

I needed the $ but I chose my mental health, I should've cut contacts a long time ago.

My job FINALLY let us start working from home about a month ago. In that time, I managed to figure myself a baseline. More ""work"" than I did in the office to make it more appealing to hopefully let us stay WFH even after the pandemic. Now that I have a baseline set where my bosses seem content that I'm working my ass off(I'm not), I want to make it even more enjoyable for myself so I can feel like a human again and really enjoy being in my home. 

The way I've worked it out, I can get away with doing maybe an hour, 2 at most of genuine, focused work but make it look like it took the whole day(truthfully, this job could fully automated with a total of 7 real employees, but I digress). 

Here's where I'm running into an issue: of course they couldn't just let us do our jobs normally from home, rather they had to outfit us with headsets for calls that track every second of breaks, bathroom trips, etc, to measure our ""productivity"". If you fail to answer a call in less than 3 seconds, it kicks you off and dings you(note: this isn't a call center position). I need to find a way around this bit.

Up. Because wages are about the
COST of labor, not your opinion
about it‚Äôs value. Of you get the kid's
labor, but he still can‚Äôt feed himself,
the taxpayers make up the
difference. Which means of
subsidized YOUR stinginess.

He don't make laws based on what
we assume a worker's

life situation is. He have child labor
laws that address the age at which
someone can or should earn a wage.

Once they are workers, they are the
same under the law.

I moved to Jordan from the US about 5 months ago and regrettably people here are all about working 80 hours a week for peanuts.

They find my antiwork philosophy very delusional. They have not gotten to the point of realizing that they are nothing more than replaceable slaves for the rich.

The rich to poor gap here is huge, about 1% rich, 10% surviving and 89% poor.

Coming from the US this place is an appalling dump.

The main character is a twenty-something woman with a liberal arts degree who can't get out of the cycle of low-paying, dead-end temp jobs. Her parents help her out financially as she flounders around, but this is becoming an issue since it's clear her career is going nowhere. She has other problems too, like a lack of any real friendships or hobbies.

This isn't a feel-good book, so don't worry, she doesn't end up landing a great job, marrying rich, becoming famous or going off the grid. The best way I can sum up the ending is that she eventually ages into accepting the mediocrity of her life. It's part happy, part bleak.

Now I'm 19, and on paper, I have a charmed life. I moved out of my parents house at 17, and have been living on my own since then. Last year, I got my first ""real"" job, and upgraded from a shoebox studio apartment to a more luxurious 1-bedroom.

The only reason I'm able to have all of my freedoms though, is because I just never stop working. I show up every day, sit in front of a computer for 7 hours, then go about my merry way. Even though I *rarely* do more than the bare minimum, I sit there and put in the hours so I can pay rent at the end of the month. It sucks.

But here's the thing... *it's a good job!*

Like, aside from the fact that I *have* to be there, there aren't many problems with it. The work is simple enough, my coworkers are all great, I get paid well... there are endless reasons for me to keep my job. Plus, I work for a non-profit organization, meaning that I feel rewarded for doing at least *some* good for my community.

But regardless of all the benefits, or the friendly atmosphere... I don't want to be there because of 2 things.

1. I just don't want to work
2. The guilt that results from that

There's just something about the daily ""grind""/routine that exhausts me to no end. Getting up and doing the same thing every day, rarely having enough time or energy to pursue any hobbies outside of TV and video games. Living paycheck to paycheck because even though you get paid *more* than enough, you spend it all on takeout, booze and drugs just to trick your brain into thinking life is worth it at the end of the day.

That feeling fucking sucks. I hate feeling like I'm caught in an endless loop. And so, I've just lost interest in the work. I work remotely, so it's not like my boss can waltz into my apartment to see if I'm on task. So, 90% of the time, I'm getting high and browsing twitter. Or watching a youtube video. Or making frustrated posts like this.

And of course, *that* makes me feel guilty. If I were working almost anywhere else, it wouldn't be a problem. If I slacked off as a frycook or a busboy, the worst thing that would happen is my boss would lose some money. If I slacked off at a call center, the worst thing that would happen is I'd get yelled at a little.

But now, it's different. When I slack off and try to enjoy myself, I just can't. Because I *know* I could be doing some actual good. I could be helping out my teammates, who are *very clearly* overworked all the time. I could be volunteering for a more important part of the job that would take up more of my time. But no, the only thing that feels right to me is sitting on the couch and procrastinating. And on top of all of that, I know there's some kid down the street who works 1000x harder than me, and gets paid less. And that makes me feel like shit.

So what am I supposed to do? I can't quit, because I'll get evicted and have to move back in with my parents. I can't continue to slack off, because eventually the guilt will build up too much, or I'll get fired. And I can't *actually* start working hard, because I'll probably fucking kill myself after a month of real, intense work.

1820,Intuitively Abolishing Work,"Hello all, since the last time [Crohn's disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn%27s_disease) nearly killed me in Dec 2017 I've been working on a way to abolish work in a stupidly simple way out of necessity. Sorry for the wall-o-text, abolishing work while easy, is still complex.

TL;DR, Creating a crazy video game via voluntary global collaboration

In 2016 Crohn's rendered me bedridden, had to stop attending helicopter school, all my previous work experience became useless. With no money, being bedridden, just returning home from emergency surgery after a week in the hospital on IV antibiotics, I needed a way to live a life I could be proud of.

Thus began [Project Universe](https://shaostoul.com/)'s closed development on 24 Dec 2017. [On 29 January 2019 freely open community development began](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Af6Z4PuaCSE).

Historical context:

* In 1992 I began gaming on the NES with the Mario/Duck Hunt combo cartridge.
* In 1994 I began teaching myself game development/modding with a few different games on my Dad's Amiga 500 &amp; 4000.
* In 2006 I began teaching game dev/modding as a fun international hobby.
* In 2014 I began modding/teaching it for [Space Engineers](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Shaostoul/myworkshopfiles/?appid=244850&amp;p=1&amp;numperpage=30).
* In 2018 I spoke at Emerald City Comic Con about [the benefits of video game modding on individuals, communities &amp; developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPb8-tTzIIA) with fellow Space Engineers modders.

Essentially I'm a huge nerd that loves video games more than most. With the community, knowledge &amp; resources gained from my history, we're creating a free space-ready open-source school disguised as a sci-fi video game. Through it we're preparing Humanity for our future as a united interplanetary civilization.

From 2017 to late 2019 I couldn't use my computer without Crohn's symptoms worsening, so I spent most of my time R&amp;Ding the plan from my cellphone. In Oct 2019 we received a $30,000 donation which paid for a powered adjustable bed frame, super soft bed &amp; cheap 55"" TV allowing me to safely use my computer in bed. In Nov 2020 we [submitted Project Universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JO1cE2VckR0) to the [Unity for Humanity program](https://unity.com/humanity).

Today development is going well thanks to a growing team of volunteers from across the globe, you can meet most of them in [our Discord](https://discord.gg/9XxmmeQnWC). Every volunteer submits an ""application"" as an introduction to the team &amp; as an agreement to a $2,000/month salary for 10ish hours of work/week plus benefits as soon as our teamwork makes it happen (at least until Humanity transitions to a unified decentralized form of self-government without a pyramid scheme leadership.)

Funding comes from multiple sources:

* Crowdfunding (via [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Shaostoul) until our account system is operational) is the best way of accelerating development. Every penny goes to Project Universe, no % cut for venture capitalists/seed investors/bank loans/etc.
* Investors ideally provide at minimum $300,000 for 1 year of dev with 10 essential devs. Every $30,000 is another dev for 1 year. This is the least preferred method as investors require a % cut, which prevents me from hiring more community members.
* Self-funding is our primary method of permanent funding once the game is sufficiently operational &amp; the community is large enough. Project Universe consists of 3 components, the game, school &amp; virtual mall. The mall is filled with [business affiliates](https://shaostoul.com/partners/) providing tracking links.

The mall is the best method of funding as it indefinitely funds development without having to charge users for access to the game/school/mall. Players purchase products/services from IRL businesses in-game at ""touch-screen kiosks"" in a centralized area linked to via affiliate tracking links. Think of it as Orgrimmar with IRL businesses &amp; in-game shops.

Currently we nearly have everything required for development from today to release. Most of the software is free, for the stuff that isn't, crowdfunding covers what it can, IE: The website &amp; dev tools like Substance Painter. Hardware wise we use [PlayFab](https://playfab.com/) for the base account system, [SpatialOS](https://www.improbable.io/multiplayer-networking) for MMO stuff, a community member is providing a dedicated server, &amp; so forth.

All we need now is help increasing global advocacy as it exponentially accelerates development. A larger community = more volunteers = faster dev = more funding = more business partners. It's one hell of a push-to-start infinitely scalable [positive feedback loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback). Additionally a larger community makes it easier for us to work with governments to get the school accepted globally. With [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/) bringing global internet access we're able to bring high-quality education to even the most remote places. Interplanetary latency is a problem until we have a FTL method of communication.

**BUT SHAOSTOUL, HOW DOES IT ABOLISH WORK?**

Humanity has a knack for over complicating things &amp; being frustratingly stubborn when it comes to change. IE: If it ain't broke, don't fix it, but we can see where that got us...

Fortunately we're not doing it alone! AI by itself is ending most jobs. Some requires streamlining our way of life. Unifying Humanity takes care of a bunch. Many businesses are creating solutions to problems Project Universe doesn't need to solve. We're just connecting it all together through a video game.

The school teaches IRL skills through gameplay. With AI, AR &amp; VR it's capable of teaching anyone anything anywhere on &amp; off Earth with an applicable smart device, console, PC, TV, etc. The account system records what you learn (never fill out a resume ever again) &amp; the game keeps that knowledge fresh by forcing you to use it for gameplay. IE: Learn welding in-game to weld doors shut to block hostile aliens. Once you're good enough in-game you qualify for a drastically shortened IRL apprenticeship.

With AI/AR/VR/robotics many jobs are permanently disappearing leading to increased permanent unemployment. However we still want to teach people &amp; keep those skills fresh for when Humanity begins colonizing space in 2024 &amp; beyond. Think of the AI as your best friend, doctor, guide, teacher, mentor, etc. Should you find yourself completely isolated, because of an accident leaving you trapped on Mars with help 6+ months away the AI can help you build/fix everything.

The game combats cabin fever, provides social interaction, gives a virtual testing ground for designing IRL spacecraft/habitats maintaining maximum morale, etc.

Instead of hiring everyone we'll be building free-to-live-in self-sufficient housing complexes with on-site aquaponics, hospital, 3D printers, waste disposal, recycling, entertainment, solar/wind/hydro gen, etc.

1826,"‚ÄúShe‚Äôs too busy to talk, so we hired an actor to talk about the job‚Äù","I listen to podcasts while I work to keep the mind numb at bay, and through the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù of tech I‚Äôve been getting location targeted ads by a company known for their little green, reptile mascot. 

The ad is basically this brainwashed sounding guy saying ‚ÄúMargie here has been working for us for so long, she‚Äôs moved up to train new hires! But she was too busy working on her career, so we hired an actor to tell you her story!‚Äù This is followed by a woman talking about how ‚Äúshe doesn‚Äôt just train people to work a job, but trains them to want to make this a career!‚Äù It ends with a crappy joke about how she hasn‚Äôt met the mascot before another corporate goon tells you how to find the hiring site. 

This whole hiring ad makes my skin crawl. Either A) Margie isn‚Äôt real and they couldn‚Äôt find anyone they deemed ‚Äúa real team player‚Äù to speak for 20 seconds tops which means the job has no direction, you‚Äôll be expected to figure it out and be 100% from day one, B) Margie IS real, but they couldn‚Äôt be bothered to pay her extra/were insulted if she asked to be paid to be the voice of this hiring campaign so instead they probably underpaid someone/had HR do it, or C) Margie is real and has been so utterly brainwashed by this job she really did say no to recording, which means if you get trained by her she‚Äôll push the ‚Äúwe‚Äôre a family here‚Äù narrative till you choke. 

The whole thing sounds like it‚Äôs a freaking cult or like they got this lady and the rest of the employees locked in a dungeon somewhere they can‚Äôt tell the world how the job really is. Maybe if they, idk, spent the money they did for this stupid ad to give Margie a raise the word of mouth she‚Äôd spread would be better advertisement then ‚Äúshe‚Äôs sooooo busy building her career, here‚Äôs a stranger we hired to speak for her!‚Äù I guess option D is Margie said ‚Äúfuck this company‚Äù and quit the day they were set to record, which would make this whole thing a little sweeter.",False,laufwm,LivyKitty2332,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/laufwm/shes_too_busy_to_talk_so_we_hired_an_actor_to/,4,24

Naive maybe, but she was just trying to be upfront. Suddenly, salary negotiations went dead silent, and while no one was openly mean to her, she stopped getting any real feedback, good or bad.

I am positively fuming right now, and they are being absolute assholes about it too.

1830,"Needed a job, so I took one with a debt settlement company &amp; now I'm regretting it","At the beginning of the pandemic, I was told to work from home, then I was furloughed the same day I lost a loved one to covid. Then I was out of work all summer, into the fall. In October I was permanently laid off. 

After the holiday season, I decided I wanted to get back to work, especially considering I desperately need to move out of my apartment (my neighbors have now opened my mail, by 'accident' because they assumed an amazon package was theirs when in reality - it wasn't.)

I decided that I was going to apply like crazy and whatever came my way first I was going to take it, considering unemployment was not going to continue to cover my rent and other bills. I ended up interviewing at a debt settlement company and I've only been in the job 3 weeks and can already tell you - this shit is a scam and it hurts people more than it helps them. 

They have trained us via zoom and within a week they had us on the phones. Now, they have thrown us to the wolves and it's been hell on wheels. the quotas that we have to meet are next level, plus the people who view/work the accounts before us don't even get all the pertinent information for the next person working the account. 

Unfortunately, though I don't wanna rely on the government to give us any more money because it doesn't look like it's happening any time soon &amp; I really want to quit my job and take my podcast to the next level, however... I need money for the tools and supplies.

The field I‚Äôm working in isn‚Äôt known for it good wages and the work-life balance but it‚Äôs manageable.
My co workers are friendly and the time I spend with them is alright. All in all, I can be satisfied and glad that I have it better than many others.
I still can‚Äôt help but feel trapped and exhausted all the time.

Eight hours a day, sometimes nine, five times a week is sucking life out of me. People still have the attitude that work gives your life meaning and that you wouldn‚Äôt know what to do without it. I see it differently.
There are a bunch of things I would do if I had the time. I would try out a whole list of new hobbies.

The endless cycle of getting up, going to work, wasting your time there, even if you have an horrendous amount of tasks to finish and then going back home only to repeat is horrifying. It‚Äôs so repetitive and dull and I don‚Äôt find joy in the little things anymore. I try my best to keep my positive and motivating attitude but it‚Äôs hard.

I shouldn‚Äôt complain with such good conditions but I can‚Äôt help but do so.

 Even the cheapest, shittiest apartments will run a person at least $800/ mo and thats after the $2000 I have to put into application fees / credit checks\\ down payment, couch, bed, utilities, etc.

People say urban car dwelling should only be done if you have a goal in mind. I dont have a specific number $$ I just know I rather save and invest everything I make rather than putting it towards rent. No, I dont want to buy a house.

I'm in a media room completely by myself unless someone comes by to tell me they want me to make something last second. Most jobs in the science field are full time with *long* shifts. Luckily I didn't waste tens of thousands of dollars at a university to get where I am, but geez is fulltime work ruining any interest I had in science. I'm ready to just find some remote office work I can do part time. I enjoy school far more than work and am taking some accounting classes to keep me busy enough that I won't get super severe sundays blues like I used to at least.",False,l9vf0k,StrugglingStressBall,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/l9vf0k/40_hours_sucks/,16,31
