4,My boss is fucking abusing me,"I'm (24F) from South Africa and in my first job since completing my marketing degree. I've been working for a year and a half now as a Digital Campaign Manager for a well known company.

I have really grown in the company and have so many networks and skills now. However, overloaded with work and probably have a job that 2 people could do. I receive R8000 a month, R7100 after deductions which is completely shit.

I've been work EVEN MORE during lockdown, even on weekends and overtime that I don't get paid for. My boss has promised me many times that I'll get an increase but never.

There are people in my department doing a little work and getting the same salary as me with no degree or experience too.

My boss has now told me that I need to take over monthly statements (including my usual digital marketing work) so I need to send customers statements monthly.. This is a job that another department has done and have now moved it to marketing.... So he put it on me and immediately told me to do training..after online screen sharing training yesterday I messaged my manager and said that this is a really strenuous task in addition to my others. I'm not sure how I'll manage it. All he responded is that if Its too much he'll get an assistant for me. 

What I see from this is getting an assistant gives me an even lower chance of getting an Increase, cause then they have to pay another person! And also he'll probably trick me into teaching the assistant everything in case I decide to leave. Because he knows I have much skills and so much potential to easily go to another company. 

The amount of work is something that another person could do as a job on its own. Now he's forcing me to do it and I'm still getting the same shit pay. I can't even get an increase now or leave my job cause of this lockdown.

I'm just so sick of this shit work and shit salary.

5,That moment when your dream job feels like an actual job,"Basically, I've always wanted to be a cartoonist. I've been drawings since kindergarten, doodling all over my homework papers, and I made several comic books back in elementary and middle school. Once I learned that my grandpa was a cartoonist, I pretty much had my mind set.

Though nothing professional, I have finally achieved that goal to a certain extent when I started to get hired by people to write and illustrate comics for them. Fun, right?

Well, a combination of lack of creative control and the grind of it all makes it not so fun, like, *actual* work. All I can think about while doing them is how much I want to get through my commission list so I can work on other stuff I have plans to do.

8,Owen D. Young - GE chairman and RCA creator,"There are examples of people who would be considered aligned with business having humanistic ideals as well. 

(In 1927, Owen D. Young, a Greenwich resident who was the first chairman of General Electric, gave a speech at Harvard Business School, in which he scolded businessmen who “devise ways and means to squeeze out of labor its last ounce of effort and last penny of compensation.” He encouraged them instead to “think in terms of human beings—one group of human beings who put their capital in, and another group who put their lives and labor in a common enterprise for mutual advantage.” Rick Wartzman, a longtime head of the Drucker Institute and a historian of corporate behavior, told me, “This really was beyond rhetoric. We were much more of a ‘we’ culture than an ‘I’ culture.” On Young’s watch, G.E. became one of the first American companies to give workers a pension, profit-sharing, life insurance, medical coverage, loans, and housing assistance.)

10,What does the next year look like for cooks/chefs?,"I'm in a bit of a grey area when it comes to the unemployment crisis in the service industry. The fine-dining restaurant I worked for closed two weeks before COVID stay-at-home orders were issued, so I'm not furloughed; but very, very unemployed, with no prospects for the near future, in an industry that will, assumedly, be cutting down their number of total kitchen staff by not calling them back in, cutting the hours of the ones who are called back in, and not being able or willing to hire anyone new for what, the next year at least? I got unemployment started right before the system became bogged down.

I'm definitely not wanting to go back until my unemployment runs out, and will try to apply for the 13 week extension in November. There is absolutely zero incentive to even think about applying anywhere until the extra $600 per week runs out. I'm just curious what others, who may or may not work in the same industry, project for the near future.",False,gqzty5,ForensicAstronomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gqzty5/what_does_the_next_year_look_like_for_cookschefs/,2,1

12,Just a personal rant.,"I want to preface this by saying I am aware I'm in a really privileged position here. I know others are much worse hit but I needed to get this off my chest and thought it would be unwise to post on my personal social media.

I (28f) interviewed for a new job on a Friday morning. I was offered the position that evening, handed in my notice on Monday morning, by Monday tea time the industry I work in was shut down. I worked one weeks notice, the weekend between finishing one job and beginning another the UK went in to lockdown. I still began my new job and I do have to be thankful to my linemanagers for lying to head office to make sure I started as planned when the instructions were to stop all recruitment which would have left me unemployed.

I work in customer facing administration so have continued to work, in the office, serving customers throughout the pandemic, our company has classed us as key workers, which is total rubbish to be honest. 90% of our job could be done from home.

I started my job 4 days too late to be eligible for the Government job retention scheme. So, whilst every other administrator at my City's branch has been furloughed for 3 weeks at a time, each on full pay, I have been working every weekday and picking up their work too. Security have been furloughed on the same basis and managers have been in work on a rotating basis, 3 days working from home, 2 days in the office. Myself and the two maintenance technicians are the only ones who have been in as normal. Don't get me wrong, I am so relieved they have been able to stay at home and mitigate some risk and im pleased the company have done the right thing and topped up their wage so theyre not doing  without. I wouldnt have that any other way for them. But i have been feeling very overwhelmed.

I started my job in March and brought up at the time that the salary on the contract I signed would be below National Minimuim Wage as of April 1st when it increased. I was assured it would be amended as soon as the increase came in to effect. Last month my pay slip was confusing as I had worked an extra week so I trusted everything was okay but when I received my second slip this morning I realised I'm still being paid at the original salary, that is around £600 a year under the new minimuim wage. 

On top of this, the accounts department have not submitted my details to HMRC so I have been emergency taxed by around £300 a month for the last two months. Ive rang HMRC and they said its with my company to fix it as the tax code they have generated for me is correct. 

I am extremely lucky to be in work and to be staying with my parents who aren't charging me rent right now. Maybe I'm being petty, but I feel so cheated out of money ive earned and so stressed I wont be able to afford to live when I move in to my own place next month. I want to cry.

TLDR have worked full time, customer facing during a pandemic only to be paid under min wage and have  nearly 25% of my wage taken in tax",False,grgm7n,sarahannety,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/grgm7n/just_a_personal_rant/,5,1
13,Anxiety of returning to the classroom,"I am a primary school teacher here in the UK. I am currently on my first year of teacher training through a programme called Teach First. From September to March, my anxiety and depression levels have been the highest they have ever been from a job (I was previously a project manager). 

Since the lockdown was enacted here in the UK and schools closed, my mental health has improved tremendously. I am still required to set work online for my class, however I have time to cook, clean, relax and effectively spend wonderful quality time with my son and wife. I had always hated work in general, and would get really bored with a job after about 8 months and quit. I also like different things and to learn new things, so I've worked in so many different industries (retail, sales, fitness, translation, project management, now teaching).

I have always thought that the grass was greener on the other side, i.e. that there was a job or industry out there that I could enjoy and excel at. That is why I got into teaching, in order to make a difference and to have direct impact on positive change in childrens' lives. 

Now that the UK govt have announced that we will be returning indefinitely from 1 June, my anxiety is skyrocketing. It is almost like a bodily response - work is a virus and my body is trying to produce antibodies to get over this condition of disease (work). I now know that I want to be a stay at home father and not work at some job. This sub and various anarchist texts have really helped open my eyes to the slavery and indoctrination that we are subject to with regards to work culture. It is toxic and I want to escape in any way that I can.

Sorry for the rant, just needed to vent a bit and say thanks to you all for helping me through this.

19,"I'm 18, I've had 2 jobs for less than a year each, and I already despise working.","I've always thought there was something wrong with me... even before I ever had a job, I swear at 12 years old I said I never wanted to be one of those people working a 9-5 desk job or serving up burgers and fries behind a counter. I knew from a young age there was something undesirable about ""growing up"" and I tried to prolong childhood as long as possible. But now I'm an adult, and I just got fired from my job at Amazon after a month, and honestly I dont want to seek out another draining job I hate...

I have ideas for ways I could earn money until I can get a ged and start attending mortuary school/art school- or better yet just have none of it and do my own thing.

Here's some ideas off the top of my head:
-Grow fruit, sell on the side of the road
-Buy clothes in bulk from thrift stores, sell online
-make clothes/customize them and sell online
-Paint and sell my art, maybe do caricatures for tourists somewhere
-dog walker
-become a musician and sell my music
-Dog trainer
-Become an online sw and do cam guy stuff I guess? Is there a market for that?
-sell weed, I've actually done this before when I was 13/14 so I could probably do it again
-Focus all of my attention on learning animation and create the idea I've been sitting on for 4 years and then sell it to Adult Swim for a big payout
-freelance photography, maybe wedding photos/family portraits and stuff like that

Does anyone else have ideas? I'm seriously looking into just getting a part time gig I can stand just until I can get another source of income to take off. I'm just so tired of the rat race. I'm not even fighting for anything! I dont want kids. I dont want 3 cars and a boat. I dont want three story mansions. I just want a nice roomy place away from the city with a nice yard for gardening and dogs. That's it. This constant struggle and misery just to come home to the place I pay 1,450 a month just to sleep in... I dont want it. I fucking hate it. I hate watching my boyfriend kill himself at his job every day. I want to just get away from it all and live my life in peace.

22,Work vs mental health,"Guys, I've been off my meds for the two months I've been off work. I have been so productive and I have been enjoying life so thoroughly. I actually read a book, which is a big deal because I went from five a week to zero a year. It took me a year and a half to finally get past the first three chapters of Mistborn. I blew through it this past weekend.

I still have mental health issues, but without a job to go to I feel so much better. I was getting better. I was focusing on my actual health instead if my ability to force myself to function at a job I hate.

But I found out that my job is being given back to me soon. My mental health is declining again, so I'm getting back on my meds. My therapist will be getting a call from me soon. My anxiety was so low, guys. I felt confident. I felt good. I felt... productive. Inspired to create and put forth effort in everything I did.

23,We are on the same side. A majority of people have a common enemy. This enemy puts us against each other to distract us from the real enemy.,"When I talk to people on the left and right sides of the spectrum about their personal beliefs, they usually agree on most fundamental things. The division is created in pedantics, class separation, and confusion.

Let’s take guns for example. Republicans are under the impression that liberals want to take away their guns, so they outlash and bring their guns out more, and fight for more gun rights because they don’t want guns taken away. They also want guns to protect themselves from the “dangerous Mexicans”. 

But why are the Mexicans so “dangerous”? (Not claiming they are, just going over the logical argument) Because guns aren’t more tightly controlled in the US. Over 70% of guns recovered in Mexico can be traced back to the US. 

So in reality both groups are really just against those who use weapons wrongly. with republicans thinking more guns is the solution (and being conditioned to praise violence) and dems wanting tighter control as the solution. But they’re both trying to solve the same problem.

This is true with most political divisions I see. People trying to solve the same problems but working against each other in doing so, making both groups ineffective in achieving the goal. 

Let’s think of another example: abortion. Republicans don’t want innocent babies to be harmed. They are conditioned into believing thats what abortion is. But democrats also don’t want innocent babies to be harmed (after birth). Both have the goal of wanting less harm. But they are conditioned to think they are against each other.

I’ll do one more so you can see what I’m talking about. Republicans want cheap reliable electricity. Democrats want cheap (healthy/renewable) reliable electricity. This one actually has a solution that pleases both sides: nuclear. But both sides have been conditioned to believe the solution is wrong, so they fight over other shittier solutions. If they worked together and put money into fusion, it would please both completely.

Note: Yields will vary depending on the source: A demonstrably racist police officer will likely produce less grease than an obese judge (though, sometimes such racist police oil is of exceptionally high-quality and very satisfying in a vinaigrette over a light salad) and a politician may yield prolific volumes of oil, but of very poor quality (politicians in nature will consume anything - even putrid garbage (politician oil is well-known for its impurities)). In sufficient quantity, even low-quality politician oil may be effectively utilized on the Revolutionary's homestead for the general betterment of conditions while you work.

\*Rendering fat also can serve as a fantastic justification for getting out and culling any ""blue lives matter"" or ""thin blue line"" sympathies from your garden, which may have grown unconscionably parasitic and self-serving. Luckily, these parasites voluntarily identify themselves with badges, blacked-out American-Flags, Him&gt;i stickers, and their exceptionally small and underutilized reproductive bits - indeed, curious at it would seem, many of these parasites openly brag about how they underutilize their reproductive bits (I've asked a biologist who told me this starts to develop at the smallest biological scale. ""In cells,"" he said, whatever that means). In no time at all, you'll become a marvelously proficient parasite-hunter, and, after your first few attempts, your garden will be grateful!)

Safety note: Rendering animal fat may be dangerous, as is the collection of animal fat. Live animals have a tendency to lash out, once cornered, and are known to claw and scratch. Do not fear, they are generally weak, having accrued fat for rendering through years of lazy exploitation of real wealth-producing parts of your garden. A single, forceful, and deliberate ax-strike, blunt or sharp end, to any point above the renderee's shoulders will suffice for permanently subduing a subject of nearly any size. Don't worry about causing pain: they are parasites causing pain to productive parts of your garden, they are thorny and hard to manage, they grow to spaces where they are unwanted, they are hard to remove, and, last of all, they are like lobsters! What appears to be their screams is just pressure being released from within their exoskeletons - they are incapable of feeling pain like you or I! Happy hacking!)

Step 1, Preparation:

Dig out a shallow pit in sandy soil, roughly 12 inches deep, 4 feet wide (may need to be wider, depending on the width of the subject, and 2 feet longer than the hight of the subject.

Fill this pit with your kindling and fuel material (I like to use charcoal - for the convenience and the chance to use my propane flame thrower) and ignite. Once your coal bed is smoldering at a constant low-to-medium temperature, assemble your cast iron army of pots and fry-pans and set them into the amber embers. Proceed to Step 2.

Step 2, Melting:

Animal fat, like that from a judge, renders at a low temperature - a little bit higher than 100°C or 212°F. Higher temperatures can lead to a less pure end product, a lingering acrid or burnt tastes in the fat you render, or even a dangerous grease fire.

Remove liver and heart - usually dense with fat - (especially in an older judge!) and set aside. (We'll address how to make the best use of these tasty tidbits in a later episode, I promise!)

Remove visible fat layers and globules from the subject's body, trying to separate meat and tissue. Cube this fat into 1"" by 1"" by 1"" inch cubes and begin placing these fat-cubes into your heating cast iron army. Animal fat must be rendered slowly. Allow chunks to liquify. Eventually, cackling cracklins of small bits of meat will turn golden and the fat will be liquid. With sufficient stirring and careful heat attendance, the liquid fat should be mostly clear. Remove from heat and allow to cool until you are comfortable handling, further. Proceed to Step 3.

Step 3, Filtration:

Of the various methods of filtering rendered fat for use and storage, my favorite is the most rusticly basic: through a few layers of cheesecloth into a recycled mason jar. Allow to stand. Check for rancidity before consuming at any time in the future (especially if you are trying to limit your refrigeration related power expenses). Remember that once-good-fat can lose freshness and its constitution - never be afraid to throw out bad fat and start again.

Rendering fat can take all day, it will leave your homestead smelling like bacon for a week, and it almost certainly attracts hungry bears that Russian as soon as they smell an opportunity for a fat-dense snack. Sometimes, rendering fat is a good distraction from work: a fun way to spend a day. Other times, it's a completely necessary chore - vital to prevent an infestation of bureaucrats from overrunning a potentially idyllic garden.

Happy homesteading! And stay tuned for more tips on healthy, free living.",False,gsw9v3,pj566,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gsw9v3/short_story_oc_2020tw_glamorizing_violence/,0,3
39,I don’t know what to do.,"So I used my stimulus check to pay rent for May, June, and July and move out of my parents place. However the job I work right now is part time and before COVID I barely made a little over $400 a month. My rent is $400 a month and for right now I’m not being charged any utilities. Obviously though I need to find either a second or full time job if I want to stay here after August, which I definitely do. 

So I’ve been applying to different places and all that. Haven’t had any responses until yesterday when a call center position emailed me to set up an interview. Went to the interview today and they offered me the job and I accepted. After the offer we chatted a little more and it came out that they don’t offer breaks.

 I pretended like this wasn’t a problem and went home and read some of the reviews of the place on Indeed (should have done this before the interview smh) and apparently they don’t even let them take proper lunch breaks. Apparently they make you take lunch right at your desk. They also expect you to come in at least 10 minutes early to find a computer and get set up so you’re ready to take calls as soon as your shift starts and of course if you get a call right before you’re scheduled to leave you have to stay until the call is finished. 

My state doesn’t require employers to offer rest or meal breaks so this is perfectly legal but I don’t think I want to work for an employer who expects me to work an 8 hour day without so much as 10 minutes away from my desk to myself. It’s an even bigger problem for me because I’m a smoker (I know I know, horrible) and I start getting nicotine withdrawals after about 2 hours of no nicotine. I can go 4 before I reach my absolute breaking point. And yes I can get nicotine gum or something to make it through the day but that’s not really the point. The point is they don’t value the morale of their employees at all. They don’t even offer benefits and I’m ignorant of the law but I thought that was illegal for a full time position. 

It sounds like during the first few weeks the shifts for training are just 3 hours. I don’t know if I should follow through and accept the position and just pray to Satan I find a better offer before training is over or if I should just email them and tell them to fuck off. I’m just scared if I do that I won’t be able to find another offer before August and I’ll end up having to move back to my parents place.

41,No longer on furlough,"I'll try to keep this brief, but I just had to share somewhere, and this sub is the only place that will understand my feelings.

I was fortunate(?) enough to work at a place that didn't have to shut down and/or fire any employees once the pandemic started. However, revenue understandably dropped pretty heavily, so they eventually furloughed some of us. In this case, they had us working every other week. We were able to receive unemployment aid for the weeks we weren't working.

Being furloughed was the happiest I had been since I started working. I finally had free time to do the things I wanted to do, or just be lazy and do nothing! (And luckily my hobbies don't involve going out so the quarantine and self-isolation wasn't an issue for me.) I think my mental health and general happiness was at an all time high, even with the ongoing pandemic.

But now, things are opening back up... and even though I can't imagine our revenue has increased much, they are bringing furloughed employees back in. I'm going right back to having no free time, basically. I still get to work from home for now, which is already a lot better than having to go in to the office, but still... this just fucking sucks. I really, really don't want to go back. But I need the money, like we all do, so I'm stuck suffering.

Anyway... that's it. Hope you're all doing well, despite all the crazy shit going on in the world.",False,gszwnp,Chipperz,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gszwnp/no_longer_on_furlough/,6,2

70,Corporations are dictatorships,"&amp;nbsp;

Corporations are **dominant authoritarian regimes.** They operate with a top-down hierarchical power structure with concentrated power at the top. They have arbitrary policies that can be leveraged against you at any time. Employees are groomed through operant conditioning which they call ""professionalism,"" which helps the workplace **maintain social stability**. 

Employees thoughts, actions, and words are regularly suppressed, while harassment and other abuses of power have become standard. Employees often have no recourse, they are merely seen as inatamate objects to exploit.

Remember, just because you're a moderately comfortable worker who has the option of ""volunteering"" at a different dictatorship doesn't make you a liberated human being, it makes you a **complacent slave.** I get physically ill thinking about how nearly everyone on earth blindly submits obedience and passively accepts the tyranny of these fascists institutions. 

I often hear the repeated sentiment of someone's job being ""soul-destroying"". Maybe it's time people grew a spine and took the hint that we're living under a fascist model of authority and control. **How long will we keep bending the knee to these fascist institutions?** Do we have any dignity left as the human species? 

There is something called indignation, it is absolutely necessary and healthy to be indignant about our current situation. Make no mistake, **corporations are extremely dangerous** and will continue to strip future generations of their human autonomy unless we do take action. Coercing people into employment is a form of violence. Deprivation of resources is a form of violence.

There wouldn't be any internal power plays in a legitimate civilization. There are no legitimate authority figures that possess special rights to rule over you - whether it be your boss or manager, a police officer, or the dean of a university. **It is a misguided belief to be ruled by ""authorities"".** You are an independent being gifted with free expression, who has the capacity of self ownership.

It has been said that the fear of death is the beginning of slavery. We should feel **compelled to take action** and not stay silent in the midst such evil. It is our moral obligation do something about our current situation and not stand idley by. If this message resonates with you, you have the potential to become a **light bearer upon society.** We need people with a backbone to stand up and promote the truth.

It is important to recognize that intolerance towards intolerance equals tolerance, paradoxically. It phases itself out. It needs to be recognized that there are limits to tolerance. Are you going to keep letting a **fraudulent civilization** based upon ""corporate rule"" strip you of your natural human rights and exploit you? **Are you going to tolerate that?**

According to corporations there is no objective truth. Do you know how many atrocities have taken place in the name of ""following orders"" and being ""obedient"" or simply being ""tolerant""? This is where **true evil** exists, where the truth and morality become suppressed and we become obedient participants to arbitrary codes of conduct.

Here is a fact that many people tend to overlook and not accept, I think it's particularly important for people to understand the fact that **our societies are saturated with addiction**. There is a broad spectrum of addiction ranging from pornography, pharmaceutical drugs/alcohol and gambling - to shopping, television, internet, and much more.

If we understood that we've essentially become complacent slaves with unhealthy addictions, we would stand a greater chance of a fundamental shift towards legitimate freedom. **We need to be honest with ourselves about our addictions,** change cannot be brought forth by a **degenerate population** with unhealthy addictions, and the powerful ownership class are **intimately aware of this fact.**

73,"I’ve been homeless, and would rather be homeless","Listen I’ve been homeless two times, once when me and my fam moved to the United States, and another time when I moved out on my own. 

Let me be clear, I would rather be homeless than work in a warehouse I’ve worked in three and the work is just so boring and dull that I can’t take it. (Carters, Amazon and Chico’s FAS). I have also worked at a poultry(if you don’t think hell exists on earth, work at the poultry lol) 

The biggest mistake my family ever made was to leave PuertoRico(our home) where we had our own land and farms(think permaculture). My dad  barely worked(he worked a lot on his own land but barely for money), the concept of “hoarding” was ridiculous to us. Why would we make something we don’t need? We were very modest, and lived in this small home. Guess what though? I remember being the happiest person on earth during that period. The only time I was ever happy in the US, was when I worked at the school district as a substitute teacher(this being my current job but got furloughed due to Covid 19).  Good luck paying bills on that wage though lol. 

My point is, I wish I could go back to a more simple time. I’ll probably add a few pics of the home we used to live in, very small. We were happy though.",False,gqangs,bmoral91,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gqangs/ive_been_homeless_and_would_rather_be_homeless/,33,1
74,More action less venting,"To start, I definitely sympathize with the need to vent about the injustice of capitalistic wage slavery on this subreddit.  I get it.  As I type this I’m drinking to cope with the fact that I only have 13ish hours left until I have to get up for work.  It is most definitely the booze talking here but I’ve found myself wondering why we don’t all band together and try something else.  

Like honestly, what do we have to lose?  It seems that as a community we’re all fairly miserable coloring within the lines of the current system.  We may not have much in the way of resources or skills as individuals but I’m sure collectively we could buy some cheap land in the middle of nowhere, throw up some basic infrastructure, and start working towards a better system via trial and error.  It wouldn’t even have to be a full time thing, maybe just a proof of concept until it becomes self sustaining.  

We have all of human history to use as a guide and we’ve seen how both Communism and Capitalism have failed.  As a group can’t we come up with something better on a small scale and then use that as a model to entice the rest of the world to come along with us?  What am I missing here?  Is there any realistic reason this couldn’t be possible other than the fear of the unknown and lack of commitment from participants?  If those are the only obstacles they definitely seem like fixable problems to me.

76,Work is just a popularity contest,"Hard work, intelligence, productivity, etc. etc. are all bullshit.  The only thing that matters is if the boss/client likes you.  Unless you're a surgeon or a nuclear physicist, the tasks are easy and can be done by anyone.  The only thing that matters in getting ahead is whether the right people like you.  If you're simply good at doing your job, no matter how well you do it, you are just a disposable drone and they will get rid of you whenever they don't feel like paying you anymore.  They can always replace you with someone else.

If you really want to get ahead, you have to make the people at the top like you and want to be in your company.  That's the only way to get access to the club, and it's a very small club.  But they will never teach you that in school.  In school they spin a bullshit tale that if you study hard, then you will get a job where you can work real hard and be able to afford a mortgage and a nice vacation each year.  

People are waking up and realizing that they will never be part of the club but it's too late.

Antiwork is not antinatalism. Please never let the two become intertwined.

I myself have never wanted to procreate and I never will for both practical and ethical reasons. During the darkest period of my life, I went down the rabbit hole that is philosophical pessimism and that led me to discover antinatalism and the antinatalism subreddit which seems to be a mix of obnoxious memes, pro-vegan nonsense and angsty anecdotes. Fundamentally, while I agree with certain arguments against procreation, antinatalism seems to me a defeatist ideology which offers no solutions to ease the suffering of those who are alive and struggling under the shackles of capitalism. Ironic for an ideology which purports to care so much about the suffering of living things. Seems one must be a hypothetical being for them to give a shit.

78,Scared about working in the future.,"I was working a decent job at a distribution center. I didn’t have to interact with people but the people I did interact with were friendly enough. I was content with just doing my own thing and working with my head down. I’ve hated every job I’ve had. They all feel soul sucking and make me miserable by the time I’ve come home but this job was different. Or at least it was in theory. 

There was always something gnawing at me in the back of my mind. I never really wanted to go to work but I would always tell myself “it’s not a half-bad job so just suck it up.” About a month before quarantine hit, I was miserable once again. I hated work. It was taking time away from the things I liked doing, and I was always thinking of being home and doing creative things like writing and drawing. When I got home I could barely get excited to do anything I liked doing because I was too anxious thinking about going to work the next day. I realized that no matter what job I had, I was never going to be happy, that eventually I would see it as a vacuum that sucked up all my time. So I quit. It was a hasty and thoughtless decision. I just did it because I was so fed up.

I had a few days of peace where I could relax without thinking of work but then I was hit with quarantine. I thought “oh this is lucky, I’ll just stay home until this thing passes, work on my mental health, and then get a job with a healthy mindset! I have so much free time to work on the things I love!” Maybe not the best way to look at a pandemic but that was my mindset at the time.

It didn’t end up that way. Anything I do, I feel like I’m failing in life. I can’t draw without thinking ‘is this gonna hep me be a successful person in the future? Is it gonna help me make money? If not, then it’s a waste of time.’ All I do now is dread the future because I know I’m going to have to go back to work. I just sit around, wondering what the hell am I supposed to do. I don’t want to exist if all I have to look forward to is this feeling of dread. 

I have no idea what to do with my life and it feels helpless. Not even my hobbies are fun, and my therapist isn’t helping. Sorry, that’s a long rant but I needed to vent.",False,grxywd,Mhetttt,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/grxywd/scared_about_working_in_the_future/,3,1

83,Tips to ask for a 4 day work week?,"HI guys, I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit (please lmk where would be better to ask this if so). Like a lot of people, my work life has been impacted immensely by the pandemic. I am an essential employee, so for the past 3 months the department i work in has been broken up into teams and working 3/12 shifts. Everyone is much happier on these new shifts and the quality of work has been positively impacted as well. Before the pandemic we were under-staffed and working 45-50 hour weeks. Next week we are switching back to 5 day work weeks and bsolutely nobody is looking forward to it. People in multiple departments are talking about 4/10s. I think that since everyone wants it and since they hae proven that it's possible to switch from a 5 day week then it is actually possible for us to get a 4 day work week if we ask. I have a lot of questions as to how to go about doing this. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Should I ask for a one on one meeting with just my direct manager? Should I meet with my manager and upper management together? Should I ask for a whole team meeting where everyone is present including coworkers and upper management?
2. What potential counter arguments will management give to try to stop us from working 5 days? What will they explicitly tell me to get me to agree that 4 days is not a good idea? How should I reply?
3. What would their actual motivation be for us to work 5 days a week? The way I see it, they would save money if we all worked 40 hours instead of 50 per week. Despite what they tell me, what would their actual goal be in refusing a 4 day week?
4. Should I talk to my coworkers about a sort of plan of action if they say no? I don't think anyone on the team would be willing to strike or do any other action if we are denied. Is asking futile without a plan B?
5. Do I need to have absolutely everyone on my side before asking? If so, how can I convince my coworkers that 4 days will be better than 5 days? I have only talked to 1 person who genuinely doesn't want 4/10s. 

Overall, WHAT AM I DOING HERE?? I am very scared but I feel like I need to do this sooner because if we wait too long and fall back into the swing of things, everyone will become complacent.

So I l recently got out of the military and decided to jump right into the workforce despite not needing the money bc I figured it would be a good idea to ease back into the lifestyle. Picked up a security job working night shift making 15/hr, didn’t seem too bad at first. Didn’t take long for working there for my overall mental well being to go to shit. To get off every day at 8am and then go to sleep just to wake up to have work again that night was making me fucking miserable. 

Doing this every day just to make less than 500 a week honestly blew my mind how people live off of work like this. The only full day I had off was Saturday and I was usually too tired to even enjoy it. 

I decided I didn’t need to live like that anymore. I put in my two weeks notice and I’m going into my final week tomorrow, and I couldn’t be more excited. What is weird to me is that I usually worked longer days while I was in the military, but since it was salary pay I felt more like I was getting paid for the contributions I made vs just being paid for giving hours of my life. I don’t know if I can do hourly pay jobs ever again.

I did some research and the CEO of the company I was working for made 17 millions dollars last year. Me working full time with 2 weeks of vacation would have made about 24,500 after taxes and deductions.

I feel like so much of our life seems to be based around this idea of ""hard work"". In some ways, it might be one of, if not the most universally respected value.  


We make moral judgements based on it. i.e.   
\-""You have to put in the work, to work hard.""  
\-""If you're not willing to put in the work, you didn't want it enough.""  


\-No matter what, someone will come up with a scenario where you have to work hard and not give up, and it will be grueling but worth it.   


Even if people don't like hard work, they've conditioned themselves to respect it in some capacity or pay lip service to it.   


My take:   


\-I don't consider hard work a virtue in of itself. I think it needs to be something worth doing.   


\-At the same time, it's true that not everything in life is something you want to do. In that case, you have to find the right tools and strategies. I suppose this would be in line with ""work smarter, not harder"". If you have to do something you don't want to do, you still have to find the right solution, and not try to toil endlessly.

110,Can we please actually do something?,"Listen, 

If any of you actually want to create change, we need to actually organize and create a plan, I made another post about this earlier. If we do not organize, we will never reach a state in which work is TRULY voluntary.

&amp;#x200B;

First, we have to agree that the system we currently have in place goes against our fundamental value of focusing on NEEDs only. Do people not understand that to even bring an idea that is so contradictory to our current system(Capitalism) will lead to a inflammatory response?

Slave-wage is real epidemic in the USA, we need to create RADICAL change.

I have nothing to live for, not in a suicidal way, but nothing in this world makes sense and I chose not to live my life like this until I die. We have to strike or do something. No more idol talk, no more sitting and typing someone or some people have to band together and stop this. The numbers here say only 119,282 and yet every person I talk to in my state, every kid that is growing up, old people, just everyone seems fed up, and they have no one to count on.

114,Is it bad that I feel so apathetic about my first job at 2 weeks in?,"I just graduated in March and started my first job 2 weeks ago. When I was doing my internship I felt so apathetic about going to work for 8 hours, only working for 2 hours (my coworkers would play COD for 2.5 hours after lunch just to kill time) and worrying about commuting to and from work everyday. What a waste of time and effort like I couldn’t believe people accept living like that. 

I was actually kind of relieved when Covid cut my internship short so I could chill out. But alas, I knew I still had to make money and thankfully I found a job that’s WFH. I thought WFH would make me at least like work a little bit but nope, I still hate it. My coworkers are fine and the work is easy but I just feel so annoyed by it. 

My position involves me talking to sales people in the company (middle man between sales and development) and when the sales person doesn’t communicate clearly what they mean, I think to myself “well f-ck you, you idiot”.

I’m usually an anxious person and it would make me anxious if I made a mistake misunderstanding a colleague but damn at this point I’m sick of being anxious. Why should I be anxious! This feels pointless anyway. 

I know that thats just work but in my 2 short weeks of working I’ve realized that 

1. Lot of dumb people out there. 

2. We waste a lot of time cause of miscommunication, forcing processes that don’t work and useless meetings and HR stuff.

JUSTICE FOR GEORGE FLOYD!

A nightmare for millions of black Americans was caught on video in south Minneapolis and now has
been displayed across the globe; the execution of George Lloyd by police. Video posted by the
Washington Most confirmed that George Lloyd did not resist arrest. Met a white cop put his knee across
Lloyd's neck and slowly choked him to death. He clearly repeats “I can’t breathe”, with the officers knee
‘on his neck for 9 minutes. Other officers stood by while one murdered George Lloyd. Over the report
that someone in the area tried to use a face $20 bill.

ATU members live with similar fears on a daily basis. ATU members face racism daily. Our members live
in.and work in the neighborhoods where actions like this happen, and where this took place, now
watched in horror across the globe.

Police brutally is unacceptable! His system has failed all of us in the working class from the Coronavirus
to the economic crisis we are facing. But this system has failed People of Color and Black American's and
Black youth more than anyone else. More than ever we need a new Civil Rights Movement. Civil Rights.

127,F*****g liars!,"Hello fellow antiworkers. 

I had yearly review just a few weeks ago and my boss promised me that eventhough some of my assignments will be outsourced to another affiliate company in country with cheaper labor she will take care and provide me with additional tasks in addition to assignments which will be not outsourced. 

At that time I had an offer for position in another company which I liked very much. But I decided to be loyal and continue to work in the position I already had. What a mistake! Now when some of my assignments will be outsourced she told me to prepare to be laid off. So she did not do anything to secure my workplace as she promised she would do. I am almost certain that she promised me that because she somehow supposed I had interviews for positions in other companies and she was afraid if I left too early there will be nobody to take over my assignments and then she would have to do it.

I just can't understand how could I be so naive and believe to my boss' words. I thought that you could trust someone in the management. When she told me I would be laid off she added that I was told that because open communication is one of main values of our company. Well if that is true I will also communicate openly and tell you to f\*\*k off!!!

Did something similar happened to you? I am sad mainly not because I was told to be laid off but because I believed what she told me and wanted to be loyal so I put down the offer which I thought was very good. What would you do in that situation? I feel really dissapponted right now... If I did not believe to her I will have stable good job in good company.

CHINA'S SOCIAL
CREDIT SYSTEM

It's been dubbed the most ambitious expert-
men in digital social control ever undertaken.
The Chinese government plans to launch its
Social Credit System nationally by 2020.

Engaging in charity work

WHAT'S THE AIM?

The system intends to monitor, rate

and regulate the financial, social,

moral and, possibly, political behave-

for of China’s citizens - and also the

country’s companies - via a system

of punishments and rewards. The

stated aim is to “provide the

trustworthy with benefits and

discipline the untrustworthy. ” Taking care of elderly

family members

The Chinese government considers

the system an important tool to steer

China’s economy and to govern

society. There is still much special-

ton about how the final system will

actually function. Details in this

chart are based on pilot schemes and

plausible expert expectations.

records and existing data from
registry offices or school officials - Helping the poor
along with digital sources. The latter
include data collected on the

142,Not working as a result of the quarantine has been delightful,"For starters I am a 26(M) living with my dad. I delivered pizzas but I recently quit just because I don't want to give my dad a deadly virus. He is over 60 and has asthma so I am not going to risk my dad's life to deliver pizza's lol. Also, I really hate working and I am heavily introverted and don't like being around others that much. I have money saved up so it's not really a big deal. He wants me to get back to work but it simply terrifies me that I could get him sick and I am also terrified of getting back to work and slaving away for greedy pigs. It's a tricky situation because I don't have infinite amounts of money to sustain this and our government is a bunch of degenerates so I don't expect much help from them. Eventually I feel like I will have to go back to work but idk man its just a weird situation.

Despite all of that, I am enjoying myself immensely. With endless free time my mental health has improved exponentially. I have been meditating more. I have read around 4 books already. I have gotten back to lucid dreaming. I am playing video games that I previously have not beaten yet. I don't get to see my close friend because of the quarantine but I still get to hang out with him in virtual reality. I'm exercising a lot more.  I just feel so content and carefree most of the time with zero desire to go back to work. What breaks my heart is the knowledge that most people I feel like rarely ever get to experience this freedom, this happiness.  My theory is that if more humans have access to states of well-being and bliss, more people would naturally be able to detach from toxic cultural belief systems. This would include the myth of scarcity and how you must ""work to eat"", etc. 

In Buddhism, I learned that true change begins within the mind. In order for things to change, people must see that there is so much more to life then the endless corporate grind. People must see for themselves that heaven exists IN THIS VERY MIND AND BODY and it's not something that is just waiting for them after they die. We should spend our time loving each other and to make sure everyone is cared for. Individualism/capitalism is a SCAM. We are all in this world together and we are all connected. We should strive for nothing less than the complete eradication of all human suffering.

143,COVID-19 unemployment issues exposing shady business practices. Employers sabotaging workers. Forcing people to pay back money to the state. Are some employers just as bad as crooked politicians?,"I made a post in r/unemployment bringing attention to the toxic workplace and how employers are using the $600 benefit as the reason people are not returning to work.

If you check out r/unemployment, there are some recent posts about people who are being told to return their unemployment money to the state. 

Employers are playing games and sabotaging benefits. They are being greedy and selfish. In fact there is actually some kind of scam they are pulling with the PPP loans. Someone made a post about this scam going on all over the country. Do you think the modern day employer (small or large business) is just as bad as crooked politicians in terms of screwing people over? I think the issue of mismanaged workplaces is sooo much bigger than people know. It's in all industries.

I really think the federal govt should come up with a task force (similar to corona virus task force) and actually hold these employers accountable to provide a decent wage and work environment. Lucky for me I don't have children so I really could be like screw your job and pitch a tent (not really but you get my point) These jobs take advantage of the fact that people feel obligated to provide for their family, even if it means being miserable and not getting paid enough.

I then got assigned to this project which I was way under qualified for (the boss presented me and another guy as senior developers, when I was still just literally picking up the ropes). Needless to say, my performance has horrible, I failed to meet expectations; leading to another extension of my probational period to a total of 5 months. 

Then the pandemic hit, and they’ve been keeping silent about my status. So I’ve been WFH for the past month, performing as usual. I was requested (read: **forced**) to start going to the office this coming Monday. Unfortunately, I felt a bit sick today (probably due to all the work related stress). 

So I sent an email to HR asking if I could monitor my conditions for a few days to see how it goes before I return to the office and just continue working from home. HR forced me to go to the clinic or doctor to get a fucking MC because they could not trust me. At the point I decided; you know what? I’m not going to stay at this shit hole anymore and sent in my resignation letter. I had to pay one months worth of salary because I failed to give a months notice. But I don’t even care anymore.

I feel scared, sad, overwhelmed, hopeless, and guilty. But strangely, when I sent that email; it felt like a huge burden was lifted off me.

no. Fuck that shit, man. I'm tired of working so hard and putting in so much thought to this shit which only further stresses me out. 

I can't quit because I need the money for basic necessities (thanks to this shitty system), but tomorrow, I'm going to come in WITHOUT leaving my pride, personal life, and soul at the door. I'm going to be prioritizing my own hobbies while at work, instead of losing more and more sanity each day overthinking about their irrelevant bullshit. 

For starters, I'm going to come in tomorrow with a notepad and a pen, and focus solely on language learning, which is something I loved to do but got eaten up by the stupid amount of hours I work. I'll stop rushing to the next task every time we get one, and instead take a few minutes in between, because fuck that shit, half the time I get stuck in a nonstop rush of tasks for, sometimes, almost 90% of my work day, and it's a constant, nonstop rage-inducing cycle. (Luckily, in my particular position, I mainly work in an area with no surveillance, so they won't even notice that I'm not focusing on the work.) **I thought this shit would end once I quit the fast food industry, but no, it's the same everywhere.**

Once I've destressed, and start to realize I can focus on myself instead of selling my soul, mind, and body to this system, I'll be able to focus on my next step, which is finding a source of income that will free up my time, and allow me to focus on what's truly important, which is trying to start gaining wealth and power, and then actually use it to start making a difference in this world, unlike the people who are in power right now who aren't doing anything to change the way things are.

The sad part is most of the other property managers are completely fine with it. Of course they are their properties come with a heavily discounted apartment the company provides, and they have a clientele that doesn't treat people in the office like crap. The rest of us in this company relied on those bonuses to survive. They still have some kind of incentive but it is just down right insulting at 3 dollars per lease when we are already at maximum capacity which means until someone moves out there won't be any new leases. I'm very confused on the idea of having a commission sales structure with no commission for the sales person.

207,Coping mechanisms to hold down an income?,"So I'm changing jobs (again), in no small part because I've become a bit of an antagonist at my last few workplaces—its incredibly hard not to view the bosses in an adversarial way and begin subtly turning workers against the business. Doesn't play out well for me, with disciplinary meetings about being ""less negative"", or more ""solutions focused"", despite honestly having no useful solutions to offer  when 9/10 times I view the source of the problem as roughly ""wage slavery under capitalism is exploitive, and you're doing it"" which we of course can't solve in the day-to-day operation of a single business.

But I'm so tired of being stuck in this antagonistic position. During COVID it was the two people who stand up for ourselves that got the most reduced hours. But I need work to pay rent. I'm tired of being treated negatively basically because I don't tow the company line with unwavering enthusiasm. And I *know* I am not bad at my job.

So: coping mechanisms?

Because I can't hide this completely—its absolutely a part of my personality by now. At my next job I hope I can manage this better so it doesn't cause me as much strife.

I have come up with:  
• Strictly divest my value system from work—don't let my employment situation be where I derive fulfilment, virtue, or my sense of self-worth.  
• Set firm working boundaries and prefer to be told off for ""slacking"" (and be mentally prepared for it) than to compromise these boundaries—if you give and inch they'll take a mile  
• Perhaps its better to present myself as some kind of lazy, slightly incompetent, or ""slacker"" personality to mask my outright antagonism for the owners .. I am not sure. I can't hide it completely.  
• Strict secrecy and stealth applied to any kind of worker organising that ends up happening despite my best attempts to keep a lid on this tendency of mine.  
• Just work less. My new role is 4 days a week.

211,My plan to escape (and how you can too)," Hey guys so I've brought up Permaculture on this thread a few times but up until recently I thought of it as a means to retire or at least cut down hours worked needed to survive week by week. I plan on starting a business doing Permaculture consulting and execution to help people transform their manicured costly grass lawns into sustainable food forest gardens. In doing so we will build community, resilience, feed people healthy and nutritious food, mental health and many more benefits. I plan on composing a booklet explaining this, introducing myself and Permaculture and leaving it door to door on houses that have a lot of sun/few trees already established. I also plan on buying and developing  a property in the future to settle on and teach Permaculture. 

I plan on starting off at 50$ an hour (I have confidence that the savings from not mowing, grocery bills and possible profits they will make off of investing in their property will pay off within a couple years or less) Also I am estimating that the more established consultants makes upwards of 200$ an hour. I have so much hope and faith in this, if I can escape this hell forsaken exploitative restaurant I will be truly at peace. If people recieve the booklets, decide not to hire me and do it themselves it is still worth it to me. The less reliant we are on industrial farming, the more likely we are to prevent ecological collapse, the less exploitation of the impoverished will occur, the more happy we will be. :) 

Also, mowers emit 20x more co2 then cars I'm pretty sure. 

So, it's just a matter of convincing someone who owns property at this point. I'll let you know how it goes, I still need to complete my Permaculture designer course and I hope you look into Permaculture more, I'm very open to ideas and input and why it might not work, thank you.",False,gpslhu,Mr_Shroom_King,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gpslhu/my_plan_to_escape_and_how_you_can_too/,3,1

I know for a fact that I never wanna work for a company again. I need to leave my current job but I won't have another form of income. I have started my own website since working from home during lockdown, but it's obviously going to take a while to pick up, getting the right audience etc.

Our country (South Africa) is on lockdown so we're all working from home and can only go to the grocery store etc. Last weekend I decided to stay at my boyfriends place for the weekend..

My manager messages me at 9PM on Friday night to say that I need to do work on the Saturday (BTW we don't work on weekends and if we ever do, we never get paid for overtime work or weekend work).. So I respond to him and say I'm unfortunately not home and have left my laptop at home.. I'll be back on Sunday.. He then responds and says 'You're out, during lockdown??' and I respond 'yes'. Then he says 'But you're not allowed to. If you don't want to work then you can just say so'

I was in disbelief... I just responded that this is a personal matter and I have no reason to lie.. Then proceeded to give him contact details of our agency that could do the work he needed me to do... He then called me the entire day Saturday (knowing I wasn't home) and on Sunday I eventually rushed home to do all this work he needed for Monday.. Because 'senior' told him to.

I'm so tired of this rat race. This Cannot be my life X_X... This is the second time this has happened now.. The first time I refused to do work on the weekend and he gave me a long speech about how he had to work weekends when he started out his career. I responded that I did that in previous side jobs too but the difference now is that I don't get paid for it, even though I do occasionally choose to work overtime because I'm passionate about what I do... Back then his response was that he never doubted my passion and that I'm one of the best in the department..


BTW the salary I receive isn't even worth all this... But what other route do I even have when the whole country is on shut down.. Not like I can quit and find another job.. I don't even want to be working at all for someone else..

I'm an atheist-- have been for a long time. I meditate a lot-- have thoughts on divinity etc. etc. and can parse theologies-- but not a believer outside of any mystical sense. My job? I'm a church musician. 

I'm thankful for my job because it's stable and I've proved myself a huge value add with all the tech work I've done to put content and livestreams out for our parish. 

But I am sooo sick of a) talking to stupid people-- and b) pretending to value Christianity. It's not even close-- I can't handle a religion mounted on belief in specific doctrines and claiming to know about a discrete entity at the helm. It's just unbelievably ridiculous to think that. 

Being inauthentic for a long time has a cost. I am living a lie-- pretending to believe things I don't, constantly helping organizations I don't support... etc. etc. It sucks to dump energies into menial and shitty musical presentations for people with bland aesthetic values and accuse me of showing off if I produce well. I understand the conceits of my complaining, my context, etc. etc. so don't start about it. I'm aware of my luck, what's positive in my life etc. etc.

I’m a lifelong artisan who practices many creative trades. All this down time has not only allowed me to indulge in them with passion again, but also to successfully launch the business I’ve been planning for years. Sales aren’t crazy for being open a month, but I love the entire process of running my own brand and making art that people will love.

I’m doing house projects that have been on hold for literal years. I’m thoroughly enjoying “the little things” about life more often than ever.

My boyfriend and I are having a wonderful time together. My spirit feels aligned and at peace, not in some “quote on a yoga mat” way but like seriously—the energy in my body is thriving and untainted by the rampant negativity I experience while working.

When I found out that in a week we’ll be opening again, I immediately burst into tears. I work at a casino. The industry is mega fast-paced, ruthless, and unforgiving. I don’t want to come home smelling like cigs every day. I don’t want to get harassed by customers for hours. I don’t want to watch rich people burn through tens of thousands of dollars while others look for change tickets on the floor. I don’t want to walk back into the epitome of existential capitalist dread—but it’s the best paying job I’ve ever had and I HATE that I can’t imagine not bringing home the income I normally would because I’ve still got one foot stuck in that “wage slave” mentality :(

I have enough money saved to be okay for a few months, but I don’t see my business growing enough to sustain me the rest of the year (but I’m sure as hell gonna try).

218,A Fun Quote from Marcus Rediker’s “Villains of All Nations” About Pirates and Antiwork Attitudes,"“Some mariners cast their lot with pirates in order to escape any sort of work at all. A transatlantic merchant ship of 250 tons, which would have had a working crew of 15 to 18 “hands,” would, if taken and refitted by pirates, have been manned by 80 to 90 men, each of whom, accordingly, had much less work to do. As pirate Joseph Mansfield said in 1722, “the love of Drink and a Lazy Life” were “stronger Motives with him than Gold.” Admiral Vernon knew of such motives and sought to address them in his own way. From Jamaica jails he took sixteen suspected pirates aboard his man-of-war and immediately assigned them to backbreaking work at the pump, thinking “it might be of service to carry them out of the way of falling into their old Courses,” and, moreover, “mighty be a Means to learn them... Working,” which “they turned Rogues to avoid.” Woodes Rogers, governor of the Bahamas and another man who knew pirates well, noted that when it came to work, “they mortally hate it.” Samuel Buck knew the pirate community in the Bahamas before Rogers arrived and echoed the governor’s words: “working does not agree with them.””

It seems like nowadays it is not enough to work an exhausting 40 hours a week, sometimes more, work schedule, commute, go grocery shopping, cooking and cleaning. On top of that you have to constantly 'improve yourself'. Be the best version of yourself you can be. We are under constant attack by the forces of the free market, they make us alienated from one another, they force us to pay ridiculous rents and live in scarcity and uncertainty. But of course if you feel lonely, you just need to stop whining and 'work on yourself'. If you feel depressed, 'you need to love yourself more'. People treat themselves as a start-up, they have applied all the entrepreneurial gibberish and propaganda to their personal and emotional lives. 

Humans thrive on cooperation and community. Mutual support. You're never going to replace the affection of friends, family and a community by any amount of 'improving yourself' whatever that means. It's genuinely disheartening to see hoy many people buy into this individualist dogma and perpetuates it giving it in form of advice, especially on the internet. The oligarchs and the capitalist elites WANT us to think like this, they want us divided, they want us to not care about each other and be only preoccupied with production, they want to erase any kind of working class conscience and solidarity.

229,"Dad just got layed-off during COVID-19, now I'm the only one in my family making income","We just got sad news today that my dad was one of the employees that will get layed off (he works for the hotel industry). There's a chance that they might get called back after this whole virus things blows over, but who knows when that'll be. 

Now I'm the only one left in my family that could support us with a stable income. I have two younger siblings in school, and my mom is unemployed for years now. Thankfully, there's no news of an impending lay-off in our company, so i guess it can be pretty stable for me for now. 

But then here's the thing, I REALLY  hate this job. This is job my first job out of university, is it really supposed to be like this? Task lists just gets longer and longer everyday with no end in sight. It's not even fulfilling when I get to finish a task. All I'd get is more of them. 

Deadlines are high pressure. Pressure from direct boss isn't helping either. She'd sometimes call me suddenly at night, off-hours, just to get some info from me, and even a *scolding* every now and then. No, scratch that, make that a lot.  We are expected to keep track and be aware of EVERY single thing that is happening on our projects (right now, I'm involved with about five), calling and getting info from tens of people at a time everyday, aside from doing our actual work. It's just so unreasonable. 

I can't quit and I can't just start half-assing my job(at the risk of getting fired), I really don't know what to do. I think i'm really close to a mental break, I feel like sobbing right now and never I had once felt this while I was in college. 

Was anyone else in a similar situation? Don't think I have much choice but to just tough it out for the next couple of months.

Also I am from Spain where we have an unemployement rate of 20% most of the years.

My problem is I like my life as it is right now and althought I am a graduate, I am a Software Engineer I dont want to work cause Im not happy when Im working cause for me it doesnt change my life, my lifestyle is the same working or not working.

237,Others Like Me,"Having just come across this sub, I feel a genuine sense of relief and community with the rest of you all on here. I guess I just want to share a few things about where I stand regarding the idea.  


Most people ""get"" my feelings of not wanting to work but no, they really don't. They get wanting to go home early but they still defend it, like it's still outside their comprehension that work is not a fact of life itself.   


Most people assume that not wanting to work equals depression but I'm sure many of you know it doesn't. I have certainly dealt with depression, but I experience lots of passion and enjoyment as well. I want to do all sorts of things, freely, on my own time, in my own way.   


We are all in the same boat; hard-working people have many of the same desires I have and are doing their best to achieve them from within their worldview.   


Most people wish their was a better way. I wish they would just admit it completely and not pretend like it's a good system.  


I'm pretty confident in the belief that, if everyone stopped doing what they don't want to do and started only doing what they genuinely wanted to, everything would work out. The right people would be inspired to take care of the food, the right people would be inspired to do this and that, previously untapped resources would be revealed, etc.  


This society of ours is a reflection of our collective beliefs. We believe in a zero-sum game. We believe our authentic nature is not enough. We believe in survival of the fittest. We believe that the basic nature of our lives is to fall apart. We believe that, so we see the evidence of it, and we act accordingly and reinforce it. Perhaps not a single one of these beliefs are objective facts.   


I wouldn't want to take anyone's world-view away from them forcefully for a second. I've dealt with existential fear around the loss of my old world view plenty and wouldn't wish for anyone to go through that. Still, it's kind of stunning to me that people can live for years and decades as adults and actually believe that lifestyle is 'what life is'.   


I'm not surprised or upset that people work; I'm more surprised about how unconsciously most people seem to make that choice, and that's the difference in this community that I appreciate.

Other guy: 

""Well I hope you’re happy living off the hard work of other people. Y’all are just lazy fucks who blame everyone for y’all’s problems. I grew up in poverty and have managed to go to a good school for free and have some good prospects after school.""

My response: 

""Lucky you. My education has left me in tens of thousands of dollars of debt. I work 50, 60, 70hrs a week, commuting sometimes two hours each way. A large percentage of my income is from self employment and contract work, and I pay taxes in three to five states every year. I have paid far and beyond above my fair share into the common fund, and when this is over will go right back to doing the same. 

However, through darkness there is light. Although this terrible plague has shaken the earth to it's core, there is a silver lining. I have been able to cook and eat dinner with my whole family together, even if it is something we scavenged together from what little is in the fridge. This is the first time I've been able to do this, on a regular basis, in years.

I can cook breakfast, even if it is just something simple, and drink a cup of coffee in the yard, instead of rushing out to catch the train, with no breakfast, buying a coffee on the way to work. 

And I've lost nearly ten pounds since this started, because I can finally go outside and ride my bike, or hike, or walk the dog almost every day. I've been slowly gaining weight, and slowly becoming depressed because I can't do anything about it, due to my unpredictable work schedule.

Yes, many people are sick and dying, and I pray for them and the rest of this world every minute of every day. But this may very well be the only time in my life where I have freedom like I do right now, and I feel like a kid again. It's that feeling when the last bell rings and summer begins. When was the last time you felt that?

Say what you want. Take my unemployment away, take the supplement away, take the stimulus check back, I don't care. I still won't go back to work.

Because there's no way in hell I'm putting myself and my family at risk so some fat cat can line his pockets while flipping nickels and dimes at me every now and then.""",False,gmyrtf,murderoustoast,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gmyrtf/no_way_in_hell/,16,2

Having a basic income for the rest of my life would be life-changing, I'm tired of being demonized.","Sorry for the long title. I just have a lot of thoughts.

I've been trying to be approved for SSI for officially a year now. I'm in the appeals stage where I need to find a lawyer, but because I have no income since I can't work I've had to move around a *lot,* which makes it pretty difficult to find a lawyer, to say the least*.* In total, I have moved 8 times in the past 2 years to try and avoid being on the streets. More often than not, the places I ended up took their own toll on my mental health. When I first started out I sincerely did want to try and be a Good Disabled Person, and try to not remain in the system for too long, ""get better"", and enter the work force again. But after these 2 years of struggling, sometimes while actively working, I decidedly do not want to work anymore, ever again, if I can at all help it.

It's beyond exhausting when everyone acts like people on SSI are leeches and unworthy etc etc, doubly so when your disability is due to mental illness and nothing physical and even then, I've seen people tell amputees to get a job because they've seen *other* amputees still working. It's a one-up contest on suffering and there is never a winner. The most work I've ever been able to do is one-off odd jobs, but that's far from sustainable and I can't do things like that regularly enough to actually get by. I don't know how I'm going to survive like this. I've hardly been surviving at all, I've literally had to beg to have my basic needs met.

271,What Pandemic? Is Capitalism Fighting Back?,"That's it. All done.

Last week world governments were telling their people to stay home, and stay safe. That was the message. Global Pandemic. Death tolls were rising worldwide, people were adapting to a new social behavior modification. No choice. Lives were at stake. 

This week world governments are declaring it's open for business, back to work, back to schools, daycares, and all things Capitalism pretends to give us. Economy before life. That is now the message. Global Pandemic. Death tolls continue rising worldwide, but this time go about your daily activities. No choice. Lives are at stake.

Wait, what?

Is it that nothing has changed but the message?

It appears that's exactly what is happening. As death tolls continue to mount, it's become evident that Elite Capitalistic Leaders, Large Corporations, and now Bank Executives are calling for an end to the Lockdown.

The skewed priorities could not be clearer. The Economy is King.

Now it's at the actual expense of the people. The Economy must survive. Your brother, mother, friend, or coworker....not so much.
No longer important. The Worlds Capitalistic Economies are now willing to sacrifice a select portion of the entire population in order for the existing form of Capitalism to continue.

Go get your hair cut, go to Church, visit with friends and family, but most importantly get back to work. Earn money, spend money. And for that, you could now die and or kill others. That's the message. Like it or not.

What are the people supposed to believe? Who are they supposed to trust?

A reasonable person would believe that getting back to normal fast should not be the priority during a Pandemic. World governments, large corporations and banks would have you believe otherwise. 

Capitalism is fighting back. Looks like a fairly even fight so far. The Pandemic came out strong, made an impression.  Capitalism's indifference to the death of its people for the sake of the economy may even things out. The weak are a drain on Capitalism.Pandemics kill the weak. The poor are a drain on Capitalism. Pandemics kill the poor.  The elderly are a drain on Capitalism. Pandemics kill the elderly. Minorities are a drain on Capitalism. Pandemics kill minorities. If you didn't know any better a person might think that Capitalism is going to use the Pandemic to cull the herd and ease the burden.

277,Corporations are private dictatorships in disguise,"I am going to speak plainly, corporations are dominant authoritarian regimes. They operate with a top-down hierarchical power structure and hold concentrated power at the top. They have arbitrary policies that can be leveraged against you at any point. 

Over time, employees are groomed through operant conditioning which they call ""professionalism,"" which helps the workplace maintain social stability. Employees thoughts, actions, and words are regularly suppressed, while harassment and other inhumane abuses of power have become almost standard.

Human beings are often looked upon as objects, only to carry out their orders in the most efficient way possible. Just because you're a moderately comfortable worker who always has the option of ""volunteering"" at an alternative dictatorship doesn't make you a liberated individual.

We should feel compelled to take action and not stay silent in the midst such evil. There is something called indignation, it is absolutely necessary and healthy to be indignant about this situation. Make no mistake, corporations are extremely dangerous and will continue to strip future generations of their human autonomy unless we do take action.

I've often heard the repeated sentiment of someone's job being ""soul-destroying."" Maybe people should grow a spine and take the hint that we're living under a fascist model of authority and control. How long will we keep bending the knee to these fascist institutions? Do we have any dignity left as a species?

I get physically ill thinking about how nearly everyone on earth blindly submits obedience to these fascists institutions, they truly believe they are being virtuous by passively accepting tyranny, as if they are somehow working towards the greater good of humanity. Absolutely disgusting.

According to corporations their is no objective truth, do you know how many atrocities have taken place in the name of ""following orders"" and being ""obedient""? This is where true evil exists, where truth and morality become relative and subjective as arbitrary codes of conduct.

There is also something significant that a lot of people tend to overlook, the fact that our societies are saturated with addiction. There is a broad spectrum of addiction ranging from pornography, pharmaceutical drugs/alcohol and gambling - to shopping, television, internet, and much more.

If we understood that we have become complacent slaves with unhealthy addictions, we would stand a greater chance of a fundamental shift towards legitimate freedom. We need to be honest with ourselves about our addictions, change cannot be brought forth by a degenerate population with unhealthy addictions, and the powerful ownership class are intimately aware of this fact.

I don't necessarily have a miracle solution either - after all, I am just some dude ranting on the internet, but at least I've pinpointed the problem. [The zeitgeist movement](https://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com/)and [the venus project](https://www.thevenusproject.com/center-for-resource-management/) are some of the more promising grassroots movements that I've come across.

Myself...

I have been working from home for the last 8 weeks. Even though I dislike my job I have found that working from home is a BIG improvement.

Why? Lots of reasons:

\- No commute, less prep time. I can go to bed later at night and get up later in the morning.

\- Less pressure, I am not so closely supervised and approach work as I please. Surprisingly I am now MORE productive as a result.

\- More time with family. I spend a good portion of the day with them now, which is great.

Best thing is that people are talking about work from home becoming more acceptable even after the pandemic lockdown has passed. I don't know if I would do it every single day, but working half my time at the office and half my time at home actually does sound appealing.

It looks like the crisis might end up improving my work conditions significantly. I'm quite happy with this!

So for example if we had a wealth cap of 1 billion, although bezos is worth 150 billion now, in this proposed system he may only be worth 800 million. The residual wealth (150 billion - 800 million) would be captured by the government and redistributed to the rest of america.

313,Apparently I wasn’t very convincing at faking contentment in the workplace.,"I posted here a few days ago where I essentially ranted about the job I was fired from. One thing that stood out to me while I was reflecting on my short time at that job was how many of my ex coworkers would comment on how I pretty much looked unhappy there. I thought I at least looked neutral and was genuinely kind to my coworkers because why waste energy being an asshole? Yeah, most times I wanted to jump off a cliff but I definitely wasn’t moping around with a perpetual scowl, although my resting sad face probably doesn’t help. Anyway, I guess it wasn’t enough because people would always say stuff like “schmellix, it’s almost over!” during unwarranted times or they were always asking me if I liked the job. It was exhausting. Like we all know we don’t *like* being here. Why does it matter if I’m not fucking roaring with enthusiasm every second? I may have came across as a low energy person since I’m an introvert with social anxiety but still, I was professional and decent to other people. Maybe I just don’t fit into the standard work culture among the places I’ve worked at. I just want to get there, do my job and go home. I don’t want to chat about your dogs, kids, etc. on my breaks and especially not during passing when we’re supposed to be working. 

This is just another thing really bugging me because I’ll have to find another job soon and fitting into the whole unspoken work culture is something I disdain. Being kind and professional isn’t already enough? I thought I was “fitting in” but I guess I just don’t understand it.

320,How do you find inner peace?,"Throwaway for very obvious reasons as my main account is recognized by Reddit users and by people surrounding me.

Tldr: I hate people, hate politicians, hate where we are heading. How do I find inner peace, a better sleep and the strength to not care?

To give you some perspective I have to give you a bit of a background. And please keep an open mind: I’m a researcher, a journalist, a volunteer, an economist, an ecologist, a gamer, a privacy advocate, a lawyer, a PhD graduate, a leftist and I have a couple masters behind my belt. I speak English but it is not my mother tongue and for the last 30 years I lived in different countries. My parents built everything by themselves and it gave me some sort of better starting position but also a better understanding of the world and a sense of empathy toward the less fortunate.
I know that I will sound like an old grumpy guy repeating the same things that were told over the centuries. “What a terrible era in which idiots govern the blind.” But please, bear with me. I have no one I can share it with and it is killing me from the inside. 

Over the last 5 years I wrote articles and created Reddit pastas to show how bad it is and that we must act (they appeared multiple times on /r/bestof). Act on different level for different reasons. Either politically against the rising nationalism, either ecologically against the global warming, either socially against the corporate or even against the propaganda. There are so many things wrong that it baffles me how people can go around their life and be so spiteful to each other. An example from an hour ago where a lady in the self-checking register screamed at the security for taking a receipt. It wasn’t even her receipt but someone that was buying stuff before her. Why did she scream?

 I’m +-40 years old and every single day I feel like I’m having a cardiac arrest due to the stress. I live in a country where the government bought its victory using broad social policies. These social policies where possible thanks to very good prosperous years of the previous government and taking debts that future generations will pay dearly. From the get go the government started destroying the rule of law, paying trolls to pitch one part of the country against the other, and making shady deals that would benefit the politicians. I created a website aggregating all the scandals, briberies, nepotism and deals of the government using copy-pasted articles. Not one word was mine, everything was quoted from articles wrote by other journalists, I just took it and put everything in a Wikipedia-like website. It had more than 300 entries and was visited by hundred of thousand of people over the course of a couple months. The end result? Got sued by multiple politicians, got arrested, every electronic device was taken. And worst part is that the majority of the population is still voting for them because they get monthly money from social policies. But most of them don’t know that this money come from taxes, create inflation, create inequalities. I’m all for good social reforms but you can’t tie the them to buying votes especially when you don’t have money. 

But that’s only the pinnacle of the things I have to endure. Let’s talk about the ecosystem. We are heading for a global catastrophe and no one seems to care. The pollution is through the roof, corporations are greedy engines of pollution and the politicians are just vehicles that allow them to destroy the Earth. Over the last 10 years I tried to do something about it, articles, protests, letters – it didn’t change a dime. [People are aware of, and concerned by, climate change, but choose to ignore it. It is an unspoken collective turning away. Anthropologist Kari Norgaard labelled this phenomenon ""socially organised denial""](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/21/i-dont-want-to-be-seen-as-a-zealot-what-mps-really-think-about-the-climate-crisis) People just don’t care, they want they V12 trucks, huge houses, consume everything, work until death and they want everyone else to also work their asses off. Don’t people understand that there’s no stopping of climate change and it will bring massive changes to our societies? Migrants, wars, droughts, famines etc? 

The current pandemic is not better, viruses come in waves, like the Spanish flu that came in 3 waves and killed millions I have a feeling that everybody around me forgot already about this virus. Half of the people don’t wear facemasks and the other half is wearing them as “chinmasks” in case police spots them and they need to put in normally on the face. Pub are reopening, people are returning to restaurants, they are waiting in queues at the groceries. I feel like I’m living on another planet. And it is mostly thanks to the conspiracy theorists fighting with the quarantine saying the virus is a hoax and the above govt. that downplayed the virus during an election year. They cooked the numbers to show that they have everything in control and it is simply not true. 

And that’s another problem, the greedy corporations and the way they use people as cogs. Just look at amazon, look at any bigger company, people for the sake of consuming and buying useless shit go above and beyond to earn more. Nobody is satisfied with what they have. I lived in Africa, in the Middle east and saw true hunger and true poverty. People are happy with a small tv or just having a week worth of food. And them you are coming back to your country and you see fat Karrens screaming for more cheese of their fries at Mcdonalds. And 40M unemployed that get no help whatsoever. Capitalism is killing everything on its path for the befit of the selected few. Politicians are bought, people are brainnwashed and we aer all paying the price. Fighting it will only bring you legal problems and jail. The divide between rich and poor is growing every single day and nobody cares!

And people are at each other throat constantly. At work, coworkers will backstab you for a raise because they have bills to pay and mouths to feed. They are played by the propaganda screaming that we must hate ""migrants"", ""that the other person is bad"", ""That the poor are the parasites"". The whole society tries to make us angry at each other to divide and conquer. That's why you have BLM, ecodenial vs ecofreaks, religious zealots against LGBTQ+, race war and wars between countries. All this is has only one single purpose, to make money. Money for the politicians, or money for the 1%. I mean history is repeating itself... Why can't we understand the pain of our peers? Why can't we understand a migrant fleeing war? Why can't we understand that the hispanic is not taking your job but the corporation wants to pay the bare minimum? Why can't we see that the whole propaganda is there to divide us?

And what about privacy? In the face of the a “looming threat” we are giving away our freedom. People are posting their whole lifes on Facebook, kids are creating tiktok that are scanning their faces and creating metadatabases in China, we have devices that are listening to us 24/7. And nobody CARES about it. They pass law after law that strips our freedoms and the best part is that some of us are all for it! Don't they know that destruction of privacy is just a step before abusing your rights?

As you may have guesses, I don’t have friends. It is due to lack of time, due to them backstabbing me (for promotion or other), due to them being just brainwashed or we just parted ways. I have nobody to talk to about it and it is killing me from the inside out. I volunteer, I donate money, I save money religiously for downturns, I try to be calm and respectful but lately I just want to explode. From antivaxxers to flat earthers, to trolls, to denialists, to propaganda people. I can’t win.

I could go one and on and on about it but I don’t have the willpower nor the inner strength. I’m just tired and I don’t want to die due to stress.

325,Walmart Cashier,"I own a couple of carnival games, I pay rent to the carnival each week and hope I make a profit.  It has some very good aspects to it.  I drive my stuff to the next town once a week, usually stopping at a Walmart for food and necessities.  After that I have no need to go anywhere the rest of the week.  I live in my work truck and can usually park it right behind my game trailer so my daily commute to work is only a couple feet.  It's my own game so I can slack off whenever I want, bring a chair if it's a slow day, play on my laptop or phone. I work from late April until mid October and save just enough money to get through the winter without working.  I don't have anything saved but I don't have kids and I manage to just get by doing the minimum of work.

Covid changed that.  It's doubtful there will be any carnivals this year, maybe a couple in the fall, who knows, but I'm in the Northeast, they're being pretty cautious.  So I got a job at Walmart.  Started at Self Check Out, absolutely hated it.  I got to fill in as cashier.  This is my fucking dream job, I shit you not.  I stand on a very comfortable anti-fatigue mat, my feet feel just fine even though I'm 60.  I get to smile and chit-chat with the customers, after a lifetime being a carny this just comes natural.  I get to play Tetris figuring out how best to pack each bag.  Sometimes I return stuff to the shelves that people decide not to buy, it's like playing Supermarket Sweep in reverse and I get to talk to customers while I'm doing that.  People are very appreciative that I'm working, I'm ecstatic I got hired with no real experience and no interview and I'm making $12.75\hr for something that seems so fun to me.  I don't feel any stress or pressure compared to trying to get people to play my game and being called a cheat and rip-off if people don't win, worrying my truck or trailer might break down on a jump or if I'll get rained out that week.  I have no desire to advance, I just want to do my easy, fun job and take home my $400 every week.  

I know a lot of people consider working at Walmart soul-sucking but it's such a perfect fit for me at this stage of my life, I don't even feel like I'm working.  I just want to encourage you all to try different things, there's all sorts of options out there and I hope you can find one that will make you happy.",False,go8cte,Shagcat,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/go8cte/walmart_cashier/,7,1

331,"All staff ordered back to office -- No PPE, no Plan","I work in a public library. Staff have tiny offices with no windows where they're packed in 2 or 6 side-by-side with teeny tiny narrow hallways in a basement with little ventilation. We have like 30 staff.

I'm told we all must be back in the building on June 1, with all hours worked to be in the building. We've been working from home successfully, especially those of us in marketing, etc., whose jobs are 100% on a computer. We have a great roster of virtual programming and a big digital collection.

I assumed we'd have staggered shifts with mostly WFH to prevent staff from being exposed to each other. I let my boss know that I am not comfortable going back, since it is against the Governor's orders. Governor says office environments should provide WFH and have less capacity. Anyone over 60 should also stay home or WFH. A lot of our staff are over 60. One of them has cancer.

One of my bosses emailed this back, not commenting at all on how our current plan to return all staff on June 1 with no WFH goes against the governor's recommendations --

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Since this virus is probably going to be with us for some time (possibly years) and we as an institution would like to continue to function and support the community, I believe we should focus on setting up workspaces and guidelines so that staff can be in the building soon as safely as possible. Some of us may be able to work from home in the short-term but if the situation remains unchanged for months I am not sure how that would work.  We will also need to justify our value to the taxpayers, many of whom do not or will not have the luxury of working from home.  This may include some members of the council. While that doesn't mean that we reopen with reckless disregard to staff and public safety,  I do think that we need to work steadily towards the goal of offering physical services.

I don't know what he's talking about regarding setting up workspaces.

performer (who are also the serves), kitchen staff,
front of house staff, even myself, the operations
manager, and general manger.

The owners told me that the business was on the verge
of collapse, even with the available government
funding, and they needed an injection of cash to get
through the next few months.

suggested we all volunteer our time and talent and put
on a virtual talent show to raise money with a
GoFundMe for the owners.

| received some really strong feedback from some of
the performer that they did not want to participate.
Also, the company received negative feedback
regarding where the donations would go, seeing as this
company is not a registered charity. Some members of
the public were strongly against the money going to the
owners, and instead be split among the out of work
staff.

361,Mobile Disinterest,"28M, Asian. I work in KL as a digital head of an operations department. My job is to constantly look for ways on how to streamline jobs and make them easier for people who work the frontline.

Recently, I had launched a project together with a brilliant team of only 4 people, myself included. I am forever indebted to them for all the hardwork and tolerance we’ve put into this project which we will be rolling out across countries were there are org sites. Total of 5 countries.

My mental health has suffered tremendously. I work 10am to 2am everyday, and during weekends I still get calls from colleagues asking me about stuff at work. One of the painpoints of being in this position is that I don’t know how I got to this position. I’m a quiet guy with a few aspirations that had gone bust. I used to write a lot and wanted to teach comparative literature but when I was 23, I drained all of my savings because of a huge car accident. Now’s the only time I’ve started saving again.

I am scared for my life everyday, and I feel like I’m clueless everyday. I want to quit, but life from where I am won’t treat the unemployed very well. We have a fascist murderer for a president and most areas where jobs are, are gentrified to the teeth with soaring real estate prices and commodities to boot. I just.. I just quit. I am mortified more than ever that I report directly to so many C-level bosses all at once and it’s really depressing how the gap between what I know and what I should be doing is really abysmal. I don’t know where else to go and what to do other than suck it all up because I am trapped within the bounds of neoliberal economy and a system that does away with the minority. For Christ’s sake, I am just tired. Im tired of worrying all day, scared of being given tasks that are outside my range all because I was not trained in any way. I had to run, walk, and crawl at the same time just to survive.

I have gone from being broke, to working a sales stint which sucked the life out of me, and now I’m in this position that’s coveted by most people but to me, nothing ever really makes sense– we’re all just drones and cogs working the vessel that’s going to run us all over. The pandemic and the lockout aren’t helping either. I am pushed to my limits and just resolve to drinking until I am shtfaced and fall asleep. I need help. I need clarity. I need someone to tell me that everything’s going to be alright and at the same time, shake me to my senses and endorse a solution that’s sustainable.

Otherwise, I’ll just put a bullet to my head. Been thinking about it for so many months now.",False,gq6lsb,suitable_host,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gq6lsb/mobile_disinterest/,2,1

This haughty bourgeois behavior from people earning barely anything with no benefits is despicable. Especially when they pay college students and BA grads at $11-$12/hour... and the interns? Nothing.

365,Quitting my 9-5 and start Youtube while i work on starting my own business,"I am mechanical engineer. Came to Canada here as an international student did my masters and now working as a designer. I have always hated this scheduled robotic work culture. I thought it would be different from back home because this is a first world country and has good balance of work/life. It’s actually true to a certain extent. Back home I use to take home 90% of my earnings after pension deductions. But here we all know the taxes. So after all the expenses ( insurance + mobile( very high) + rent etc) I barely save anything. 

So basically you work you butt off sitting in-front of the pc straining your eyes and ruining your health (sitting is worse than smoking) just to satisfy your boss for an year and get a pay raise of $0.60. This is ridiculous. This made me think. 

So I came all the way across the world to start doing same routine in another country? I have been here for 3 years and not visited any other province. I want to enjoy life. Thats all. Live comfortably not stupid rich. I thought of starting my own business. I have 2 ideas. Gemstones and spices. I have already sold 3 stones while working. I had many plans for this year but covid fucked me over anyways. I also know there is a big market for Ceylon cinnamon so im going to start my spice business with that and scale up. 

So to focus more on that i need to quit my 9-5. I thought of doing SkipTheDishes and YouTube to generate my living expense. I already have some money saved for the business. 

My biggest question is will I be able to survive with SkipTheDishes and Youtube? Anyone has experience with starting Youtube? Please advise and comment.

400,Am I a joke?,"So I'm pretty sure I would be classified a loser by almost everyone in today's society...

Should I get my shit together or just go with the flow?


My situation:

28 year old male (swear to God idk how I'm that old I SWEAR it feels like I was 18 a week ago) las Vegas, Nevada

So I went out of state to get off prescription pills like 4 years ago. It worked I got off them. When there's no dealer, you can't do it. Well I returned to Nevada about 1.5 years ago. I was allowed to stay with my grandparents under one condition, I get a job. My grandma is old fashioned she scares me. Well I looked for awhile and no job ever came to be. Somehow , I am able to stay here without a job for the moment. I think it's because my grandpa has Alzheimer's and was really sick about 9 months ago, and I had to pick him up and move him throughout the day and all that fun stuff. You know how that is. Anyways...


So here I am 28 , don't want to go work anywhere because I don't want to be fkn miserable. My mom stays here too and she gets so upset when I tell her about how i think. And it's extremely selfish of me not to work honestly. But dude, fuk that. Just because they're ok with being a slave throughout their life doesn't mean I have to be cool with it. I swear I don't want to work not only for me, but because I don't want to be a part of this system. If I work I feel like I'm just helping prop up the BS society we live in. I was fired from so many jobs because of bs gossip and bs drug tests. The workplace is a sick place. I managed to make one sportsbook location into one of the top money making sports book in the valley. Yes I did. They didn't appreciate it! Fired me for""being late"" and that's some BS I know the girl I worked with made something up because that's just what she does. That's dumb for taking her serious .

Another place I worked decided they were gonna drug test the whole staff one night. When it was my turn and they asked me, I said EXCUSE ME? are you asking for my piss for real? For no reason? I would have passed but nah I'm not a toy they can just make piss for fun. So I refused and they made me leave and that's the end of that.


Wow this too long I got off track nobody gonna read it.


Pretty much what I want to know is, should I just become a miserable obedient worker again? Money is important and I can't rely on living here forever. But idk ....I think I'd rather die though then do a 9-5 again. I desperately need to find a way or find something I can do that is like my own business. But pfft that's almost impossible. I pretty much need to hit the mega Jackpot.

410,Capitalism just seems like modern Feudalism,"Instead of aristocratic lords owning all of the land, we have the rich owning most of the capital and means of production. Instead of working said land and paying tribute to the lords while being allowed to keep a portion for our own sustenance, we are ""rewarded"" with an absolute bare minimum wage/salary that in a lot of cases is hardly enough to survive while the majority goes to the rich in profits. 

As time goes on this wealth inequality continues to grow and the middle class continues to shrink, where it seems that in the near future we're only going to have the super rich and the super poor.

Admittedly its allowed the rapid development of technology, but it's all centered around growing profit. If you dont contribute to the scheme of ever expanding profit margins then you're essentially unproductive and worthless to the system, and if the growth stops then the system falls apart as we are seeing now. Although that isn't the worst thing for the rich because it allows them to buy up even more assets for less money and further solidify their control.

It's even gone so far as to make essential institutions like healthcare and education for-profit, nothing is safe from being turned into a profit generating enterprise. 

And even with the rapid development of technology as I mentioned above, we're still working the same amount because the rich see it as ""if workers can produce twice as much in the same amount of time as 50 years ago, then that means double the profits!"" instead of working less, because again, it's all about infinitely growing profit.

The ruling class have done a spectacular job of trapping us into a system of modern slavery and selling it to people as being more free and independent.

Working from home had become not just a strategy, but the only viable method for many to continue earning their pay, whereas now it’s been tossed aside to allow employees to come back to their offices.

I know this isn’t exactly a good observation, it’s pretty obvious really, but what bothers me more than anything is that soon myself and many others, not just in my country but all over the world will be sent back to our little germ harbouring havens, to tap the keyboard for hours a day whilst there is an invisible fire raging all around. 

There will be safety gear on hand for us workers of course, we can have our face masks and our gloves to keep ourselves feeling a little less anxious about being there, but that isn’t the point. While the bosses sit in their own homes or offices miles away from human contact in relative safety, we have to congregate in droves and risk spreading this virus once again, with the only safeguard being that we will have paper thin masks and gloves. Surely, if we have to wear such things to work somewhere as basic as an office, then we shouldn’t be going back there just so soon?

432,Beginning steps in obtaining freedom. Please read and give feedback/contribute.,"Hello all. I see a lot of people here that just can't take the bullshit of delusional capitalistic society and I'm right there with you. If we spend time thinking through a complete solution, the abolition of capitalism at once will yield some pretty disastrous results; riots, unruliness, etc. I've seen reports of people admitting that they're waiting for just a little bit of instability so they can go around with their gang of douche bags to kill and rob people. There are other ways to bring about the change we seek.

The power of rich people is contingent upon the sustained value of their money. So long as people utilize money as their means of being, rich people will always be powerful and regular people will always have a hard time combating wealth fueled corruption. 

I think a lot of us share a frustration with billionaires. These people, are the most capable people of bringing about the change this world desperately needs, but don't. They hoard their money, inflate their own power and exploit as many people as they can. I'm tired of these sociopaths being the ones who are most enabled to creating change.

Here's what I'm thinking. The power of billionaires is completely dependent on the recognition of the value of money. Without their money, they have no power. Furthermore, so long as our means of survival are dependent on money, we are slaves! We can't volunteer in capitalism based on our interests, we must do it to survive. We need to separate our means of survival from our participation in capitalism.

Our first step in shifting power from billionaires to ""the people"" starts with gaining living independence from money. Things people need in the 21st century: Shelter, food, water, electricity. All of these basics can be supplied and maintained outside of capitalistic systems. An absolute prerequisite for freedom is to stop playing the rent game. Get land. Property tax is bullshit, but one thing at a time...

Shelter: Earthbag homes are so efficient and cheap it's ridiculous. There are also plenty of other alternatives home construction designs that doesn't require you to fork over your paycheck for 20 years. 

Food: Perennial food forest. People can be so clever. We have now found ways to incorporate companion planting in very efficient, space saving ways. In an acre of land or less, we can grow a crazy amount of food if we tune our allocation well. Lawns are a scam!

Water: Water is underground, water is in the air, water falls from the sky and at flows atop the ground. Unless you're in a very arid area, water is in many places. Stop buying water, it's a very corrupt industry. We can gather water from precipitation, above and below ground water sources, humid air. In 2020 information and technology can empower us to strive for freedom.

Electricity: So many ways to go about independent electric. Hydroelectric if you have a flowing water source. Solar panels. Wind power. Piezoelectric tiles. And so on.

With these expenses removed or minimized, money acquired can be saved or spent on extracurricular things. We will have the freedom to quit a job when we want which will apply pressure to employers to treat us with some damn respect because they know we don't have to work there. We can use our money like votes. Buying products from companies that we want to support. We can have the freedom to avoid companies that abuse their production means the most and can sell stuff for the cheapest because that's all we can afford and we're just trying to make it. With the ability to choose, corruption and exploitation can dry up in a fair capitalistic environment, if people stay aware.

Our main problem is that our means of survival are tied to capitalism. If our means of living were separate from capitalism, then I think capitalism wouldn't be as bad as it is now. At least, it'd be a step in the right direction. Some of you might be bothered by the fact that I say a prerequisite is owning land. Realistically, I don't think there's any other way. How can we be free if other people are in charge of what we need to survive? So long as your means of survival are controlled by someone else, you must do what they want you to do, when they want you to do it and that is not free.

For a lot of us, we live in apartments, myself included. Barely able to save money. This is okay and we are not out of options. Don't get apathetic. See the way forward with me and find a way to make it happen in your situation. This subreddit is full of so many supportive people and I would be willing to bet that an open discussion, regarding how an individual in their unique situation can stride towards freedom, would be welcomed. Land can be quite expensive, but it can also be really cheap. We don't need a massive plot of land to implement independent means of living. If your main sources of income don't provide enough money for you to save a few thousand to get some land then find something that you can do a couple times a week, online or not, and save it. Yeah it sucks we gotta work harder, but this is the situation we are in, like it or not. It is an unfortunate reality, but this is it. There isn't a convenient easy way out, but there is a way out if you're truly motivated. Don't let apathy take over your mind. You owe it to yourself to get there. It helps me to think in terms of time, not difficulty. If I do this for this long, I'll get this far. Not, if I do this that is this difficult and will make me this tired anddd.... there goes the motivation.

I've had many long conversations with a good friend of mine about the mutual problems we all have here on [r/antiwork](/r/antiwork). Him and I both agree that widespread coordinated action is difficult to achieve, given the tight grip of control we are under. But, a lot of people, independently taking the right steps forward, is major progress in the right direction. We don't necessarily need people banding together in the streets to protest. We need people to start separating their means of living from their involvement in capitalism. This is truly how we can begin to take back our power as people. We can't demand change, we must be the change.

435,Why you should absolutely detest landlordism,"[Don't dare try to write this critique of landlordism off as some kind of far-left analysis, here's a quote from the notoriously anti-socialist Winston Churchill:](https://anotherangryvoice.blogspot.com/)

""Roads are made, streets are made, services are improved, electric light turns night into day, water is brought from reservoirs a hundred miles off in the mountains — all the while the landlord sits still. Every one of those improvements is affected by the labour and cost of other people and the taxpayers. To not one of these improvements does the land monopolist contribute, and yet, by every one of them the value of his land is enhanced. He renders no service to the community, he contributes nothing to the general welfare, he contributes nothing to the process from which his own enrichment is derived…The unearned increment on the land is reaped by the land monopolist in exact proportion, not to the service, but to the disservice done.""

Landlordism is so ridiculously parasitical from an economic standpoint that it even makes capitalism look good in comparison, and it doesn't matter how many soothing fairy stories landlords might tell themselves about them being the good and responsible ones, not the nasty exploitative slumlord ones, the fact is that what they're doing is still economic parasitism.

But the worst thing of all is the absolute entitlement of these exploiters when it comes to economic hard times.

They simply won't accept the inherent risks in borrowing cash to make unsecured property investments, and then expecting to indefinitely live off other people's backs to pay off what they borrowed.

The whole economy is taking an enormous economic hit, the second mega-crisis in the space of twelve years, and these idle exploiters expect to be bailed out at the expense of the genuinely productive economy, so that they're the only ones not to take a hit.

The worst thing of course is that our political and media class are absolutely riddled with landlordism. The liberal media outlets are just as full of landlords as the hard-right propaganda rags, and even the Labour Party front bench is stuffed with landlords.

It's difficult to see how we ever begin to move away from this economy-sapping model of parasitical landlordism when the establishment class is absolutely riddled with the idle beneficiaries of it.

439,Working for one of the most sinister industries during lockdown is affecting my mental health,"So I've been working from home for two months and I really need to vent, but I'm also going to keep it vague for privacy reasons.

I graduated and found a job in my city at an organization in the insurance space. It was a really random opportunity-- one of many job applications I filled out within five min and forgot about, because I didn't particularly like the idea of working anyway. Fast forward a couple of weeks, and I decide to take their job offer, not knowing exactly how fucked up the organization/industry/job was (RIP old me for thinking unlimited PTO, nice retirement match, and free health insurance was good for anything).

I've been at my job for \~2 years and holy shit. It's literally run by a gang of incompetent millionaires who fuck around all day and do absolutely nothing in terms of productivity. It's driven on nepotism and idiocy, with myself being one of only a handful of employees hired on ""merit"". The organization runs a massive PAC dedicated to upholding things like employer-sponsored healthcare (the reason why we don't have M4A in America) and other shady insurance practices, which hurt the average American 100% of the time. To top it off, they don't have an HR dept, and I was met with absolutely zero accountability when I attempted to report a coworker for harassment.

I've hated it since the beginning, but since we've been working remote, it's gotten so much worse. I realize that over 90% of my day is filled with me doing absolutely nothing while upholding the status quo for my bosses. All day I sit at home and wait for my bosses to ask me to do some menial task that could've taken then five min to do if they cared. Meanwhile, my ""work"" continues to drive the organization forward, effectively preventing folks from accessing healthcare through a single payer system. Instead, the org fights to keep insurance relevant, while lining the pockets of all the execs who are constantly on vacation.

I'm so tired of this. I don't know if I should keep ""working"" and drain the company of their money while doing nothing, or seek something more ""fulfilling"" (we all know that work is not fulfilling, it's mindless and unnecessary). I feel trapped here because I have a lot of student debt that I'm working to pay down. I don't want to be responsible for the massive amount of suffering that the insurance industry causes, but I also don't want to quit this job in the middle of a pandemic with nothing else lined up.

I sincerely wish we lived in a world without work as we know it, bad coworkers, and industries hellbent on exploiting human needs. I'm so tired and I wish I could just tell my entire organization to fuck off forever.",False,gj2zry,radgreek,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gj2zry/working_for_one_of_the_most_sinister_industries/,5,1

441,"The law of value, our value in society and capitalist ideology","I usually encounter many people who say the usual ""if you don't work you don't deserve to eat"" in different shapes and forms.

""Society owes you nothing"", ""get up by your bootstraps"" (nice analogy because it's physically impossible), ""why do I have to work to give you a house?"", ""you have no right to anything"", and so on...

First of all, it's incredibly ironic that people use this argument to attack socialism, where the goal is to make a more efficient use of labour and eliminate the biggest parasitic setback (the bourgeoise). When you ask these people, most of them think capitalism rewards their output, capitalists are selfless servicers of the community, and that humans need always live in a state of deprivation to motivate them to work.

Secondly, this basically stems from the functioning of capitalism itself. The output, to this people, means nothing but your labour-force embodied in some commodity or service which can be monetized. It's the theory of the law of value, where your access to others' work is mediated by the market instance using the socially necessary labour-time as a measure of value. Of course, this measure is deeply flawed, as goods and services only have value as carriers of exchange-value and surplus-value. Therefore, you end up producing toys, war machines, drugs, etc. insofar it yields a profit. Illegal or not, these activities are tied to the profit they generate. No one would be making or selling drugs for the sake of it, at least not at the scale we see today, with the amount of violence and turf control, thinking they do a service to anybody. The mechanism of value is what allows a huge deal of corruption and human narcissism to take a new form, too. It is what keeps pollution rising. In our society, profit matters more than our lives. This is precisely the problem.

The measure of this output is flawed, because it is neutral towards the morality of the activities carried on to achieve a surplus, because it leaves out a huge deal of reproductive work, care of children, the disabled, the elderly at home, personal reproduction, and also in the realm of value, most of that output is not rewarded or recognized either (where do you think capitalists make money from?)

Thirdly, this ideology is blind to the structural limitations in the access to the mere production of surplus-value. You're not even granted exploitation to survive. Many people are basically thrown out of the mechanism of capitalist reproduction. You have to compete in demanding fields, train for years, have social capital, and even then getting a job might prove difficult and very anxiety-inducing. Again, this process is flawed, too, and the more capable individuals often don't get positions because another person with more social capital got the job. This is evident in politics, but at the workplace too. People rely on nepotism to get by. If this doesn't speak to you as yet another example of why this system of labour doesn't work, then you have to be benefitting from it.

Fourthly, why wouldn't my value as a human being be more important to society? Isn't society a mechanism, in principle, to better human lives and not leave the astray on the wilderness? To give them purposeful social lives, to care for them when ill. These people's idea of society is just a market, that's how flawed and capitalist-realist their thinking is. A big shopping center when you receive when you give something in return. Living in America might not be so different, that's why people there are so fucked up mentally, with issues like school shootings, deep alienation, racism and homelessness being commonplace. I'd argue the ideological component of these comments stems from a vision of society akin to that of the USA, if not more rooted on capitalist ideals, eugenics, a hate of the poor.

Why wouldn't we want to help people live good lives if that's what they want? Why would we prefer to pay no attention to their needs, and even sabotage any help they might receive? Do these people have a limit to their empathy? Maybe, some totally do. Narcissism is so prevalent today it's painful to watch and experience. I think this ideology is another form of the just world hypothesis. Value works in the same realm of abstraction. Capitalism, to these people, means something totally different, they're unable, unwilling to understand it can be as flawed as it is. There's nothing just about our world, our work and our society. How is people dying because they can't produce surplus-value just to anyone? What's the morality behind this? Is death, lack of a roof, food to eat, healthcare, etc. the penalty for not producing useless stuff, producing more value to feed the autopoietic all-devouring machine of capital?

This is how we get fascism. This is how it begins. People become means, disposable and of no value. And then they claim the moral high ground no less! Evil is all around us, it's our status quo, and most people are really no better. Right now, our society is narcissistic, wanting company to their misery instead of freedom. They will even push away rights, benefits for the sake of proving themselves to be ""valuable"". They can't envision the economy right now being so inneficient it's producing so much surplus to pollute the entire planet but unable to put a roof over everyone's heads. Purposeful shortages. Not only do they lack a care for social life, a disdain for the other's life, but also are weak and subservient to forces which don't care about them, their work, their dreams and loved ones. They rejoice in their just world delusion, when the bourgeoise reaps half of their working day to themselves. They are being drilled a new hole by capitalism and their only coping mechanism is that someone else also needs a new hole. It's like the joke where a man encounters a genie, who says that for everything he wishes for, his neighbor will get double, so he wishes the genie to make him one-eyed.

Fifthly, it's feasible. The amount of useless work being performed is staggering, unemployment traps millions in poverty and a life of shame and fighting the system to defend the value of their lives over the idea that they're a ""cost"". We can get by with a 4 hours workday, the rest is just profits for the bourgeoise, which we don't need at all. We know now that most office work consists of procrastination, tedium, ""faking work"". Millions trapped in useless routines just to prove others they have ""value"". If you don't work, you must feel ashamed, if you aren't studying and training for work, you have to feel ashamed and get ""motivated"" fast, ""man up"", ""become an adult"" and basically become the perfect slave which is not only ignorant of its demise, but also happy about it. We can provide for everyone, we can reduce our work a lot, we can forgive debt and restart social life with a new, real, social contract. Whoever tells you it can't be done is blind to the fact vacant homes outumber homeless people, more can be constructed fairly easily; bullshit jobs exist, 40% of the food is thrown out, automation could reduce work significantly, etc., etc. It's more of a matter of a bad-faith argumentation than anything else. Even Nixon, Keynes said we would be working less than 20 hours by now. What happened to the capitalist dream of leisure? What happened to the focus on quality of life? What happened to real progress? What happened to humanity?

The worst part is, precisely, that this is our normal. Being on subreddits such as this gives too empathetic and conscious idea of human society under late-capitalism. In the end, we are alone, we have to live thinking about how we can enter, re-enter the profit system somehow, by being a wage slave, having a position of authority, nepotism, or taking hold of surplus. To earn ""passive income"" or rely on the State to lead a life without actual work, getting an ""easy job"", ""big income"". It all revolves about our relation to society. There's no alternative to value as of yet. This is what we are stuck with as long as people delude themselves that this is just and are unwilling to care for the other or be conscious of their own exploitation. So, in fact, the ideology I'm here portraying as ridiculous has in fact been the most effective in many parts of the world. Despite the bloodshed, the coups, the sanctions, the most effective weapon is and always be compliance, ideology, protecting the system in the minds of people, so no idea to overthrow it can ever arise. Why has it won? Why has capitalism, privation, exclusion won ideologically? This, I must admit, is the biggest unknown I have with regards to societal matters.

If I may adventure an explanation, it boils down to capitalism adapting to our innermost drives. It provides the constant promise of desire satisfaction, an endless route to get surplus-enjoyment from. It fosters narcissism, tribalism, petty competition. It also gives the illusion of justice, as Marx said. When workers enter a contract, they don't usually know they're being ripped off. The law of value hides the mechanism of exploitation and excludes other forms of work (this tied to patriarchy). It invites technological progress, which also helps with the illusion that society is going forward, while it also digs it's own tomb. And, here goes the unexpected one: it provides meaning. Capitalism is above all a system of distribution of value based on the mechanism of Value. This value that it's distributed in the form of money is, at the same time, a form of social recognition. Give yourself a pat in the back, ""you are someone"". Because you are someone, your work also matters, your ""output"" is appreciated. It gives people an easy way to measure their worth, to see themselves as valuable. It helps people, all in all, truth be told, to at least equate meaning with their role in society, even if this role is meaningless to societal reproduction. This is not everyone, but how many times have you heard ""so what do you do?"" at conversations? It's our primary quality.

People are in desperate need to hold to things and anchor themselves. The truth of meaningless suffering is unmanageable, and we grab onto whatever we find to overcome this suffering. So while it's obviously true we're narcissistic and capitalism goes well with the structure of desire, it also provides a basic framework, a map, for people to follow and pride themselves upon. This is undermined in leftist debate and more so on here. ""Oh, how can you derive meaning from work? It's like dying each day!"", and we make fun of people who say they get bored outside work. In the outside world, and even in other communities, people really act like this, however. ""I got a job, I'm no longer depressed"" can mean much more than the fact that interviews can be frustrating, maybe that person felt useless and the only way to regain his or her pride was to re-enter the workplace. How many times have you heard an unemployed person be shamed? Yes, it's flawed and precisely the opposite of what we need, but it works, it happens more times than not, to force others into entering wage-slavery. People don't have the same level of criticism we do, no matter how we wished it was so. People function and follow the status quo much more like automata. Disregarding social forces comes at a big cost, it makes of you an antagonist, a flaw, it makes you doubt your own value. It shatters personal connections by unmasking your value as temporary. It's easy to just give in without a fight. Maybe, just maybe, humanity will never truly have the mental fortitude to lead their lives and their social world rationally and with conscious direction. This is what I fear the most if we are to keep roaming this planet. Still, I just can't be at peace. I can't justify or embrace the suffering. It ought not to be this way. And not doing so is seen as the flaw. Not adapting becomes ""a chemical imbalance"", being angry or negative a clear way to ostracize yourself. Seeking enlightenment a naive trickery to keep us in check. We have no spiritual community as did the Buddha, we live in a world which can only destroy contemplation, shame it. It's unproductive to criticize. This ""mindfullness"" is the perfect companion to late-capitalism of anxiety, constant work, no free time. Reaching a stable state of mind amidst oversaturation means the bourgeoise can now milk you for longer, and better. And you will even feel good about it, thinking you're now at peace while being more productive and accelerating forces which are ravaging our planet as we speak, and making others redundant. Oh, the irony of wellbeing when it disregards the impact our actions have on others and other living beings.

What is to be done? Well, nice question there. Really. Everyone thinks they have the answer, everyone loves to preach about their own organization, unions, charity, stealing and work, and such, but we are naive and when facing the challenges we face today, we require a level of organization and power that trascends everything we've seen in history. We have to stop a wheel that's spinning so fast and it's so massive it sends anyone trying to make it stop miles away. Capitalism has destroyed everything, from mountains, rivers, forests, to collective institutions, entire countries, cultures. Do you think your Walmart union can stand a chance? Don't be naive! We don't need hope, we need results, a conscious analysis on overthrowing capitalism, revolution, not puny reformism or benefits for a small sector of the working class. In the end, automation is coming, and with this remote-work craze going on, how many people will become redundant? How many things will be automated? It's time to think, more than ever. I'm sorry, but unionizing won't come back and work will be treasured and fought for like bread in a famine. The Welfare State is shrinking. As soon as the coronavirus crisis passes, we are headed for a new kind of capitalism, with more unemployment, more disparity, more authority, debt, and new climate crises (the climate is really changing faster than expected) which are going to spark migrations, xenophobia, maybe wars. I'm sorry to break your illusions, but we don't eat imagination and no revolution has been made without an analysis of the material conditions and the development of capitalism. Imagine if Lenin (like him or not he lead a revolution we can not even dream about thanks to ideological constrains) hoped that, after the war, Russia became a world power and no revolution would be needed to promote better conditions, at least in the short term. 

Well, that's how I see many posts in here, people hoping that the overlords will grant them UBI, remote work for life, increased benefits. It's the last breathing reflex before drowning. A level of naivety which makes me douby my previous statement about people here being so different. We are more empathetic, no doubt about it, but we can also be prey to delusions. I for one was. We don't need platitudes, easy money schemes and dreams of a cabin in the woods. Everyone who preaches these alternatives is not a comrade. They're not paying attention, they're not really aware of societal conditioning. They're just anti-capitalist because it goes well with their minimalist lifestyle, not because they feel or understand the pressure. A true comrade doesn't take your issues as meaningless strivings when you could just ""rent a cabin, plant a garden"" and some shit like that middle class first-world people say like it was easy or feasible to everyone (hint: it isn't even physically possible and it would be terribly wasteful to give 8 billion people the same suburbian lifestyle, no matter how your dreams look like). This sub has been filled up to the brink with liberal delusions masquerading as socialist alternatives. When one preaches platitudes with no argumentation behind them, or recommends a minimalist lifestyle, remote work, a trade, coding, etc. as the solution to everything, they're doing a huge service to capitalism. Capitalism needs that hope, it needs that delusion, too. Universities are filled with hopeful people thinking they are changing the world and just end working some other bullshit job just to make profits more often than not. A comrade doesn't say ""oh just meditate and quit that job bro"", a comrade says ""so, how are we going to overthrow capitalism?"" like it were that Pinky and the Brain cartoon where Pinky said ""Gee Brain, what are we gonna do tonight?"" and Brain replied: ""The same thing we do every night, try to take over the world!"" That's comradery, not some useless life plan that's subject to everything but your own volition.

I think I've extended myself enough already and I wrote what I wanted to write in the first place. Thanks for reading my post.

TL;DR: capitalist apologists are deluded, afraid and show tendencies which are akin to fascism; capitalism hides behind a veil of justice (which is nowhere to be seen behind it) that resembles the operation of the law of value hiding exploitation and unequal exchange in the production process, not taking into acount reproductive labour and not having any sort of care about the use value of the commodities produced; and a criticism of the liberal tendencies of this sub which sabotage the devising of revolution.",False,giczlh,Abyssal_Scepter,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/giczlh/the_law_of_value_our_value_in_society_and/,1,1

460,A full working day could be 10-4 with no major repercussions,"I'm talking from my experience working at a ""over the phones"" distributor.

Businesses who ship goods each weekday generally have their goods collected in the early afternoon. Once orders for that day are complete usually by about 3-4PM (I've found), their tends to be a drab winding down, looking at the clock phase where everyone kind of just pretends they're on with something until they can leave.

The same goes for early in the morning where staff(ies) generally make coffeee and open their emails, a process you can stretch until about 10am when other humans are actually awake to call up your slack shack.

So, with little loss in productivity, I present you the benefits of a 10-4, other than the obvious **15 hours** a week shaved off your misery:

* **You have time to do other chores during your weekdays at other businesses that work 9-5** (currently every single small business on the planet occupies this timeslot meaning you have to actually book a day off the firm to do chores. eg. get your car MOTed, oh the joy)
* **No lunch breaks** (you can have a hearty breakfast that will run you through to 4 o clock no problem, no more stale sandwiches, corn beef arteries or salted crisps)
* **You're guaranteed to leave home in daylight** (no more black Winter mornings)
* **You're guaranteed to return home in daylight** (and in the summer you even have time to enjoy the last couple hours of sun or even in the morning. No more black Winter evenings. No more mole men)
* **Avoid rush hour traffic** (assuming some dinosaurs companies remain 9-5 or some natuarally take other slots like 11-5)

Does this work? Well me and all my coworkers have been working 10-4, from home, furloughed and against our will, and we've made less errors and 100% of orders have been completed. I've had time away from dizzying phones to crack on with marketing and that's flourished since lockdown.

So the answer is yes, this works... at least at the misery plant I work at. If only we could knock our boss's ego we'd have a chance at implementing it. The irony is, him and the bags under his eyes would also benefit from a 10-4.",False,gmcywd,ThumpItInTheEd,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gmcywd/a_full_working_day_could_be_104_with_no_major/,8,1

I am not a full on anti-work person cause I believe we are still at a point when many jobs are necessary unfortunately (cook, fedex driver, crop picker, doctor, dentists, etc).

However, the major that I set out to do is one that is setting me up for an Office space/bullshit Job existence. It is an accounting major. I do not want to be chained to a desk for 40 years doing tax work. 

Here are some things to assist you guys in determine if I will ever escape the dreaded office: 

1. Am gay; will marry if I find love of my life- only for tax purposes tho- marriage is stupid; will never have children 
2. Will get a sizable inheritance I’d say between age 30-45 of somewhere between 300K and 500K 
3. Am open to RV life
4. Am open to being a tax accountant remotely in an RV in my 30s once I have gotten experience of public accounting for 5-7 years 
5. Would like to escape through real estate- becoming a landlord, owning rentals, or a real estate agent in my mid 30s
6. Am open to doing bartending/serving and pizza delivery for extra cash (more fun than a BS office job)
7. This ones a pipe dream but I’d love to be youtube famous for gay RV life haha
8. If I worked in tax accounting from age 23-30 my average salary for those 7 years would be probably 75-80K
9. Am a minimalist; will live dirt cheap 
10. Also considering teaching high school history as a second career like age 35+ once I have enough money hoarded away in a next egg; history favorite subject; summers off 


So there you guys go. Is there any hope for me or will I be doing tax accounting in 2064?

506,"I lost my job and even though I'm worried, I'm also relieved","I posted here recently about my temp agency pressuring me to agree to have my hours cut. I agreed out of fear of being fired. Since that day, I wasn't given even a single shift.

So I knew something was off when the employee responsible for me called me on Friday and then again this morning. No one picked up when I called back. When he later called again, I picked up and he asked if I had received their letter and that they had sent me a termination letter. He still had the guts to ask why I hadn't picked up and claimed I never called back (my call log begs to differ).

FYI one of their arguments for cutting my hours was that they did it so they didn't have to fire anyone. 

Funnily enough, a few days after cutting my hours, they posted the exact same listing I had applied to when I started there. I have no idea what I did to them or why they seem so keen on fooling people into employment, only to let them go a few weeks in.

I'm pissed off and worried about the next few weeks, but I'm also kind of relieved I don't have to panic whenever I get a call from them or a text on WhatsApp again.

509,Gaslighting and corporate America.,"I work for a relatively famous, large financial firm as an executive assistant.

I was hired initially under the agreement of working for two people (calendar management, travel booking and expenses, the usual that comes with being someone’s assistant), as well as getting involved in some project work when I could in order to help me grow professionally.

For the first year I was doing great. Felt good about my bosses, was making decent money despite still being below the low market value for my position and location. 

Then, I was randomly forced, without any proper conversation or revisit to my comp, by one of my bosses, the work for a new person.

This new person is needy and treats me like an appliance, not a human. I was underpaid as it is and doing more work than a normal person in my position. I am an excellent employee.

And what happens when you’re good at your work?

You’re punished. You’re thrown more work. I voiced my concerns and my lack of raise and I was called rigid, and told I wasn’t being a team player. They used every argument in the HR book against me. How if I have extra capacity I should be able to take a new person on.

How about if I have extra work I get extra money????

Hey everyone this is my first reddit post so I thought I would make it a rant, so go easy on me lol

Also it’s a long one so buckle up.

Let me start of by saying this

I hate working. 

You got to be in bed early and on time because if you don’t you will be tired all day. Set that alarm, make sure all your work gear is washed and ready to go.

Hearing that alarm clock at 5 in the morning or earlier and the first thought that goes through my semi awake mind is “Oh not this again”  Not another day of the same thing that I have been going through day in and day out since I as old enough to work.

Then you have to force feed yourself as much as you can because you know that you will have to work through that first break just to meet those deadlines that you have. 

Work forces you to associate with people that you would never go near with a hazmat suit. It puts people who are intelligent and puts them with people who still think that they are in high school with all their little clicks. Sure there are some people that you like to see, but as soon as management see that, they split you up just because.

Knowing that you have to face some people and be stuck in a confined space that you cannot escape makes me want to eat a bullet. Have you ever sat there and just tried to will that light to fall on you? Or go into the bathroom wet your hand and play about with a plug? Just to get a day off work or avoid that one asshole you have to work with? To me being electrocuted is better than being at work!

Managers seem like an undiscovered species of prick that science is yet to understand. How in the name of fuck did people so inadequate and incompetent get in a position of power? I imagine that a manager application form goes something like this.

As a manager you must do the following

&amp;#x200B;

1. Know      how to push every employees buttons when not needed
2. Talk      down to everyone who is not management
3. Get      everyone to do your job for you and take credit for it only when it goes      right. 
4. Only      do work when a higher manager is looking
5. Not      know how to do any of the jobs that everyone does. But tell them how to do      it better anyway.
6. Take      30min more for all breaks but make sure that everyone is back on time if      not sooner.
7. Take      as much vacation time as possible
8. Hit      on and make passes at all female workers 
9. Threaten      to fire one employee per week. Doesn’t matter what for
10. Must      love the smell of the bosses shit.

When it snowing heavily or it rains so much it floods, you call in and say I cant make it in, they are all like “why cant you?, right you are on a warning, you are not a team player” Fuck being a team player! No way am I going to work in a snow plough or a dingy. Team player my ass. 

The customer must be treated like a demi-god, a walking avatar of truth that can never be wrong or questioned. They shit silk and piss Hugo boss. They fly off the handle at the tiniest most insignificant thing just because they can, just because they know that you cant do shit about it. I could not care less if your burger has the tiniest bit of mayo on it and that your virgin taste buds have been violated. I don’t care if tiny Tim did not get his crutch on time in London by drone.

I hate this “the customer is always right” bullshit. One time a customer couldn’t find his jacket when the club was emptying and he kicked up such a huge shit storm about it and everyone was saying sorry this and sorry that, calling him sir and all that pandering crap. Turns out when the lights came on it was over his stool. We still had to say sorry and that it was our fault. 

We are paid a crappy wage to suppress our human feelings and to take shit from people that are truthfully assholes in the purest from of the word. Is it any wonder people break down and just can’t face the world; we want to just say fuck this and lunge across the counter and punch their lights out.

Speaking of pay, we have to deal with all of that while getting paid the lowest wage possible, management want a hundred things done all at once and they wanted it done five minutes ago, But for the bare minimum of pay. We get taxed up the ass, we live pay check to pay check and are also expected to be on call 24/7

Well how is this? You pay peanuts you get monkeys. Minimum wage you get minimum effort.

You will spend more that 40 years of your life working for someone or something you hate. By the end of it you have a tiny pension to look forward to then live out the little time that you got left. You will be broken up mentally and physically ill, unable to do whatever you had planned. The only way to live from that moment on is to purge that last 40 years of your life from your brain.

But lets get down to the science and it’s a grim picture at that.

The average American spends 90,000 hours at work over their lifetime.

And nearly 60% say their jobs are making them insomniacs.

The average American spends more than 100 hours commuting every year.

And a quarter of Americans say work is their No. 1 source of stress.

In the US, stress from work is estimated to be the fifth-biggest cause of death.

And the majority of Americans don't even use all of their vacation days; there were 705 million unused days off last year nationwide.

And even when employees do go on vacation, 42% of them say they feel the pressure to check in with their offices while they're gone.

What the hell are we doing too ourselves? Who the hell wants to live like that!

But you always get some Politian saying how lucky you are to have a job. Most people I know have two of the fucking things, two dam jobs, so you are getting double of all the stats above. But I should be grateful right.

Look I am not lazy; I have been working since I was 16. But it just the constant grind and the ground hog day feeling that I feel it has been ever since.

This was in a place were 6, 12s in a row are also commonplace. Most of them thought they were “helping out” by showing up for that kind of overtime.

516,Do people here have a distinction between work and creation?,"I peruse here a lot, and I’m curious. I have tried to collect an understanding based off people’s comments, but it seems everyone has a different take and I’d love to hear where everyone “draws the line” between “work” and “wageslave” or any other term related. 

I really like “working”, especially working a lot, and hard. I like getting home pooped out, dirty, and satisfied, and able to relax after I have spent a day achieving, or contributing to a team, or just on a personal project. I have worked as a waiter, “unskilled labor” and “skilled labor” for a contractor, in an office, and all sorts of other jobs. None of them I have dreaded, most of them I found pride in too. I generally consider peripherals like music making, woodworking, and education “work” if I am participating in them with a task oriented mindset. Sure I can noodle on an instrument, but practice time is different, and that’s work to me. 

For me, work is something that has an intent of creating. Wether it be profits, an organized excel sheet, a good grade, or better technique on an instrument. All of those are things that pride can be found in to me. I am very open to other definitions.

So where do you folks stand on this? Is it a matter of definitions, and I’m over extending the word “work”? What is the “work” in “antiwork” actually defined as, and if it’s different for everyone, what is your personal definition? Do you think people who find satisfaction in labor are deceived by a system, or is it just a matter of different opinions? I don’t expect everyone here to have the same opinion, thanks to anyone who shares.",False,gljrbo,jamesluke1,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gljrbo/do_people_here_have_a_distinction_between_work/,12,1

518,I like my work but I am anti-work because I hate the game. Here is why:,"I have a quarterly package that I do each month.  It is due on May 31st. 

The package process this month:

I received final materials on Thursday and had the whole package completed by Friday, EXCEPT a piece that my co-worker Charlotte does (which I also need to incorporate in one cell in Excel in my materials).  I requested her to do it on Thursday.  I sent my package without Charlotte's piece on Friday for preliminary review to my boss Regina.  

On Monday morning first thing, I followed up with Charlotte so I could add her piece to the final package.  She told me that Regina's boss wanted to review her piece and was still looking it over.  Late morning after this on Monday, Regina (my boss) asked me where I was on the final piece because it needed to be sent to the user by Tuesday (I knew this was a lie).  I told her that her boss (John) was looking over Charlotte's work so that was where the bottleneck is and everything else is done.  I also told her I followed up with Charlotte already.  Regina said she'd follow up with John.

Today finally Regina said she'd look over this piece ( I guess John never got around to it) and to incorporate it (which I did in 5 minutes).  I pdf'd the whole thing and she told me to send to John's boss to get signed (which we do every quarter). I sent around 2pm today and John's boss hadn't sent it back by 5:30pm.

So around 5:28pm I emailed Regina/John and said that the big boss hadn't signed it yet, and did it still need to be sent out by today?  John said tomorrow is fine and not to worry.

OBVIOUSLY this stupid thing wasn't due early after all, and my boss just assumed I hadn't finished it yet because I was just twiddling my thumbs.  When I told her it was actually her boss that was the delay, turns out there really wasn't an early deadline after all,  but she was just being one of those micro-managers.

Note, I am very good at my job and do everything ASAP and single-handedly solved a major major problem for them that took 3-4 months to unsnarl (which they needed to repeatedly ask me for help on b/c they lack Excel skills and problem solving skills).  So there's no reason to ever question how fast or how well I do things.  In fact, I did this pretty early this quarter.",False,gilq8k,Comicalacimoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gilq8k/i_like_my_work_but_i_am_antiwork_because_i_hate/,6,1
519,It's my *company's name*versary today! Can't you tell how excited I am?,"I wanted to puke when I logged in and saw that. My boss congratulated me on this milestone and told me that she hopes it's the start of many more years to come, which it is absolutely not. I'm just stuck here, but trust me, I tried to get out before this Covid thing happened. It's been a whole year of suffering. Great.

They're doing a fundraiser to help employees who had to be laid off due to the virus. They're asking us, other employees, to fill out forms in order to give chunks of our paychecks back to the company so that they can share it with those ""in need"". They mentioned that the people who may need that money can contact them to be part of the program and receive the money. 

It all just seemed so fucking scammy to me. I'm not sure that they contacted every employee that they laid off. Most of them don't have access to their emails and I'm certain they won't read them if they're not working. Why would they? So they probably won't even be aware of this. Not to mention that I'm in Canada where the government has been supporting those who got laid off with a lot of money, I'd say. Substantially more than what my company can offer with these funds. They have gathered about 50k so far. They send us updates regularly regarding how much money has been collected, but we still don't know where it's actually going. Are we just giving our hard-earned money back? Most likely, yes!

They're having a virtual meeting about these funds in an hour and it's mandatory. At this point, you may have a strong will to help out other employees, but insisting that much only makes me even more wary of it. Plus, I know just how desperate for money this company is. 

Listen, I'm glad I got to keep my job. You have no idea how grateful I am for my paychecks. But I can't wait to leave this company.",False,giyw7u,annieduty,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/giyw7u/its_my_companys_nameversary_today_cant_you_tell/,5,1

535,Lockdown thoughts.,"I'm very glad I've found this sub. It speaks to me so much! From the age of 18 I've never understood the logic of this system and felt trapped by it. I'm 35 in a month and this feeling has never gone away.

Prior to lockdown I was a cleaner in a care home for the elderly, something I have done for about 5 years, and I enjoyed it, to some extent. I wasn't there to make anyone rich, I was providing a necessary service for vulnerable people, and I could help them in any way I could.

One of my colleagues started making my life very stressful. I eventually walked out. 

After that I went onto unemployment benefits and was looking at working within the NHS, to do some good, but this pandemic happened. And now, I'm at home, in a semi rural area, the weather has been glorious and I'm the least stressed I have ever been!

This is incredible because I've suffered with mental health issues since I was 16. Funny that.

Now I'm trying to mentally prepare myself for post-lockdown. Honestly, I don't want a job. I just want to do some volunteering, hiking and spending quality time with ""my tribe"" (friends and family). I know that I will have to get a part time job, because capitalism, but this is the life I want, and will try to live.

546,"I'm bike messenger, trying to get coworker not to work","hellojust discovered this sub... hope you're safe and well. I know it's not the case, but I hope it will be for you.I'm from Europe and work as a delivery worker on bikes. Personally I'm delivering 'unsold food' to homeless fundations. Well, I think my work is 'useful'. But, as you expect, my bosses are terrible and forced us to go back to work. When pandemy and so lockdown started, they refused to permit not working (and they had opportunity to have state funding for what we call 'technical unemployement' here. So like when situation (as covid) happens, state will pay the company as much as she need to pay us et pay the warehouse rents etc...Well just to say they HAD choice, and they still HAVE choice.My coworker for most just want to go back to work because 'lockdown is boring' and so it make my points (and for certain of my coworker too) harder to make, since there is almost half of employees that are okay to work, and begging to work. (We're 20 \~\~).

I have health problems. Lot of my coworker have children or old people at their home. We're being paid minimal wage. We have BAD tools (ours bikes are brokens, putting us in danger lot of time, or are just too much energy consuming since they do not repair them and we have to put TOO MUCH effort into biking. We're all good cyclist, since we're bike messenger, and trust me when I say we put too much effort, it's the truth.). It seems like ALL of our claims that we did for years just disapeared because 'lockdown is boring'.

I'm not happy with that. I will return to work probably next week, and some coworker returned a week ago. And NONE of bike are in good health. Bosses are providing one mask a day (and chirurgical one, not the good FFP2 that protect US, and not just the customer we deliver) aand... that's it :)We have 'right of withraw' in my country, so when an employee happens to thinks he is in danger because of X situation, we have legally the RIGHT to go back and NOT work (or at least ask for another task that do not involve being in face of the danger. Like, I don't know, doing mails or wathever).And legally only the employee is in right to judge of legitimy of his widthraw. And if the boss is not okay, he only have the choice to push the case into a judge. So it take time. But here her just ignored all law and just said 'if you use your right to widthraw, you'll get fired.'.

Sorry for my bad english, it's not my native language and I'm struggling with anger, so I'm not goodly writing. But definitly needed to get that true off my chest.

tl;dr : bosses want us to go back to work during covid, we have no good protection supply, our work tools are dangerous to use, they refuse our rights and want to fire us.  


Edit for clarification : I know my job is useful, and especially during those times. but I just not stopping thinking that state should just GIVE money to the homeless fundation and not putting me in danger for working without security, and for a minimal wage (and it is so SAD that's I'm worrying about my pay rate, capitalism rly brainwashed us...).

I remember in middle school, there was a long mandatory assembly presentation on why communism was bad, and the discussion afterwards involved how the government chooses your jobs, and has you waiting for food according to their whims, and how everyone is paid the same. When a classmate (who wanted to be a doctor) was questioned whether it would be right to be paid the same as a janitor, she said that it’s unfair. I suppose back then, I thought it made sense, janitors were simply less important than doctors. 

Now I believe that people are not “better”, but simply different and have different proclivities. We need society to have a complete reformation (including the way we educate people; it should not be coercive nor focused on simply following orders mindlessly) and change the way that we think about each other and our roles in society. Society should be like a library, a place where we enjoy the benefits of collective benefits, not a tier system on arbitrary values of importance. As it stands now, we collectively believe that people should starve and be near homeless if they work in a restaurant.",False,gj9lgc,EstrangedNeko,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gj9lgc/why_schools_must_be_abolished/,17,1

Ok so not only do my mom and stepdad yell at, swear at, belittle and make fun of me...but they expect me to live at home for my first year of college and help them pay bills. 

I am 17..turning 18 in July. I’m going to a community college that is almost an hour away...I’ll be there four days a week from 9:00 to 5:45. Somehow...my parents want me to also work, help pay their bills, and do even more chores around the house than I already do.

My mom and stepdad are very very very well-off. There are no financial troubles at all. Why should I have to go to college (Which isn’t what I want to do anyway...they’re making me do it) AND help pay bills? 

So, I am going to be charged rent all while being belittled and not having the freedom of an adult despite being 18. I will not be allowed to have my boyfriend in my room with my door closed...etc. 

I don’t want to live with them. My plan was to pack my bags and leave to go live with my boyfriend on my 18th birthday (if he doesn’t have an apartment by then, his parents have already told me they will gladly take me in until my boyfriend and I find a place of our own). And if by some freak chance we break up (doubtful...our relationship is very strong) I’ll be moving in with my dad. 

But...sadly I can’t do this plan that I’ve been looking forward to. My mom and step-dad said if I try to move out, they will take everything from me. My car, my phone, my insurance etc. 

I feel like my life is falling apart. I need my phone and internet to do what I want to do to even help pay for my parents bills in the first place. Don’t laugh or say “don’t do it!” Cause I don’t want to hear it..but what I plan to do with my life once I turn 18 is go into the sex work and fetish industry. But my mom thinks I’m just being lazy and don’t want to get a job and help out around the house when the reality is I DO know what I want to do to make money but I can’t tell her because she is against that and will take my phone away. 

I just don’t know what to do. 

My dreams are...different from most people’s. I’m a sexual being and a free-spirit...I just don’t know what to do with such unaccepting parents.

Customers who have been waiting weeks for products that we haven’t processed yet or don’t have in stock. When the stores don’t have the stock we have to reinvoice shit and it’s a long process. Customers are constantly emailing us complaining about shipping times and a lot of the time there is issues with their order.

We have been manually processing these orders and for about two years now we have been hassling our higher ups to automate the process so that we can focus on other parts of the job, namely providing actually GOOD customer service and creating content etc. 
They’re constantly bringing up reasons why it wasn’t doable, like “it’s not busy right now, it’s not a priority” 
And then when it gets busy “it’s too busy right now, we just need to focus on doing the orders” and it fucking blows my mind. Thankfully this covid lockdown forced their hand in terms of automating some of the process. The worst part is how repetitive the job is, and how sore my body gets from sitting around all day. My knees, my wrists and especially my back are completely fucked. I’m only 25 and I wake up with sore joints all the time from this job.

583,"I want to stop working for client, but have many concerns about it","After working for last company as senior developer for exactly 3 years, I decided and did quit working there in April. Without deep details, they started treating abusively, and with extreme under appreciation, and bunch other stuff. Anyway, after I quit, I feel extra sensitive and don’t want another client or company to treat me the same.

Now I’m working as a freelancer with a client, and might end up an employee there, they are nice in general, and most probably someone else might happy working with, but cuz i became picky about work i get frustrated each time I:

- Know that all workers there are freelancers too at the company, which makes communication lacking.

- They don’t have proper experience at work , and team leader does’t remember our discussions, blame me on things so I have to show emails most of the time.

- I got literally no handover process from the previous freelancer developer, for a project with a lot of problems.

- they bug about work with haste, but I gotta chase them down for payments.

- Sometimes, other freelancers are irritating to deal with.

So, I know I might be picky and exaggerating about above points, but Im frustrated all of the time even when im not working.

596,Sometimes shit rolls uphill,"TL;DR: We aren't allowed to have overtime, boss can't run our department at full staff all week if we don't work overtime. Sucks to be him, lol.

I'm a field service tech; I drive around and fix stuff people need. As such, I'm considered Essential(TM). Normally in my industry this time of year is pretty busy and I'd be getting plenty of OT. The corporate overlords have decided to offset their loss of revinue by (predictably) regulating payroll. This sucks because my base pay is already pretty sweet and half of my typical day usually involves driving places while listening to audiobooks. Field service can be a decent gig (relatively speaking) if you know what to look for in an owne--, erm, employer. Ask me about it, I'll clue you in to the scam.

The first week this went down, we ended up having no techs available after about 2pm on Friday since our work done earlier in the week had already used up a lot of those 40 hours. This is a no-no because there needs to be techs available for unscheduled things that pop up.

So week two starts and we start our day with our daily phone meeting. Boss man say, ""I need you all to start managing your hours, we can't have a repeat of last Friday.""

Workin' man all say, ""Yeah boss man, hours."" *cue choreographed eye roll*

Week two rolls to Friday, same thing. I even get the whole day off since I was on call (and still got OT. Ha!).

Week three starts (this week), boss man say, ""Hey guys, this can't happen. We *really* need to watch our hours this week. Call in to dispatch and let them know if you need to move some tickets from the end of your day. We can be flexible.""

Workin' man all say, ""Yeah boss man, hours. We're tryin'."" *cue exaggerated choreographed eye roll*

Well, now it's Thursday and sure enough, I'm on track to work half a day tomorrow. So are my colleagues. The thing is, we *can't* manage our own hours. It just doesn't work that way. We get assigned service tickets to fill our days that were scheduled ahead of time. We can't control how long it takes to fix a problem, and for safety reasons we can't leave a job unfinished in a lot of cases. It takes as long as it takes. On top of this, when we call in to say that we won't be able to complete all of the assigned work within the allotted time we're told by the dispatcher to just go, we need you there today. It's not her fault, she's got people up her ass about getting them scheduled right away and she'll catch hell for trying to push them back. Plus, scheduling us is not her only job. I feel for that poor woman, she's up to her neck.

600,I hate work from home. I would literally rather do anything other than work from home for this company. This job makes quarantine 1000% worse,"My day job has moved to WFH and it is the most stressful god awful thing ever. I hate working from home and I’d rather just not work at all.

What? You have a job AND you get to work from home? What are you complaining about?

Well, I’ve worked for a company for about 2 years on and off that does proxy voting for shareholders and we’ve recently moved out of the office and into wfh using our personal computers and cellphones. (the office will not provide us with any equipment) it goes through a program that keeps our information secure. If we did not have the necessary equipment or our equipment could not handle the mass amounts of software, we had to spend hours on the international help desk line, and if the issue was not resolved, we were fired. 

On an everyday basis we have to contact wealthy or middle class shareholders and ask them to vote their proxy for the upcoming shareholder meeting for whatever company. We are not trying to sell them anything as this is not a sales job. Most shareholders think we are scam callers so we get yelled at, hung up on (which is actually the nicest thing they can do), mocked, I’ve even had some person go so far as scream in my ear as loud as they possibly could. One person put the phone back, told me to hold on a second so they could get their husband or wife who handled the investments on the phone. They never returned. It was basically a “your going to waste my time, I’m going to waste yours” I’ve been called every name in the book. I’ve had jealous wives demand why I want to speak to their husbands. I’ve been called “sleaze”, “slut”, and “whore” by those women. I usually just laugh because they’re probably jealous of maybe a mistress or something. I’d be mad too if I had cobwebs in my vagina but whatever. 

I had some guy a couple of days ago try to keep a really long conversation with me because he said he was bored in quarantine and it had been a long time since he heard the voice of a female. Then I heard a zipper unzip, and I swear I am not making this up, moaning and some wet noise. I just ended the call immediately. 

I go into work with 2 or 3 emails sometimes about “dispositioning” a call wrong or not logging in on time. Then there’s the infractions: we have wrap infractions and you can get one of those by taking too long in “wrap time” which is the time after you end a call where you’re supposed to take notes on the call. Then  you can get “break infractions” which is what happens if you go even one minute over your break or lunch. Then there’s the “aux infractions”, the aux is just a phone code that tells our supervisors what we’re doing. We have aux codes for break, lunch, system issues, whatever task we’re doing etc etc. you can get both and aux and break infraction for staying in the break aux code too long.

We are allowed a whopping 8 minutes (plus obviously lunch and break) of personal time a day. That is time to get a drink of water or go to the bathroom. We are expected to make 30 calls an hour, which doesn’t seem like much but when you’re working on a really slow, outdated system with angry shareholders you’ll be lucky to squeeze 15 an hour out of that. Our team lead had the audacity to complain to us today that we were not working fast enough and he expected an improvement today. 

So yeah, basically my home has become a massive place of stress for me, headaches and anxiety included. I am a big simulation gamer (TS4, cities skylines etc) and this job doesn’t even make me want to look at my computer or game anymore in my free time. 

I’m in the process of registering for summer college classes and financial aide for said classes which is stressful in and of itself. I am very close to a bachelors degree, so I’d like to squeeze that out here in the next few semesters. Due to all the COVID stuff, I can’t really get a hold of anyone.

602,The Oppressive Nature of the Triple Eight Rule,"(CW: Some depressing content and work-related depression.)

I've made a plethora of content about [depression and capitalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPFxQhA4lYk) on my channel, and I feel a bit guilty for making so many videos that I have to put depression/suicide warnings on. My newer content has swayed away from that, but I still like having outlets to discuss these things, so that's why I'm here. 

You all have most likely heard the triple eight rule at least one time during your lives. It's a semi-common colloquialism and, arguably, a piece of capitalist propaganda to force an anti-worker, reductionist view on the populous. If you haven't heard of it, the triple eight rule is ""**Eight hours of work, eight hours of sleep, eight hours of play**"". 

A little background about how this rule becomes more and more painfully obvious to me: I was laid off in late March due to COVID, and have now recently returned to my job. To put it lightly, the extra time off was a *godsend*. I had time to help one of my boyfriends move into an apartment, clean up my space a bit (which I'm sure made a [certain Canadian](https://carleton.ca/align/wp-content/uploads/JP-e1528757689361.png) happy), and I was able to relax to an extent that made me feel a little guilty (because I wasn't spending all my time being ""productive"" like I would at work.)

Now, I'll say right now that not everyone is going to have the same problem as me, and if you have depression, *please try meds*. Sometimes it takes trying quite a few to find one that works. Many of my peers believed that my daily suicidal thoughts and occasional crying fits/breakdowns might have been the cause of a chemical imbalance. I had tried one medicine at the time that gave me only side effects, and during my time laid off due to COVID, I switched meds. My concern, however, was that the cessation (or rather lower frequency of) the ""thoughts"" might not have been due to the new meds, but instead, because I wasn't at work. 

Returning to work, I realized that it wasn't the meds. 

Now more than ever has it become more painfully obvious to me how very little time we have in our lives to do what we want. My ""time anxiety"" has become quite a bit more like [red-ataraxia's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1HrHUdvqWQ) and it's something that's hard to distract myself from. I see my full time job as a leech on my energy and time. The triple eight rule doesn't account for time spent doing work-related activities (commute, getting ready, etc.) I get up to go to work at 8, I get off at 5, and by the time I arrive and home and am done having dinner, it's already 6. If I go to bed at 10 (or 11 if I'm feeling risky) then I only really get 4 *maybe* 5 hours of time to myself. Around *half* of what is proposed in the absurd ""triple eight"" rule.  Does it not run people ragged knowing that they have so little time to fit what they want to into such time? I understand scheduling, but I shouldn't have to waste time putting effort into efficiently spending my free time. It's *leisure*, why schedule it like it's *work*?

It's ridiculous that one must surrender most of their day's time and energy to get the ""privilege"" to survive within a capitalist society. I have to wake up, eat, go to sleep, and work on someone else's time. I hypothesize that people are more spontaneous than that. Some days we have more of a capacity to work, some days we have less. The system does not care about this, because we are flesh machines. We are expected to work at constant, unwavering rates.

My biggest and only life goal right now is trying to escape the 40 hour workweek, and considering this is such a huge gamble in my life, it causes ample anxiety. I have plans, but there is no guarantee they will succeed. And even then, it will still pain me to see my friends and comrades work in jobs equally (if not more) oppressing than the one I'm trying to escape. 

I've learned that I won't get the easy way out. I've tried meds, I've tried therapy, I've talked to at least a dozen people who have their depression under control, I've shared my thoughts on r/MutualAid, I've tried meditation and similar distractions, I've tried absurdism. I can understand those who survive for the revolution, or those who survive for who they love; and while I find both revolution and loved ones paramount, it still just doesn't keep me from wanting to commit the final no-no. I'm that broken. 

 It won't help me hurdle this wall. I cannot accept the life given to me if the 40 hour workweek is a necessary condition. I am weak —  work has broken me. Truthfully, like many other people of this mindset, I don't want to die, I want an escape. 

I'm not sure if this kind of post belongs here, and if mods see fit, you can delete this. I understand. 

Unfortunately, I can't help but scream these morbid thoughts into the voids I have access to.",False,gi5xtf,EccentricRants,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gi5xtf/the_oppressive_nature_of_the_triple_eight_rule/,0,1

No separate email telling me of this, telling me where in my contract that is. I only found of because I asked why I wasnt having a random Sunday off coming up at the end of May. (Anniversary of my mom's passing, ha).


Oh, but we had a medical director with our company up until mid February (I think) who had every Saturday off as religious exemption...but fuck me I guess.


Our clinic does covid-19 and antibody testing outside of Detroit. And what was my thanks? Cut hours, used PPE, and constant tedious emails about *the exact words to use to answer the phone*. My coworkers insubordination got us more email reminders so we were ""all on the same page"". I'm in a whole other chapter, I know to empty the trash at night, upload receipts and payment logs. I worked hard for this company just to use me until I cracked. Which I have. 


I didnt sleep well before work. I would wake up at 3:30am-4am before shifts just anxiety ridden. Couldnt fall back asleep until hopefully 6 for a half hour that I would push off until 7:10am. The lack of care had me tripped up more though. We had to reuse N95 masks. We had COVID positive patients at our clinic and we would see patients for testing 30 minutes apart. There was hardly time to disinfect properly. Patients walked in with symptoms when signs said otherwise and then someone sits in the lobby with a hurt wrist symptom free thinking they're safe....you aren't. Seeing patients open to close gave us no time to eat. And I was literally hanging up calls when another call would start to flash and ring...its been chaos. I'm glad to be done.


Should I even get into my boss being sexist? Not only cutting our PA's salary during COVID but paying the few Male PA's more to start than the females. Fuck, I think a PA told me she with a raise is barely making more than his starter pay. Hes verbally abusive to former managers and has said that ""women arent good in positions of power because they're too passive"" (uh, come again?!)

604,employer screwed me over with unemployment,"me coming on here for consolation because my job cheated me out of $1800 worth of those pandemic checks which was supposed to compensate for my reduced hours and now i'm being forced back to full-time even though 1) 90% of the ENTIRE building is still on furlough 2) Other depts. are being allowed to bring people back ON SHORT HOURS 3) my dept. for some reason is having a hard time bringing our people back because management is fucking incompetent and is too scared to make a fucking phone call to the people on furlough to come back 4) they're telling me and my boss that they're trying to ""maximize the hours in the dept."" before bringing more people back which is why we both have to be full-time (which is bullshit bc of #2) and 5) they only made this decision when my boss and i found out that i wasn't eligible for the $600 pandemic check and that's why i haven't been getting anything for the majority of fucking April because apparently they made me work JUST ENOUGH hours to not be eligible for it. (I know it's based off last year's income or whatever which i also think is stupid because what the fuck does that have to do with what i'm making right now.) But now i'm being forced to full-time? So where's the fucking 3 weeks worth of $600 pandemic checks that's supposed to compensate for my reduced hours? Did I just fucking work those 3 weeks for nothing? Those paychecks I got those weeks wasn't even enough to cover a trip to the fucking grocery store. Will I see that money or am I supposed to just lick their boots and go back to full-time even though my whole fucking department isn't back yet bc THEY'RE STILL ON FURLOUGH. I ASKED THE HR DUDE ABOUT THIS AND ALL HE CAN TELL ME THAT IT'S A ""BUSINESS DECISION"" LOL OKAY. ALSO WHY DO THEY GET TO MAKE THE FUCKING DECISION INSTEAD OF MY FUCKING DEPT. MANAGER? My dept. manager literally told me if it was up to her she would've had me work 16 hours and just called another person in to work 20 hours since work was picking back up. There's no reason why us two should be the only ones in the ENTIRE fucking building being full-time busting our asses while the rest of our dept. gets to stay home on furlough collecting the $600.

Sorry if this is super lengthy but my job has honestly just been a pain in the ass about this whole thing and obviously they don't give a shit about their employees. It just infuriates me and honestly I was gonna quit around April and find another job before fucking COVID-19. Until my job trapped me with staying for unemployment only to screw me over with it and now they want me to go back to normal even though they clearly exploited the shit out of me. I'm this close to just walking out and never coming back but I also can't because I do need the money.

611,“Find something to do.”,"Not sure if this is the right place to complain, but the whole “if you can lean, you can clean” thing has always been a pet peeve of mine. It’s basically punishment for finishing your work early, or for a gap between customers that isn’t anyone’s fault 

I remember working at a retail store at which there were always cameras aimed at me. I didn’t mind except for Mondays. On Mondays for some reason we never had any customers, but I was still scheduled and if I stood around doing nothing (after inventory/ordering etc was all done) I’d get scolded immediately, so I go and sweep the floor, or wipe glass displays, or randomly rearrange products and then rearrange them back etc. Sometimes I’d clean the *entire* store three times in one shift. Since cleaning just once a day is enough, and there are no customers, and I need to be paid for my time there regardless of customers, what reason was there to have me clean over and over and over again? 

I’ve also had several desk jobs, either at cubicles or reception areas, and again sometimes I was in the zone and just finished all my work before end of day. Despite this, I’ve NEVER had a supervisor who was just cool with that. Sometimes I’d sneakily study in secret (this was before applying to grad school) and I’d get scolded and given more work that wasn’t originally mine. For no extra pay obviously. As a result, I got into the habit of staring at my computer and going real slow for the entire day. Same work done but now I’m miserable and wasting precious hours of my life I’ll never get back. 

Why do supervisors get hissy when I do anything other than work AFTER THE WORK IS DONE AND IM STILL ON THE CLOCK BECAUSE LEGALLY IM AN FTE. I don’t understand why it killed them to let me study a little. 

And of course there’s the opposite of this; having more and more tasks thrown at you as months go by, but you never get a raise. I finally quit a job once when they kept throwing complicated work my way but then scolded me for working overtime. You want me to do more work outside my job description? How about you pay me more?

622,"I get it, most of us have to work. But my work experience has been shit and I am feeling suicidal. Covid-19 pandemic just made it worse.","Context: I am Asian. Specifically, Singaporean. Singapore is a pressure-cooker society ruled by boomer logic and the relentless growth for prosperity. It is exceedingly difficult to be your own boss. So most of us are salaried workers. 

Now, I just graduated from college 2 years ago, majoring in the Humanities. My first job was manageable but mediocre. My boss was inept (he couldn't even operate the office-scanner after 30 years in service!), a micro-manager (he would scrutinize your reporting time and the time you went home) and someone who offered zero guidance but was quick to blame you when things went wrong. He sure had his nice points, but at work I was quite overwhelmed. In addition, I had to front customers that were rude and self-entitled. I have been called an idiot for merely communicating policy positions and for being unable to accede to the customer's ridiculous requests. My boss just asked me to suck it up. 

I lasted for 1 year 7 months in that company. During that time, I constantly prayed for a job change. I finally got one and I tendered my resignation immediately. 

On paper, my new job sounds like everything I wanted. Opportunities for greater exposure and the opportunity to apply what I like doing best - research and writing. The first 3 months were alright, and then it rapidly turned to shit. I can never seem to satisfy the expectations of my new boss. I can have multiple submissions for a single task, and it will only return with curt comments to change this or that. It is frustrating. 

Worse of all, my boss is VERY hurtful. She is the kind that does not mince her words and it is causing me to have multiple episodes of anxiety attacks. I am trying my best, and she still rubs caustic shit like ""please buck up""or ""it is very difficult to assign you with more work until I see improvement"". By the way, she is the FIRST ever person to tell me that my writing and research skills are not up to scratch. Not to blow my own trumpet, but my professors back in college and ex-bosses have praised my flair in writing. What a fucking bitch. 6 months in, and I am looking for another job. Sent out 80+ job applications, and in this covid-19 pandemic it is understandable why replies are slow. But urghh. 

Talked to that bitch about it, and she sounded defensive. She basically told me to level up, and that her unreasonable expectations about work are ""justified"".

My parents simply do not understand my job woes (unlike much of the Western world, Singaporean singles generally live with their parents until the age of 35 or when they get married - whichever is earlier). As I mentioned earlier, Singaporean society is still largely ruled by boomer logic - get a job at a prestigious firm and park yourself there for 40 years. You are not allowed to leave unless there are better tangible benefits (higher pay). Bad bosses? Too bad, just suck it up. Its better to die at your bosses' hands than to die of joblessness. When I wanted to leave my first job, I got a big fat scolding. And when I voiced my intention to leave my second job, my friends looked at me and gave me judgmental looks (huh? what?? changing jobs again???). 

I have never felt so alone and scared. I am currently working from home and even then, I dread opening my inbox (even though I have to, at some point). 

I am aggressively applying for jobs. But there is also another fear - what if I land into another cesspool?

625,I fucking hate retail,"I hate retail. I've been in it for 3 years, and it's been mentally draining to the point I think I've become less of a positive person. I moved from one retail chain to another in the hopes that I'll have a better team but it's just the same except more uncomfortable. My manager runs 2 stores, one I work at and the one next to ours. The teams no eachother but it's not like we talk often. One day the assistant manager from the store next door came in and asked me to buy him a drink - which I thought was a joke because we never talk. 
But he was serious, so I awkwardly bought him his drink. The next day I came in and jokingly asked him to buy me a coffee - he flipped his shit. I was telling the other team members jokingly that ""i bought him a drink and he won't even buy me one"", he lost his actual mind. He pulled me aside and told me I was being ""disrespectful"" he went on to say ""he doesn't know how i was raised"" overall being so rude even though I thought we were doing ok?
So I walked out after telling him that I was just doing what he did to me, and that what's  actually disrespectful is coming to me and demanding for a drink even though we don't have a relationship like that.
So I walked out- and cried. Lmao.
Now everytime I go to work I have to see his stupid fucking face. Ontop of that, everyone in my store is actually friends with him (THEY ALL HANG OUT).

America has beaten me, and it will kill me in no time flat if I let it. My sole saving grace is a decent sized (hundred thousand-ish) inheritance coming my way. With it, I am going to try to get into Latin America illegally and work remotely. I'm going to invent a completely new persona for myself - a false birth certificate, forged papers, forged resume, forged educational history, everything. I am then going to take this and, living overseas, try to land some decent-paying remote work position in the United States, in an attempt to live well - or, at least, better than in the abject poverty I find myself in now.

Will it work? Probably not. Am I prepared for it? Not at all. Is it worth the effort?

Yes.

My resume will be \*completely\* doctored, using some combination of reference faking sites and hired Third World developers to mock up sites for businesses that do not exist. Most people advise against doctoring ""perfect"" resumes; my approach will be the opposite - I will tailor it specifically to the kind of work I'm looking for, so that I will be the 'perfect' candidate.  


 My ""diploma"" will come from a university that is no longer in operation. My identity.... the Social Security Number is by far the weak link in the chain, but I am unafraid of it. I will shoot for a position in some field like project co-ordination.

I'm going to try to get a remote work position \*and\* dropship. If I can do both, I should be able to do very well for myself. I will never be able to retire, but who the fuck can? The cost of a typical rental in one of the areas I'm looking at is two hundred American dollars a month. If I can lock down an American remote work wage and live there simultaneously, my conditions will vastly improve.

Very roughly, I already know how to get into Mexico illegally. I have a destination in mind, and I think I've worked out how to get there, though of course conditions are always changing.

627,In praise of idleness,"The work ethic is a relative recent invention. It has its roots in the Protestant Reformation — the Tudor authorities were hostile to idlers. Monks were considered to be lazy. It gathered force in the Industrial Revolution when the mill owners required a docile and punctual workforce to toil in the dark satanic mills. That’s when punctuality became a matter of essential morals. And most recently Silicon Valley has invented its own version: unless your side hustle has a side hustle, then you are going to fail in life.  
Earlier societies, though, were not so work-oriented. The ancient Greek philosophers insisted on the ideal of “schole” or cultivated leisure, for a happy life, and even the brutal Romans believed that civilised people should enjoy a decent portion of otium. Life was not all about business: they called that negotium.  
In the Middle Ages, the great creative projects of the cathedrals were carried out voluntarily in people’s spare time. Guilds were against overwork as it might give you an unfair advantage over your brother in the guild. And there were multiple holy days and feast days when working was prohibited.  
Some are born idle, some achieve idleness and right now, a lot of people are having idleness thrust upon them. And many of them rather like it.

got either of those.”

653,Tired of Taking The Blame for Corporate Greed," I'm SICK of going to bat for big corporations that I work for. When CEOs decide to screw customers over, it's the employees at the bottom that are stuck dealing with the aftermath.

Here is an example. I work for a software company that used to allow it's users 2 activations per license. Then they took an activation away from customers out of nowhere, forcing customers to purchase an additional seat (which costs anywhere between 3-5 grand)

Customers started calling in to complain.I have to apologize for a decision that I didn't even MAKE. Some greedy asshole at the top did so they could pocket more money.
 And they probably got a million dollar bonus for it!! I wish I knew who made this decision so I could personally give out the name and address to every customer who calls in to complain.

 I feel bad for the customers who are taking it out on me but I have to go to bat for this corporation. Instead of saying ""You're right MY COMPANY IS GREEDY"" I am getting paid to defend their actions that I do not agree with. Does anyone else feel like this? It goes against my code of ethics and I feel like a sleezeball just having to take their side so I can put food on the table and have a roof over my head.

I think employees and customers waste so much time fighting each other over decisions neither of them have any control over.

656,Why are employees expected to bend over backwards for work?,"Employees are expected to sacrifice working on holidays. People are expected to work extra hours as if we don’t have don’t have life outside it. As if we are indebted. 

I feel like an employee can be hardworking without overworking them. Don’t get me wrong - there are people who genuinely don’t mind working extra hours/sacrificing holidays and they should be properly compensated for that but they shouldn’t be the standard.

Like, I already finished my 10 hour workday, thank you very much. I want to spend my remaining free time with my family now.

Worse, my coworkers fell into the trap (I don’t blame them) and now feel bad that they have to work extra hours but now think I’m being unfair for choosing not to work on weekends. We have different roles so our workload isn’t rotational, btw. 

The corporate world is driving me insane. I feel crazy. There’s so much gaslighting going on that I don’t even know what my rights are anymore.

So, why are we expected by corporations to bend over backwards for them? 

Follow up question, what would be a good comeback if my boss mentions I’m “underperforming” for not working extra hours? 😔",False,gejm5f,regrets11729027,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gejm5f/why_are_employees_expected_to_bend_over_backwards/,50,1

I’m safe and in a healthy relationship. I have a job. I like my boss. He’s nice and runs his business ethically. But I wish I could choose to take 2/3 days off a week when I want/need to, without looking bad and without being homeless. It would bring me back balance between chores, pet care, staying fit, cooking food, showering, internal development, healthcare, illness recuperation and prevention, leisure, hobby, friends, family, lover, etc...

Why are so many people okay living on shit wages for meaningless work?","I just graduated from university with a degree in Finance and one internship under my belt. I got paid a pretty good amount but I hated the job, it was in capital markets, think investment banking. I've never really known what I wanted to do as a career aside from sports but that didnt work out for me unfortunately, so I went to school for something ""practical"" after I stopped playing club, but now im realizing finance isnt even that practical and the jobs dont pay enough for the high cost of living of being in the city where finance jobs are. So theres too many graduates, and not enough jobs, and I hate the industry anyways. I cant even think of anything worth doing and Im getting stressed out being at home with nothing to do and having my parents breathing down my neck. I feel like Ive lost all the autonomy by moving back home. I keep applying to finance jobs even though I hate them all.

Anyways I started getting into music about a year ago and now im thinking I'd want to pursue that maybe, but thats just as hard as my first dream of professional sports. I dont know why I cant be realistic. It frustrates me a lot. I wish I could just be happy to do a regular job like other people but I cant. What do I do? Im not even good enough yet for sure, but its the one thing I can look forward to in a way. My other interest is exercise and fitness but thats also super oversaturated industry and personal trainers dont get paid anything... and god knows we dont need another fitness YouTuber.

I need advice on what to do with my finance degree? and how to pursue music along side whatever job I get? I feel so disillusioned and hopeless. I see all these people doing regular jobs and wonder how they do it, but I also see successful musicians and Youtubers and entrepreneurs and wonder how they got there.

Sorry for the ramble but how do I figure out what I should be doing and how do I go after it while havign enough for rent, and food and necessities? Im so burnt out and miserable and I just feel hopeless.

691,"The Actual True, Really Real Story of How The Bureau of Labor Statistics Made 8 Million Unemployed Workers Disappear","So, the actual true, really real unemployment rate, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics own methodology is almost 20% -- 19.3% -- but the BLS itself reported it as 14.7% yesterday even though they know that figure is wrong, again, according to their own methodology.

I am not making this crazy shit up. The BLS actually reported an unemployment figure they knew was wrong, knowing it was wrong. This is some insane, fucking crazy shit. 

So, how did this happen?

Well the BLS admits in its release yesterday that 7.5 million workers reported they were ""absent from work"". The category, ""absent from work"" means they are still working, just not at work. So, according the BLS they are not unemployed. The BLS knew this might happen, so they told their people to reclassify workers who said this in another category, as ""absent from work due to coronavirus related business closure"", which would make this 7.5 million workers unemployed temporarily.

Instead of 22.5 million workers being unemployed for the period, there would be 30 million workers unemployed.

Well, the correction never happened. That's right. The correction never happened. The BLS didn't correct the numbers. Instead, they reported that 14.7% of the labor force was unemployed, not 19.3%. That was the headline that went out to the media. 8 million people just disappeared from the ranks of the unemployed just like that.

693,Going back to work soon with extremely reduced hours. I don't want to lose my unemployment.,"Hello comrades.

So when the virus got bad, I voluntarily took time off work since my hours got slashed (felt like there was no point in risking my health anyway) and I took the quarantine seriously. But I'm going back to work on May 18th (which I feel is premature but I don't really have a choice, it's company's orders). 

I wouldn't be balking if it meant I was going back to the same exact work situation, but I'm not. I previously used to work in elementary schools for about 40 hours a week. Since the schools I worked for are now closed, I'll now be getting around 10 hours a week in a different setting (same company/role). I absolutely cannot live on that alone, point blank.

Bummed because I'm actually financially secure for the first time since I started in this field nearly 3 years ago. It's been *so damn nice* not having to worry about money and getting paid a living wage. I hate the idea of going back to my previous lifestyle of always having money problems. Makes me angry just thinking about it.

But I've heard that if your usual hours have been cut due to the virus, you still may qualify for unemployment, but how exactly does it work in the other direction (e.g., I started as completely unemployed but am now going back with reduced hours, not just reduced hours to begin with)? Is anyone familiar with what I have to do to keep getting unemployment payments? I'd expect some of the money to be reduced, of course, but I'm just extremely unfamiliar with the overall system. Since my searches on this topic are leading to dead ends, I would like some advice on how to keep afloat if anyone has any. I'm in California, if that matters.

So....After my employer kept saying we weren't going to get furloughed....guess what.  We got a day's notice that we were getting furloughed and were not allowed to use our vacation time.  I had told my employer about 6 months previous that I would be moving in the next six months.  However hadn't said anything since.  So, my wife gets a job out of state and we are moving...at the exact same time I started working from home and then furloughed.  Soooo, I now live in another state and I am tentatively scheduled to go back to work on the 26th of May.  Because of the job market, I haven't found a job in North Carolina yet.  I have never not given a two weeks' notice but I am kinda stuck.  I know on the 25th, I am going to say I am not returning to work.

It was an industry I have a decade of experience in but have struggled to get a job in for 4 years. During that time I worked retail jobs which I absolutely hated. I finally (out of luck) landed this job and started straight away. Within the first week, I knew it was going to be tough. The type of work being done was different to what I had done in the past and the owner was extremely difficult. When I started, I was assured that there'd be adequate time for me to train and learn and there was no pressure to be productive for a while. On day 3 I was already getting pressure from him. Adding to that, there was no training to speak of and any time he explained anything it was scattered, unclear and impossible to follow. If you didn't understand you were made to feel stupid. He refused to write things down and I basically stumbled my way through the job for 4 months feeling like each day would be my last. Eventually I got to the point where I had to throw in the towel because the owner was getting increasingly aggressive and frustrated while 5 mins later acting like your best friend.

Now I'm sitting at home, job hunting in a terrible climate and I feel like a massive failure. Why couldn't I just suck it up and stay there? Why didn't I learn quicker? Am I stupid?

702,[Idea] I think you would all enjoy working...,"**...if it wasn't so kafkaesque**. It took me a while of practical thought to get here, but I'm logically here with my train of thought. Instinctively humans love to feel resourceful, as it is a trait carried to us from our neanderthal forefathers. However given the state of affairs that exist today (between wealth inequity and the lack of communal presence* related to one’s job), we have a big portion of the population (myself included) who are anti-work. 

However, we still have people that enjoy playing games like “The SIMS” or “Animal Crossing,” we have people that love slice of life shows, such as “The Devil is a Part Timer,” a big portion of the population who are anti-work, also enjoy the idea of work from afar. But why?

I recently watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhD2rmhcBFM) video discussing a theory about “Animal Crossing”. In summary, the main character is dead and you are in purgatory. The theory is is partly evidenced through the ideas that life within Animal Crossing is very simple. Work is simple, bills are simple, owning a home is simple; and life within Animal Crossing is simple because it is viewed through the objective lens of a [deceased?] child.

Kafka poses that through excessive bureaucratic burdens, people are left confused in paperwork. We don’t know what's going to happen next, nor where to turn [/u/blom95], and we are stuck in this jungle of complex ideas with little ideological substance. 

Gone are the days of communally working as the towns blacksmith, or the state’s teacher. Present, are the days of working as someone’s *senior insurance claims adjuster*, woo!

The aforementioned ideas parallel and describe the anti-work situation today. Work is no longer a simple lifestyle, but at best, complicated.

Protocol one page summary.

The Unionist World Order or New World Order. It will be accomplished by control of the money and the media.
Goyim are mentally inferior and can’t run their nations properly. For their sake and ours, we need to abolish their governments and replace them with a single government.
His will take a long time and involve much bloodshed, but it’s for a good cause. Were’s what we'll need to do:

0 Place our agents and helper everywhere
1 Take control of the media and use it in propaganda for our plans

2 Start fights between different races, classes and religions

3 Use bribery, threats and blackmailed to get our way

4 Use Freemasonic Lodges to attract potential public officials

5 Appeal to successful people's eggs

6 Appoint puppet leaders who can be controlled by blackmailed

7 Replace royal rule with socialist rule, then communism, then despotism
8 Abolish all rights and freedom, except the right of force by us.

9 Sacrifice people (including News sometimes) when necessary

10 Eliminate religion; replace it with science and materials

11 Control the education system to spread deception and destroy intellect
12 Write history to our benefit

13 Use our media to create entertaining distractions

14 Corrupt minds with filth and perversion

15 Encourage people to spy on one another

16 Deep the masses in poverty and perpetual labor

17 Take possession of all wealth, property and [especially] gold

18 Use gold to manipulate the markets

19 Introduce a progressive tax on wealth

20 Replace sound investment with speculation

21 Take long-term interest-bearing loans to governments [FED, IMF, BIS, ECB]
22 Give bad advice to governments and everyone else

23 Blame the victim

Eventually the Goyim will be so angry with their governments (because we'll blame them for the resulting mess) that they'll gladly have us take over.

734,"""Reframe your thinking so that you're working for the time off work""","Nothing makes my blood boil more than that statement.  The time on work is so fucking miserable that I don't even want to do anything after.  Forcing myself to have ""fun"" doesn't work as it is clear it is a distraction to not think about having to go in the next day, and the day after that UNTIL I FUCKING DIE.  

Here is the convo whenever I talk about pivoting:

Me: ""I hate my job, I want to quit.  It makes me miserable.""

Everyone Else: ""What about money?""

Me: ""I have savings, and can easily afford to take a few months off because I haven't been consooooming anything for years now.""

Everyone Else: ""You shouldn't quit without a job lined up.""

Me: ""Look, I'm miserable.  I've been to therapy over this.  It is clear the job is the source of my anxiety/depression.""

Everyone Else: ""Just try to stick it out until you find something.""

Me: ""I've been sticking it out for 6 months.  I hadn't entirely been looking as I was more focused on my depression and willingly went to therapy on my own.  I hadn't even done that when my parents died.  I am having more stress and anxiety over this job than I did dealing with the death of both my parents.""

Everyone Else: ""It.. It's really bad to be unemployed right now.  Coronavirus is ruining the market.""

Me:  ""The timing of the virus sucks, I'll give you that.  But everyone is working from home now.  This is making it worse, as it bleeds into my home life.  And, the virus doesn't change how much I have in savings nor does it change how I feel about my job.  If anything, it feels worse because I feel MORE trapped when people say the job market was bad.  Like I should be grateful I have something that put me into a a state of mind where I feel horrible?""

Everyone Else: Either silence or ""you don't seem open to changing your mind about this""

I just find the idea of taking time off so... archaic.  Wanting a month off, unpaid, is against pretty much EVERY corporate policy unless you have a doctors note.  If you have the savings to take a month off, why not?  This whole idea of waiting until retirement is absolutely stupid.  A lot of people NEVER make it until retirement.  People literally spend like $4,000 on a two week vacation abroad, while I would LOVE to spend $1,500 to just cover my bills for one month and sit on my ass.  But my idea is considered crazy, unapproved, I get looks like I don't belong.  Hell, maybe I don't.

I have good stuff going for me that I have to remind myself, in case thoughts get too dark.  I don't want to appear bragging, I encourage everyone to find some positives in their life.  

* savings
* good friends
* good family
* good girlfriend
* not addicted to any drugs
* don't drink alcohol/coffee
* very healthy weight (been working out a lot since the pandemic started)
* excellent diet, blood work came back flawless
* good 4 year degree from a good college
* 3 years of work experience

And yet I'm labeled as depressed and anxious because I am deeply unhappy with the idea of my current job and continuing to go to something that makes me absolutely miserable.  Every single time I put in extra effort, I just got more work and responsibilities for the same pay.  Forcing myself to refrain my thinking works for a week - after that I start to go insane.

738,My first and worst job,"This is my first job ever and is probably the reason I will never work at a restaurant.(this is on my phone so sorry for bad spelling)

I got my first job about two years ago. I was in the middle of my jr year in high school. I felt bad asking my mom for cash cause I wanted to buy my own stupid shite. So when my mother told me that the restaurant she works at just made a deal with an airplane company to create over priced food, I was down for it as well as occasionally prepping food. My job was simple. The company would call my boss and tell him how many of whatever food they needed that day, then we would come in to put them into containers which would be driven to the airport. The pay was good(at least for me), it was 12 dollars an hour.

I was told to get their the next day, when I got there,however,the working conditions were horrible. First off we worked in the storage room near the food prepping area, second the plastic/makeshift tables were too low and would hurt your back, third problem was that we were timed and since the demand was too high(I'm talking hundreds to thousands), other workers(including my mother) would have to take time out of their day(without compensation) to help. The final problem was my boss. He was generally a piece of shit who acted like he owned the place and would rarely help(thank Dagon he got fired for incompetence).

This would go on for two years, which got harder as one day I came to work only to find everyone but me quit. So for some of those two years, I was ""making""
Hundreds of raviolis, sandwiches, quiches, by myself  from the beginning of the day.

The last time I went to work was last Halloween, 100 sandwiches which wasn't too bad. I'm still waiting for them to call me back,but due to covid I'm basically out of the job.

My second job is commission illustrator that I do from home. I'm working on a comic, trying to get going on Patreon, accepting basically all commission offers I get. My first job is a fast food place that shan't be named for legal reasons. 

I still need a regular job for now while I'm getting established. In March I explained that to my manager I'm available for 2 days a week on the schedule, 3 tops, because doing illustration is time consuming. She agreed to this at the time, and on paper it looks like she's doing just what I asked. In reality she's refused to hire anyone at all to alleviate the strain for the possition. There's just me and a single other person who 'can do it'. Nearly every day I'm not on the schedule I'm getting bombarded with texts and calls from her that I need to come in and cover, which I refuse to do after the first time. I have my own customers and deadlines to meet and I've given my manager my terms.

This morning on my way to work my car broke down. I let her know what was going on and that I was going to try to correct the issue and be there asap. After coming to the conclusion that it wasn't something I could fix I let her know I couldn't make it. 

My boyfriend could take me in for my 4am shift, but id have no way home until he got off his own job at 6pm. My manager offered to take me home but at earliest that would be 4pm, but likely 5pm, and I know if I'm there already she'd going to work me into the ground the entire time I'm in that building. I already don't get any breaks or lunch, and I'm not allowed to clock out until the manager tells me I can. She regularly keeps me for 2-3 hours past what I'm supposed to be there anyway, and I know she would use my being stuck as an excuse to keep me working until the absolute latest possible.

Plus, I gotta get this car issue taken care of or I'm not going to be making it to work anyway.


She blew up on me because she had to call in the other person how does this possition and berated me for not respecting the other person's second job. The ""second job"" is cleaning the managers house for her. That's it. 

So yeah, I'm a disrespectful jerk for calling in once, which caused the manager to have to clean her own damn house. I'm so done with these rediculous jobs and their more rediculous managers. Hire enough staff to make up the difference when you know there are ppl calling in every day!

750,quitting my job during the pandemic,"as the title says, i'm about to quit my job during the pandemic and i've never felt so FREE!!!!!  


my brother sent me this sub last night and i have been devouring all your stories..he thought i should post mine, so here it goes.   


so, i've been at my current job 2 years. i was hired as kitchen staff at $14/hour and since then, i have gotten pretty decent raises. also, i've got to explain my payroll a bit before i continue... so for kitchen, that's my main position, the position i was hired for. but sometimes i clock in as ""barista"" for $9/hr but that is not often and only for an hour or two at a time. i am the only one at work that has two different ways to clock in, with different pay rates for each.   


the women who work with me all clock in as ""barista"", and all started at $9/hr but since they've all been working here for years, they have obviously gotten raises, too. so they make probably $11-12/hr.   


okay, so now the main point of the post....  


our cafe closed back in March for 6 weeks...went into work that Monday, everything normal, come home that night to an email saying we will be closed until our stay-at-home order expires. one thing my boss said was ""**Currently, XXXX’s is financially sound and we determined we do not have any employees that depend on XXXX’s wages in the next few weeks to make their rent or feed their family.""**  okay, alright that's mostly true because its high schoolers and retired soccer moms i work with...but for me, yeah, i kinda depend on my check! it just seemed pretty tone deaf on her part to add that. 

anyway, i thoroughly enjoyed my time off, it felt like this is what everyone's life should be like. basically i went through a huge awakening where i realized that working for someone else is definitely NOT what i want to be doing with the rest of my life. 

then two weeks ago, i get the dreaded email....we are reopening! i audibly groaned when i read that..groaned even more once i read what my boss sent me, privately.   


*""Hi Coldmoon,*   
*Also, I plan to have you as a “barista” starting out – but would like to have you do the prep for the first hours of the day.  We can discuss more this next week, just wanted to let you know what I’m thinking.""* 

EXCUSE ME, WHAT?!   


so basically, i have returned to work with a paycut but with the same responsibilities i had before... and i know i am the only one who received one, because i asked my coworkers. and it makes sense too, because i am the only one with two ways to clock in...so this was the easiest option for my boss who seems to think she's saving a shit ton of money by doing this.   


i am done. all the loyalty i had to this business, went out the window when i received that email. i know my worth, i am one of her best employees. she has said it herself. and so it just feels very much like manipulation, like she thinks i am loyal enough to stay with her through anything. she thinks she's pulling the wool over my eyes and that i'm none the wiser.   


but I've had it. i don't care anymore. i don't want to make blended caramel mochas for the Karen who refuses to wear her mask inside. fuck coffee, too. i quit drinking caffeine during my time off and it was one of the best decisions i've made.   


since returning, i've never been more repulsed by our customers... people aren't tipping as well because they think that calling in/curbside isn't us ""waiting on them"". people aren't following the distancing rules we've implemented. they aren't wearing masks. some are saying that the preventative measures we've taken are ""too much"". its insane. i don't want to go to work now. i don't feel safe. i feel very exposed and it doesn't help that i feel like this is all for nothing. i am coming to work to risk my life and the lives of my loved ones because some idiot can't go a couple more weeks without their oat milk latte. just fuck right off. we shouldn't be open. point blank period. no cafe should be open right now.  


the service industry isn't for me. my dream is to buy some land, learn to farm and have a self-sustaining property that i can live off of. i've been looking for biodynamic/homesteading courses to take when i finally quit. i really am grateful for the time i had in quarantine, it gave me a whole new perspective.

756,So what's the plan?,"Hey everyone!

I just stumbled upon this wonderful community after some heavy-handed google searching and I've got to say, I am curious to know more.

I posted on here earlier today with a bit of a rant that will give you some insight into my story and where I'm coming from, so I won't repeat myself too much, you can check that post out if you'd like. With that being said, my sheer rage over how the US is handling this pandemic has boiled over, and I feel like my eyes have been opened to how absolutely laughable the state of affairs has become.

The fact that the government tossed a $1200 check in all directions is bad enough, because let's be honest, who can really live on $1200 for an entire month?

I know I can't, and I get paid a bit less than that at my current job. 

I don't see how the American people can be so up in arms over this meager ""stimulis"" check, and in the same breath call us essential workers ""heroes"" when mere months ago, they would've spit in our face for taking too long to make them a god damned hamburger and claimed we don't deserve what little money we are getting paid. 

Now all of a sudden they're all a bunch of kiss-asses because even though they're out of work, at least they can sit on their ass and order a bunch of saturated fats that people like me get to deliver to their doorstep, all the while potentially exposing ourselves to the virus.

And you have the god damned NERVE to thank us? And deem us ESSENTIAL?

We aren't, Karen. What we ARE, is the portion of the population that don't have the luxury of taking leave from our ""essential"" jobs to self-quarantine and ride this thing out. While you complain that $1200 isn't enough for the month, we are paid roughly the same amount WHEN WE'RE WORKING ANYWAY.

I've been running in the rat race for a long while now (probably not as long as most of you, I'm only 23, but every day feels like a year at any crapshoot job I've had) and something is obviously, and visibly wrong with our system.

How do I get out? What's the secret? I don't want to be a rich man, all I need are the essentials, plus some wifi so I can keep making angry posts on the internet like this one.

760,"I’m not lazy, I’m just logical","Lately I’ve been feeling trapped in the cycle that is my life, and it’s gotten me thinking.

Every day, 7 AM, alarm goes off, wake up, get dressed, drive to a job I absolutely hate, come home dead tired, too tired to even enjoy my evening so I end up falling asleep too early, rinse and repeat only to have a $1200 paycheck at the end of the month which doesn’t even cover my essential expenses.

I’ve bounced from shit job to shit job for so long, can’t afford to go to college, and realistically even if I could, I could just as well wipe my ass with the degree. Besides that, I can’t even see myself having a higher paying job that I would enjoy, I just don’t like the concept of working my life away while some fat cat sits on his ass and reaps the benefits, giving me only table scraps, and if I’m not working on something I actually care about, I could care less about the money. I’d rather be broke and happy than rich and miserable.

Don’t get me wrong here, I have a great work ethic when I’m working on something I enjoy. I write music and poetry, I run an online selling business from home on the side, I’m a clean freak around the house and I enjoy things like mowing the grass, doing dishes and keeping my space tidy. 

But these are things that I really like doing, and it gives me a sense of satisfaction with myself when I complete a task that benefits me.


Despite all that, I just don’t see myself enjoying any kind of run-of-the-mill job. I genuinely don’t see how some of the people I work with are so “happy” to be there.

768,Working an office job has made me realize how bullshit these upper-class jobs are,"I worked at a major law firm in a large U.S. city for the last nine months. The work was largely administrative, had awesome benefits, and the job itself was low-stress. 

I should have been happy since my office was downtown and surrounded by skyscrapers. Our office Christmas party was at an upscale restaurant with an open bar. Leaving work to do ""team-building"" activities was the norm. 

But I hated it. My job was the definition of a bullshit job. I had an hour-long commute each way.  My job was largely surrounded by useless (and wasteful!) paperwork and unnecessary spreadsheets. My manager would regularly ""make work"" by scanning years-old papers and invoices and have me file them in folders.

I got laid off yesterday and I only felt relief (I am lucky that I have saved a good amount of money). My family is telling me that I should find another office job, but I seriously dread the idea of working in an office again. I've told them that I'd be much happier working somewhere like a bookstore, or coffee-tea place (I'm a huge tea drinker), art gallery, or movie theatre. They've already balked at it, saying that I didn't get a Masters to do something like that and that I'd be poor and not have insurance.

I don't want to work another day in my life, it's gotten to the point where I've literally considered ending my own life over it because I just can't stand the thought of working the rest of my entire life.

I've had break downs because all I want to do is be happy and I just can't be Happy when working 40 hours a week is a thing in my life

I can't be happy working my entire day, coming home to eat dinner, sleeping and repeating that process Every day until the weekend where I can live a little bit

The worst part is I felt real happiness again for the first time in years about 3 weeks ago when they gave me off for the coronavirus. I woke up everyday with a smile and actually enjoyed life and now I feel like it was stripped away from me. All last week I was back to work and it has really made my entire life worse because after having off work just hurts so much worse.

I don't know what to do anymore... Am I just supposed to suffer for the rest of my life? I don't want to die but I feel like it's really my only escape from this hell.. I just want to be happy and this way we live isn't happiness

I'm 27. It feels like everyone around me is doing OK in terms of work. All of my main friends and family members my age have seemed to find either a career or a decent paying job. I'm still looking for that.

Ever since I was in high school I had no idea of what I wanted to do, and still don't. I have had many aspirations but all my adult life I've been crippled by Anxiety, depression and chronic pain. My anxiety specifically has prevented me from seizing upon several good opportunities in the job market. I don't have any real skills or experience. I have worked service and retail jobs and currently drive a truck and deliver snacks. 

With the way things are looking I will have to settle for a Customer service job or go back to school. I have been dreading the thought of doing either. I really don't like dealing with people all that much and school scares me. I really consider myself to be a smart person, just not booksmart when it comes to hard skills. I've always been a failure in math and sciences, two areas that are very important. I'm at a crossroads where I really don't know what to do. 

I hate working and most of all, I detest work culture especially here in North America. I hate how people judge you based on what work you do. I hate how competitive school and work is to the point where job requirements are laughable. Browsing online I see ads for jobs paying 15 bucks an hour (Canada) but a degree and very specific experience is needed. It's absolute nonsense. 

I guess the main thing that scares me is the perception and my self esteem... Taking a low wage customer service job would be a blow to my self esteem. I'd also be looked down upon constantly and talked down to. I was fine with working at a grocery store in my early 20s but I'm now 27... 



I don't have high standards. I'd be absolutely content with 40k a year salary wise. I currently make close to 50k but I might have to quit soon due to chronic pain issues. All I'd like is a job that pays OK. That's it. I have everything else in terms of a girlfriend, parents, friends, car etc. I live at home and am comfortable. However everything in this world revolves around jobs.. If I don't have a job I lose almost all of that.

I have been out of college about 8 years now, almost 30 years old and I just hate working. I’ve hopped around to so many jobs and have actually experienced gas lighting and emotional abuse from my bosses. I have a job now that for the most part is fine, I have a supportive team for the most part. My boss likes the way I work so she rewards me with more work.

I was let go from my last position and I landed my current job but took almost 2 months off before starting and I felt so good. I felt like I was able to heal and just do projects that I’m interested In. I was living on unemployment which is less than I would bring in but I felt so good. I suffer from severe workplace anxiety.

820,Passion Is Privilege,"I still remember the first time an interviewer asked me the ""passion"" question. Dumbfounded, I stumbled my way through a response, while thinking, ""What do *you* care? I show up, I do what you tell me, you give me money."" Only now have I figured out why the passion angle rankles so. 

When you're growing up on the south side of town, you can only afford to be passionate about not starving to death and not getting shot on your way home from school. Only when you start moving up the Maslow hierarchy can you afford to pursue pastimes unrelated to survival. And that's why the ""passion"" trope grates on me: it's full of coded privilege. 

Asking what someone's passionate about serves two purposes. First, the person must have sufficient means to pursue a passion. Choosing your job for pragmatic reasons signals low SES and limited options and we don't want *those people* here. Let's face it, darling; taking what you can get is *soooo* plebian!

Once you pass that test, the interviewer must now screen for the ""right sort"" of passion. After all, it wouldn't do to have a theater kid hanging out in an office full of classic rock fans, would it now? (This happened to me. I can still remember the interviewer's disappointed, dismissive tone when I told him the last concert I'd attended was given by my favorite Broadway singer.) No, we've got to make sure you're ""one of us,"" that you're ""our type of person.""

The passion trope is really not much more than a way of screening for privilege. I hope that once our economy starts resetting itself, we'll do away with this silly, not to mention discriminatory, practice.",False,gbrev7,broadwayguru,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gbrev7/passion_is_privilege/,3,1

829,"Recalled to work after furlough, do not feel comfortable returning yet[Florida]","I believe florida is reopening too early and I just got a letter that I'm supposed to return to work this week. I'm absolutely dreading the phone call I have to make tomorrow to confirm my return, or to possibly quit.

 As the pandemic was beginning there was pitiful attempts from our part of the company for safety precautions and I would basically be working next to 2 people, probably not even 6 feet apart all day every day like before this started.

What are my options here? I've been furloughed for a month and unsurprisingly never received unemployment benefits, and I seriously don't want to work in that environment right now. I don't want to get sick or get my family sick.

Can a furlough be extended or am I basically screwed out of my job if I don't want to return? I have money in savings to last me a while with my current bills if I quit, but I'd rather just wait longer until it seems safer to return to work. 

To be honest this past month has been the happiest I've been in the past year and a half at this miserable job. I've had much more free time to relax and enjoy my hobbies, spent much more time talking with friends and family and my anxiety and depression issues have improved greatly. Now I'm really worried about what to do and very anxious about tomorrow.

838,Fuck this company specifically.,"For reference: I work for our a subsidiary company of a huge retail brand. I mean huge. We are on strict lockdown at the moment and for the most part essential deliveries are allowed on the road. 

At the start of quarantine, my company sternly said that they will enforce No Work/No Pay and that they won’t allow working from home. I was like ok fuck it then. We left our work at the office and went home. 

A week after, our Mother company changed directive and said that will continue to pay us our salaries and those that will have to work will be given a premium (oh trust me, then can afford this). I was like ok that’s nice of them providing financial help during a crisis. This was all over the news here, “_____ to continue pay their employees during quarantine despite temporarily closing operations”. They got praise. 

I thought, at least there’s still some semblance of redemption since this company is known to be a greedy capitalistic fuck and known for underpaying employees.

A week after, my boss is telling us that we have to work and that we should be grateful that we’re still getting paid because other people are getting laid off and that we should be very well rested. Don’t get me wrong - I am grateful I am getting financial help but wasn’t this supposed to be help? I don’t understand why it’s being thrown at us as if we deliberately just stopped working out of nowhere. 

After strictly saying that there’s no WFH set up, we’re expected to deliver without having our work stuff with us? I raised my concerns and said I only have my old laptop with me so expect limitations on my output. My work heavily relies on paid apps and at least 8GB of RAM - both of which I don’t have.

My boss still continued to give this “you should be grateful” spiel. While I understand that I am considered lucky, I’m just angry that the responsibility of having a strong working computer so I can deliver out of this world output fell on me. They also didn’t offer to at least pay for the app subscriptions. It’s like they just expected me to have it naturally. 

They also are forcing us to work on holidays and at this point, maybe even weekends without clear directive whether or not it will be paid. (I clarified on May 1 being a holiday and got a response that we had a lot of time to rest at the start of the quarantine when we were not working so it’s just very easy, quick math that we should no longer need an extra day of rest).

This continuous emotional attack and force debt of gratitude is driving me nuts... almost as if I’m expected to move mountains for them. A company earning millions in a month, probably even weeks. Me? A lowly shithead who just afforded to open a savings account months ago? I can’t even afford to get a new phone. 

It doesn’t help that my workmates bit the bullet and caved in on the emotional attacks. Now I look like the only one being a hard employee. 

Please tell me I’m not going crazy.

But I was there in the office and just signed the thing...

Now im reading I have to work here another 2x the ammount I had been learning for which in their minds is probably 6 months, so that means I have to work another year here and im stuck and I got major anxiety.

860,Parents are brainwashed by the American work culture. They would rather have me work than be safe and not catch Corona.,"So some background info. I’m a 21 year old guy that still lives with my parents and currently work at a grocery store. I want nothing more than to move out but of course, you can’t support yourself as a grocery store employee but I’m apparently a “hero”. An impoverished hero. Apparently hero’s are only worth 14.50 an hour. Sure I could get my own cheap little apartment (I live in an expensive city) if I do nothing but work but that’s not a life worth living to me. I value my freedom and happiness over everything else. And ever since I can remember my parents have been work horses. Can’t even count the number of holidays my mom missed because of work and my dad routinely works 60 hours a week so we obviously aren’t on the same page on the topic. It always felt like they care more about money than their own kids. 

Anyways, like I said I work at a grocery store and I’m getting worried about catching the virus. I think about quitting every day cuz the risk isn’t worth the reward. The problem is my parents won’t let me quit and “I live under their roof so I have to do as they say”. I’m already someone that can’t stand working bullshit, meaningless, tedious, customer service based jobs so that isn’t helping either. And on top of that, it sucks seeing all these people protesting because they want to work when I don’t want to work and yet I have to. It’s so backwards and really pisses me off. The one time in my life where I would get an opportunity to be unemployed and nobody can say shit about it... and I’m an essential worker. Frustrating as hell. I’m not even a lazy person. I would say I’m the best worker in my department. But the American work culture is inhumane and I really don’t wanna participate at a time like this. At the very least we should be getting
more than the people on unemployment. 

Some people are prolly saying “just quit, fuck what your parents say” but they would have no problem kicking me out. That’s there most common threat towards me and my siblings. Anytime we would do something they don’t like they would always say “you’re lucky we don’t kick you out”. They would say this stuff to us even as kids. It honestly made me stop trusting them and I don’t open to them at all now that I’m an adult. 

I don’t even know what the point of this post is but I need to vent.",False,gdissn,Gooch_Rogers,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gdissn/parents_are_brainwashed_by_the_american_work/,39,1

878,"""she is, for the most part, a good boss.""","my boss tapes people’s mouths
shut during meetings

by ALISON GREEN on EEBRUARY. 45.2020.

A reader writes:

Recently started my first “real” job in a small
office (eight people). He have strategy meetings
every morning for about 30-45 minutes. By boss is
REALLY intolerant of bad ideas. The keeps a tape
dispense on the table by her chair and whenever
someone suggests something that she thinks is
dumb, she will feel off a piece of making tape and
pass it to them, at which point they are required to
put it over their mouths so they cannot contribute
any more “bad” ideas for the rest of the meeting.

Heedless to say, the first time I saw this, I was
shocked! But my workers don’t seem too
gathered by it. Or maybe they just don’t want to
complain, I’m not sure. By boss can be kind scar.

By issue with this is that enforcement of the rule
seems arbitrary. It depends entirely on her mood.
Some days, no one will “get tapped,” but other days,
if she is feeling particularly sour most of us, if not
everyone, will end up “tapped” and the meeting is
just her dictating to us!

Is this normal? I’m thinking not. But does that
make it inherently bad? Is there something I should
do? Other than this idiosyncrasy, it is mostly a
great job and she is, for the most part, a good boss.

Anyway, I asked for time off so I could be there for my friend and my supervisor said no and looked at me like I was an idiot. This was a surprise for me at the time, but I've since learned how unforgiving the working world is about missing work, even if it's not vital. I just think it's so fucked up and it doesn't make any sense. If your best friend or a partner loses a parent, **you have to be there for them.** I don't understand why that's not seen as a legitimate excuse for missing work.

906,(Long rant) All my talents are worthless to the Job Market(TM). Looking for thoughts from people who share my values?,"Sorry, I didn't really know how to title this post. Longtime lurker, but I've been hesitant to reach out to the Internet for some reason. (An odd crippling fear it'd come back to me somehow?) This is going to be kinda disjointed, I just need to get it out and see what happens.

I posted here because I feel all of Reddit's normal ""advice"" channels would just tell me I'm not being practical, wasted a bunch of time, and should pull up my boot straps.

**About me:** I'm between 20-30-something, no degree, live with my wife and her two family members. 

I've worked at a public-facing help desk in Nevada for too many years now. It pays well enough for being a part-time job, but dealing with a very-regularly nutty public has spurred plenty of chronic anxiety/depression over the years. I'm constantly looking for my way out.

The idea was for it to be a stepping stone until I could really figure myself out and establish my own way in life. It's the very definition of dead-end: Because I have no degree, there's literally a hard ceiling directly above me. That's it. 

In real life I'm a 3D artist and studying development on my own, where I've built a number of creative skills over the years, but I'm in this awkward ""valley"" where it seems like none of them are to a level where they are ""worth"" anything! 

Point being, I've always hated this job, but we got lucky in that they continued to pay us while we sheltered in place due to the pandemic. The governor's orders are the only thing holding them back from putting us in danger for ""wave 2.""

At first, it was a total dream! I got to stay home and work on my art as best I could. The hope was that this was all I needed to be up and running. I could get a portfolio and maybe start selling my art so I'd never work in another ""business environment"" again.

""Maybe when they tell me I can come back to work I can just say 'Thanks but no thanks, I'm sure somebody else needs it more than I do. Good luck with that."" ...but I was just fooling myself, I think.

Well, if the lockdown persists past late May, they'll stop paying us. Then comes layoffs and furloughs. I hate this job anyway and I don't want to wait around to be booted to the Unemployment system (which wouldn't be so bad if it weren't completely overloaded right now.)

So, I thought maybe I'd finally get around to putting together my personal website. I'd find a place I could at least deal with working while I figured everything out...but then I realized ""What would I put on it?"" I feel like I have nothing to offer. Like I'm a joke. 

Job searching is the most depressing thing in the world because I feel like I could step up from ""customer service"" and finally put my skills to use, but I'm expected to already be some kind of master. I'm not a ""specialist"" or an ""engineer"" for anything, so what, am I basically doomed until I go from 0 to ""nailed it"" all of a sudden?

I want to make an ""anti-resume"", stating that I'm a sociable polymath looking for an environment to cooperate in, rather than be someone else's ""people product."" But I still feel like I don't have anything ""tangible"" to offer. 

Time's ticking, I simply don't have enough time to ""develop myself as an artist"" and somehow turn that into cash all of a sudden. I would go back to school just to get a ""See? I told you I can do shit."" degree, but my wife is currently in university and that's about all we can manage right now.

If I search for jobs, I come up empty and I just burned a ton of time I could have been building up artwork, but also I'm just too slow at artwork to have a sizable portfolio or catalogue or whatever ready to go.  How the hell do find my voice when I'm constantly up against the wall?

**Basically?**

Nevada's pretty damn unfriendly to co-ops and anarchists by its very nature, seeing as what IS settled  here is basically a capitalist cash-farm colony. I don't know where to escape to, and I don't know how to put my existing abilities to use for support before I'm kicked into another ""service-industry"" hellhole.

What kind of work out there is friendly to fellow anti-corporates?

912,"The work problem and the workplace problem are linked, but they are not the same","I have come to realize, reading some interesting posts in here that I used to mash up two distinct problems: the work problem, and the workspace problem.

 Although they are linked, and they certainly affect us in similar ways, when is Aamir symptom of the other, but more importantly the solutions to the workplace problem do not address the work problem.

I came to realize that as an advocate of freelancing I was misled and misleading people. Freelancing is a solution to the workplace problem: it addresses the problems of having a manager, being accountable for the time spent on whatever activity, having to go to places, being told at what time to eat, go to the office, and go home.

It doesn’t address the fact that the vision of the future used to be one without work thanks to automation, increased efficiency, the better understanding of our needs and our environment. It doesn’t address the fact that while we are enjoying those progresses, through the concentration of wealth, work hasn’t been made somethings one freely chooses to do come out with something we all need to fight for in order to sustain ourselves and meet our basic needs.

I do not have a solution. Just felt like the honest move on my part to say out loud what my conscience stumbled upon.

I wish us all good luck, and to keep being compassionate even when we feel enraged.",False,ge9q29,ProfessionalSuccess4,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ge9q29/the_work_problem_and_the_workplace_problem_are/,0,2
