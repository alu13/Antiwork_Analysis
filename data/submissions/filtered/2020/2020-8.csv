11,"Capitalism sucks, y'all.",as a followup from my previous posthttpswwwredditcomrantiworkcommentsih9lbnijustgotfiredasanamazondriver id like to say that payroll can be at least as bad as working my gf and i were recently employed by the same amazon delivery service provider hereafter dsp but she transferred to another dsp shortly before i got canned we both got emails from our former dsp on august 28th about an issue with adp saying that direct deposit would come through within 48 hours it hasnt yet been 48 hours as i write this but she got paid and im wondering why i didnt when we both have direct deposit set up possibly the 4912 hours i clocked last week but i dont know for sure the email did say that paper checks would be sent out within 24 hours but i really dont want to wait a week for my money im not saying anything is malicious on any side but it is at the very least fairly suspicious  couple that with the fact that i spent almost 300 on books and uniforms for the coming fall semester nursing school ftw and that was after 1000 in school bookstore credit plus the fact that i had to go downtown to the main campus to get the supplies when theres a campus close enough for me to walk if im feeling really ambitious which is where id taken all my previous classes and i hope you can understand why im pissed  the only saving grace is that classes and clinicals this semester are all virtual because of the pandemic though i remember hearing something about inperson clinicals later in the semester  sorry for the rant i didnt know where else to post this,ij1sfz

15,Fuck these shifts (rant),working retail i get how your weekends are non existent and you can work 7 days straight to only get a day off they cant give me two days off in a row but give me a break with these hours people  these shifts arent necessarily horrible ive done clopens before where you work 2pm10 and then come in the next day at 5am but the 2pm10 one day and the 8am4 the next day is one of the stupidest things at least with the clopens i know im getting fucked i know when i get home from clopens i know i wont get my 8 hours so i can take my time doing my home duties  these 2pm10 and 8am4 give me just enough time to get home cook eat water my plants brush my teeth and immediately go to sleep  i have to speed run my few precious hours off of work in order to get the basic home chores before going to bed because my manager doesnt know how to make a decent schedule   but even if i do get in bed at record time i start to think with the current 16 hours of work i only have 2 hours of free time and i spend the next 3 hours tossing in turning in anger because how fucked im getting   but then i realized i can call out so i did i get a strike and if i do it another two times ill get a write up but im okay with that i think i might call out again tomorrow for shits this job has controlled my life more than the virus has and it feels good to just do what  i want for once  wall of text i know but im here right now drinking some coffee and chatting with my brother when i should be at work doing a shift i dont like and if i feels great,iib4jx

58,Stop working.,stop quit your job stop working for whoever you work for be reasonable though if you are caring for dying patients or giving immediate food to people who need it then you may not need to leave altogether but at the very least you should resign from the formalities and culture of working under a boss just to follow every restrictive rule and demand they make to make sure you obey them ie working hours when you arent actually doing anything at the job that day strict dress code that dont have to do with safety or being inappropriately nude   we all need to do this and once its done we need to make our focus tasks that actually matter  what the world needs is a change in the way we consume energy we need to work on access to power for everyone using renewable energy when we all have the electrical power we need we as individuals can become more autonomous we will no longer pretend to work meaningless jobs so that we can pay for oldfashioned forms of energy once we have energy we can make everything ourselves   lets all stop working today and bring attention to renewable energy so that we become autonomous,ijel07

128,I sometimes feel guilty and untalented about not wanting to turn my passions into full time jobs,the title says it all i always viewed creativitypassion as a sweet escape from the boring everyday life i am forced to live working 11 hours a day or less occasionally thankfully thanks to school math science and physics tutors and homework i was forced to do a thing i hated or at least did not like that much for most of my day and then came home finished the rest of it and did what i wanted i dont want any advice in this thread i just want to hear someone elses experiences because i am feeling depressed numb and hopeless filled with despair i have severe mental health issues caused by bullying shunning school and extreme homework hours its been like that for three years but things were so much better before 2020 started to a point where my problems were somewhat managable and limited   anyway so i like creating but how on earth am i still expected to enjoy doing it for 8 hours a day every day how on earth am i supposed to not get sick of it why do people think that the things we adore can always be fullfilling full time careers for us i would not mind a part time career related to the things i love i want to be a part time author for example  sometimes i feel like a hypocrite for not wanting to do the things i enjoy full time they are the loves of my life what on earth would i do without them but the idea of doing them for 8 hours a day makes me feel sick in the stomach and i often work on projects for more than three hours because i genuinely enjoy it but why does any sane person do the thing they love for 40 hours a week do they just deal with it because the idea of working a normal job and having less time for their passion scares them   sometimes i feel like my art is less important like my talent is nonexistent and like i shouldnt even bother to create to begin with if i am not gonna turn this to a full time job like i am worthless compared to those who do it for 8 hours a day but isnt it more mentally healthy to do what you  like for a limited amount of hours a day instead of esentially having your life revolve around it if i want to create something i dont even need a boss to help me with it i can film a whole choreography without even leaving my bedroom thats what the internet is for   i have a cartoonistanimator friend who has similar feelings towards his work he says he just wants to become a doctor and that he will hate his passion if he starts getting money for it a painter friend of mine started selling her work or doing orders for clients and she started hating her art now she also has a condition in her wrists that prevents her from painting   why on the fucking planet is doing something even something you love for so long many artists such us ballerinas work for more than 8 hours considered normal and healthy i know a pro dancer whose feet bruised occasionally bc of too much practice that imo is not neccecary for a good quality play and even if it did impove the quality humans above ideas mental health above all everything in moderation   if i watched tv or read books for 8 hours a day i would be called addicted or mentally unstable and rightfully so how is this any different for work or even art   find a job youll love is not the solution for everyone is anyone else sickened by the idea of doing their passion for 8 hours a day of their whole life revolvin around it i would love to be serious about it and i am 100 gonna go semipro some day and i wont give up or even retire until the day of my death but 8 hours is too much even for me,ijwnzc

245,Thoughts on CDL Trucking,as you all know i am not much of a people person most people like to carry on by their business and make money  and i believe cdl or any industry related that involves with driving seems to be a job that would work best for most majority of people   reason being its because you get to spend most of your time practically alone and by yourself enjoying the countryside and less drama with office politics too i have never taken cdl but would like to try it sometimes but share me your experiences if it seems like its the only job that you dont have to deal with people on a daily basis,ihugdh
246,RANT - I really hate the people at r/massage and I hate most massage therapists!!,im so sick of the massage industry in my state california continuing education is not required to renew the massage certificate most clients like 999 of the time dont give a flying shit about anything other than swedish and deeptissue which i am pretty proficient at i have been licensed and certified for about 6 years now i used to have tons of passion for massage when i was in massage school and also the first year i was licensed but getting a hand injury really put a damper in it im not qualified to do anything else and i would rather kill myself than work in retail or restaurants again i went to massage school first and foremost to get me the fuck out of retail and foodservice jobs i also went to massage school because i wanted to move out of my parents house lord forbid somebody goes into a job because they need more money a lot of massage therapist think that people should not get into the industry unless they are super passionate about massage i cant fucking stand that i dont relate with any other massage therapist except for maybe one who is this really chill cool ass girl who i have been friends with for a few years she admits she hates massage and she hates the industry and so she went back to school for esthetician and laser hair removal she likes that much more than massage but anyway  so i go in the massage reddit and i asked if people can give me recommendations for the cheapest medical massage continuing education course so that i can practice massage legally in my state with the covid19 regulations massage is not deemed as an essential service which honestly it is not an essential service theres people who go their whole lives without a massage it is not essential i will admit that but the state does recognize medical massage as essential   one person actually gave a good recommendation and all the other losers told me that i shouldnt choose the cheapest continuing education class because i touch people for a living  and i should put more care into my education i dont really give a fuck dude i give a damn good massage but once they are off of my table i dont really care about them anymore 90 of the clients in this industry will never ever rebook most of the clients you will only see once literally   but anyway thats just one situation most of the spas that i have worked at consisted of other massage therapists who were extremely pompous and thought they were gods gift to the healing arts they all think that they are way smarter than they are even though 99 of them are completely science and math illiterate theyre obsessed with talking about toxins being released even though there has been absolutely no scientific research on fucking toxins being released from muscles after a massage i mean im huge into new age stuff and im extremely spiritual but i know that a lot of things in the healing arts are really just a bunch of fucking quackery and hocus pocus   i really just cant stand all these motherfuckers i went to massage school so that i could do massage in the meantime of going back to school to get a biochemistry degree so that i can have a real job and a real career making real money because of the stupid economy this massage career is lasting a little longer than i would have wanted it to it has taken me a really long time to get going back to junior college   the frankly i used to have a lot of passion for a massage but i havent for a long time and i shouldnt be judged or penalized for that sorry but i do massage for the fucking money ive been doing this long enough to know how the clients are and the fact that a lot of male clients are just fucking perverts and that you really cant make a lot of money doing massage its also too easy to get injured,ihv2x6

248,My Manager stopped caring about safety.,i am a cashier at goodwill over the last few months we have had a hardline policy on masks and people without masks whenever weve had people without masks weve kicked them out unless they said they specifically had a medical condition in the case of them having a medical condition we have offered them a face shield which has no effect on breathing ability because as a team we have decided that regardless of what corporate wants we will prioritize the safety of our customers and workers over peoples convenience we do not listen to conspiracies or bullshit lying by right wing assholes well today we have had two occasions where someone has come in without a mask refused to wear a face shield and actively walked within 6 feet of people first was a man who was kicked out one month ago for this exact issue he had previously said he had no medical issue didnt feel like wearing a mask and went on an insane rant about how we were all sheep now he walks freely and is not kicked out cause he suddenly has a medical issue he purposefully walked by fellow coworkers and customers after being told he needed to stay six feet away and was never punished despite my manager being told by me and other coworkers that he was violating our policy he also had a ridiculous unibrow but that is beside the point next was a man i personally had the displeasure of having to deal with i walked up to him once i noticed him and asked him if he had a mask he said no and i told him it was required he said he didnt care i offered a face shield just to get him covered and he said no i went to management and they came out they told him he needed a mask and he said no my manager asked me to open my till to ring him up since he was already at the registers i opened up and when he came up he said he didnt have a medical condition and didnt stay behind the plastic barrier i got mad threw up my closed sign and said i would not ring him up he then said really you need to watch less tv at me and i told him i did not care i would not help him then my manager began ringing him up told him he could not come in again without a mask all while ringing him up he then said he would keep coming back without a mask because he didnt wear one anywhere he then said we were rude and walked out this sets a dangerous standard other people will learn by watching that if they dont want to wear a mask they dont have to because our management is to afraid to piss someone off too afraid to miss out on seven dollars  im looking for a new job fuck this corporate bullshit,ihyddi
249,Being sent home because a few mins late,about 3 weeks ago a few cow workers and i were sent home because we were a few mins late let me start off by saying it was my first time being late to work im almost two years im always at work roughly 115 mins early everyday i do this because i dont like to rush in and it gives me time to mentally prepare for the day  i was up that night until 2 am because of a tooth ache that did not matter to him so this morning about 3 guys call and say they are going to be late he tries to call us all together and vote if they should come in or not i told him thats his responsibility and it wasnt a democracy when i was sent home im so fucking mad right now dont tell me to go home and its only fair because hes doing it across the board then try to get us all together and vote on it thats your call dude dont try to make us look like the bad guy its horse shit i for real am stuck between flipping out on him or going home maybe both,ihisha
250,I'm so curious about this sub and the opinions of those here.,hi rantiwork ill introduce myself i am udiamondrake and have been lurking this sub for a little while ive got a few questions to ask about your mindset when i say your mindset i mean the users of the sub and not rantiwork as a whole i can and did read the sidebar i hope a post like this is allowed if not take er down  ampx200b  ill just list some questions and if i could get your opinion on someallnone of them id genuinely love that  do you workhave a job currently do you like that job do you think you are treated fairly at your job   ampx200b  knowing you had no necessities eating sleeping etc to provide for what would you change about your current lifestyle  ampx200b  how would providing for necessities work without work  ampx200b  what is important to you jobwisegoalwise  ampx200b  what is your ideal society  ampx200b  ill start so maybe this sparks conversation wish we just had a big convention center to just chat in aaanyway i have a job and i like my job i work at a large chain auto parts store at the counter i do like my job the people i interact with a generally good people looking to save a buck over taking their car to the shop i believe that for the skill requirement for my position i am treated fairly im not asked to do much outside of my job description and get along with my coworkers however it is fair pay if i only did what was required of the job be a robot that sells auto parts i put quite a bit into the job compared to how i am compensated this isnt because i am expected to but because i want to and ill get back to that in a minute  ampx200b  i was raised pretty traditionally i feel extremely lucky to be in the situation i amwas my parents are still together and were great parents i wasnt spoiled as a kid but never had to worry if i was going to eat that night im currently married and at university and loving learning so you can say i followed a pretty traditional path  ampx200b  heres where i come into what spurred me to make this post i place high value on hard work i hate the feeling of not having anything to do in a day how do you deal with the feeling of a day gone by without having done anything do you have sad feelings or is that just not a thing with you there are some days where i have nothing scheduled and i get chomping at the bit for anything i always look forward to my days off until its the actual day and i have nothing to do just play video games until my wife gets home then watch a few episodes of avatar until my eyes are on fire i try scheduling things for my days off to put in place of my time off from my job ill find more maintenance to do on my carsbike ill clean out whole apartment ill crave that sense of fulfillment from doing work until i get it that day i pretty much dislike vacations unless i can find some way to satisfy that feeling do you have that feeling of accomplishment with work even if that work is a job   ampx200b  i am pretty individualistic so your business isnt my business unless you share it with me i see a lot of posts saying someone would rather die than work which is interesting and raises the question of what is stopping you from living that dream wondering what stops people from becoming vandwellers is it fear of the unknown responsibilities toward others do you enjoy the things brought to you by work such as technology or homes or cars or would you prefer to be like a nomad just scavenging enough to survive and exploring around  ampx200b  my ideal society is one where everyone has common morals everyone is there to help each other not by force or because its the law but just because they choose to i support a free market but i wish people werent greedy i wish those who had extra would choose to give to those who dont have enough however obviously this is the real world and people are what they are  ampx200b  so what are your thoughts,igtz8a

258,i finally quit (but i'm so upset),so i 20f have been working at this coffee shop diner for almost a year and a half its a pretty busy spot and theres usually only 4 employees working at a time so it can get pretty intense   now i love this job ive been working since i was 13 and this was my favorite its crazy and awful and chaotic and insane but i love it so much i have my regulars and my chores and routines and i get all the coffee i want   the owner is the worst though shes super intense and just straight up mean she makes it an effort to scare away the weaklings so shes super mean to the new employees it was really bad when i started the others said they thought id be gone for sure   i stuck it out ended up being one of the only fulltime worker for 6 months and became the 2nd employee to be crosstrained then covid happened and i helped run the show  with the owner and manager and one other employee for the entirity of our shutdown 25months i went on unemployment for only 23 weeks and was one of the first employees to return   the owner and i had been on better terms before covid when we were only doing curbside she started getting aggressy with me again asking me if i even wanted to be there telling me i was doing everything wrong telling me that the water leaking from the faucet that she neglected to get fixed was my raise going down the drain have never recieved a raise to this day etc things calmed down again when we reopened for dinein and some of the other employees came back as the manager noticed and made the schedule so the owner and i would never have to see each other   today she calls me and starts bitching about last nights close i didnt even close last night for the record the last day i closed was sunday and i was training someone in so i was supposed to let her do most of it she says i thought we were done with this its really not that hard you have 3 days your scheduled next week and i dont wanna be babysitting when manager leaves in a couple months its not fair to the rest of the employees blah blah blah   i messaged the manager right after hanging up and told her i was done ill finish out my 2 weeks but if the owner says one more thing to me im out im going to fill out applications today i deserve better which is saying a lot because i am a huge fucking doormat   im just so annoyed and everyones like its a really hard job you did your best in that condescending way the job isnt that hard i mean ive been working 3 positions simultaneously this week and its hard but its not impossible and i love it i just hate that everyone assumes i couldnt handle it like its not that fucking hard the owner is just a massive cunt   anyways im going to be reporting the owner she never pays on time tries to skimp out on paychecks and verbally assaults her employees all while running off to her timeshare in the bahamas every 2 months meanwhile i cant pay my rent because she doesnt feel like filling out our paychecks and even when she does i usually have to get it corrected because she somehow missed the entire back side of my timecard plus theres probably a whole bunch of technically illegal shit going on in there let alone things that could get her business license revoked im usually not one for vengeance but this woman is a fucking monster and im sure shes gonna be dragging my name through the dirt for a while so might as well,ighxvf

262,Can we talk about how work under capitalism destroys intelligence and free thinking?,i truly think mediasocial media is a convenient tool for capitalism in that it further reduces our ability to do meaningful work as in we work day in and day out doing meaningless soulless jobs that dont satisfy even a fiber of our beings we come home exhausted and even for those of us still lucky enough to have creative or meaningful hobbies were so damn tired that we just sit our asses in front of youtube or facebook or reddit engaging our brains in easytodigest more meaningless content that slowly rots our brains to the point that we crave instant gratification at all times this further robs us of the ability to engage in meaningful workhobbies because were a too tiredexhausted to under capitalism and b our attention spans have been ruined due to social media and the like  and i truly think this works in capitalisms favor the more people are engaged with meaningless drivel the less time they spend engaging in meaningful hobbies that humans are actually designed for activities that can actually stimulate the mind and allow you to broaden the scope of your thinking so you go through life completely ignorant of how shitty the world is under capitalism because you literally dont have the energy or the time to critically think anymore,igq9i2

Why do most humans choose to waste their lives in an office, when there is the whole world to explore?",our time is limited in this earthwe are born and educated in a way that brainwashes us to believe in the social norms whilst i believe in a few of these i find many social norms to be absolutely bs for example i believe that the whole idea of power government social status etc is ridiculous why spend our lives trying to prove we are better than others but anyway another social norm i find bs is working as i said we get to experience this earth for a limited time why waste away most of our existence at a desk people say get a job you like but even if you do get a job you like are you really living or are you just getting by to live life i believe you should focus on real natural experiences such as travelling and being with family i wonder how our ancestors would react if they saw the way the majority lives now this is life as we are brainwashed to live it  we are told to work hard in education in order to get a good job we are told to get a good job as it gives us money the majority of people spend 80 of their lives in the cycle of work with the exception of holidays and weekends that leaves the 20 of your life when you are old and tired and probably cant even remember your name to live life great i cannot comprehend how everyone seems to succumb to this bullshit as if its normal and what we are supposed to do im only 17 i havent even started working yet and im already in disbelief to how stupid this system we live in is and why does the world seem to comply to it anyone get what im saying,ie56px

291,"[Rant] I've been given a bullshit ""golden opportunity"" with our company exec",at my job we have these employee relations type people its a non paying opportunity where as well as your regular job you also need to canvas the office get opinions from people in how theyre feeling and feed it back by feed it back i mean come up with bullshit excuses for the negative feedback and really hype the positive because as i found out peoples feedback directly effects my performance at reviews which is very fair  unfortunately i drew the golden shit ticket so im one of these lucky few i came into work to an email today from my boss who very excitedly told me my next relationsions meeting will have our company exec attending see every few months he comes down from his golden throne to pat us workers on the head and say good job  im being told that this is my chance to really shine and impress so i asked my boss out right whats the incentive for me to shine her only answer was a pissy the exec will see how hard you work so i pushed her some more and asked about actual tangible rewards and she told me my attitude wont get very far i should be doing this because im passionate about my job  this really fucked me off im a data auditor for an insurance company who the fuck is passionate about auditing  i know have to churn out a presentation for a guy who does not give a shit about me or the work i do and will most likely forget my name as soon he leaves room  im essentially a dancing monkey putting a show for a guy who makes more a month than ill ever see in my life time he got a 10 mil bonus last year and my reward is a good job  the worst part is the other employee relations people are excited to meet him why hes not going whisk you away in his diamond encrusted chariot if you impress him hes going to feign interest and then rush home as quick as possible to shower the poor off of him,id61bj

293,I’m feeling particularly anti-work today, i am sad because of the world i have been born into i am sad because to live i need to work most of my life away from my people i care about most i would be much happier if i could spend my every waking hour with the one i love but no instead we have to both come home from work stressed at our worst selves instead of being the loving happy people we usual are on breaks from work we are trying to make our own business so we can spend more time together however we need money to start a business we have soo many ideas and every time we get money a new bill comes up  council tax fine water bills insurance  the worst part is that the poorer you are the poorer you get as for example when you cant afford to pay your council tax bill which is around 120 per month they tell you that you need to pay 1400 upfront and obviously now you cant pay that so they throw court bills on top of that to fuck your over even more people tell you to that you are lucky to have a job lucky for what for pay that doesnt even allow me to live only to be pushed around like a farm animal then youre told that youre poor because you dont work hard enough im sorry that i cant work harder when i already have no fucking life to begin with the annoying part is that starting a business is the only way to go and if feel that you need to be born into money for the most part to start one successfully  sorry for the long post im just venting as i felt particularly strongly about this issue today  i hope we can all find a way out of the system where we can live happily without giving our life up to be a clog in a machine ,idfinm

311,Having a really shitty day at work,this is probably gonna be a long post but i promise the excitement picks up at the end also on mobile so of course sorry alright this literally just happened to me and i had to tell someone it was just all so ridiculous and unbelievable here goes so lets preface this by saying one i almost never shit myself and two im actually a pretty hard worker when there is work to be done you give me a task ill do it especially one that makes sense to me and needs doing i start getting anti work because no managerboss gives tasks like that   ive worked full time since i was 17 years old to support myself and through the years have just become more and more disillusioned with having to do this but i gotta make ends meet so right now im working as a janitor for a university because im diabetic and need insurance in a union over the summer i have been cleaning student apartments top to bottom to have kids move in i was working my ass off for months anywhere from 48 full sized apartments that were typically left disgusting because college kids lived there but i got it done in fact i was getting compliments from higher ups at how good i was getting it done like i said if there is a job that needs doing ill do it even if i dont like it   cut to lately finished every single apartment on campus my boss kind of forgot i was over there normally i work in a dorm and so for the past 2 weeks or so i have been at same apartments with nothing to do with all the apartments cleaned there arnt a whole lot of areas left just some hallways to vacuum and a very small lobby and laundry room all in all to completely clean all that takes about 45 min my shifts are 8 hours first couple days i honestly tried to stretch it out to last even called to ask if there was more i could be doing nope keep the apartments clean so here i am with literally nothing to do   another important fact is despite having cars were supposed to drive on campus i take my personal vehicle cause i like going home for my lunch break just makes it easier so then it hits me i have nothing to do so ill just go home so for the past 2ish weeks ive had an amazing time at work i clock in get my shit done in about an hour or a little more im in no rush now then i literally just drive home because if my options are sit and twiddle my thumbs at work or go home im taking door number 2 its been amazing id make myself nice lunches watch tv take a lot of naps all on the clock at one point i even went and got a haircut during my shift another i slept through going back to clock out and ended up getting paid overtime the ideal situation for an anti work person right but all good things must come to an end   yesturday i got a call from my boss while i was at home demanding where i was it was about an hour and a half after my lunch break was supposed to end and she was saying shes here and wheres my car and where am i i am a bad liar at the best of times so i mumbled well im on the way rushed back over to get chewed out assured her i just lost track of time that day she told me i was no longer allowed to drive my personal vehicle which was always technically the rule and that she was gonna have to drive me to the apartments theres 2 different buildings and pick me up i sighed and said alright actions have consequences and i knew my luck wouldnt last forever   so today first day im being babysat i get dropped off at first apartment which only has a laundry room the laundry room has no bathroom just a small janitor closet with a sink and cleaning supplies and washersdryers she gave me about an hour and a half till she said she was coming to get me and like i said i can finish this laundry room in 510 min i clean it everyday its not dirty so i was actually feeling kinda good like oh ya ill just knock this out and sit around play on reddit whistling along cleaning away another important fact was i had 2 cups of coffee this morning i wanted to be awake for dealing with this bullshit babysitting   coffee always makes me shit i had to go as soon as i started but figured id just hold it out till we got to second apartment with a bathroom i do hate not being able to go to the bathroom when i want at work though but im still feeling alright things arent too bad had a pressing fart no one is there its early i figure hey ill let some pressure out like i said i havnt shit myself since i was a literal toddler but that all ended today out it came i confidently squeezed out a fart and a heavy rush of warm diarrhea came out instead immediate panic i waddle over to closet and close and lock door i drop my pants to assess the damage its bad its really bad step out of pants and underwear now just butt ass naked at work with my dick hanging out at this point i kind of laugh at how ridiculous this all is and think i guess ill have to just throw the undies away wipe with a rag and water and go commando   thats when i remember i have had the same pair of work pants for several years i wear my work clothes till you can physically not wear them anymore this particular pair has a large rip that covers basically the entire crotch never cared before coworkers made fun of me but id just wear sliders no big deal its a big deal when those very same underwear are now covered in diarrhea because you a grown man just shat yourself panic again i cant go commando i have to drive around with boss she sits right next to me could glance over and see my dick and balls hanging through pants oh no normally id just drive home real quick and laugh about and whatever not today my car is miles away   realization is slowly setting in but im looking for other solutions i attempted to make a sort of diaper out of some rags no good time is ticking away before my boss with keys comes a calling had this happened any day earlier it would have been totally cool but today i did what had to be done i strapped some gloves on covered my underwear in cleaning supplies and did my best to hand wash it in sink im sitting here butt naked squeezing shit out of my underwear as best i can not so happy to be at work anymore i do the best i can attempted to dry them with a rag and slid my wet semi dirty underwear back on desperate times call for desperate measures i got all the shit rags i had used to wipe and clean up with and threw away the evidence got picked up and no one was the wiser besides a comment about slight smell   but i know i just shit all over myself and cant even change because i am contractually obligated to be here for 8 hours they determine when i can and cant have access to bathrooms they determine when i go home and when i cant i am so sick of shitty ass work thank you for reading all this if youve made it this far hope

340,Getting fired from a toxic job made me change my priorities,i just graduated college in may my senior year i was working in my first big girl job it made me feel really accomplished that i was working in industry while still in school but honestly it was horrible i was scared to eventually move to a full time position there because all of my coworkers were insanely overworked and everyone i talked to hated it there also in the span of a year that i was there i saw our office go from 35 to 20 people all of those were people who quit i never really understood what a toxic work environment was until i started there i cried every single day at work due to coworker pettiness and frustration because i was given little training and a lot of responsibility i was promised i would be given a full time position once i graduated but instead a few days after i graduated they told me my position was eliminatedthey told me it was nothing against me i think budget cuts because of covid but said if you see were hiring you should totally apply yeah right even though i knew i wasnt planning on staying i was devastatedthe job market is rough but especially so for new grads but with all this time off my mental health has been a million time better and its really made me rethink my priorities ive decided to take some art classes because this is something ive always wanted to learn also ive started a side business with my sister where we sell vintage items i did actually just get a new job its part time and low stress i will never give my all to a company again because ive learned the hard way that they really dont give a damn what happens to you,if5tng

346,"People who don’t want a solution, they just want to complain",anybody work with somebody like this i do and it drives me nuts she clearly gets a lot of satisfaction out of complaining about how stressed and anxious she is because she does it a lot  i mean almost daily its so difficult to be around she also will repeat it several times during the same conversation  as in i am so stressed and anxious its so busy it makes me so stressed and anxious its just so stressful its not unusual for her to make back to back to back statements about that or to go into detail about just how stressed she is  she is not stupid nor have i been quiet about my distaste for such statements so its clear that shes doing it willfully despite knowing that the effect shes having is to dump her anxiety and stress on others she wants others to be as upset as she is and makes it her mission  whats most frustrating is that when she is presented with a solution to a certain problem that is bothering her she has no interest whatsoever in said solution she becomes haughty and irritated and totally ignores or dismisses out of hand the solution in effect she is not interested in lessening her burden  shes only interested in talking about how burdened she is i have talked to my boss about her behavior and he has agreed that it is very annoying and causes discord together we have tried several angles to get her to stop doing this but nothing ever works because shes incapable of admitting that shes her own worst enemy my boss isnt willing to fire her over this she does decent work perhaps its immature of me but i wish he would  thats my rant,idjc70

356,Shady shit from an employer I had an interview with last week,with my extra 600 ending on my unemployment and only getting 300week i decided i needed to look for some worn i saw an ad for a job that paid 16hour and i got a call back for that job after i sent them my resume on indeed at the interview there were so many red flags though first the 16hour was only after 90 days the first 90 days was paid at minimum wage but they said if you stay past 90 days then theyll retro your pay rate my thought process is why not just pay me the rate youre advertising then after they mentioned that strange policy i asked if there was an issue with high turnover and if they had many people not lasting more than 3 months they didnt really want to answer that question it makes me wonder if theyll just fire you before the 90 days so avoid paying over minimum wage they offer little to no training for their property systems which was rather unusual i held an ace in my sleeve though when it came to my acceptance of the job i didnt fill out their application and since i never gave them an actual application i can honestly say i didnt refuse a job in my unemployment certification   oh and to top things off this company is one of them who sent it people to lansing bitching about how the extra unemployment benefits is hurting them fill all their open positions its not the extra unemployment that was stopping them from finding people to work for them its the shady shit with only 9hour but well pay you the remainder in a lump sum after 90 days of employment,iep7aw
357,It feels like my coworkers are brainwashed...,so at my company we have these roughlyquarterly meetings with our directors these meetings are half qampa half presentation on how well the company is doing i was not surprised at all during the meeting to find out that our productivity was down given that we moved all of our staff to workathome rather than having people come into the office but who cares right numbers are down big deal     monthly i attend meetings with a team of people who escalate concerns of our peers to our teams of supervisors and directors the meeting started with the topic of our productivity not being tracked correctly for about half an hour people swapped personal anecdotes about how their work has a large amount of variety and thus its impossible to report their true productivity so they want something done to show their productivity more accurately     at this point i chime in and the conversation proceeds as follows  ampx200b  me why does it matter if your productivity isnt reported accurately  group well its just not accurate it should be made more accurate  me well sure it should be more accurate but why do you personally want it to be more accurate are your supervisors telling you that youre not doing enough work  group no they say that were doing fine its just that we have a lot of assignments and its difficult to complete all of them  me okay so you feel like youre being given too much work  group no i dont feel like were being given too much to do its just we have a lot of work that isnt getting done maybe if our productivity was more accurate we would hire more people to get everything completed in a timely manner  me but why do you care if were getting everything done in a timely manner its not like youre being forced to complete extra work to make up for a lack of bodies  group right but our directors say our productivity is low so we need to adjust how our work is being reported so our productivity is higher  me but you say your supervisors have no issues with your productivity as is right now and its not like our directors are breathing down our necks trying to get us to work faster so why do you care about our collective productivity what is there to worry about  at this point the few people who have their webcams on seem visibly exasperated one person delivers this next line in a way that makes it seem like its their final say after much deliberation  person we need our productivity to be tracked more accurately so we can more easily set goals to increase our productivity the company wants our productivity to be higher so thats what we want too we want to make our goals align with the companys goals  others in the group agree with this person that this is what they meant by saying they want our productivity to be tracked in a better way here the moderator for the meeting cuts us off and abruptly introduces another topic     i was completely dumbfounded after figuring out the reason for this impassioned debate to me it still seemed like a bad reason if our productivity goes up we gain nothing we dont get paid more and if our collective productivity goes down we lose nothing the company doesnt go around docking pay and they certainly dont start firing individuals because of the company not meeting a certain goal  plus if our productivity increases that just causes directors to move the goalpost our directors will literally always say they want us to do more work more and work better at no point will they ever stop us and tell us that were being too productive so increasing our collective productivity is pointless as it will never stop our directors from asking for more  i dont think ill ever understand why i was the only person to speak up and try to define a goal or reason for wanting to increase our productivity but i think the team i meet with resents me for it how  dare i suggest that were doing fine right the word stagnate was getting thrown around a lot i seemed to be the only one who accepted the idea of our productivity reaching a plateau while everyone else apparently wants to do more and more  for the company,ie0upw

363,People on this sub need to be realistic about their expectations and also look at their own behaviour and attitude towards society,i believe that one day technological automation will reach the point where all of our necessities food running water shelter etc are provided supplied and maintained without human interaction a world where our logistical medical and agricultural needs are all streamlined and automated   unfortunately were not there yet   our society still requires a hell of a lot of human labour people are required to grow package and ship food people are required to build and maintain houses and the facilities those households need people are required to build and service our cars people are required to look after our sick and elderly people are required to maintain and update every website and entertainment platform you browse and to secure and maintain the data centres that theyre hosted upon for society to function we need a hell of a lot of man hours  if you want to work part time at a dead end job thats completely fine you just cant expect to be able to reap the same benefits from society of those who put in more hours at a higher skilled job do you not find it hypocritical to expect to be able to live in a house built and maintained by workers drive a car built and serviced by workers enjoy food grown packaged and shipped by workers go to shops and restaurants and be served by workers but not want to work yourselves  while were on the subject of hypocrisy lets talk about wealth inequality its no secret that our capitalistic society has a massive wealth inequality problem its awful that we live in a world that has billionaires with private jets and super yachts whilst simultaneously having people dying of starvation and exposure im sure youll all agree with this lets get to the hypocritical part  lots of you will happily complain about wealth inequality while simultaneously buying products from companies which perpetuate this inequality youll complain about what a hard life you have working 40 hours per week but will happily buy nike trainers and iphones even though youre well aware that theyre the products of child labour i understand that necessities such as food must be purchased regardless of ethicality but designer clothes and smart phones are far from necessities  then lets look at how antilandlord and anticorporation lots of you are youll complain about landlords who often just own a single extra property and small business owners who have a couple of employees but youll happily pay into a bank account which generates interest an isa 401k or pension scheme how the fuck do you think these systems generate money by pooling your cash together and investing in stocks and properties  i like the idea of this sub i like the idea that one day well work less and everyones needs will be met what i dont like is how many of you are simply uneducated hypocrites,idfn0j

366,Real freedom is incompatible with Capitalism,thats why many countries are so big on freedom propaganda   most people have literally no say in the way they live their lives they are going to be employees for someone no matter what they are like or want to do with their lives they will be taking part in one particular type of economic system even if they disagree with how it works there will never be any sort of choice or freedom in the matter   its honestly impressive how well economic and political propaganda work people actually think freedom implies waking up everyday to work against their will in exchange for things they shouldnt of been deprived of in the first place   freedom implies having the freedom to live as one chooses whereas under capitalism you are forced to take part in employer  employee relationships no matter what that is not freedom,idr08c
367,Highly Recommended Reading!,i was at the library last week when a title caught my eye  the freedom manifesto by tom hodgekinson  its been an entertaining read the author details sentiments similar to those i find on this sub from the evils of capitalism its roots in puritanism and the free ways of medieval peoples  he ties it into permaculture which is an interest of mine and i believe it may be an interest many of you share being a manifesto he proposes many ideas while he doesnt detail exact methods he backs up his suggestions with examples and sources alongside his own personal experiences  while it may not be totally new information i have found it satisfying to watch as someone else connects the same dots i have and proposes a few more points i hope some of you will enjoy it too  feel free to ask me any questions about the nature of the book,ido1ll

375,Idleness as a path to a more sustainable way of life,departure into emptiness  climate crisis idleness and mysticism essay by jupp hartmann excerpt  i  not as much   that is the imperative of our age less plastic less co2 less  consumption less stress that sounds like a renunciation of meat of  flying of  driving cars  but does  this necessarily have to be a renunciation it would be renunciation to  deny yourself the fulfillment of a deep desire not doing something  because there is a better choice that is freedom  there  are good reasons to use that freedom needing less can be full of its  own  pleasure it means being less dependent and  instead of  constantly chasing after the satisfaction of needs  having more time  for the really important things  those who have lost by being moderate are rare confucius analects iv23  ii  doing and leaving  are what shape our perception of the world a woodcutter a biologist  and an investor perceive the same forest in a completely different  way whoever is taking on a task must be careful not to be taken over by  the task the more the focus is on predetermined goals the more the  view of collateral damage is lost  in  a world of numbers and financial streams everything becomes a means  to an end the earth becomes a raw material warehouse and people become  human capital everything becomes a utility what is useless or not  useful enough from an economic point of view is in danger primeval  forests are being cut down animal and plant species are becoming  extinct in the name of utility a huge destruction is underway  it  would often be better if less were done but this is difficult to  achieve because many people despair when they have nothing to do they  cling to their occupations often  work is the centre of their lives   and for many it is the source of their identity  in  our performanceoriented times this can be seen with extreme clarity  that it is not a new phenomenon however is proven by a more than two  thousand year old text from china  when  the farmer has nothing more to do with grass and weeds he has nothing  more to hold on to when the merchant has nothing more to do with alleys  and markets he has nothing more to hold on to only when the people of  the crowd have their daily work do they make an effort the craftsmen  depend on the skill and handling of their tools to feel themselves if  he cannot accumulate money and goods the scrooge becomes sad if power  and influence do not expand steadily the ambitious man becomes  desolatethe slaves of power and wealth are only happy when in the  process of change if they find a time when they can act they cannot  stop acting they all follow their path with the same regularity as the  cycle of the year they are caught up in the world of things and cannot  change so they run along internally and externally trapped sinking  into the world of things and never coming back to themselves oh how  sad zhuangzixxiv4  so  what can be done is done  and that is often much more than what needs  to be done we virtually suffocate under the mass of products that our  productivity produces  iii  idleness  a word that has fallen into disrepute idleness as the proverb warns  is the root of all vice and more than a few even see in it the worst of  all vices the refusal to perform in a performancebased society  the  calls for deceleration which are becoming louder and louder have  rehabilitated idleness to a certain extent in recent years in the  wellness sector at least it has found a firm place  and in countless  magazine articles when it has to do finding oneself or burnout syndrome  idleness  requires free time this is more than leisure time it is a time free  of constraints empty time that can be filled with what the moment  offers  caught in the daily hustle  and bustle it is difficult to develop new perspectives one is so busy  mopping up the water that one does not even think of turning off the  tap  in order to get a grip on  things at any time your hands should be free being idle means to have  time to do the right thing at the right moment  iv  inspiration  the muses like idleness to be kissed by the muse is the pictorial  description of what many artists experience a higher power seems to  guide the creative process this process is more of a letting happen  than a conscious creation not the conscious ego  it paints it writes  it composes this state is called flow  in  this way making art becomes a communication with something unknown  are higher powers at work here or is it simply neurobiological  processes either way it seems like a miracle  but the flow does not come on command you can only create good conditions for it theres an ancient chinese story about that  a  wood carver carved a bell stand when the bell stand was finished all  the people who saw it were amazed at its divine work the prince of lu  also looked at it and asked the master what is your secret the  latter replied i am a craftsman and know no secrets and yet there is  one thing that matters when i was about to make the bell stand i was  careful not to consume my life force in other thoughts i fasted to  bring my heart to rest when i fasted for three days i no longer dared  to think of reward and honour after five days i no longer dared to  think of praise and blame after seven days i had forgotten my body and  all my limbs at that time i also no longer thought about the court of  your highness thus i was collected in my art and all infatuations of  the outside world had disappeared afterwards i went into the forest  and looked at the trees in their natural growth when the right tree  came before my eyes the bell stand was ready in front of me so that i  only had to put my hand on it if i had not found the tree i would have  given up because i let my nature interact with the nature of the  material thats why people think its a divine work zhuangzi  xix10  v  art  is often the art of omission capturing the atmosphere of a place with  just a few strokes of the pen or grabbing the audience with a few notes  is considered high art it is often important not to do too much if  you try to speak a text in a particularly beautiful way you will  quickly appear artificial if at a jam session all the participants  constantly wanted to show all their skills it would be very exhausting  to listen to only when others hold themselves back can individuals come  to the fore with their solos  as  much as through the emphasis of its tones a rhythm gets its special  character through its pauses a scale gets its special sound by omitting  certain semitone steps  the white  area left blank on an old chinese ink painting appears like the water  of a river or like wafts of mist between the mountains the emptiness  here is an essential element of the composition  in  the early twentieth century abstract painting developed through an  increasingly consistent omission of all references to objects from the  outside world  this led to an  undreamtof freedom in dealing with colours and forms and since there  is no predetermined meaning in abstract paintings they are an  invitation to the imagination to go walking  vi  let it happen   trust in the momentum of the creative process that was my basic  attitude for decades when i was artistically active for me abstract  painting became a voyage of discovery   painting always had a  meditative aspect for me when i painted i let the spontaneous impulses  of my body take their course i let my hands do it without a plan  without thinking i tried to leave the door to chance as wide open as  possible what happened to me often went far beyond what i could have  thought up by myself  i playfully  found my artistic way over the years i did a lot of different things  pictures made of  ceramic tiles lit objects digital art abstract  animations   it was not a  planned development one thing led to another each connected to the  other appearing   in retrospect to be logical but for me every new  turn was a surprise i saw my own artistic development in the way that  train passengers sitting with their backs to the direction of travel see  a landscape i never saw what would come next  i learned to have faith in the continuing process  and that i would discover more in my journey id ever dreamed of  vii  cognitive methods  the modern sciences are atheistic in their methods ie the recourse  to religious beliefs is taboo in the scientific framework for good  reasons this does not mean however that one needs an atheistic  default position to do science the atheism of science is purely  methodical and not ideological even those who are scientifically active  have questions that cannot be answered in this way then one can decide  for or against believing something specific as long as the scientific  activity remains unaffected by this all is well  besides  the sciences cannot prove an atheistic world view because their method  is atheistic they cannot prove what they presuppose that would be a  circular argument  just like a  methodical atheism there is also a methodical spirituality as an  artist i become more open to inspiration when i feel that there is  something greater than my conscious self and that i can open myself to  this something in my creative process i just need to have the capacity  to be amazed miracles are more likely to happen when i beleave they  are possible  as little as scientific knowledge can support atheism so can artistic experience serve as proof of a higher powers  the  word inspire comes from latin and means to breathe in it raises  the question who is breathing in but all answers to this question  remain speculation  it is  possible perhaps even reasonable to talk about creative work with  religious or esoteric vocabulary then one interprets experiences within  a given pattern of explanation this makes them easier to  communicate this is legitimate but it proves nothing with regard to  the pattern of interpretation  beyond  all doubt the experience itself remains intuition can flow more  freely the less conscious control you exercise it is an experience  that probably all people can have no matter what they believe or dont  believe  viii  success  basically its quite banal of course my art will be better if im  painting focused on what im doing and not constantly thinking about  what others will say or whether my work will yield  enough money the  freer my head is the more attentive i can work with attention comes  wonder and with wonder comes awe with awe i have a good chance of  succeeding in what i do  in his book effortless mastery the new york jazz musician kenny werner makes the observation   that there are good players who for some reason have little impact  when they play everything works fine they are swinging and all that  but still something is not landing in the heart of the audience  p10 he attributes this to the fact that they are caught up in  their thoughts and are far too much guided by ideas about how right it  should be one must practice surrendering control to a larger or  higher force its scary at first but eventually liberating ibid  i  very often experience my painting when others talk about their art be  it music painting or literature whoever wants to taste abundance must  become empty  ix  emptiness is of crucial importance in daoist philosophy  how  the nose breathes and the ear hears is essentially emptiness all  things use what they dont have on the basis of what they have if you  dont believe this just look at a flute or a pipe made of reeds  huainanzi xvi6b  this is  not about an abstract or metaphysical idea of emptiness it is about the  very concrete emptiness between things or within things its about  emptiness interacting with whats there an emptiness that can be  experienced  emptiness means potential an empty space can be filled empty time can be used an empty sheet can be written on  not burdening oneself with unnecessary things means freedom to become empty in this sense is the best way to find oneself  to be empty means to have room for abundance  read

389,Wondering what's next after this job...,31m been at a tech company for 325 years in a compliance role the last 2 years i do kycaml which is just approving or denying new customer accounts this means i dont have talk to customers by phone or email this is a huge benefit however im grossly underpaid 1750 an hour denied a due raise to 19 that shouldve happened in june due to covid i can confirm the company has saved a fortune with its universal wfh policy and also a cancelled annual company trip to the hq overseas that costs millions every year instead of throwing every employee a 2000 bonus as they shouldve done they tightened up on every penny including salary increases  now that we realized the company is going to do just fine and is perfectly profitable in a fully remote scenario were an online only financial institution with no branches or stores they are slowly phasing back in salary reviews but not before they are going to do a benchmarking every year they do this crap where middle management undertakes a completely pointless 36 month project to reassess the median income for your role in your city and state i view this is nothing but a stalling tactic its data for datas sake and it stalls in the actual implementation of the overdue raises im not sure if the company is run by mouthbreathers with analysis paralysis or if this is a deliberate tactic or both  so my salary equates to about 37k which is enough to get by with a small 1 bedroom apartment in my state but its a dead end job boring as hell and the company has made it clear their priorities are automating and outsourcing they dont even hide the fact our jobs are threatened and the mood in my department is one of pure hopelessness and despondency everyone feels the same and despite the companys lies were paid about 20 under median as generally this position starts at 45k elsewhere  in august 2021 i am going to reassess in june ill be there 4 years and they do provide a 6 week paid sabbatical i figure ride it out until then take the break and hope the pandemic and job market have improved in the next 10 months  but then what all my experience before compliance was in customer service and sales i could literally never do that again i consider getting into compliance in 2018 a big break as getting out of the public eye reduced my stress levels at work considerably in the spring i put out resumes for other jobs in this area for big banks and financial institutions and got zero bites i literally cant go back to sales or cs i wouldnt last 2 days,iew8fn

family and can get by working only 19 hours a week id love to be a selfsustaining artist or gamedev but my biggest struggle is maintaining a mindset to do so i see all these people who managed to do it even though they had to slave away at fulltime jobs or careers  i know im in a privileged situation and i feel exceptionally guilty that i cant make something better even with those advantages   im increasingly convinced i have adhd and right now im struggling to even get an appointment and figure out a proper diagnosis my moods change on a whim ill be inspired and confident and ready to rock n roll and then in 5 minutes im a worthless sack of crap who will never amount to anything im ready to start a digital sculpt and suddenly i have 35 unrelated wikipedia tabs open because i made the mistake of looking to the internet for reference  i stopped playing games if i can wrestle my brain into agreeing with me for once i work on my skills on projects on tutorials i occasionally buy games on sale because they look so fun and yet i feel guilty playing anything because the longer i play now the more shifts ill have to endure later so they sit there waiting for an imaginary day i can finally get to them   im sure at this point most of us have a backlog that if played in its entirety would be triple our own lifetime  the exception being  i play the occasional game my so and i can agree on because its a way to spend time together   but yeah the point is to dispel the assumption that i might be dumping my life into games and complaining that im not getting anywhere i know those people i hurt for those people and im not those people  i jumped into a game jam hoping i could test out the new skills i learned but it took me forever to code basic functionality the dayjobworkblock hit i wont have anything to submit i failed  ampx200b  where the hell is all my time going  ampx200b  but maybe if i work on my selftalk maybe if i learn this timemanagement skill maybe my art will be good enough soon how the hell do these people find the time to learn this stuff so damn fast when im so slow  yeah i screwed around in highschool because gamedev wasnt exactly an established field at the time i had nobody to mentor me or explain to me otherwise i have no artists in my family the thing that hurts is when i ask most skilled artists about their origin story they tell me a parent or sibling or bestfriend or whathaveyou played a huge role in guiding them  if anything i took so many detours believing i need a fallback thats stable and vastly underestimated just how demoralizing the working world actually was   where im at now  so after a series of terrible customerservantjobs thats landed me in my current job i work at a pseudogovernment institution and my job is to help with whatever stupid computer questions from any humanrefuse that happens to wander in im often alone and often without a lineofsight to know who im about to encounter  i thought id get to help people learn computers how wrong i was mostly im just there to help the incompetent apply to kfc and print out paperwork for loansharks or lots of landlords who wanna print out halfassed tenant agreements  i want to make it clear i will bend over backwards to help people in need but usually im just there to be taken advantage of mostly old boomers come in and immediately tell me how dumb they are with these computer things and just as soon start flattering me with how great i must be so ill do it for them of course   my usual response lately is to look terribly confused well thats quite an assumption im not that bright   i grew up helping my parents and old relatives with computers and being patient its not like im an elitist jerk im just tired of the same old narrative i just straightup politely call it out now   oh well youre young so   no its a skill like anything else like cars computers have been commonplace for literal decades much of gen z has no idea how to use something without a touchscreen so please dont  the place can either be packed full and peaceful with people just doing their business or empty save for 3 people who will run me ragged an entire shift raising their hands like schoolchildren to summon me for idiotic questions like and i shityounot what do i do after filling out this job application the next button   ive also had plenty of people try to get me to help them cheat on if there are 10 apples and you take 2 away or if the register says 1432 and they hand you 10000  otherwise its not being able to find the blackonblack address bar in chrome or having to attach a resume to something or an email attachment or nothing is working because they opened internet explorer   ampx200b  gti clicked the e for internet   actual quote ive heard more than 30 times i swear  plenty try to get me to write their resume for them   the word resume tastes like corroded pennies in my mouth to this day  basically  imagine waiting tables except you cant hide in the kitchen or enjoy a panic attack scream in the freezer you get no tips and all of the customers are campers who stay as long as theyd damnwell please  theyll even joke about how theyre making you dancemonkeydance heehee making you work today huh   boundaries crossed  despite the internal screaming i must come off as rather nice because its gotten me stalked numerous times usually by creepy leopardprintclad women circa 1950something and i mean stalked shed call my coworkers multiple times a day asking for me by name and it took a long time for anybody to take it seriously because haha how cute im a young man and i must be cougarbait how flattering   a steady schedule is usually a wonderful perk for a jobhere it works against me  she literally would set up her laptop at my service desk and refuse to leave shed ask inane questions like how do i change my linkdin profile picture which somehow turned into i look young in that photo right i refused to comment she even asked if she could take me home  thankfully she just stopped showing up or calling one day  i had another aged foreign woman the other day say were you running late i saw you running i was waiting for you  i just shot back oh thats weird yes late is how i roll why  ampx200b   ive had another regular threaten me because i politely said they could put their bigass biggulp on the shelf in the back instead of next to the computer management immediately tucked tail instead of backing me up  numerous karens who expect topnotch handandfoot service they arent even paying for  dont even get me started on friendly people who keep trying to touch you   this is all the same during the pandemic i literally cannot social distance because i work in a cramped space and often have to lean over people to point out what they should do or take the mouse myself so theyll just friggin leave  sometimes i deal with cool people sometimes i get crackpot conspiracy theorists and sometimes i just get your compostvariety assholes the great part is being a community center as it is the worst of them tend to live right around the corner   you know how sometimes you meet that crazy methhead and decide to put it on the creepy encounters sub well hey at least youll never see them again  well here that nutcase is gonna be a recurring character in your particular story and theres nothing you can do about it theyre a local they like it here they know not to do anything throwout worthy but theyll get right up to that line without crossing it will they show up today tomorrow when who knows   but dont worry they will   and always always without fail when youre alone   back to lineofsight   theres a big ol open door in front of me i cant see them coming and excuse myself to let anybody else handle it unless im standing up tall and peeking out a window my entire shift i cant know what the monstergenerator is going to throw at me from one second to the next is this next person just gonna print something and leave will they suck out my life force my entire shift will they yell at me for something i cant solve will they form a romantic attachment because i told them how to connect to the wifi network  i try to be empathetic but i never signed up to be a psychological counselor or make excuses for everybodys misanthropy  i can look down for a second and look up to have my heart skip a beat because oh look theyve suddenly materialized and theyre ready to make my day   or i just watch them stroll in and take a seat my hands get clammy and my breath gets ragged waiting for them to start something  theres been a few of these bullies  villains that i hadnt seen since the pandemic work began to get slightly more tolerable my anxiety calmed down i stopped having panic fits in the car on the way there   i wonder why i have such terrible anxiety problems  fun trivia the lockdown mysteriously solved most of my psychological symptoms wow whod a guessed s  now just after i remember to count my blessings and practice gratitude because i hadnt seen them i think maybe they moved maybe to a farm upstate just sayin   theyre starting to come back and most often theres more than one at a time its like the most insufferable run in packs  because of this i cant just leave work at work as is constantly suggested i cant just ding breathe a sigh of relief and hope tomorrow is better no it gets to me it stays with me what will i have to deal with soon  im always running combatscenarios in my head preparing for the random chance ill have to put up with their shit im constantly trying to bolster my assertiveness and figure out how id get them to leave without bringing heat down on myself i hate confrontation and im really bad at knowing when and how i should act when they cross a line  i had a particularly nasty jackass come back the other day who also abused my coworkers across the building im afraid hell be back in my next shift that starts soon lol gonna be late ranting online  im so strung out inside that im more than willing to just use up my goodwill and tell his aggressive complainy self to stop coming back if he hates it here so bad can you believe im hoping he acts irrationally and starts a fight so he can be trespassed and we can get this whole game over with thats not right  no this way of thinking isnt healthy yes ive tried cbt and telling myself its all in my power to control my emotions and my reactions and feel the force as is penetrates us and moves around us as we control our breathing blah blah blah   sarcasm aside im not dissing it it really does helpsometimes its not enough though  it doesnt stop the freaking skinner box of randomized punishment and i feel like the creative loving generous person i used to be has been reduced to damaged goods because im just sick of people and want to be left alone prelockdown i would even puff a weed pen before my shift just to cope im concerned about effects on my lungs though  ive been putting up with this job alone for about 5 years   why not just leave  i dont have a degree i get paid 2000 an hour for this literally anywhere else would pay me less than half as much for more than twice the work there is zero upward mobility mostly that degree thing and my job will aggressively keep me in my lane if i even so much as try to do anything mildly intelligent or autonomous   hence why i want so badly to just do my own thing   buti cant i cant think of ideas anymore when i was once brimming with them i start projects and the block of suck part of the week arrives and i cant touch them again for another 3 or 4 days so theres no momentum im not at the point yet where i can ask somebody for money and expect to confidently deliver an end result in a freelance arrangement ive had a few freelance experiencesall disasters so far  now i have this reputation as that guy whos so excited and ready to start something amazingbut never follows through i feel like im just not good enough  even if i found another job theyre all the same theyre all corporate run by corporates theres still the bullshit ill take more abuse for cheaper interview process it could likely be worse and if i went fulltime well i feel like id never actually accomplish my dreams that stable fallback stuff is a trap its not like i can save up to have a comfortable next life or something this is it   the worst part is the forced art  capitalism paradox  i have to fool myself into thinking im doing it just for mewhen i know that this is my only alternative to slaving away forever i have to be marketable if ill ever escape  i know i shouldnt judge myself by others success but yeah i see people who make art because they enjoy it and that led to them being good at it and now they can do it for a living  i see people starting youtube channels and i worry that i might have at one point had a vibrant personality that i wouldnt mind sharing online but now it just feels likewell more public contact is the last thing that would be good for me  meanwhile i know i do love it but i have to get good at it so i can finally obtain my freedom but besides lifes events in general im constantly drawn back to this forced obsession over what ill be forced to deal with at this godforsaken job   i feel i dont have the leftover energy to do freelancing even if i could because i just cant handle more people demanding things of me right now annnd what if i couldnt follow through  im sicking of hearing all these stories about former companymen who saved half their salaries asked their boss for paid vacation got a signoff from the wife and had a runway to follow their dreams i dont have that i have triple digits as an emergency fund if shtf really bad and i cant let down my wife like that   conclusion  thanks   i really dont know why i wrote this but i just had to put it somewhere i feel like my struggle is misunderstood by everyone but i know a lot of you share it  maybe i would have something a little extra to say at the end here but yeah i just needed to get this out   take care and hope youre doing well lt3,ifaa5x

406,I used to love my job.,tldr i loved my work but after a few experiences of being treated like shit im feel i dont wanna work anymore   so this is more of a rant its ok if no one finds it interesting or reads it but i wanted to share a bit of my life experiences and why im so pessimistic when it comes to thinking about work also english is not my first language so there will be few grammatical errors here and there for sure   i love what i do i always did and i find it fun and exciting while studying i worked as hard as i could i would get there at 6 in the morning get back home at 7 in the evening and work some more until it was bed time i manage to be one of the best students of my class but i never liked smooth taking myself with the professors since i believed in meritocracy but it became clear that if you wanted to land a good job after the studies you had to lick the ass of the important person in front of you and thats what happened to some better at licking asses than actually working  anyway i got an internship that was okish being treated like trash but hey its the first job so thats normal i thought then i got an internship in a company i always dreamed of working at i still remember how happy was when i got it oh boy i was wrong   i worked around 12 hours a day to try to impress the people there the commute was 2 hours in total i had so many responsibilities that an intern shouldnt have and i was terrified by the ceo who you would hear screaming stuff youre a fucking retard to people during meetings luckily i never spoke to him i got offered at least 5 times the possibility to declare myself handicapped so the company wouldnt have to hire real handicapped people i dont have any handicap just a couple of fingers that look a bit different than normal but i always refused for ethical reasons they left me home because of that i was paid around 600 bucks a month   i found another job looked cool and fun but i discovered they werent paying people they blamed it on us and they still owe me 4 months of salary after 34 years the owner of that company keep telling us theyre trying their best to give us our money but he just got a tesla so im sure i wont see that money in this life  i moved to another country because i didnt see a future for myself there just because of work tho since i always had many great friends and a loving family got a good job in a good company and at the start was actually pretty nice best salary i ever got with the promise of great yearly rises better work life balance and the ceo was a great leader who always listened and asked our opinions he knew every employer and had great values but he resigned i believe pushed by the stakeholders and now everything went to shit thanks to the model you there do this task now and if you complain they think you do that because youre lazy the yearly rise was insulting they used the excuse of the budget classic move while the new ceo gets 300400k  my point is i really like my type of job and im sure ill be able to get better and better offers but im almost 30 and im already so fucking tired of this shit im tired of being treated like a fucking machine and have to say thank you for having a job how is this normal why should i be happy to overwork myself and in the end it doesnt make any fucking difference   sorry is a long confusionary and boring post but i just felt i needed to vent,ibdrxr

415,Workplace Culture in a Post-Covid World (Share if You Agree),tldr people do not enjoy their jobs covid has made it worse workplace culture needs to find a way to acknowledge this underlying truth and treat employees better  the intersection of work and mental health has been at the forefront of our covid discussions since march when the pandemic began in earnest for the united states our mental loads have increased as evidenced by the output of think pieces discussing everything from parents trying to wfh while teaching schoolaged children to essential workers shouldering the extra burden of increased sanitization tasks on top of their existing job duties in fact all of this has given way to even more think pieces about how companies can support employees through these tough times a few popular suggestions that come to mind include  1 allowing for continued remote work if possible  2 ensuring employees have all the resources to do their jobs from a home office  3 establishing regular meeting cadences with direct reports to check in on progress and well being  4 being as transparent as possible about company change growth etc  this is all fine and good but it isnt everything it probably doesnt even scratch the surface which is why we have therapists if we can afford them out of all the articles blogs and narratives that encourage us to press on working in the face of catastrophe i finally feel entitled to this word while also letting us know its okay to cry theres one element of our postcovid working lives that ive yet to see discussed in any real detail  the fact is when it comes to work despite all the passion and productivity were supposed to bring to the table most of us are disengaged and would rather not be doing it in the first place now dont get me wrong  im sure that this sentiment comes in drastically varying degrees across the population some of us really do enjoy our jobs and thats wonderful however im willing to wager a few bets on the subject  1 most people would choose to not work if they were financially capable of doing so  2 if given the choice even those who do enjoy their jobs probably wouldnt choose to be at them 40  50 not to mention 60 hoursweek during their most productive waking hours instead these people would opt for a more parttime arrangement  3 most people view work as transactional in nature  simply a means to an end to afford basic necessities and whatever luxuries can be mined from the remaining surplus  this train of thought in and of itself isnt particularly new or radical but during covid its been swept completely under the rug when it needs to be a much larger part of the conversation think about it  for anyone following national and local guidelines not everyone is but thats a separate issue their lives have been drastically reduced to 1 work and 2 home in the most literal sense all of the extras that used to go into a full and complete life  be it time with friendsfamily shopping vacations sports etc  are not happening as frequently and when they do happen there is a logistical burden to remain safe and distant the result is a balance thats more heavily weighted toward work than ever before as employees log extra hours under the expectation that always home  always available  so now we have a large subsect of the population thats not only overworked and anxious but also severely depressed as they cope with the realization that work  never quite the high point of the day in precovid times  is now their primary sometimes only means of interaction outside of their households lives have been whittled down to zoom calls long walks and socially distanced bbqs and as winter approaches it will be more and more difficult to partake in the activities that are making our days a little more bearable over the summer  with so many people regarding their jobs as merely tolerable what happens when youre in an environment that forces it under a harsh spotlight we didnt plan on needing to like our jobs not everybody gets that lucky but we rationalized it was okay to pursue a transactional relationship with work in order to enjoy our time outside of it well that theory is shot to shit now isnt it  if youre reading and none of this rings true then congratulations  youre in the 1 or whatever minority maybe youre a successful business owner a top performer in an artisticathletic field or just one of the lucky ones who truly enjoys a job that many would find monotonous im not writing this for you im writing this for everyone whose feelings around work have been marginalized by the rhetoric that our jobs should provide both economic and emotional fulfillment im writing this against the idea that we should keep working at any cost pushing ourselves to be better and better while constantly upskilling and hustling but even without a raging pandemic to consider thats really hard to do the difficulty from what i can tell is that most jobs seem to break down into four components  1 something tedious  ie spreadsheets data reporting  2 something challenging  ie being forced to learn a new system with little to no training  3 something anxiety provoking  ie yelling clients andor managers multiple tight deadlines emails at all hours  4 something ambiguous  ie very vague goals and direction that result in all of the above proving that stress and boredom are in fact not mutually exclusive  even if there were some sort of emotional payoff at the end of all this minutia its hard to justify repeated exposure to the above as making it all worthwhile unless it were really really big paradoxically workplaces by their very natures are not designed to play well with emotions on any level were repeatedly told remain professional which means not getting upset crying or losing our tempers so how likely is it that wed be able to truly feel joy from our work if all the other emotions that help us recognize joy are stifled  if at this point we can agree that 1 work is not a great source of emotional fulfillment for most and 2 covid has regressed work from tolerable to a matter of quiet desperation then the issue becomes about how to have a workplace culture that acknowledges this misfortune without completely bucking the system thats a tough thing to ponder but im going to take a stab at it before i list off what i think this may look like i should probably also define what it does not look like a postcovid office culture does not look like this  1 managers apologetically asking employees to turn in their tps reports because they know employees would rather be doing something else  2 employees taking advantage of more nuanced management by turning in latesloppy work and going mia while wfh  3 employees feeling emboldened enough to let their tempers flare during conference calls or over emails  we still need to be reasonable about workplace norms even as it becomes more difficult to normalize the rest of our lives as amusing as it would be to have all companies rewrite their mission statements to here until we win the lottery its not going to pay for our food clothing and shelter instead managers lets try the following  1 do not require us to be passionate on your time simply require us to be pleasant dont hire for passion either hire those who possess the skills and qualities to be successful in the position  2 understand that we do not have to enjoy our jobs to be grateful for them and give our best effort we may not love the day to day hassles but we understand theyre what make up the building blocks of our paychecks  3 do not assume we have more time to devote to work just because we are spending more time at home  4 allow a reasonable amount of slack for late assignments and missed deadlines if there are extenuating circumstances from otherwise strong employees  5 encourage employees to take vacation to mentally recharge and provide adequate coverage so they dont come back to a shit show  6 make video on zoom calls optional whenever possible we dont need to expend any more physicalmental energy getting our faces and houses camera ready  7 recognize that covid recovery for many may take even longer than two weeks do not pressure sick employees to come back prematurely seriously dont do this and help recovering individuals make a smooth transition back to work  8 dont say things like its business as usual if your particular industrycompany wasnt impacted economically if business is good thats great but it doesnt mean your employees are fine to emotionally plow through the muck and work in a vacuum  9 find out how peoples homelives have changed over the past several months are they struggling with homeschooling caring for a sick family member or simply having trouble coming to grips with a new reality  10 lastly understand in an unspoken way that no matter what people say or how they act work is still not how most of us would choose to spend nearly all of our goddamn time understand that we are doing the best that we can we are doing it for the money and that thats perfectly okay  as the dust settles and we look to the future lets have a bigger dream than simply going back to normal why aspire to bring back all the problems of precovid workplace cultures in a postcovid world lets raise the bar on normal and create workplaces that sigh suck just a little bit less,icfowm
416,Even careers for high fliers doesn't seem so attractive to me now,a lot of people think working sucks coz we are poorly paid wageslaves if we just got into real jobs we wouldnt be suffering   but im thinking would even getting jobs for high fliers be that much better such careers include   high finance investment banking hedge funds private equity venture capital  management consulting mbb  biglaw top law firms  medicine  management level at a f500 company  these are the typical sort of safe prestigious careers many top uni grads wanna go into   but will it really be your dream job 2 things to consider   1people are obviously gonna be smart these are very selective fields and naturally they will screen out people who dont have good grades on their cv maybe they wont be the next isaac newton but generally these people learn fast think fast and act fast and i wont be able to catch up  2but not only are they smart they are not anti social nerds or whatever they can communicate normally deal with many tasks handle pressure etc i mean most of these jobs are client facing and they face important people in short they are nt or if not are very damn good at disguising it at least they act street smart to function properly in a corporate environment  so you already have people who are 1smart and 2able to act properly in a working environment  but thats not all chances are almost everyone there has a competitive type a personality which brings me to  competition among peers these are elitists field which only pick the best to enter but its a pyramid shape and room for those at the top is even smaller  a lot of elite companies all seem to use a variant of the cravath systemhttpsenwikipediaorgwikicravathsystem or a extreme version of the vitality curvehttpsenwikipediaorgwikivitalitycurve  in short even if you made it into these elite firms only a few can make it to the higher levels if you dont make it to the next level within a certain period its time for you to leave this means insane amounts of competition its not enough to be average here you have to stand above your peers so you can be promoted or you will be forced to leave this will in turn means massive amounts of politics and backstabbing  if youre not ready to deal with this kind of pressure you might as well not enter coz youre basically a walking target for all your peers to gang up on     in short even if i had the intelligence remain in these elite fields i just wouldnt be able to take any of the social aspects of it too much competition and pressure i couldnt stand constantly looking over my shoulder to see whos the next guy to backstab me im not even mentioning my would be boss whos glad to have an easier job ripping people up in their next annual review call me a quitter i dont care im not made for this and i should finally accept it for my well being  tldr i quit being ambitious and trying to aim at the elite levels i rather just have a decent paying job that i wont hate not like that exists either lol,ibgcjl
417,What do you mean by “end work”?,title  it sounds absurd if no work is done then nothing will be achieved a doctor cant heal a patient without working on healing the patient for example a farmer cant grow food without working on growing food  a world where literally no one works would thus be a world where the sick get no treatment and  everyone starves  and since this is so obvious i figure you must surely mean something else than that so im curious what does antiwork mean,ibyq0e

421,this is what i do not get,people talk about their jobs as if their work was family and can talk about how good of a place it is to work etc etc and how meaningful their career is and how its important to them and its providing them satisfaction in life etc but if there was no  involved nobody would be with that work family nobody would be doing that career how could a job ever ever be about the good of the community or literally anything when the people who do it would not show up if they were not getting paid how could anyone at work be family if you would not all be there together if nobody was getting paid i do not understand this how do people look this over so often i know this isnt the most readable so im sorry still trying to find a way to communicate this frustration im having all the time in a way that makes sense basically how does everyone just conveniently look overforget that if it were not for money exchanging hands and someone making a profit or someone needing  to survive none of this would run why are we all engaged in the constant business of denying capitalism itself and trying to assert meaning in places where i just cant see it existing or is it that i am a grouch and all this stuff is meaningful and im stuck not being able to see what others can this could be like the smallest to the biggest thing like a weird small example is some people could love x vet clinic because they really care about your pet but like my take on it is no they could never care about your pet because if you had no money at the door they wouldnt take care of your pet ever am i a cynic its depressing to live this way but its just like how i see the world to me if someone wouldnt be nice to you for no money it doesnt matter how nice they are when you have it how do people just go through life believing that everyone they pay to care about them really cares or do people actually care and overlook the money part and im the one who cant see that,ic0r25
422,"That moment when you realize you can't afford ""average"" new things on an ""average"" income.",in the county where i live the average resident earns just under 27k a year or about 13 an hour  can you afford rent on an average 1 bd apartment with your average income  average rent here is 825 a month  doubtful it will cost 41 of your take home pay which is higher than the income to rent ratio that many landlords will accept  can you afford to buy an average new car with your average income  the average new car in 2020 in the us is about 36k  no  can you afford to buy an average house with your average income  the average house in my area currently sells for over 220k  no  can you afford an average vacation with your average income  the average vacation costs about 1200  doubtful    there is something radically wrong when the average person can no longer buy average things,ibq51d
423,Waste or capitalism?,i decided some years ago to quit my job and live in my grandmothers house in the rural area all fine and dandy i managed to get the crops started grow myself some vegetables potatoes corn i have two goats chickens a lazy cat the whole deal  although the labour is intensive i dont owe anyone anything and all i produce is mine now as many of you that rant about how they would like to quit their job and live free and without work by picking an apple from the tree and eating it know this is a labour intensive process that keeps you tied up all day you have to feed the animals clean after them water the plantation gather firewood gather the crops store them etc etc etc all this beside maintaining a household like one would do in the city you know vacuuming dusting doing the dishes the laundry cooking and so on  now having a microfarm i like to call it this has its challenges some things are a struggle my potatoes are very small i cant get them to grow larger than a golf ball others are ok and others are flourishing my chickens are flourishing poultry and eggs production is through the roof and i live alone this is my problem  i dont want to throw them eggs away after all theyre the fruit of my labour and im sick of eating omelette my cholesterol is too damn high  so i was thinking maybe i could take them to market and sell them but i live alone online market is not an option i use the public librarys wifi every now and then and i need to be around for the chores i bored you with earlier the only other option is to hire someone to sell them for me but that would make me a capitalist that enslaves other people  lets say i can make 100 by selling a batch of eggs if i hire someone i will have to pay that person a share of this 100 it should be a fair share i wouldnt want him to feel like a wage slave but a fair share to him would mean an unfair cut from my end if its unfair to him to receive less than the profit he deserves for his labour why should i get only a cut from my 100 because i have to be home to tend for the animals  so what do you recommend should i hire someone to sell them or throw the damn eggs in the bin,ibah6i
424,Anyone ever quit on the spot?

425,What’s the closest you’ve gotten to living completely work-free?,i saw this reddit post a while back i think it was in rconfessions or ramitheasshole about a guy who had accomplished the dream he worked as a programmer of some sort for this company the company got bought by another larger company and they forgot about him completely  he literally came in whenever he wanted reported to no one and had to do like 10 hours of work a month i think the reason he was posting was because he felt like an asshole for leaving for work during the day wife and kids at home but really just going golfing working out and reading at his desk   i fantasize about that post daily i cant get it out of my head it sounds like everything ive ever wanted now i want to hear your stories have any of you done something similar something even better let me live vicariously through you pls,icsfxu

443,Does browsing LinkedIn make you feel inadequate?,for example in my class of 2010 everyone barring myself went onto have careers in their chosen industry ditto for another field i tried to break into so when you look at my network which i avoid but sometimes browse out of curiosity you see how far theyve gone in their fields and how youre still stuck at square 1 does this make anyone feel whats the point up until maybe last year i worked hard in general but im skeptical whether most people work that hard at all the jobs market is dialed to extremely competitive but out and about i dont get that impression from the vast majority of people at all and more than that competition sucks and working hard after a certain point  becomes kind of futile,ic5sov
444,Anyone have practical advice on how to power through a job you don't like (work from home)?,heya antiworkers im looking for some practical advice   first let me tell you my situation i work in corporate it which mostly means shifting through the same 3 or 4 excel sheets for weeks on end and occasionally downloading data from a 20 year old system that is barely still standing  its very boring and annoying and i dont enjoy it one bit   i have been working from home for the duration of the pandemic and it has been an improvement when its quiet i can more or less take the day off but this comes with the downside of making me resent any work that i have to do it also removes one of the few pluses of my job which was talking to my coworkers   i really really really times a thousand dislike this job but i am not in a position to quit right now the job market is very bad and i would not be able to shift easily into a new job while working from home i also dont have enough savings to retrain or take extended time off although i am saving quite a bit   i reckon i need at least another 6 months in this job before i can practically leave but that presents a problem which is getting through these 6 months   the main problem i have with my job is how boring and unfulfilling it is its tedious and repetitive and i find myself procrastinating or dodging work which usually just means more problems in the long term   ampx200b  so any practical coping mechanisms or tricks i can use to get through the tedium for at least 6 months  any help would be greatly appreciated,ibxlg2

486,Thinking about quitting my retail job.,hey guys  im 19 i just started a new tech job where i work from home answering calls and helping people with their computer problems for 15hr i work 5 days a week for 5 hours im still going through training   before getting this new tech job i worked and still work at a local grocery store where i help bag peoples groceries or stand behind a cash register before becoming a cashier i often did menial chores emptying trash cleaning stuff god i hate cleaning restrooms sweeping the floor etc i still do them from time to time but now im usually cashiering  ive been working my retail job since december 2019 i got it right before covid hit i get 9hr minimum wage in my state and i usually work a few nights per week usually 45 hours per shift at most   overall its an alright job i get to buy whatever i want at the end of each shift without having to walk to another grocery store my bosses are usually pretty chill my coworkers are nice most of them at least and the customers are 99 reasonable people who wont make you want to find the nearest gun and blow your brains once they walk out the door i get a karen every now and then but its not as bad as something you would see online   i started thinking about quitting my retail job when i realized that every shift i took i was risking catching covid and getting infected myself and spreading it to other people i worried the most about spreading it to my parents afaik they arent immunocompromised or anything but why take that risk right   and i was doing it for minimum wage   even though my area hasnt had a major outbreak everyone at the store is required to wear a mask when they get in the building we have plenty of hand sanitizer and get our temperatures checked at the start of every shift i sometimes think could this be the day  im also thinking about quitting because working two jobs even though they may be part time puts a serious drain on my motivation to do other things on days where i have to work both jobs i only get a few hours of free time at the most which is mostly spent recuperating from watching training videos for my new tech job before i all of this i wanted to play guitar and learn to draw and make comics i liked art and wanted to leave some kind of legacy for myself  i say all that in past tense because in recent times i feel like ive lost my passion for anything besides work surfing the web especially reddit gaming then sleeping just to do it all again it feels like my mind has become preoccupied with work putting that above all else i feel like a wage slave  my parents seem to be happy that im working 2 jobs but im not they like to say im a working man and that now moving out seems possible but im slowly getting depressed at how out of control my life has become like any young wage slave im looking into the future at what my life is gonna be like for the next 60 years it doesnt look good   whenever i bring these things up my parents heavily advise against quitting my retail job they only said i could consider quitting once ive worked both jobs for six months im not suicidal or anything but if thats how long id have to do it id probably spend my hours working longing for the sweet release of death   i never thought id say this but one thing i miss about high school was that hope that my life would turn out okay that unwavering optimism that once i turned 18 my life would get 1000x better god i miss it i never thought i would miss anything about high school tbh the older i get the more pessimistic i become   i want out of this rat race i want to really start working on my passions like i originally intended when i picked up that high school diploma and shook my principals hand one last time   to make a small change i just asked to set my availability to 4 hours per shift instead of the usual 5 i dont know if itll be accepted or not and i dont really care better a small change than no change at all maybe thats enough for now but should i just quit altogether  btw i dont know how to drive yet so my opportunities besides these two jobs are like next to zero   anyways thats all i have for now hope you read through my wall of text   tldr  young wage slave is depressed cause he feels like he has to work 2 customer service type jobs to support himself thinking about quitting minwage retail job and looking for a way out,ic7cuw

529,this is what I do not get,people talk about their jobs as if their work was family and can talk about how good of a place it is to work etc etc and how meaningful their career is and how its important to them and its providing them satisfaction in life etc but if there was no  involved nobody would be with that work family nobody would be doing that career how could a job ever ever be about the good of the community or literally anything when the people who do it would not show up if they were not getting paid how could anyone at work be family if you would not all be there together if nobody was getting paid i do not understand this how do people look this over so often i know this isnt the most readable so im sorry still trying to find a way to communicate this frustration im having all the time in a way that makes sense basically how does everyone just conveniently look overforget that if it were not for money exchanging hands and someone making a profit or someone needing  to survive none of this would run why are we all engaged in the constant business of denying capitalism itself and trying to assert meaning in places where i just cant see it existing or is it that i am a grouch and all this stuff is meaningful and im stuck not being able to see what others can this could be like the smallest to the biggest thing like a weird small example is some people could love x vet clinic because they really care about your pet but like my take on it is they the company could never care about your pet because if you had no money at the door they wouldnt take care of your pet ever am i a cynic its depressing to live this way but its just like how i see the world to me if someone wouldnt be nice to you for no money it doesnt matter how nice they are when you have it how do people just go through life believing that everyone they pay to care about them really cares or do people actually care and overlook the money part and im the one who cant see that how are there genuine relationships when money is involved and exchanging hands  another example of this is how are there so many interviews with athletes celebrities artists politicians ceos etc that never mention money even one time like why did you tell this story in this way why did you release the movie at this time why did you decide to promote this product and the answer is never because it will make me more money its always some sort of cover answer how does everyone believe the cover answer or am i really genuinely out of touch for not believing it,ic17a6

561,How to avoid working as much as possible until the big Fuck Off?,i have a pretty sweet setup if you dont count the fact that i inherently hate working im a developer who has been working from home all pandemic and i already know ill never be able to go back to a normal office setting im a decent developer so most of the time i dont have much work to do  im a one woman team so nobody bothers me most of the time the problem is my boss shes a workaholic who has been at the company 20 years she wants to retire in the next couple years and im her intended replacement as she reminds me often this has revealed to me that she has terminal yesman syndrome and has picked up a laundry list of useless tasks throughout her tenure shes been training me to take them over and many have nothing to do with my job description  most of it is spreadsheet hell auditing sales documents from a decade ago or documentation that literally nobody will ever look at  to put it plainly i just dont want to do them she also doesnt know i have no intention to be with this company 6 months from now my plan has always been to restore my savings after an earlier attempt to fuck off from office life failed and then fuck off to live in europe at this point i cant give a shit about anything but the promise of good wine cheese relaxed work culture and beautiful old architecture the pandemic has set back that plan but im determined  regardless id rather die than stay in this city at this job i will not be here long enough to make learning this bullshit matter to me too bad i dont have any teammates who might have been able to relieve me of some of them how do i avoid working when the buck stops with me  i was thinking that since these tasks are not what i was hired for i should just pretend to be bad at them she might get frustrated and continue doing them herself if she thought these tasks which are not worth my pay rate imo would take bandwidth away from me doing development  have you ever done this do you think i could get fired for being incompetent at tasks that are secondary at best to my main job function what would you do,i8gvou
562,I must leave r/antiwork,i love this sub and i have finally found a place where people feel the same way i do  the world has always made me feel lazy for not wanting to live this way but you guys have shown me that there is an inherent wrongness with the way society functions  but i know that this will never change  even if there was the tiniest glimmer of a possibility that things could get better it certainly isnt going to happen in my lifetime    so as much as i love this sub i have to leave it for the sake of my mental health  the game is rigged and they will always win,i9kinl
563,What type of labor do you find meaningful?,it always amazes me when i occasionally see glimpses of meaning shine through the purposeless existence ive been conditioned to accept in my career ive realized that work isnt what i hate i hate the purposelessness and futility of my work some of my own surprising examples of finding purpose and purposelessness in labor are listed below but im curious  what are some unexpected types of labor where youve found a sense of purpose or purposelessness   by day im a bureaucrat but i sometimes do side projects and damn if they dont sometimes feel purposeful recent examples include planting plants and pulling weeds shoveling muck out of a lake and painting a house another surprisingly purposeful example of meaningful labor is helping landlord friends and tenants connnect i know i know but still i find it beautiful to help broker deals where everyone wins  i also play music for  sometimes and for fun all the time but surprisingly it does not feel purposeful or righteous to get paid to play at rich peoples weddings   im curious if you all can relate or have different examples,i90yee
564,"I find it somewhat ironic that in order to not work you have to work a lot, save a lot, and then enjoy your free time of intrinsic purpose with years of extrinsic conditioning. It feels like a contradiction.",like many of you i am antiwork labor should not be exploited under the threat of biological coercion it seems like in order to escape the popular trend is to grind out for years saving 50 or more generally this requires a college degree and a high paying job which means you have to be expected to know about this or at least have a direction when you start middle school so that you can place for college based courses   it is madness and then you invest in the same companies that bomb and blow up other nations cause addiction based behaviors track your data and sell you destruction drugs labeled as medication   if you have a problem with the system it isnt the system thats at fault it is you you are weak you are a mooch you are lazy you are needy you need to increase your income want to retire on 200k ha healthcare will eat you up you need at least 1 million but then 10 million how about one billion thats right you will never retire never get back to work   i find this crazy circular bullshit game to be maddening i hate it i hate the trauma i hate the expectation i hate the addicted egocentric bullshit   i have lost my motivation with fire with grinding with hustle with all that nonsense i work just enough to save a little and sleep for mental recovery history of concussions thats it it is pretty meaningless and then i die the end   what keeps you sane,i8wqp3

569,The person who (unknowingly) made me anti-work,not sure if this is the right place for it but i wanted to share how i became antiwork mainly anticorporation last year i landed an internship at a large multibillion dollar company which i was super stoked about because even though they didnt pay me very well as an intern it was very prestigious and i thought it could lead to a further career with the company ha anyway my supervisor there was the person who completely unintentionally woke me up to the problems with work and corporate culture   she was in her early thirties but all she talked about was how excited she was for retirement she would always share her future plans for travel and such and would cross her fingers and say only thirtyeight years to go if the only thing youre excited for is almost forty years in the future and youre essentially just trying to make time pass until then what kind of a life are you living  she seemingly did nothing except for work she was always in early stayed late took on extra responsibilities she had meaningful contact with almost no one outside of work but her parents she told me she hadnt been out with friends in over a year  she was always extremely stressed out so much so that it was intimidating to approach her with questions or even just to say hi in the morning she also always looked sick and exhausted huge bags under her eyes and sicklyyellowish skin even though she was a fairly attractive person she looked awful to be blunt she would spent her fifteen minute breaks dead asleep in the storage room with a pillow upper management probably didnt know about this  my internship was only for one semester and i was returning to grad school afterward on my last day she told me to enjoy school while i could because its way more shitty in the work world  interacting with her and just seeing how hopeless and empty she was really affected me especially since she seemed like shed be a pretty cool person if it wasnt for work just beating her to a pulp now that im graduating myself it makes me scared im terrified of ending up like her and losing my soul so to speak but i need income and dont know what my other options are it makes me feel hopeless and empty myself knowing that that might be my fate  anyway i know this is long and dont really know what my point is but just wanted to share,i95diw
570,Goal-setting; what a joke!,i find the whole notion of setting goals in the workplace to be a complete joke especially now during covid times im not sure where im going with this i just needed to rant   the company im in has seen revenues decline considerably so much so that they were forced to cut everyones salaries by at least 15 management got even more but their salaries are so much greater so they can still survive unlike us peons   catch is we still have to go through our mid year and annual reviews where the main focus of them is the goals that we set for ourselves usually the driving force behind these is an annual salary increase and a bonus those arent happening this year   i just find it hilarious that theyre expecting us to put any kind of effort when our salaries have been cut one of the goals for ppl is to learn a new skill were a tech firm soyoure saying we should increase the value we provide to you as a company while we dont even have the possibility of getting a wage increase in fact the opposite  what a joke i hate the concept of a review it exists solely to build a case for why someone doesnt deserve to be employed by a company anymore,i99mfj

573,General Strike,i see general strike trending and being discussed online and just wanted to drop my 2 cents and remind to all the antiwork community that strikes are amazing and powerful tools for liberation show solidarity to all striking workers by striking yourself as well support them with emotional and material support and never cross picket line and scab yourself  get the ball rolling keep boosting and organizing from what i gather so far in terms of american discourse the general strike is being planned for september 1 also note that the longer a general strike goes the better so plan accordingly and organize your communities and build food and other necessities distribution spots   wish you best of luck in the upcoming struggles remember to take it one day at a time and eat well and rest well solidarity from greece,i9dp1h

576,2nd Personal Phone Number,so my company has given us phones to use for work purposes i always turn it off when im done for the day  due to covid and being furloughed for 6 weeks  which i absolutely loved  i had to give my personal phone number to a few senior managers so they could contact me   my line manager has contacted me a few times after work when i wanted to forget the work hence me turning my work phone off while it hasnt been anything major but i want to circumvent the situation where if i am on annual leave or if i am after work i am getting contacted i dont want to make them feel like they can contact me whenever they want i dont want to know and hear anything from my work during my free time  now saying to my line manager not to contact me via my personal phone and only use my work phone might not be the smartest of ways as this could cause unnecessary friction i want him  and other managers  to feel like i am part of the team and think that they have my phone number  so instead i am thinking of buying another phone number and using it as my true personal phone number that only my friends and family have while treating my current personal number the same as a work phone number  turn it off after work and forget about it during holidays weekends or evenings i would buy a crappy mobile phone for 30 or something for it as not to have to change my sim card too often  sure that would mean i would have to change my phone number to login to my bank or gas payments but this would avoid unnecessary questions as well as make it much more difficult for my workplace to contact me when i dont want to be contacted if they asked anything about it i would say that oh my area has a crappy signal or my phones battery died or something  has anyone done something like this how did it work did it annoy your coworkersmanagers,i8jai1

593,I want to drive trucks and give zero fucks.,i am 35 i worked 20 hours a week since i was 15 i worked full time as soon as i finished high school at 18 i had one burnout crisis 10 years ago but that was quite simple it was purely because of the shitty job i had with a lot of responsibility and zero free time i usually spent whole saturday just sleeping and sundays drinking and dreading the monday i took couple months off found a better job and was back in the race this time in less shitty job around 2016 in spring i started feeling a bit anxous around large groups of people even people i knew i was in a hotel in vienna at our annual company conference about 250 people i was about to go on stage for my bullshit powerpoint which was part of my job at least once a month never had issues with public speaking i was sweating profusely and 10 minutes before my time slot i chickened out dumped it out of the blue on one of my coworkers and said i dont feel well locked myself in the room and didnt leave until the next morning i was not able to step in front of more than 20 people and talk to them  ever since 2015 was the best year in my career i finished 2 long running projects with high praise from all the fatcats at the company i had pretty good work life balance took 3 week vacation first time in my life i went somewhere for 3 straight weeks just with the target to not do anything but relax i still remember how amazing i felt when i came back but it was also a time when i started to spend money like no tomorrow 2016 in my job was what 2020 is now for the whole planet earth worklife balance meant the life part is the time you come home after 9pm every day but i suddenly had to keep up this cult of consumerism i was living in after all that expensive watch is a great purchase if it gets to be worn for 15 hours a day at the office at times i would just buy expensive shit that ended up unopened piling up in the hallway i think i still have a pair of expensive shelf speakers in the garage that i bought 3 years ago but by the time they arrived  2 days later i was no longer interested in upgrading my audio setup because i had no time to do so long story short too late i tend to ramble i let myself become an anxious shy angry and easily irritated pile of garbage human being which is not really good for an executive job position managing couple dozen employees and couple dozen million budget for rampd i wanted to quit in 2017 they always convinced me to stay a little longer with empty promises about different job position i wanted i finally quit in october last year and the last few weeks in the company after i knew it is over felt like the gravity stopped working because i was skipping with ever step i took la di da i found a job in one day home based no direct people management i lasted 2 months when christmas holidays were close to end i could not fathom to spend another day on the phone dealing with morons on 3 different continents i had enough of my us colleague who wanted to touch base every other day and just drown me in small talk for 30 minutes every time i hated speaking to colleagues in india who never in the 15 years i worked with indians could tell me what the fuck they actually think i swear to god the yahnah headbob over the phone is 20 times worse than in person because i dont even have chance to see your face to learn something is wrong so i every phone call is basically an interrogation if i want to learn something that you are afraid to tell me because it means there is a problem no sir everything is fine oh yes sir half of the team quit yes everything is fine the delivery will be on time oh yes the delivery has to be posponted by 3 months how i wished to say fuck you to everyone i realized i am the asshole if you meet an asshole in the morning you met an asshole if you keep meeting assholes the whole day youre the asshole i quit after just 2 months in the new company and i am not working now for the  8th month i am still not ready to work again every couple of weeks i get really anxious with the corona shit happening we had one of the lowest infection and death rates in the world but also with full shutdown for several weeks our economy tanked the most in all of europe that i wont find a decent job any time soon even though i know i dont want one yet but for the first time in my professional life something happened that never happened to me before  i did not get a response to my job application nor did i ever need to send more than one before but receiving no response is still far better than those we are sorry but you did not fit to our criteria this time rejection emails i had to dumb down my cv which landed me 3 interviews all 3 of which i cancelled an hour prior i was afraid i would accept an offer if they would make one after i realized in april or so that i wont be working any time soon i claimed unemployment from the government first time in my life that was another low for my self esteem i felt like a leech still do i have to keep reminding me that in taxes i pay more to the government in a year that they will give me for 6 months and even if i did not count taxes in the unemployment insurance i paid for the years i was working i paid a lot a lot more to the system than i will take away the society tells you are a parasite if you are not productive for the society which i agree if you never worked dont want to work and collect money from government but the society well fuck society the family thinks you are a parasite if you are not working the family will call you using expensive phone and cell plan you bought and pay for to tell you that you should get back to work and be a valid member of society my dear mother told me that she could let it go after i refused to enter college and started working she politely forgot the fact they threw me out of the house after high school and we didnt speak and visit for 3 years because of that all the kids of her friends have degrees and succesful careers and families and kids and houses and all her friends vere envy about how important i was at the company i worked for the largest employer in the county with 5k employees how everybody in town respected me and that nobody in history of the company ever quit at the position i had because you either get fired or retire from the executive jobs so the gossip in town is i surely had to be fired the gossip 9 years ago when i got the job at 25 was that i surely had to suck a lot of cock to get it at such age but now my dear mother told me she has to fear in shame somebody will ask her how i am doing so my dear mother keeps telling people i still work for the company i quit alredy 8 months ago my dear mother offered to give me money when i got rid of my expensive german car and bought a small city hatchback for 15 of the price with a 3 cylinder engine oh if you cant afford it anymore i will give buy you the car what will people say when they will see you driving in such car that surely you are broke fun fact is i would gladly take the car why not free car but it wasnt sincere offer from a mother to buy something for her son out of love it was just to keep a facade of success in all endeavours for every family member i thought only she can be so shallow but i actually had 3 people over the last year ask me why did i buy such cheap car one a car mechanic changing my tires asked me if i am not ashamed to drive in the car a man with my status this is what i hate most about our society what i hate myself for doing the same for almost all of my life  to value our self worth based solely on our status education job position house we live in car we drive i cant compare it to drug addiction only because my bade does not bode will any drugs otherwise i am pretty sure i would have a drug problem but addiction to social status can be pretty hard to get rid off too it could make you miserable for 23 hours a day but that one hour of high will keep you living with it for some it is the feeling when they earn another fat cheque for some the deferred behavior of employees who  love hate and fear you another loves to see their name printed everywhere i myself i think i am done with any creative work done with using my brain my brain is dead or it feels like it most of the days all day i am content just watching netflix and play hearthstone for hours i really feel brain dead writing this post was probably the longest thought i processed over the past few months i cant deal with people anymore i cant deal with

wait to see the face of my dear mother when i will tell her that wearing a truck yeah cap and tank top with playboy bunny logo,i89rio

596,"This is the sub I've been looking for.

598,My story on Antiwork,interesting subreddit i found it scrolling through popular this looks like a place that i mostly agree with since i absolutely despise the thought of working 40 hours a week for your entire life at a thankless job that would replace you before your funeral if you suddenly died  short story about me when i was a teenager i used to visit an old folks home a lot and talk with the residents   some of the questions i would ask them were   what do you wish you would have done more of in life and what are your biggest regrets not a single person said they wished they would have worked more or watched more tvmovies most said they wished they would have worked less and spent more time with family and friends some said they wished they would have spent more time doing hobbies or whatever they loved like traveling or writing   later at 28 i just couldnt take the 95 anymore so i quit my job sold everything and went traveling to south east asia   now about 5 years later i am living in cambodia working 24ish hours a week and saving more money than i spend every month with my lovely wife and kid i have plenty of time to spend with them and on the things i enjoy doing   i am only working as much as i do because we want to buy some land and build a house a little farther outside of town total cost for land and house should be around 40k  to me being anti work does not mean laying around all day doing nothing   it means doing what i love doing with no regrets now or in the future while reducingeliminating the time i have to spend working for others   i do not want to be in my 70s and be thinking what if i would have   ps i do not recommend moving to another country most people would not be able to handle it i wouldnt say i am one in a million but i would say i am one in one hundred thousand   pss new account because i never had a personal account before my other account is for my fantasy writing and i do not want to conflate the two together,i8ty0j

600,A random thought,my grandfather was a carpenter the old school kind with hand tools only very skilled guy all the furniture in his house was handmade by him but it took him forever to make even the simplest stool  he worked for a random furniture company where he had power tools coworkers logistics marketing finance department whatever a company has they were making and selling a great amount of furniture  i dont think that he could have been so productive on his own to match the productivity he had at his company on his own he would have had to take out part of his carpentry time to go buy the materials he needed then he would have to carry the materials home after the furniture was done he would have had to store it sell it he would have had to be a carpenter along with being an acquisition specialist truck driver marketing specialist salesman accountant  even if companies are bad greedy steal the fruits of the labour and so on even if he was paid less than what he worked he still earned for himself much more than he would have on his own  so my question is this how do i know i wont end up working much much more for less revenuebenefitincome if i were to quit my corporate job,i8ttqn

618,Sick Time Guilt? -Vent-,hi guys first time poster  tldr at the bottom  with everything thats been going on in the country both socially and economically ive been lurking around this sub as well as raboringdystopia and rlatestagecapitalism and generally just agreeing with and laughing along with whats being posted   im lucky enough to still have an income during the pandemic entry level auto technician but the job or atleast the company i work for fucking sucks 50 hours a week benefits are ass 0 employer contribution to 401k 12 a day pto earned a month which counts towards both sick days and vacation the pay scale is super low compared to others in the industry management has been super misleading about payexpectationsadvancement etc ive been with this company for almost 2 years now and im not expecting to be pampered or given a free pass to master tech but what they expect from us and what they give in return is fucking infuriating especially with how busy weve been over the summer im not the only one fed up with their bullshit either were having people quit left and right management is in damage control mod rn but we are hella short staffed and over worked which brings me to my point  over the past week ive had a harder time catching my breath and breathing in general no problem i says its just my fat ass struggling in the heat and humidity ill lose some weight and quit vaping then i start getting random headaches and i get dizzy if i go from prone to standing too fast no problem i says i hit my head pretty fuckin hard the other day on the lift im sure its nothin then my stomach starts turning knots and im moonlighting as a septic super soaker in the bathroom every hour and a half no problem i says never gonna trust free burritos from the mexican food place next door again ill just take my day off and rest this whole mess out of my system and thats what i did all day yesterday i slept and took vacations the the toilet but i didnt feel any better if anything i felt worse off today been fatigued all week but this morning was a legit effort to get into work and doing the job felt like pushing a bolder up hill i tell my manager im going to a minute clinic at lunch to see what they say i get there and describe my symptoms and they says sorry we dont do covid testing here you will need to go to the other minute clinic and im like dont put the fucking c word on me i dont have that shit well in any case we wont be able to see you today we are booked full   thank you for choosing notadoctorvisitclinic please come again god damnit i text my manager and say they want me to do a covid test and i drive to the other clinic to see if they can get me in today i get there and again they are booked for the rest of the afternoon but they atleast tell me how schedule an apointment for the test i call my manager and tell him i wont be able to get one done until tomorrow he says its fine but he will need me to come back so they can get my temperature no fucking idea why or what thats supposed to do but apparently ive been running a 100f fever today too lol he informs me that i will need to stay home until i get the results back from my test and not to worry because my time away will be paid but the real kicker is that the company posted a paid time off for covid policy around may when our city first went into lock down that basically boils down to we will pay you for up to two weeks if you are away with covid related issues your banked pto days will be used first and then through our good graces we will give you free pto that you have to earn back at the standard rate 12 a day per month   so here i am at home bitching to strangers online about my crap job worried that ive caught the literal plague concerned that i wont have another paid sick day or vacation for the next two fucking years oddly enough i feel guilty for being away from work why i fuckin hate the job but i am thankful for the income i resent the increased work load with no clear incentive but i have been increasingly stepping up my game to match the demand and i feel like im letting someone down by not being able to continue doing that im incredibly burnt out and my mind and body have been begging me to take some time off and i guess my wish has been granted in monkey paw or sarcastic ass genie style  tldr  my job sucks i might have covid and i feel guilty for taking sick time,i9wp81

626,You have to have open availability for full time.,not sure if this is the place for this but im just venting i f 26 work at a lowes hardware store i have worked for two full years and i did just about anything to earn full time as it so happens they were looking for someone to fill in the position for lumber cashier and no one wants closings and i thought  why the hell not i get to sleep in and all anyway at one point i wanted fixed days off because i kept getting 810 day weeks and i was exhausted still am  i asked the manager in charge of my schedule if i could have monday tuesday off she didnt have a problem with that since the other cashiers already had the weekends off by default i do not mind working weekends anyway it was going well up until now i tried to update my availability to have monday tuesday off to have some sort of a life with my wife sadly the previous manager in charge of my schedule passed it on to another manager that manager had me fill out a form for the hr lady and as soon as i took it to the hr lady she immediately began to shame me for wanting a fixed schedule because as a full time worker im supposed to have open availability and basically keep at it like a wind up toy it seemed like  to make the long story short she was pissed and clearly doesnt care about anyone but herself thankfully i spoke to my manager in charge of my schedule and she personally took my availability to be able to work with me as much as possible  i dont understand why its such a big deal to want the same days i was getting for almost a year off i signed up for the hours no one wants and we just need someone to close for 2 days that im not there hr lady made me feel like shit and needless to say shes not well liked but she makes me realize how ae are shamed for even trying to have free time with significant others and even a life because work is our life sorry for the rant  tldr i wanted the same fixed days off that i was getting for nearly a year hr shames and scolds me for it despite there already being people with fixed schedules,i9atjh

629,I don’t believe in responsibility.,my angle on feeling this way stems from the fact that i never asked to be born ive never been happy chemically medication or organically i never wanted to be here so why do outside forces or people feel they can demand my attention i dont believe that anyone has the right to tell me what to do   just because something needs to be done or changed does not mean that i need to do so or that im the person to do so i dont believe in taking the effort to make something happen its either too much work for barely anything or a feeling of accomplishment that either goes away in 10 seconds or sits in the form of a trophy or reward broken or collecting dust laundry dishes the world wont explode if i wait i believe society grooms children to become worker bees and never question or form their own morality   i dont care about time chores jobs or consequences i do believe that the world owes me because again i did not consent into a world where i suffer and if i am not allowed to take myself out via euthanasia im not going to participate in society   in short i believe being comfortable is the most important over all and i do not believe in responsibility,i8rijp

631,Any suggestions for minimizing time working? what are good jobs to do part time?,im currently 20 and about to enter the world of adulting either college or a job and im feeling so lost and the despair of it is really creeping into me and making it hard for me to focus stuff like the traditional path of work 40hours a weekbullshit chores and errands just to be able to live and have almost  no time for what matters seems pointless like why bother living  so im trying to find a why out thats not suicide i cant figure it out my parents who id usually ask think my goals in life are bad idk if this is the right place to post but you guys at least get what i mean  anyways i know what i want i just want to have enough to be able to not die and be able to do what matters in life art writing and time with friends and family like none of that is terribly expensive to pursue but the real thing required is time and imagination so need to figure out a way to minimize  work time and stress so low cost of living and such  im thinking probably best way to do this is either to live out of a van or try and find a small place in a rural area just somewhere enough for internet and amazon orders but im really stuck on how to figure this out i suck at planning or what kind of job i can do part time but still pays decently per hour ideally remotely to save on commute and so if i choose not to live in a van i wont need a car this is just very confusing and overwhelming to me and with college rearing its head and im not sure i need it i want to figure out sooner rather than later so i dont get myself into a whole just doing part time community college tell i figure stuff out  ampx200b  does anyone have any advice itd be appreciated thank you for getting this far,i9nfyy
632,Why?,why do some of you hold onto the idea of some sort of revolution happening people have been talking about profound systemic changes since before i was born and do you know what it always leads to more talking your children and their children will more than likely be doing the same thing i want someone to tell me what they think a radically positive change in society would look like what forms would that take     lets drop the goodalwayswinsmarvelavengers last stand fantasies for a bit and be realistic with ourselves we live in a point in time unlike no other in history because now we have technology technology has given us many amazing things like this phone im typing on convenience instantaneous entertainment and much more inversely its also given us many terrible things like mass surveillance too much convenience shorter attention spans collective apathy and too much power to those who are fully capable of stomping out any potential dissent    so what exactly is the solution for all of us and for the love of christ can we please stop pretending that voting has solved any of our problems thus far were not gonna fix a broken system by using it against itself it doesnt work like that theres a reason why things have been getting progressively worse instead of better insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results,i7w6r2

639,Stuck trying to decide on education,first time posting but after a bit of lurking i feel like this subreddit really gets me  that being said heres my dealio through working full time and living with my parents up until a couple months ago ive managed to save up 33000 however i have no credit very little equity no 401k and outside of speaking a foreign language and hs diploma i have no education im a real piece of work i know but i dont have kids so i suppose thats a plus now im beyond fed up with my manual labor factory job i hate it there everyday i aim to clock in make as much money as i can do as little work as i can get away with and leaveive been thinking of  a quitting and going to tech school for electrical in november seven month program costing 5800 the drawback here is im afraid after finishing school there would be nobody willing to hire me as id have zero job experience with electronics or the only places willing to hire would want me to start on night shift   b obtaining an associates degree online in quality assurance itd be a twoyear program at 4000 a semester so its costly af but although quality control has never been my job title aspects of it have been in some of my previously held and even current positions theoretically i could work full time and go to school full time but then it becomes exponentially harder to pass and my quality of life plummets as free time will become a thing of the past  have any of you workedwent to school full time was it miserable  any feedback would be appreciated figured id post it here where id be among like minds lol,iaduse

655,Should I work during my studies?,now i realize this aint a finance sub i just align with antiwork  heres my situation  i am looking to move in to my country capital oslo  i currently live at home paying no expenses bar subscriptions and personal items  i am studying it on my 2nd year as of this august  i am finishing my studies in june 2022  i have 8500 euros in my bank account  rent in the city costs about 500600 euros a month  cost of living is generally high but average its apparently around everything from 100300 euros a month on expenses  the student loan i would take would amount to around 14500 euros after 2 years of study subtracting my bank savings would amount to around 6000 euros in debt after 2 years  in addition to this i can lower that 6000 in debt by simply not using all of the student loan money i get each month  as well i can work a set amount of days a month and get some extra money if i get a job in the city  so now with all of this information what is you guys perspective on this should i work even though i hate the type of work i am likely to get  customer service jobs are the most prevalent  or should i take the 6000 euros of debt and look to work it down after getting a job within it either during my studies or upon completion  3rd option not a personal preference but possible is to live at home while i complete my studies  i will be 24 years old when i finish my studies and the year 2022  my parents have clarified that they would allow this and my dad strongly urges me to do this  any tips,i8g687

669,It's astounding how many of you don't realize the problems you have in capitalism you will still have in communism. Basically nothing would change for the common man.,i am very much antiwork  mainly just on the personal non ideal connected basis that i hate working also for the notion of automating the workforce having machines handle everything not that we can properly do that yet  i am very much not communist though  thats not to say im a big fan of capitalism truth is both systems are utterly horrible atrocities that should never be considered  anyhow the basis for this thread is that when i come on here i often see people making a complaint about capitalism and wishing for communism when the complaint they are making is something that would still be part of their daily life in a communist society only some details would change im not feeling the drive to type a whole essay here but the gist is that here in capitalism you are shoved down by an oppressor and forced to do work you dont want to do just to have access to the basic necessities of survival and under communism you would be shoved down by an oppressor and forced to do work you dont want to do just to have access to the basic necessities of survival the only real difference is that capitalism is more successful at causing those basic necessities to exist in the first place leading to less starvation than the alternative,i8gxfj

693,the customer is always right...,if you believe this you are one of two types of people the first type is a business owner for them this line is a commandment on the stone tablets you can not argue with them and you can not reason with them about this from my experience business owners rarely deal with difficult customers that is why they have managers and to an extent cashiers to absorb the abuse in the cases where a customer demands to see the business owner chances are that the staff member will be sacrificed to placate the customer   this happens all the time   the second type is a special breed of customer this customer is the obnoxious type entitled they look down on you and what you are doing they assume that because you are working retail you must be stupid or lazy i doubt that because i have to as a reason ever comes into their minds about why you are working there the unfair system they are a part of does not  bother them in the slightest  this type of customer is unaware of the basics of how a business functions and expects things to just happen or things to just be there they dont have an idea of how a fast food restaurant works yet they will attempt to tell you how to do your job they have no idea how a particular business functions but they will abuse a cashier for an issue that is actually managements problem they dont understand the concept of shit happens and that you can not plan for every eventuality  this customer is more financially privileged than the people they bully they assume that money gives them the power to abuse people my theory they only pick retail places to exert their influence because no one else will take that type of attitude from them   respect is not given if anyone desires to be respected you should first respect other people being a customer does not elevate you to a level above other people  the customer isnt always right,i7prq7

695,"It's not just that I don't want to work. I couldn't even if I wanted to, at this point. I fear for my future, if I even have one.",this post is horribly written as i am so broken up by everything that i cant do it properly but i got something down so i am sharing it anyway  im glad to have found this sub i desperately need to talk about this i have felt extreme levels of guilt stress and pain due to my inability to tolerate work for nearly all my life its been so severe its driven me to be nearly permanently suicidal and eventually started to effect my physical health if you end up reading all of this thank you it means a lot  since i was a child i have resented and feared the concept of work its complex as to why but one of the earliest factors was my father shortly hes a fascist who has long praised the virtues of hard work particularly where you suffer dont worry i disowned him 2 years ago for most of my life i have felt so deeply incompetent due to my seeming inability to find my stride and do well with work i thought i did in high school but that started to slowly shift following that my first 40h a week job was the summer of 2008 and the entire experience of it just crushed me i did it but the sheer length of time it took out of the day left me with so little left inside when i got home that summer i did basically nothing and was horribly depressed it lifted once i got back to school but that experience lasted with me since then i have dreaded and feared the day where id have to join the 40h grid  i did get thrown in earlier than i wanted at the end of the day im actually no schmuck i have a phd in organic chemistry i tried i tried so hard to make myself grow tolerant of working long hours if i did something i loved ive wanted to be a chemist since i was 10 as the subjected fascinated me maybe it could work out but it didnt graduate school was enormously destructive to my mental health well being and completely killed my interest in chemistry im a shell of my former self at this point i started my first full job 5 days after my thesis defense 5 days i needed the money despite being so destroyed by grad school i didnt want to but i had to i held this job for 2 years before it crushed me  when i started my job i was honestly terrified that i was going to be fired in a matter of days i thought i was lucky but would never be able to keep up with it the work itself i was able to do most of it but the sheer terror i felt over it plus trauma from school which prevented me from performing in key areas rendered it downright destructive if you include graduate school i have gone through 14 psychiatric medications to address my mental health issues years and years of quality therapy none of it dented my problems still i somehow managed to hold onto my job for 2 years and even win award for it as i have supremely good people skills also i managed to squeak away with some loopholes i was actually working around 3035 hours a week and got away with it due to being salary and using therapy driving time as an excuse to leave early on some days as well as coming in late  around a month before i quit i got in trouble for coming in late and my hours began being tracked i had to work 40h no matter what i lasted a month before my health declined to the point of going to the emergency room i was at my desk utterly overwhelmed by stuff piling up on me not being able to will myself to do those tasks and i felt so ill and in pain that i went to the er 3 days later i quit this was a year ago now i havent worked since and am very lucky i have managed to do that with the help of family  in my year off and through this pandemic i have figured out several things that i have refused to admit to myself i do not want a job period i never have i have felt so much immense guilt and shame over that all my life and i though the problem was all on me but the poor benefits long hours too low of pay too low of resources and increasing societal demands for more and more are out of my range literally at this point i quite literally cant work i am so scared drained and in poor health that i could not work a job even if i wanted to at this point  currently i am living with my grandparents and they can easily house and feed me i am so thankful for this as without them i am pretty sure id be dead i tried looking for work a few months ago but it honestly started to fill me with a sense of panic and extreme dread much of it knowing that i would last maybe a few weeks before id be fired i just have not gotten any better in the past year i was hoping the time off would lead to me healing and being ready ill never be ready i tried i really really did but the fact of the matter is it is a literal impossibility for me to work a 40h a week job maybe i could work a 20h a week job but it doesnt pay enough and i have 125k in student loans from undergraduate if i actually want to support myself i have to do something that i cannot do  i feel overwhelmingly trapped i dont know how long i can stay with my grandparents probably a while but certainly not forever i fear the day i will have to leave because i dont think ill survive on my own i really didnt when i was on my own the job made it impossible for me to take care of my home my health my friends anything im just flat out not cut out to work maybe it could have been different but my experiences have damaged me to the point where i cant anymore i deeply hope i can find myself in a place where i have a small stream of income so i can stop worrying and fearing for my life  for most of my life i have not wanted to work because of a buried feeling that i wouldnt be able to cut it i tried to make myself i truly went to the end of the earth to do it and it didnt work out now im at a point where its not just that i dont want to work but that i cant yet not working means no money which means no food or home which means death this is why my mental health is so destroyed its why its been so bad for so long not working means death and if youre not able to pull it off it means youll die  im sorry if this post hard to follow i tried to write it multiple times and i would just freeze i barely have the strength to explain this anymore it feels impossible to properly explain all this coherently so much has happened and it would require a book to explain it all if you read all of this thank you,i6f06a

698,Work has eroded my mind,working in the industry i do is super taxing on the mind then i go home and have to do dinner stuff then i realise ive got twothree hours of free time until i need to go to sleep to ensure a sharp mind the next day often ineffective i work hours that leave no room for my wilted creativity to bloom again i no longer dream or feel surges of inspiration i only think about making sure i find the quickest route to my free time so that i can just do nothing as much as i can before bed all to balance out a hectic and peoplecentric work day  i remember how i would spend hours a day practicing guitar and writing songs and drawing constantly and getting better and better i remember how i used to actually remember things  these days i can barely remember most things people tell me let alone find the motivation to pick up my guitar again ive just had so much of my life force drained from me  i would say all the money in the world isnt worth this misery but would i be better off on the streets  anywho what were we talking about,i6weod

701,Whatever you do will be another dollar in someone else's pocket,it seems like many people are unaware of how damaging and immoral advertisement actually is its the one thing at the origin of clickbait and sensationalism titles it pushed social medial in a design creating additions and its the main reason behind the harvesting of personal data because peoples attention is a market  your available brain time and your entertainment are being demonetized and turned into profit by corporations just like your labour but unpaid and youre not given a say about it watch as buy premium or fuck off and dont you dare using a blocked because well be constant asking you to turn it off if we even let you access our webster  advertisement is ethical ,i6ch9k
702,Resignation letters...,today is the first time ive ever written a letter of resignation so i was looking through google to see what kind of stuff i needed to include and to be quite honest the search results frustrated the hell out of me  every search result strongly advises you to dedicate an entire paragraph to telling your boss how much you love appreciate and how much you will miss your work if you really do love your job then i see nothing wrong with that but seeing as the vast majority of the workforce hate their job i can only describe doing this as corporate simping   the other thing that almost every search result advises you to do is to make sure you tell them where youre going and what youre going to be doing next i cant think of a single reason why this is even necessary or more importantly why its any of your employers business to know where youre going or what youre doing next   employers should be grateful im actually giving notice at all considering they wouldnt give me notice if they were going to fire me so im certainly not going to go as far as to be a corporate simp,i710rf

704,How to Escape the System,this is a question that i have noticed has been discussed on this subreddit previously and something that i have spent a good amount of time thinking about myself i am certainly no expert on the subject  but i do have a number of thoughts on the subject that i would like to share with the intention of sparking a conversation if other people have thoughts or ideas they would like to share   now keep in mind im from the us so my experience may be different and what i am going to write about may not simply apply to everyone also every avenue will require work and will also require a change to your lifestyle   now before i get into how to get out i want to go over some fundamentals that i believe   at a basic level capitalism is a trade you trade your time for money i understand it is more complex than that you also trade labor expertise knowledge skills etc if you accept this fact then you quickly realize that time is the most valuable asset that you possess and will ever possess time is precious and it is always fleeting   in a capitalist system money equals survival without it you wont be able to buy food or shelter or any of the other items required to live so you have to make money to survive which means trading your time for money now logically the best thing would be to figure out how to trade the least amount of time for the most amount of money which leads to people going to school and specializing again i understand it is much more complex than that   now the trick of the whole system debt and advertising culture i strongly believe that capitalism is designed to get people in debt want to go to college debt want to buy a house debt oh you got sick and dont have insurance debt combine that with a culture that demands endless consumption which again leads to more debt and you have the perfect system to keep people controlled and in jobs they hate but need to do to service all of their debt honestly when you realize the whole thing it is kind of amazing   the short answer is that there is no easy answer i dont think there are generally easy answers when it comes to life life is hard and requires work and to truly escape the system one will have to put in a lot of work now i am going to try and outline some different avenues that i have explored and thought about   1 choosing to be a hobo believe it or not this is something i have thought about just pack up hit the road and see where life takes you this to me would seem to be the most extreme challenging and possibly the most freeing i think you would want to have a backpack with essential items to include a tent so you would always have a place to stay you would also probably want to have some kind of savings established and a way to get and do odd jobs as you go along i think you would also have to rely a lot on the generosity of others and you would probably always want to stay near some kind of larger population center to take advantage of the services that they would have available    2  living in a commune or communal based society they exist and honestly seem pretty freaking cool this is probably the quickest and easiest way to escape the system i myself have dreamed about joining such a community but have not done enough research for one the very large established and well known ones are generally in other countries im personally not ready to leave family but you may be there are also likely ones in many different states that are not known about their presence only shared via word of mouth i knew someone that lived at one for a time and i went and visited them it was kind of weird to be honest i really loved the idea of it all but the social dynamic was weird a family owned the farm and people would stay in the barns and around the house everyone who stayed had to help with doing chores around the house whether it was cleaning or working in the garden work is how you paid for your stay you really didnt need to have money unless you wanted to buy stuff   3  the van life or a tiny house i think this is a cool idea and also something that i have dreamed about this option would definitely require some more money money to buy the van and keep it gassed and serviced i do follow the vandwellers subreddit and there are a lot of people who are doing this and a lot of blogs about it there are people who are able to secure jobs remotely and actually continue to have some kind of a way to make money while your expenses would be so incredibly low   4  debtfree lifestyle this is the one that i am trying for pay off all debt as quickly as possible by eatingcooking at home and not buying much else the idea is to keep reducing your monthly expenses as much as possible now i know about financial independence which also requires having a lot of money saved up and put into investments once your expenses are low enough you can make enough from the investments to not have to work and essentially retire i am trying to go at it a little different i also want to try and grow as much of my own food as possible and get my monthly expenses as low as possible i think that i would still need to work but at that point i could do something that i enjoy like working in a greenhouse and i would only need to do it a few days a week to survive   5  move to another country norway sweden switzerland countries with much better social support systems and just generally a better quality of life this option i frankly know the least abouti am sure that there are restrictions and forms applications processes that would all have to be completed to be able to do it   anyways those are just some ideas that i mull around in my head the stuff that i dream about when im in the middle of doing a job that i hate but need to do to survive hopefully one day there will be a ubi and it will be much easier to work less,i5ikgj
705,Wrote a poem/rap about the state of the capitalist world right now. Would love some feedback vis-a-vis any particular issues I could work into it since it's still unfinished.,the systems fucked with my trajectory and the tolls felt by my minds chemistry regressing quicker than arsenal under emery got me hangin on the edge of beggary and its not just me the whole world must see surely this deserves some attention please down the media vine under the poverty line at the mercy of these motherfucking tory swine and the people on the front line wake up to a pay cut you sell em out straight up prices getting raised up close the food banks so they never find a way up so you can sit way up in your ivory tower gluttons who devour all the wealth and power while the cries of starving kids echo louder and louder only pull your finger out when rashford calls you a coward im a freedom fighter but i shouldnt have to fight ya i want to see us all ascend higher and higher but i cant take a back seat while compulsive liars see that things are getting dire so they throw us in the fire    youd rather neglect us reject us before you respect us instead of protect us you let it infect us that aint what we read when you sent the prospectus this austerity has been fucking relentless represent us but you clearly resent us bring in new policies made to torment us circumvent us with the pennies youve sent us freezing to death in the box that you rent us the ones who employ us you want to exploit us destroy us and toy with us far off deploy us you cant avoid us so you try to decoy us try to play coy but we know you enjoy it so why you expect more than just the bare minimum empty our hearts cus were stuck with your venom in disillusioned by the hustle curriculum work all our lives just another poor citizen you remain wealthy while we cant be healthy maintain the divide while acting all stealthy act like theres nothing when we all know theres plenty why i dont subscribe to the shit that you sell me since when has survival become something earned we all have i right to it i can confirm you let us all burn but youll still never learn your primary concerns when we finally turn,i5v6qd

707,The moment I became anti-work.,too long of a post but here it is  ive worked since i was 17  44 now  i have always been in administrative positions and was groomed to believe hard work will pay off  every position i have been in ive left it all on the field  yes sirmaam i can stay late or come in early  no problem i will do that task outside of my job description    after working hours  not even an issue lets get the mission accomplished  job interviews  yes this is my dream job my only weakness is i care too much etc etc  can you pass this complex test for this low paying job  absolutely  after numerous interviews for different positions in this company i landed a job that paid me 15 an hour  my college degree was really paying off now  medical costs  dont mention it brings my pay down to about 10 an hour   this admin position was an 8 hour work day with a lunch of 30 minutes to 1 hour with 2 fifteen minute breaks i had a manager that was a task master and was borderline micromanaging  i took my breaks on time was prompt for lunch breaks and did everything as instructed  after working in that position for a year a diff position opened up in the same cubicle area with a different manager  it came with a whopping 150 pay raise bringing me to 1650  the manger for that position pulled me into her office and said i would be a good fit  i applied and was granted an interview  i put my best foot forward threw on a tie  the interview consisted of her telling me that since i am not a millennial i would be a good fit for this position  she spent time belittling millennials i nodded my head and lucky me i got the job    in this new position i did all my work and was super efficient  there was no hard and fast requirement to be at the desk because there was no office traffic or anything that would ever require a customer or coworker to come to my desk  if someone sent me an email i would respond within seconds  after being there for a while i learned i could clock in and out on my phone and respond to any emails the same way  this position did not require any phone calls    my manager would come in the office once a week and when she was there i was always there  when she was not i would take all types of liberties by clocking in and out on my phone and responding to emails the same way  i did this for more than a year  one day on a random friday my manger showed up to the office  i was doing my usual routine of a long lunch and decided to actually show back up to the office  she called me in and said where were you i show you are clocked in from lunch  i didnt come up with any complex story and really did not say much  she let me know that my coworkers had complained that i was not there on some random like 2 months prior  again i did not say anything  she said she would think about what she was going to do on the weekend and let me know monday  congratulations  youre fired  i took the walk of shame out of the office  my coworkers were glued to their desks checkin checkout promptly  keep in mind their management was not even in the same state and had no office locally  they were soooo full of integrity that they wouldnt dare falsify hours or take longer breaks even though they would surf the net all day    there were people there in same positions still making 1650 after 20 years with no hope for a raise  getting fired even though i was performing at a high level because i was not glued to my desk was my moment  antiwork  youre telling me i get the job done but because my lame brainnonsocialinternet surfing co workers want me at my desk i am fired   ahahhahaha    there is so much more about what happened here but that is all i will share for now  after moving on i was liberated i fought for it and was granted unemployment  was lucky and received the extended unemployment took care of personal affairs to include my military disability  i recently signed up for a work from home job where i will actually be helping people    the system is bs and i finally figured it out  lets keep this subreddit strong,i6d1t3
708,At the end of my rope,guys i think i have undiagnosed autism thats making working complete hell and ruining my life  im 23 and i dont know how to drive ive tried learning but whenever i physically get in the car its a disaster  i dropped out of high school because i couldnt learn anything math related and i felt so fucking dumb  completely socially retarded never had a girlfriend or anything basically have never been out anywhere in a social setting my entire life  i have only 1 friend from middle school who i talk to its strictly an online friendship  i still live with my dad and his wife they give me rides to and from work all the time and i feel terrible about it public transportation is virtually non existent where i live  ive gotten jobs though my current job and 1 previous job both are warehouse jobs i got by going to a temporary agency temporary agencies will hire anyone  got laid off from the first job because it was strictly temporary seasonal work  my current job i got hired on after a year or so it would be a great job if i didnt have to be around other people    everyone who works there are miserable people with no lives and have nothing to talk about so when they see me quietly minding my business and doing my work i become an easy target for scrutiny  our supervisor constantly has me do my coworkers work for her while she blissfully works as slowly as she likes and while she talks shit about me with everyone  shes constantly behind on her work because she just knows the supervisor will get me to do whatever work she doesnt feel like doing  no matter what i do she has a problem with it i could literally just stand up and walk by her and she calls me a dumbass under her breath  i havent done anything wrong as far as i know the only reason she hates me is because i ignore her like the plague and just quietly do my and her work  she herself is miserable and has no life outside of work either the difference is im completely fine with it because of my nature or autism or whatever   she on the other hand makes herself feel better by walking around to other areas and talking shit about me to other people she lies to them telling them im lazy and dont do anything its complete bullshit   ive confronted her on 2 occasions asking her what she said she loses her shit and tells the supervisor that im crazy and im making it up in my head  supervisor always sides with her basically i cant do anything me and my coworker work in a workshop area away from everyone together alone so its impossible for me to prove the way she acts around me  ive tried standing up for myself and telling the supervisor i shouldnt have to do her work for her especially with the way she treats me but he says its teamwork   its making me depressed as fuck and im seriously considering suicide having to get up every single day to go into work to deal with this  i want to quit so bad but i know it will be very unlikely ill ever get another job   i know if i was a normal person i wouldnt have any of these issues like if i was able to socialize with my coworker like a normal person she wouldnt have come to resent me but i just cant deep down i feel like i dont have autism but its becoming increasingly clear that i do   so wtf can i do can i get disability for my apparent autism like i said its not diagnosed would i have to go to some sort of doctor and convince them im fucking retarded   if i could get disability and live in a tiny place somewhere and never have to interact with people ever again that would be my ideal life  i have to figure something out soon if my dad were to pass away suddenly i would be completely fucked because i rely on him too much i would be homeless and i would definitely just jump off a bridge at that point  thanks and sorry if anyone reads this long ass ramble,i6v2y6
709,Yesterday I followed through and quit my job,i have a bad habit of not following through on things leaving toxic jobs in the dust being one of them ive been miserable for months and i was actually laid off in june for all of a day before being picked up by another department within the same company which was a big red flag since it showed me they were willing to set me adrift in the middle of a pandemic when not much of anyone is hiring   that being said the last straw took place a couple weeks ago when i was in the office i started in this new department about a month ago and was still getting the hang of everything after barely being trained basically i asked my new supervisor where i should put away some folders full of things that i had been working on once i was finished with them she pointed in a vague direction and said put them in the room with all the boxes now a few days prior i had been shown a room with a bunch of boxes and trays where things were stored so i headed there and about 34 the way there roughly 40 feet from where my boss sits she yelled across the office and in front of all my coworkers what are you doing not there the other one and proceeded to make some comments under her breath at which point she and the group of women that surround her desk all laughed not so much as even glancing in my direction  that one interaction made me feel so small im young only 27 but im old enough to have gray hair and a college degree and i hadnt felt so insignificant and humiliated since i was the new kid on the first day of third grade absolutely awful  so yesterday morning i decided to just go in first thing and gather my things and leave my badge with my notice that it would be my last day i will concede that giving your 2 weeks is a courtesy that should usually be extended but so is treating your employee like a human being who deserves respect  i have a part time job lined up with a small company near me pending my background check and im going to do that catch my breath for a bit i hope you all are treated with respect by the people you work for because you deserve it we all deserve more,i5o3ia

712,"If you can opt out of Capitalism, you should.",i know this isnt realistic for the vast majority of you im strictly speaking for people like myself who are in a position to drop out of capitalism without being starved to death or left in the streets   if you can do this id highly recommend it getting all your time to yourself to better your life learn think and have fun is very much worth it in my opinion i know there are downsides there is very little choice in anything when you have nothing but you can still get by using the internet since everything digital is free if you know how to find it yes society will hate you but if you really care about the truth that wont bug you   the world needs more people dropping out to use their brains instead of pretending money has value if you spend your time right dropping out will be of major benefit to society in that you can help to spread knowledge and be a good example to your fellow man you can spend your time shaping the way you think to better help others follow suit in the way i am doing now   we need as many humans as possible doing the right thing so if you can do the right thing and drop out of a system that hurts your own species you should a world of information knowledge contentedness happiness and understanding of the fundamental nature of reality await all those willing and able to use their time wisely,i6iaap

716,How to go about unemployment without getting fired,hey everyone sharing this incase anyone has been in the same situation and knows how to go about it or is in this situation and can follow this post  so a few weeks ago i got an email from my daycare center saying they see an increase in enrollment and are calling people back and were looking for my decision after thinking about it i decided to go back only two days a week they said all the safety and cleaning procedures they were going to implement but they said wearing masks for anyone over 2 was optional even tho all staff had to wear them  so i was observing everything back at work and not much has changed there isnt much distancing like they said the masks are optional and ive only seen one kid with one the 67 year old group and everyone is so close to each other breathing on each other and sharing the same toys the only change i see is that staff has to disinfect the toilets each time a kid goes   the other day at work in my classroom i noticed a few kids coughing and sneezing all over the place no masks of course i tried to distance myself but its hard when everyone is contained in one classroom a few days later i started to not feel well still dont currently sore throat dry cough stuffed up nose and im highly certain i got this from the daycare as i didnt get sick once this corona period since i took a temporary lay off of my job in march i also saw a few posts saying that cases are rising in children and it has me a little concerned as i work around multiple children all day i do not wanna go back next week for my safety and to not be around any more sick kids wether they truly have the virus or just a cold  i know a way to get unemployment would to be getting fired and stop showing upletting them know however i do not wanna do this   i was wondering 1 how do i go about filing for unemployment successfully like what to say without getting fired 2 what to tell my work that wont disqualify me from getting approved for it like for example if i refused to come back to work when they called me back they would of notified the state and my unemployment would of gotten cut that way  i would love to know if anyone has been in this experience and what they did thank you,i68jia

726,My co-workers were happy to come back to work......,a few of my coworkers and i were all laid off for about 4 months  we just started back last week  we were chatting and i was asking them how their time off was  all of them responded in the exact way i expected them too i was so bored and i couldnt wait to come back to work  my brain hurts every time i hear anyone say this  we were all drawing the extra unemployment and one of my coworkers even said she didnt care about making more money on unemployment she just wanted to come back to work  its so sad that people have been so conditioned to having most of their time consumed by their job that when they do get free time they have no idea what to do with themselves  no one has any hobbies or anything they want to create no where they want to travel to  they have no social life or friends or family they want to spend time with  its so fucked up  i get it most people need a job to survive  but we had the rare opportunity to be free for a while and not worry about income and they were all miserable  meanwhile im over here and i cant wait until i get enough money saved up to take about a year off,i6pzmf

735,Why such a bad stigma against college grads?,everyone seems to think its entitlement that you want a job that pays a living wage with a college degree or a job in your field its always the college grads fault its never employers given the debt and training you take on i dont think thats unreasonable i think its just a strong bias against young people who want professional careers but theres really no entrylevel  i feel like entry level job postings arent really for entrylevel candidates see words like expert proficiency or 3 years experience theyre just for people willing to settle for entrylevel wages   i sometimes hear people just want to start at the top but i dont think thats really the case college grads arent applying for senior level positions people just want to not be struggling to get by living with their parents i dont think its entitlement to resent that,i6lsfg
736,Should I just call a ceasefire for now and settle into a career [Vent][Advice][etc],im 26 from the uk a graduate from a 3d art and design course and i guess technically self employed but not enough to live on sustainably so i am looking for something i can call a career  any time i think about moving into a long term field of work i just get so incredibly stressed because even though i know i am a capable person even outside art and design everyone who is employing has stupid criteria that are making me second guess myself and anyone who i could work for is going to extract my value for their own gain and despite being inherently immoral are probably so in other ways too and i just keep asking do i really want this is it worth my soul   the problem is i know i need to work for my own well being if only to escape from my parents and take my mind off my still raw break up and further than that i know i need to make a career so i can earn more than nmw and maybe cut the next 40 years of work down a bit so should i just bury this deep seated hatred for having my wellbeing held to ransom and just choose a career path already  i just know of the past few weeks when stuff was going south relationship wise i did get to thinking what would i want to do and why and i have been ruminating and ruminating but ultimately the answer i keep coming back to is that everything sucks and i am overthinking it looking for ethical value in a career where such is impossible ill be clear i want to end work and i think there is still part of me that is clinging to the naivety that i could ever actually feel at peace with the work i do  so should i just do a job for the money the challenges it brings and the people i get to know and be venting here and on late stage capitalism about how shit it all is  do i accept that really i dont need the work to be fulfilling on every level of my consciousness andthat if i at least find it stimulating and it helps me commit to learning a skill that i can use to make money and help others then that is ultimately at least a partial win even if my employer reaps the most benefit  i think i am answering my own questions a bit here but i guess i would just like to talk to like minded people and maybe i can make it out of my current predicament safely and at least have a job to show for it      sorry for the rant a,i7etsq

743,Used to not like but tolerate work.

756,Sick of it—the BS job market is not worth it.,i recently graduated and have had a streak of very bad luck with jobs last week i had gotten hired at a company as a temp assistant and was glad to hear that they were willing to consider someone without experience in their specific field and that they wanted to give me some experience for my resume and help me out for a few months those were the words of my boss they didnt even have a computer set up for me so all i could do was filecopyetc   literally two days later i get a call that i dont need to come in because they decided that they need someone with more experience in their specific field   wtaf   im so sick of being led on and having to bend over backwards pretending that i would just love to be an underpaid paper pusher because i cant find anything better to do with my undergrad degree its humiliating and demoralizing and makes me feel like all my solid credentials  stuff i did in the past doesnt matter at all all of that probably doesnt matter to employers at all but yet thats how i see myself as an individual with unique strengths so im not willing to lie and say my dream job is to toil at some dinky little company for years on end   im still trying to find a full time job so that i can pay rent but im questioning more and more if its worth it if i have to sacrifice my mental healthhappiness and have an enormous chunk of my earnings go towards rent if this isnt what i want my life to be like why am i even trying to make it be like that  its what everyone thinks i should do   i might try to go on unemployment if i can but ive never done it before and am scared of the process it might be better for me to just move back home and work part time to save some money for the future grad school instead of subject myself to this dehumanizing farce,i74e8n

775,"Software development skills are useless, he said, clickbaitingly.",this is more of a rant than anything else  background i work fulltime 1 as a software developer 2 for a clueful software consulting company that cares about employee wellbeing 3 in finland these three things combined put me in a massively privileged position free healthcare proper labor protections 5 weeks vacation no unpaid overtime good wages pleasant work environment with nohassle remote work arrangements still ive long held antiwork ideas and as ive grown older just turned 40 ive only become more anticapitalist and moved leftwards politically  as i get older the idea of continuing to work fulltime on client projects that mean nothing to me personally becomes increasingly less appealing still ive got a home loan to pay so i keep doing it   software development skills are generally considered valuable from a perspective of working for someone else they undeniably are but if i wanted to build something on my own that would generate even just minor passive income theyre surprisingly useless  heres what i mean by that im able to build full databasebacked web sites from scratch backend frontend server deployment and maintenance but building any such site in 2020 that would actually generate meaningful income ethically without being userhostile scammy or sleazy eg adbased revenue tends to be one or more of these one that would provide some valuable service to its users that they would be willing to pay a small monthlyyearly fee for hard enough that it essentially rounds up to being impossible  im not trying to generate so much money that id be able to quit work altogether i quite like my employer and the people i work with and id have no problem doing some amount of contract work for them indefinitely if something i built myself would generate as little as 5001000 income per month id already be able to cut down from the 95 grind into something closer to a 4day workweek without significantly affecting my total income thinking web scale that is a laughably small amount of dosh and yet  write what you know they tell writers the same applies for software dev if i were to build something solo it would have to be something i know currently board games and more recently woodworking ive spent years trying to come up with something that 1 people sharing those interests would be willing to pay for and 2 isnt already fully served by existing services possibly for free i cant think of anything realistic  another option would be to have a partner that i trust who would be the subject matter expert with me acting as the technical implementer yeah good luck with that trustworthy people with strong enough enthusiasm for a subject that theyd be willing to team up to build something around it and who are in a position in their lives to do so dont exactly grow on trees either youre insanely lucky and already know someone like that or youre not and you dont everyone knows the old line about how hard it is to make friends as an adult the same applies to business partners  so yeah not much of a point to this just felt like i had to get this off my chest people with the just start your own business attitude can honestly fuck off,i710ux

827,What are your thoughts on doing three 12 hour shifts as opposed to five 8 hour shifts?,i am almost 19 years old and i have been off work since the pandemic began i lost my job as the brick factory i worked at closed down which i am kinda glad for i imagine most of you can just imagine how soul sucking a brick factory can be   but now it is time for me to look for a new job and i discovered an alternative what about 3 12 hours shifts sure a 12 hour shift is long and draining but doing 3 of them and then having four days off i would have more free time than work time yet make just as much money id have the time i lacked before to pursue my art and other life goals that brick job left me drained and dead with little recovery time and i was living just to work but i figure if i can condense my work week i am gaining a bit of freedom over the 95 workers and with those 4 days a week i will have time and the money to plot my escape plan   the capitalist wants us to work 9 to 5 5 days a week since it leaves the people unhappy and drained to be able to escape the work week hangs spread over your head and time like a dark cloud the weekend a moment of sunshine to regain just enough energy to do it all over again it is not designed this way because it is most efficient for productivity but because it allows for control over the workers yet a lot of places i noticed are going with a schedule of 3 12s a week and i feel while it is a tough 3 days its better to plow through and get the work done and out of the way as fast as possible make the money have the 4 days of true free time to live life as i please and plan out an escape from the capitalist system it would allow for ample recovery time and even if you consider the first day off after the grind as a recover day that leaves me with 3 whole days upon which to plan my life and goals,i6y3wx
828,Why to be anti-school too.,yesterday i made an antischool posthttpswwwredditcomrantiworkcommentsi6qyfkbeantischool that gained some interest but it was a low effort expression of my ideas here im trying to further conceptualise and explain these ideas in such a way as to avoid some of the disagreements i believe were more down to miscommunication than actual ideological disagreement  the main opposition was that education is good because we need knowledge and understanding to progress i do not disagree with this but i believe the educational systems of schooling and education are counter productive and actively damaging to children  1 there are two main definitions of education which are almost diametrically opposed  2 the process of receiving or giving systematic instruction especially at a school or university  an enlightening experience  i am arguing against 1 because through my experiences of formal schooling and educational parental practices we are inadvertently sucking the enlightening elements from childrens learning in place of definition 2 i use learning to describe the free and enjoyable exploration and assimilation of cultural ideas and concepts this is an imperfect substitutions but the best i currently have  while the difference between education and learning may seem semantic it is useful to create a distinction between these terms education has come to refer to the compulsory organised educator led systematic exchange of cultural information from one generation to the next an extrinsically motivated process often enforced through punitive and coercive means learning on the other hand is best described as the selfdirected and intrinsically motivated acquisition of cultural information this is a naturally autotelic process that all humans engage in as long as they have been able to retain their evolutionary drive to explore and learn in education we are taught how to make a clay model through learning we explore how to make a clay model in line with our own thoughts and feelings the significance of this distinction is vast in regards to the effect on our learning  school and all its associates preschools further education higher education are educational institutions that provide some form of access to learning opportunities though they come with conditions and for children are mandatory you have to be there and you have to learn whats on the curriculum regardless of your personal interest or investment indeed schooling will often reduce opportunities to engage in selfdirected learning while there is some specific knowledge that it is vital for children to know school is not best way to ensure children have access to and understand the importance of this information  humans are born with the drive to learn preinstalled it is an evolutionary trait fundamental to our success as a species and our continued development as a civilisation the greatest strength of learning is that it is intrinsically motivated meaning we do not need external rewards or threats to motivate us to do anything about it its like a perpetual motion machine and all it needs is space to keep moving the problem is that extrinsic motivation motivation to gain rewards or avoid punishments is seductive and powerful in fact if we begin to offer extrinsic motivators for an existing intrinsically motivated behaviour the intrinsic motivation disappears and does not easily return while intrinsic motivation is selfperpetuating extrinsic motivation requires constant reinforcement or else the learned behaviors deteriorate and may eventually disappear furthermore we are far more creative when learning exploring or expressing through intrinsically motivated autotelic means because we have nothing to lose if you want your reward you are going to take the safe option every time you know it gets the job done so why risk creativity  our educational institutions are built on extrinsic motivators for the very reason that it was necessary to use coercive means to get children to learn this stuff children are emphatically not intrinsically motivated to learn everything on the curriculum while it could have been argued that we needed to give children this vital knowledge base in order to ensure their future success and survival this is no longer the case the advent of the internet and the smartphone have given almost everyone immediate access to the entire collection of humanities recorded knowledge or at least more than enough to get you started on any field of knowledge you may want to engage with as a result our educational institutions are obsolete now only providing laboured access to semiknowledgeable individuals teachers in an environment of stifled creativity and authoritarianism even the niche fields of brilliant academics can often be accessed online the only reason access to some knowledge is still limited is that exploitative luddites are trying to prop up a cash cow that has recently become deceased  with this obsolescence school has become little more than a holding pen for children to waste their lives in waiting for their parents to get home from wasting their lives at work talk about dystopian not only this but the archaic practices of a fundamentally flawed education system are actively damaging the mental and emotional wellbeing of our children at a time when they are most highly responsive to learning and most vulnerable to trauma the damage lasts a lifetime and many never get back what they have taken from them i will not even begin to delve into the damage a conformist system has on those who are neurological physiologically or experientially unable to conform  our defense of education stems from a lack of understanding of childrens true abilities children are voracious learners who only stop when they find something more interesting or collide with an immovable authoritarian object such as a teacher with a schedule to maintain there is an alternative but it is radically different from anything in existence today and not something i am yet able to effectively paint a picture of it will however take a drastically different community based format where an open learning environment is created for people of all ages to learn together sharing knowledge and working collaboratively where parents free from work are actively engaged in every aspect of their childs learning process providing a cultural and emotional anchor from which a child can and will find their own feet  not only is this the natural progression from the counteroppressive antiwork attitude but it is a means of explosive creative diversity when done right and a radical change that will be necessary for the adaptation of the human race to suit the needs of our unpredictable future  this is but a fraction of my thinking that ive been able to force out through my fingers but i hope it has at least created some discomfort with the idea of sending children to school that you did not have before school is no place for a child  i am very keen to discuss any perceived flaws in my line of argument as i am still very much working it all out for myself  thanks,i76t1l

830,"It's not enough to be exploited, you have to be gagging for it and exploit yourself some more.",absolutely agree  in the other hand some people dont just grudge through work they try to make the world a better place and get a sense of accomplishment out of doing the difficult task hard work is a virtue of ts a passion or a calling rather than just a paycheck you would willingly work more hours than required its about thriving rather than just surviving  grant that this isnt the case for many people but were taking about those that at least might   reply giveaward share report have ,i2fiss
831,I wish that I had less Hypocrisy for the Homeless,   hello everyone is been a while since i created a post in here i had many faces and many life events none of which were at the same level as the vagabonds on this sub maybe when my wife and i left home and had to sleep in my financed car for some weeks with no income but even so i wasnt a true vagabond at heart sometimes i dance with the idea especially knowing how meaningless it is having to do something for 40 hours to receive papers in which everyone in society agreed in the monetary value of it even so to the point of judging other peoples values by the amount of money they hoard  i include myself in this mess since i never helped any homeless and dont even acknowledge them on the streets because they are crazy or just a druggie this mindset buggies me since i always been a lurker of this sub for years also always having trouble fitting in societys need for the constant state of production my life situation is closer to them than to the rich which is funny of how much the average person works for how little freedom and money they have the majority of those that have to work dont have access to healthcare and are not even the honor of the roof they live in they are 2 to 3 paychecks away to becoming homeless  of course i want homeless to have shelter to receive aid to receive better jobs psych help if need it but those are concepts that go in the political field if i truly believed i would do something to help either preaching the word or volunteering i feel even worse than my paycheck goes 80 on bills the rest i use for traveling which is something that i could do without working right now i am sitting on my porch reading a book looking at the trees as the wind and sun interact with the scenery and i feel satisfied this is what makes me happy it is my day off and i think of how privilege i am but why should i feel this way why i have to work 40 hours overnight if my needs are that simple and why is there more people who cant afford even that that they cant have a roof over their heads and the simple need for food it is something to keep in mind every day  anyway an outflow from my day off hope it is understandable a long time lurker and wish anyone reading this post the best this post the original intent was aimed at the rvagabond community,i38vwa

869,Any former teachers? (Or teachers who want to quit?),i quit my first teaching job about a year ago i quit around 34 through my first year i havent returned to teaching for several reasons after i quit i was so burnt out i couldnt do anything but live off of my savings and shut myself in   ive been thinking a lot about work and stability i wanted to see why other people got into teaching and why those same people left or want to leave  personally i just couldnt work anymore i was so emotionally and physically exhausted i worked seven days a week because it never seemed like i could get ahead of all of my responsibilities i was totally alienated from my peers as well almost everyone there hated being there the second the work day was over people packed their things so they could spend a few meager hours with their families before they had to shut in and grade the job was also to be done at homethis meant we were also alienated from our families   teaching in its current model basically requires you to work two jobs the school only pays you for direct instruction they do not treat planning as part of the job thats not my main issue though if you care about the children or the nature of the work it wouldnt matter how much schools dedicated to compensation i dont want to work two jobs and be paid for two jobs i just want to work and be paid to perform one job i actually enjoyed thinking of lessons and preparing them until i had to do so very much of it   i found the work i was assigning was pretty pointless it was all career based it was all numbers pushing there was an obsession with standardized testing and sat or act scores the administration was obsessed with the schools letter grade the same way capitalists are obsessed with gdp or some other shit that doesnt reflect the quality of life for the average person education is actually really subjective there is this constant pressure to measure output however   the schools also focus on certain subjects like english and math the school was so in need of core teachers that i a person who has a license to teach history was hired as an english teacher because of some previous tutoring experience if you can find a job within your subject area your focus isnt very much respected anyway   i know this was a bit long i was curious as to how other people felt i havent the slightest idea of how to solve these issues,i380bp
870,Another reason why you should slack off extra hard today.,so raises promotions all those things those companies dangle in front of us to extract more work from us   when you think about it from his perspective why would your boss pay you more   they already got you employed youre already slaving for them they pay you what they pay you and youre busting your ass already why the hell would they actually go through with a raise  they got what they wanted just by dangling the possibility of a raise in front of you  your productivity   or maybe they will give it to you  have fun with 3 its nothing to them and its nowhere close to what the added work you had to do to get it was worth  but hey they didnt lie you got a raise    i used to believe in all this shit drank the corporate koolaid or whatever worked myself to the bone actually almost to death then i woke up   im still making the same amount of money doing bare minimum than busting my ass so im just reminding you to slack today extend that break have an especially weak bladder on this fine friday   fuck them,i5ay6a

874,"Seriously, how do you actually get a job? It feels like an impossible thing. One of the reasons I support a job guarantee program and universal programs for basic biological needs: to break the mold of workplace ""productivity"" coercion",dont have a degree get a degree got a degree get a better degree have a good degree you are overqualified or should have gotten an internship the individual is to blame not the system just because 1000 people apply for a singlespot internship doesnt mean the system is broken you are just a bad candidate oh we shipped more jobs to china dont worry about it we get access to their educated workforce as well it is great for consumers and our bottom line  have crippling debt and even worse depression tough shit thats just life get used to it you think your low wage job sucks i did even worse for way less pay and never complained  get a job join the cult gatekeep others today  so if jobs are so important why are they so difficult to get and even if you get one eventually it is a lower hanging one that only allows you to gain skills for other lower hanging jobs it isnt like the 725 minimum wage work is training you to become a doctor engineer coder or something difficult but rewarding no the joke becomes that you have to get into massive amounts of debt for the potential of getting something that isnt retail or fast food to join a company cult and become indoctrinated and this requires you to not have had any issues physically or mentally when growing up and the ability to read at a college and post college level surprisingly rare in the usa  so why is getting a good job so difficult systemically there are a lot of factors at play but no one is allowed to criticize the system so the individual is the only thing society focuses on as a distraction  what has been your experience,i2ga2x

878,Just a little vent,sorry for how long this will be   just found this subreddit that perfectly sums up my feelings especially since covid started about my job  work in general just thought id rant to people that would know how im feeling i cant complain to a lot of my family because they just say well you have to work it is what it is just go back to school idk what id get another degree in and also easier said than done and more debt just get another job again easier said than done you have a good job just suck it up  i have a bachelors in psychology i was originally planning on getting a masters or phd and going into academia or maybe going for therapy  social work for veterans that did not end up happening getting to know myself better i knew i would be a poor fit for those jobs and i hated school college was miserable for me   right after i graduated i went to work managing short term disability claims for a fortune 500 company the perks the pay allows me to live comfortably i dont have to work evenings  holidays  nights my manager and most of my coworkers are awesome i have full wfh schedule since covid  the cons boring office job stuck behind a desk for 8  85 hrs per day the work is stressful and too much for one person to handle youre on the phone with disgruntledrude people for most of the day everything you do is ranked by metrics ex calls taken calls made claim decisions made etc   our workload has doubled in the past several months due to covid and there is no end in sight another office is in an even worse spot than we are so we need to help them and werent even asked if we wanted to so because were helping them we are now falling even more behind our department is basically going up in flames and there isnt any relief for this coming people are constantly quitting going out on leave calling out randomly if they dont flake out on work then they are constantly stressed snapping crying or just generally miserable  anxious  depressed and the work keeps piling on us because the more people that get covid the more claims we get the more claims we get the more calls we get which then puts us behind which increases call volume  which puts us more behind because were stuck getting a new call every 2 minutes its a never ending cycle so when people get a call they dont pick it up and let it roll over to the next person because theyre trying to get caught up then they get in trouble because they didnt pick up the call but then they also get in trouble because theyre not daycurrent on their daily tasks wtf our workload is over double what it should be something has to give eventually and were only human   then even at the best of times the people that dont do their job and just sit around dont ever get reprimanded or just get a slap on the wrist and then the people that do their work then have to do more work because they have to pick up the slack from the other people so im getting paid the same as this person who isnt doing their job so why would i do mine i could just go sit on the couch and clock out at 430 and say i was working   every day i fight the urge to quit but what would i do then i have to have something else lined up like it or not we need money to survive i have absolutely no clue what i want to do for a job i want to not work and have more time to do what i enjoy my grandfather passed away last week and didnt get to do some things he had been wanting to do it made me realize life is too short to put up with this nonsense i want to go hiking and camping with my dog i want to go on road trips i want to spend more time with my aging horse while i still can i want to spend more time reading and writing but at the end of the work day im so drained all i can do is watch tv and then i go to bed dreading waking up the next morning   if i had to pick a dream job it would be an author or a pilot unfortunately both are a little far fetched for me making enough money as an author to live off of is a combination of luck and great talent and to be a pilot you need big bucks to go through the training plus the aviation industry wont be doing too hot for quite a while because of covid   basically just feeling really stuck and depressed right now if this is how the rest of my life is going to be then im not looking forward to it,i2lnbx

883,Why is it so hard to fully enjoy time off from work?,tomorrow i go back to work after a week long vacation and all i can think about is the distinct feeling that i wasted my time off obviously because of the pandemic we were limited in what we could do ie no major travel even if we could afford it but just the time away from work should be enough right throughout the week we went to a local state park did a little biking ordered takeout relaxed spent time on our hobbies but even with all that each day was a count down until the vacation was over and i still wish we couldve done more to make the most of our time now its sunday night before returning to the grind in the morning and i just have this heavy feeling of depression why is it so much harder to return the longer a vacation is is this what life will be for me for likely the next 50 years working full time at a job i mostly tolerate just to afford existence and not even being able to fully enjoy the few times a year i can get away is there any possibility of ever getting to a place where we could work part time or even not at all without sacrificing a ton along the way all this is just hitting me really hard right now sorry for the rant,i2mz0c

891,"Have worked through this pandemic and made less money than those not working, had my job held over my head, and became more stressed than ever.",sorry for the rant but i need to get this out im 21 and a debt collector for two very large banks who finance for multiple stores ive worked here for 2 years and have been a in the top 15 of collectors multiple times over 300 associates but its never good enough right now im paid 17 an hour its not bad except for the fact ever at that rate i still cant afford a place to live and have money to put into savings my time here has been nothing but negative every day we receive emails with our stats that constantly remind you you arent meeting goal stats even when im a top collector im not meeting goals because those stats dont determine your collecting like they think and tell us they do supervisors constantly reminding you youre not meeting goals and pitting you against everyone else one of my supervisors is a snake and i despise him 6 months ago he called me in his office saying i broke a rule which wasnt a rule but he saved me from the corrective so now i owe him he constantly has it out for people and will manipulate you non stop the higher ups arent any help and will do the same thing if you have a legitimate argument with stats and facts to back it up they use hypothetical numbers to confuse you then talk circles around you until you give up  i collect the company over 360000 a year and make less than 35k before taxes and yet through this whole pandemic my supervisors have been holding my job over my head because im not ranking still collecting 30k a month they dont care that im not ranking because i didnt cheat to build a pipeline of payments 12 months out and can now focus of collecting for other months instead of same month i and every other bottom collector collect about 20k more same month than the top collectors who collect maybe 9k same month of course we cant catch up though because we are on correctives for ranking and dont have the 6 months to build up a pipeline large enough to compete with those top collectors the bank ultimately prospers off this though as they have the top collectors floating on pipelines and collecting for a year out and then us bottom collectors collecting same month payments just to try to stay afloat we are working to pay the bonuses the past couple months have been 5k incentive checks for the top 15 for the top collectors while being shit on and told we should feel grateful for our job  while im having meetings every day with my supervisors chewing me out for not being as productive as they want me to be because i ran out of my medications three weeks earlier than i was supposed to because i trippled my daily prescription just to operate on the level they wanted me to despite my stats showing i rank in the top when i make fewer calls and not burn myself out people are collecting unemployment and making almost 2 times more than i make in a month while im trying to juggle my job the risk of homelessness family crisis and my own mental health people are going on shopping sprees  they dont care about me back in february they called me in their office and asked what they could do to help me perform again they didnt even bat an eye when i told them i need 140 mg of adderal as thats what i was taking the 3 months prior that i ranked while working 70 hour weeks they dont care that my body aches it feels like im having a heart attack and cant sleep for days on end because of what i have to do to work the way they want me to,i4g8p0

909,Do you have a bank account which generates interest? Do you pay into a 401k or pension scheme?,one thing i dont like about this sub is the bad rep which all land lords seem to get there was a post which was glorified on here not long ago from someone saying that their tenant had moved to a different country taken the keys and not paid for a couple of months rent and people were congratulating this as if it was a good thing  most landlords are just people whove worked hard and saved up enough to buy a second home for some extra income theyre not millionaires with 100 houses they still have a mortgage to pay on the house most of the time and the amount of money they make directly from rent is very little  i understand that you might be against the current system but ive no idea how you can be against the people struggling to do their best in the current system if someone manages to scrape together enough money to get a mortgage on a second home that doesnt make them a monster it makes them someone whos trying to live within this system and provide a decent quality of life for themselves and their family  are you against landlords if you are and you have a bank account which generates interest or you pay into a 401k or pension scheme then youre a complete hypocrite how do you think these systems generate money property stocks and bonds they use your money to invest in things to make more money to then pay you,i46epb

919,"Put my 2 weeks in, need ideas",i work at a gas station and it sucks for all the reasons you would imagine but the real reason i started keeping my ears out for a new job is that i found out 2 of my coworkers were convicted of sexually assaulting children and possessing child pornography another did time for neglecting his own children so badly that they were unresponsive when cps came to investigate  i felt bad for snooping into their past i believe people like that should have jobs rather than be put out on the street to reoffend but i cannot stand next to these people for 8 hours and pretend to be their buddy and fuck my boss for not disclosing this information when he hired me  i have another job lined up so i need some ideas on how to live it up for the next two weeks my first idea is to wait for someone to come up to the counter and say sorry i left my mask in the car this happens at least once a day my boss refuses to turn away customers without masks instead of telling the customer its fine im going to say something like god forbid you should have to walk all the way back to your car to protect me and my family from a lethal incurable disease  i will try to steal a decent amount before i leave as well and give nice customers free things but i need more ideas what would you do at work if you knew you had two weeks left and another job lined up,i48xhx

926,A rant about the nature of work and some other thoughts about it,hi all been a long time lurker here first time poster  first off id like to express a thank you to this community for being one of the few places both online and in rl that express the same sentiments and thoughts i have about work for a long time i thought i was the only person who felt this way i was surrounded by people hungry for more work who identified with their careers or were aggressively competitive to achieve goals i just couldnt understand ie become next second assistant manager of corporation x etc i thought it was all bunkum but i never expressed it i was too afraid of being marked out as weirdlazysocialistfreeloader even now although i have revealed my thoughts and feelings about work to one or two people im still pretty careful about what i say career culture is strong but here even the very idea of no work at all ever again is celebrated such an extremist idea from where ive come from  so thank you  at the moment i am currently working fulltime in marketing for a nonprofit i am on medical leave for about a week and a half for workrelated stress and anxiety right now i feel so much calmer and settled i will be seeing a psychologist in a few weeks to sort of a number of issues but ive often wondered would it be even necessary if i never had to work again or at least work far less hours ive also wondered if a lot of mental health issues around the world could easily be resolved with less or even no work   i think the thing that irks me the most about most of the jobs ive ever had is the inanity and lack of purpose or point behind them oh sure there is a point to it  paycheck but any other meaning it had was to me so abstract so removed from reality it often made me question why we did such activities an example would be formatting fancy pants documentation for government consumption but knowing these would be rarely read almost never adhered to and would end up at the bottom of some bureaucrats dusty paper stack it was just to ensure another box was ticked at my current position i hardly see the connection between what i do and the workplaces goals or that even my work contributes at all to benefit our nonprofits recipients   on top of all that there are the endless meetings where nothing of true value is discussed or concluded upon the managing of personalities and politics the cringy team building activities that were created in order to force build friendships between people all this cream and cherries on top just adds to the sheer inanity of my current job it seems to be imho that most modern day work is ultimately empty and has no intrinsic value besides ensuring people have a paycheck to keep them from being homeless  over time as i dealt with this i have become more and more despondent as of late i have reached a point where i questioned even the point of existing if all it was was endless pointless work the fact that we trade up finite precious time to do empty meaningless work just to survive it is as if our lives our marked with a monetary value and we are reduced down to just economic inputoutput units it was this entrapment and dehumanization that spurred my despair and anger into life we are given enough to not drown sometimes not even then but never enough to clamber onto the shore   i tried to manage this growing despair and sense of meaningless so i did the usual journal exercise attempt to establish some sleeping pattern didnt really work talk it out with friends and family but i couldnt really express just how deep my hopelessness went i applied for new jobs parttime roles but in this day and age jobs are hard to come by and every job has a hundred applicants or more i attempted to upskill hard to do on an ft position just too tired to do anything tried to consider employment through different perspectives and of course browsing rantiwork  at best some of these methods mitigated my despair and constant questioning but eventually that sense of hopelessness overwhelm and meaningless came to colour my whole world i would attend work each day my stomach roiling and my heart hammering dreading the day ahead as of late i went to the doctor expressed what was going on in regards to my mental health and she was sympathetic towards me  which was surprising we organized some medical leave counselling and antidepressants the antidepressants are what helped me work full time once upon a time i decided to go off them earlier this year due to feeling extremely flat and emotionless about most things in my life it turns out zombifying your brain is how one is able to cope with ft work i have a little bit of hope back regardless of this   im not sure what ill do next ill enjoy my time off as much as i can but after thatidk im sorry for the long post i feel that there is nowhere or no one else i can truly express the depths of my thoughts or feelings on this topic so thank you for reading if you have gotten this far  ampx200b  tldr expressing my thoughts on the antiwork sentiment and basically my journey of how i got to this place thanks all,i5800r
927,Don't ever feel bad about work (or not working),right after my graduation a girl on my course posted that she had found her dream job in law at the time i looked the firm up and felt super jealous she basically had her life sorted straight out of college and i was struggling through applications and temp jobs  around 4 years later  a recruitment agency headhunted me and asked if i would be interested in a certain firm it rung a bell and after googling i realised its the same firm my old friend had got the dream job at years before two interviews later and i got the job too  i was thinking well good things come to those who wait then it turned out the boss was massively abusive always playing the blame game refused to provide training and was racist and at one time jokingly pushed me into a cupboard expected a fuckload of unpaid overtime but was never thankful banned staff from talking about salaries thats illegal here  i thought i could turn to my old friend but she was unrecognizable she pushed other staff under the bus at every chance after her initial post she never mentioned how bad the firm was she must have felt the same but then hardened and became cold like the bosses i can only imagine she swallowed her feelings and did everything to fit in  well i could not after 9 months of weeping on the way in and in the cubicles and deteriorating mental health i took the leap i left a job with guaranteed good pay and progression and jumped into the unknown unemployment and its honestly the best decision i ever made i still feel euphoria at how i escaped that place  tldr this just goes to show regardless what people post you dont know the real story you may think youre missing out when the reality is in fact awful and you dodged a bullet dont compare yourselves and always put your mental health first dont allow yourself to tie your worth to your ability to get a dream job because it probably doesnt exist,i2l5i4

930,A favourite book - Stone Age Economics by Marshall Sahlins,i am curious who else has read the above paper  book  it has been influential on me and my minimalism journey  i dont fully agree with all of the premises but i do think it was true at the time stone age but harder to achieve now given how society is in the throes of consumption    i find myself yearning for its simplicity but not yet sure how i carve that for me    the key part that stands out for me is the notion of original affluent society  taken from wikipedia for ease  ampx200b   through knowledge of their environment huntergatherers are able to change what foreigners may deem as meager and unreliable natural resources into rich subsistence resources through this they are able to effectively and efficiently provide for themselves and minimize the amount of time spent procuring food the food quest is so successful that half the time the people do not know what to do with themselves3httpsenwikipediaorgwikioriginalaffluentsocietycitenotesahlinsnew3 huntergatherers also experience affluence without abundance3httpsenwikipediaorgwikioriginalaffluentsocietycitenotesahlinsnew3 as they simply meet their required ends and do not require surplus nor material possessions as these would be a hindrance to their nomadichttpsenwikipediaorgwikinomad lifestyle the lack of surplus also demonstrates that they trust their environmenthttpsenwikipediaorgwikisocialenvironment will continuously provide for them by foraging only for their immediate needs among plentiful resources huntergatherers are able to increase the amount of leisurehttpsenwikipediaorgwikileisure time available to them thus despite living in what western society deems to be material poverty huntergatherer societies work less than people practicing other modes of subsistence while still providing for all their needs and therefore increase their amount of leisure time these are the reasons the original affluent society is that of the huntergatherer,i3ghwe

937,Power tip #2: bound your productivity,your work or your job is a relationship between you and another entity in which both parties try to maximize the profit they can extract from the other the problem is that in general there exists a large intellectual and power differential between the strategic capability of winning this game between the sole employee vs the corporation which has teams of experts dedicated towards widening this power dynamic ever further in the name of profit  this dynamic translates to a work condition for the employee that relentlessly approaches the conditions of slavery  no pay for exhaustingly laborious work keeping this in mind it is imperative to take the appropriate measures at both an individual and communal level to ensure that you are at least not complacent in allowing this quality of life degradation to proceed at full pace  bounding your productivity is something that anyone blue to white collar can and should be exercising to both maximize their quality of life and fend off an increasingly dystopian workplace which inevitably leads to greater income inequality for all here are some generalized tips around this matter  1 estimate the minimum level of productivity required to maintain your job for example if you are an hourly dishwasher and know that washing 100 dishes per hour is good enough to satisfactorily ensure job stability then there is no reason to make yourself go at a pace that achieves 101 dishes per hour be cognizant of the fact that this extra effort if expended is you voluntarily working for free and eating the full costs of labor and giving the full profit to your employer who is at war with you if its rush hour and the restaurant is backed up that is not your fault  there should be more dishwashers if you are comfortable talking with your coworkers this is a good mindset to share as it will alleviate significant pressure not just on you but on everyone fostering rewardless competition and peer pressure amongst coworkers is a strong tactic used by the employers to increase stress and productivity  costs that you pay but profits they take exclusively 2 realize the law of diminishing returns wants you to do less as visualized here0 an application of this law posits that the harder you work beyond your minimum level of productivity the less value you gain in proportion to each additional unit of energy expended this is bad for you the more bad it is for you the more beneficial it is to your employer as it asymptotically approaches the financial model of free slave labor for example this can be thought of as the following you get paid 10 for washing 100 dishes you get 15 for washing 200 dishes assuming the effort of washing dishes is nontrivial you would be best off maximizing your returns if you wash 100 dishes for 10 and then go do something else that has the value of at least about 3 an hour such as another job or relaxing the 3 as opposed to 5 is to make up for the fact that washing those additional 100 dishes is more exhausting than the first 100 dishes just like running the last mile of a marathon is more costly for your body than running the first mile  therefore you dont actually realize the full 5 of reward 3 discuss these dynamics with likeminded peers in the usa it is illegal to prevent employees from discussing salaries and pay rates you should aim to be more comfortable discussing this with peers because the employers cultivate and leverage this tabooculture to ensure they can pay you less than your coworkers who does the same job in the end it only hurts the employees first step towards this is to learn to approach these topics in a safe and calm manner the sooner employees stop being ignorant and silently complacent is the sooner you can aim to improve your situation remember you are getting ripped off  almost by definition of having a job  and you wont get a refund on this thats why you this is a hot issue and you are incentivized to address it asap you dont want to end up doing this too late as the poor employees of this famous company did recently 1  0 httpspmctrainingcomsitewpcontentuploads201804lawofdiminishingreturnschartpng 1 httpswwwbloombergcomnewsarticles20200803blizzardworkerssharesalariesinrevoltoverwagedisparities,i3vk1c
938,Power tip #1: understand they are your enemy,ive noticed that a lot of people dont understand the dynamic that they have with the workplace they are affiliated with  in fact its worse  they think they understand but are flawed this leads to massive losses that are hard to see as theyre not tangible beyond slowly seeping consequences such as frustration  it is faulty to believe that your workplace is your friend ally or your superior it is faulty to think that you should be extraordinarily grateful to have a job if you play the game of friendship with an agency that is playing the game of maximizing personal profits at the expense of others you will lose this is corroborated by the fact that you are on this sub in a miserable state of mind  realize that your employers entire relationship with you is defined by their attempts to maximize profits off you  how much they can steal and get away with this comes in many forms in which they give you less value than the value you provide them search wikipedia for scrips  dont let them do that treat them as the enemy but be polite work extra hour for free nah clock in only after youre arrived at the office and changed and done some prep work nah remember they are your enemy and you should try to treat them as such they sure treat you that way,i3pyvo

946,How do I retire early?,hey guys i am 23 years old and i work as a tech support in a phone company and i get paid minimum wage the job is quite easy even though the learning curve was quite steep but once you get the hang of it its quite nice bosses treat me good and i like everything about the job really except for the pay and also except for the fact that i despise work  i do not want to wake up every day and do this shit for 8 hours and i hate that it has become normalized in our societies that we have to do this until we die  so i am currently exploring real ways on how to escape this lifestyle i would really like to retire before i am 40 but that is of course just a dream as of now  my current plan is becoming a real estate agent where i should definitely be able to make at least 15x what i am making now and with possibilites of making a lot more if i work harder  with my savings i am going to invest them in stock options and index funds and by using the power of compound interest i should have enough money by the time i am 40 to retire basically just work if i want to or when i want to i have also explored some options by buying properties and renting them out or just doing fixer uppers but that takes more capital than i have as of now  i am actually a quite lazy person i do not like to work at all and i prefer to do my hobbies all the time video games fitness and weight lifting painting hiking photography and more i hate having to spend most of my waking hours on doing something i dont enjoy so that is why i am trying to create some concrete plan which will enable me to live my life freely  feel free to share your plans on how you are planning to retire early as well,i32980

950,Any social workers here?,so im at a crossroad in my life  im studying law got into it for idealistic reasons and while they still arent illegitimate goals or unattainable i just dont think that the actual work will make me happy or fulfilled the exploitative and alienating parts included but what the fuck can you do   i was thinking about what could be an actually helpful contribution to my surroundings is labor that can be sold and would suit me in a way that the actual work makes me somewhat happy and also fulfilled  since one of my bigger strengths lies in being socially capable and while im no genius i can confidently say that i have good emotional intelligence going for me so i thought about doing social work i volunteer in a homeless shelter if that experience counts for anything  any perspectives on this warnings advice,i3w2dr

955,Livestreaming and the Commodification of the Self,i often fantasize about how much better my life would be if i could make a living livestreaming though the more i think about it the more it seems like an illusory escape from the 95 grind that instead of enabling you to extract money from your hobbies just ends up blurring the line between leisure and work so much that the distinction becomes almost nonexistent  youre left with this strange amalgamation of something you do because you have to love it  spontaneity is crushed under the weight of expectation  you become the commodity  your time your personality your entire being is branded and assessed  never to exist privately and separate from your community ever again  you quite literally give up a part of yourself in return for the money and freedom that affords  just like a regular job  money is an abstraction for power nothing more  if we want to do away with work we have to do away with money  not literally but we have to kill our current collective conceptions of it as a real and finite resource because it isnt and if it is those things its only because most of us mostly agree but that agreement is the way the world is not the other way around  we can invert it together and we can meme ourselves better  or perhaps thats just a desperate attempt to cope with the hellscape that is earth,i4sxu3
956,My Experience,apologies for a long post i wrote this hoping to achieve some sort of catharsis from sharing with likeminded people tldr at bottom  i graduated college in 2011 and got a job shortly after a couple years into the job i was ready for something more i decided to quit and return to school to get a second bachelors degree and pursue a career in tech another 2 years later with second degree inhand i began searching for jobs  job searching is one of the most demoralizing and dehumanizing experiences a person can have i learned that tech jobs are on a whole new level of dumpster fire after months of applications rejections no responses and getting jerked around by elitist tech recruiters with superiority complexes i was finally hired by a large software company in a technical support role  there was no training zero comprehensive training on the software i was now expected to support despite this i was quickly thrown into action resolving issues for clients we were expected to just ask questions if we didnt know something imagine showing up to work every day having to ask your coworkers how to do your job having to ask how something was supposed to work having to ask how to go about investigating the cause of an issue everyone hired around the same time as me were in the same boat this software wasnt something that could be picked up easily at no point did i ever feel unqualified or incapable of performing my job the problem was the knowledge of the softwares complex functional and internal intricacies was a massive barrier to entry it was the most unintuitive and broken software ive ever encountered even after a year i still relied heavily on input from others to do my work  asking for help to do your job on a daily basis begins to affect your psyche it damages your confidence it makes you feel incompetant it makes you feel like a failure i had already begun slipping into anxiety and depression during the job search now the job itself was dragging me even deeper on top of that after the time taken by sleeping commuting and working i was left with only 4 hours of personal free time a day it was all chipping away at me at some point i realized i wasnt doing many of my hobbies anymore i went to bed and woke up every morning with sickening existential dread i came home from work with no motivation or energy to do anything else the negativity from work began to seep into my personal life i did this for 2 years  i eventually applied for a position in a different department of the company and was hired i saw it as an opportunity for a fresh start and it was one of the only ways to get a promotion at the time of starting the new job i was already well beyond the point of absolute soulcrushing burnout there was no training i was quickly thrown to the wolves working with clients again unlike the awesome people on my previous team the people on the new team were pretentious tryhard wannabe yuppies this was so far from the person i am i grew to detest them i had an absentee manager who largely ignored my emails asking for help or clarification on my duties i was pushed further to the breaking point when a coworker began shittalking me and the quality of my work both to my face and to my new team including my manager i will despise this individual for the rest of my existence despise is not a strong enough word after several months the day finally came my mental health was below rock bottom i couldnt think straight anymore i was losing the ability to function my brain felt like a mire of tv static at lightspeed at the end of the day i talked to my manager i said im done i resign today was my last day i just walked away i had done everything in my power to make the job work but at no point had this company ever invested any effort to set me up for success  i took a couple months off to regain some of my mental health after that i was able to get a parttime retail job while i worked on some personal projects this was february 2020 then coronavirus hit when asking my manager if i could wear a mask one day the response was ill have to check it might alarm the customers seems the companys bottom line was more important than my wellbeingalthough as far from essential as you can get this business remained open until they were legally forced to close by my states mandatory lockdown i was laid off the day of closing  its been a few months since then im profoundly disillusioned with our society my experiences left me cynical jaded and contemptuous toward the system as it exists i never want to work in corporate america again i never want to sit in an interview with some condescending hr manager testing how much boot im willing to lick before theyll hire me i just want to spend my time doing things i enjoy with the people i love i was able to find a job back at the first company i worked for after college back where the story started i actually enjoy it and im working to monetize some of my hobbies i am now in the best mental health of my adult life quitting my tech job was one of the best decisions ive ever made  i want to extend thanks to this community for sharing your stories and helping me feel like im not so alone in these sentiments  tldr got a degree got a job got burned out got a second degree got a tech job suffered immense mentalemotional stress and trauma as a result quit on the spot now pursuing a more meaningful and fulfilling life,i4v9ci

959,I got let go after working a global pandemic for these assholes.,i worked at a national pizza chain that is the opposite of dominos i was working to put myself through college i know this is the part where reddit writes me off for working a minimum wage job and calls me lazy or some shit because it has happened before but i work harder than a lot of people and also fuck you every one working full time deserves a living wage and im speaking mostly on behalf of my older coworkers   anyway when this all started we didnt know what was going on we just knew things were getting shut down but we were considered essential and had to work if we quit we wouldnt qualify for any sort of unemployment and if we took a brief leave to get things sorted for the pandemic or if we got sick it would be unpaid at the time we also were told we couldnt wear a mask because it would scare people   when the stay at home orders were issued we were hit with mass amounts of large orders it was hell on top of that we were scared we didnt know who this was going to affect or who was most likely to die from it we werent allowed to stand six feet from customers and were never given plexiglass   we were all overworked i was exhausted and anyone who says that isnt skilled labor can go fuck themselves because i cant tell you how many people quit because they couldnt keep up and that was before the pandemic i couldnt keep up with school once covid hit id be so tired when i got home id knock out on the couch and sleep until my next shift   eventually when the state opened back up we slowed down and my hours were cut significantly the state shut back down soon after but the company made less profits during that time and with all the employees testing positive and having to temporarily close stores our store closed permanently   these companies need some sort of regulations so that if we are going to be beholden to them then they are going to be beholden to us essential my ass big shout out to osha for protecting the workers and for all the karens i had to deal with for what is and was a shit time for me and my family elderly parents as well shout out to our ceo david briggs still making billions and one of president trumps close pals   i would also like to say that when i am done with school and if i ever own a company or employ anyone i promise that i will treat them fairly i will not take advantage of another human being for my own personal gain i hope you all will do the same so that we have a future we can be proud of please continue to fight for workers rights i know i will,i54bub

971,What can We actually do to change the nature of work aside from sharing and reposting memes on some obscure corner of the Internet?,thats a trick question because i think memes are the key to changing how we view and understand work and all the other concepts intertwined with it  value labour  property hell existence itself  its memes all the way down  but seriously just look at the front page of this sub  its all memes  the internet is a network of connection between nearly every single human consciousness on the planet  information now travels both instantly and constantly  the internet is human connection manifest  what do we use it for  memes  of course were already witnessing how that can be twisted and perverted to serve the interests of capital  disinformation distraction polarization  but maybe all we need is a critical mass of awareness  awareness that cant be stopped given the instantaneous spread of ideas and information  what if 90 of people in your community agreed friday was the first day of the weekend  thats literally all it would take to be true  now what if 90 of people in the world accept money as an illusory abstraction of power with no actual power outside of a shared and communal belief in its realness and legitimacy   can we memes ourselves better or is the memetic gravity of consumption so great that destruction by our own hands is inevitable  memes gt guillotines,i4ybjn
972,Told work to get fucked today.,for a bit of context i work in childcare a famously shit work environment toxic culture high stress ridiculous bureaucracy and minimum wage i am deeply commited to the betterment of early educational methods as i believe it is the most effective path to radical systemic change as such i have been trying to maintain a career in this rancid sector  i have always stood up for what i believe is right and have tried my best to adhere to the rules of the system regardless i am not well liked by my managers its hard tk reconcile the need to put children first when profit always comes first   anyway prior to covid i experienced burnout and suffered from depression and suicidal ideation there was a rather major breakdown at work and my manager told me to take a couple of weeks off paid to get myself back together unexpectedly generous but im sure you can guess where this is going  into my second week of compassionate leave and the pandemic is declared sending my mental health spiraling further out of control i get in touch with work and tell them i need more time but am happy to use up my holidays as was agreed im advance with my manager unfortunately my vile area manager gets back to me explaining that paid leave is not offered by the company and they would be retroactively removing the offer forcing me to use my holiday for the weeks i had already been off when challenged my manager made some weak excuse that i misunderstood her meaning it was clear as day at the time but silly me for trusting managers without a written agreement i was too busy thinking about killing myself to ask for it in writing  after this i asked to be furloughed instead but was told i could not be furloughed because i needed to be back to work ready and my mental health suggested i was not  as a result i have been signed off on statutory sick pay of 9585 a week since the pandemic was declared   now the fun bit as childcare settings are preparing to open again they want me back at work because i am the most highly qualified person in the place sorry still sick while being signed off i have adapted my life arangements and no longer need the job now im signed off for an additonal 3 months after which im not coming back they cant fire me or fill my position because i still work there so they just have to sit quietly and stew while their industry collapses  i feel great  that story was longer and less exciting than i anticipated so thanks for listening find the small ways to fuck the system and fuck it good  tldr  work screwed me over out of spite so i screwed them in return,i4wugi
973,Only losers willingly partake in systems that can't feed everyone,capitalism is a demonstrably failed system you can point to its failures to prove this point like the fact that capitalism is unable to make sure all humans have food water and shelter while having access to modern tech  any system that fails something so essential and basic with modern technology at its disposal is beyond laughable and only a complete loser would think otherwise   if you cant figure out that humans deserve food water and shelter and that your current system isnt capable of providing that then you are by definition a loser   you lost    you let a economic system determine right from wrong for you rather than reality again by definitionhttpswwwmerriamwebstercomdictionaryloser this means you are a loser   definition of loser  a person who is incompetent or unable to succeed   just like your system was so incompetent as to be unable to provide the basics of a human life to all you too were incompetent and unable to recognize it as a problem and instead defended it you are incompetent and unable to succeed in terms of recognizing reality because you think your economic system determines right from wrong   i honestly feel bad for you and those like you who are going to be lead down a path so detrimental to your own well being as well as the well being of your entire species   instead of a life spent gaining wisdom bettering yourself focusing on your family your health having fun doing what is right and contributing to society youre going to work in exchange for things no human should ever be deprived of youre going to be forced to live in a way that is not actually realistic and you and your world will not be as complete or healthy as would be possible if you were not having your time taken by a outdated economic system   and youre going to defend it in masses thus signing your kids up for the same unrealistic unhealthy and morally deprived system youre going to tell them its right youre going to tell them people like me should be ignored that earning a living by spending their lives doing things they dont want is okay that forcing billions of humans to do things against their own will is moral   the silver lining is that capitalists are wrong and this is easy to demonstrate they are not living their lives in well rounded or healthy ways they are not setting good examples of what it is to be human for their children people are starting to wake up and all i can say is thank you to all the capitalists for years of making bad arguments and stating that only market participants deserve food your bad arguments and immoral stances have helped our side a lot  tldr  giving up years of your life to immoral economic systems is for losers,i5aehf

984,We live in a world where no one wants to work yet everyone works,i have not found a single person who enjoys working for someone else on this entire planet yet most people like 99 of people work for someone else and ones that dont started their own thing cuz they hated working for someone else not because they wanted to work no one on this planet wants to work that is the greatest consensus on anything ive ever heard of yet wtf everyone fucking works all the fucking time   and not only that but it is essentially a species self induced survival of the fittest game the kind of work you do directly correlates to your status and ur attractiveness and ur options in selection of a mate we havent conquered natures suppression humans are now the suppressor of ourselves the amount of money u earn essentially determines ur chances of reproducing we are a species that is currently selecting for who makes money the best   but money is just abstracted symbol of value created by a monetary system enforced by a government the moneycredit in the economy is always fixed unless policy is implemented to either destroy currency or devalue it by printing so this means that profit loss is net zero sum all profit is gained through another persons loss all income that a business or businessman generates in another persons spending unless i print money into my own pocket in which case the price is everyones money devalues by some tiny fraction due to the reduction in scarcity of money   thus any excessive amount of profit can only be obtained through excessive inticement of spending otherwise the exchange of money should be balanced with the good of service provided for that money this means that to excel in this game of money u either have to be really good at legally robbing people of money by creating addictive goods and services that cause human dependency on ur business or you earn and spend in such an insane amount such as being donald trump whereby u are constantly discounting ur earnings by taking on debt such that ur input output makes u seem really rich yet net balance you have almost nothing if the flow of money stopped what fucking madness is this sick game what does any of this have to do with happiness and living a fulfilling meaningful purposeful life   wake the fuck up people,i1oci4
