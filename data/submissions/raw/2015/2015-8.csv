0,I actually love being unemployed,"You know what? I'm not going to lie. I love being unemployed. Sure, the money is a little tight, and I had to sell some stuff which I haven't used: my old amp, a guitar, and a mixer. I'd prefer to have that stuff, but I couldn't continue with my job, and my emergency fund didn't cover an extra month off. 

That being said, I *LOVE* staying at home and doing what I want to do. I go to the gym and actually feel refreshed and content because I don't need to immediately head to work afterwards. I can study something which I actually love studying, and can see myself progressing every day (a second language). I feel well-rested, more extroverted, and more loving to the people around me. 

I think there is a misconception that the unemployed don't want to work. I tutored for a week, and plan to tutor next week as well. I really like working, but my preference leans more towards 15 hours a week than 50 hours a week. 

Honestly, I have a substitute teaching job, and I'm a little nervous that one day I'll have to step up to be a full-time teacher to support my family. It's so stressful. I won't have to time to learn what I want to learn and I won't have time to excercise to be healthy. 

I am praying for some monumental thing like a windfall to allow me to work at a more leisurely pace...more of a marathon than a constant sprint. I don't care about the status of work, and I don't care about making way more money than I need. Hell, all I really need is my computer, food, and my apartment and I'm happy!

When I first became unemployed for a month out of university, I felt this enormous stigma. Like it was a tribal society, and everyone was pushing me away from the central fire. I don't feel like that anymore. I feel like *this* is the way for me to live. Leisurely, happy, content! 

I've studied about 3-4 hours every day consistently during my unemployment...I love working, but I don't love trading my labor (and my life) to a corporation with foreign leaders. ",False,3i7ksa,Ghandithegman,http://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/3i7ksa/i_actually_love_being_unemployed/,16,28
