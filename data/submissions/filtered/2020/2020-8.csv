11,"Capitalism sucks, y'all.",as a follow-up from  my previous post https www reddit com r antiwork comments ih9lbn i just got fired as an amazon driver  i'd like to say that payroll can be at least as bad as working  my gf and i were recently employed by the same amazon delivery service provider  hereafter  dsp  but she transferred to another dsp shortly before i got canned  we both got emails from our former dsp on august 28 th about an issue with adp  saying that direct deposit would come through within 48 hours  it hasn't yet been 48 hours as i write this  but she got paid and i'm wondering why i didn't when we both have direct deposit set up  possibly the 49 12 hours i clocked last week  but i don't know for sure  the email did say that paper checks would be sent out within 24 hours  but i really don't want to wait a week for my money  i'm not saying anything is malicious on any side  but it is at the very least fairly suspicious   couple that with the fact that i spent almost  300 on books and uniforms for the coming fall semester  nursing school ftw  and that was  after   1000 in school bookstore credit  plus the fact that i had to go downtown to the main campus to get the supplies when there's a campus close enough for me to walk if i'm feeling really ambitious  which is where i'd taken all my previous classes  and i hope you can understand why i'm pissed   the only saving grace is that classes and clinicals this semester are all virtual because of the pandemic  though i remember hearing something about in-person clinicals later in the semester   sorry for the rant  i didn't know where else to post this ,ij1sfz

15,Fuck these shifts (rant),working retail i get how your weekends are non existent and you can work 7 days straight to only get a day off  they can t give me two days off in a row  but give me a break with these hours  people   these shifts aren t necessarily horrible  i ve done  clopens  before where you work 2pm-10 and then come in the next day at 5am  but the 2pm-10 one day and the 8am-4 the next day is one of the stupidest things  at least with the clopens i know i m getting fucked  i know when i get home from clopens i know i won t get my 8 hours so i can take my time doing my home duties   these 2pm-10 and 8am-4 give me just enough time to get home  cook  eat  water my plants  brush my teeth and immediately go to sleep   i have to speed run my few precious hours off of work in order to get the basic home chores before going to bed because my manager doesn t know how to make a decent schedule    but even if i do get in bed at record time  i start to think   with the current 16 hours of work  i only have 2 hours of free time  and i spend the next 3 hours tossing in turning in anger because how fucked i m getting    but then i realized  i can call out  so i did  i get a strike and if i do it another two times i ll get a write up  but i m okay with that  i think i might call out again tomorrow for shits  this job has controlled my life more than the virus has and it feels good to just do what   i want for once   wall of text i know but i m here right now drinking some coffee and chatting with my brother when i should be at work doing a shift i don t like   and if i feels great ,iib4jx

95,Someone who is 80 years old has only lived for 40-50 years. Why should we waste that?,we spend about half our lives asleep  this means that everyone s lifespan is effectively halved  because in terms of experiences  we don t have any when we re asleep outside of occasional dreams that we forget anyway  it s not precise  so if we work 9-5  that s 8 hours of work  then  there s 8 hours of sleep  out of 24 hours  that s 16 hours of the day spent not living  that means you only get a third of your life to spend how you want to spend it  and even then most of that is doing chores  or work outside of school uni job   fuck that ,iivpba
96,A question for r/antiwork: to what avail?,i believe in this type of philosophy  one were people should have more spare time to live a life with things they want to do  rather than wasting their time at work   only working because they need to make a living  pay the bills  feed yourself  etc   the only problem i have with this subreddit  is what can we do   it s not like anything is going to change in the foreseeable future  and even if we strive for automation with technology there will still be people to need to build the robots to take over jobs   i ve been fortunate enough to just work part time so far and be fairly sustainable  but at some point a full time job is going to be a reality   it s just difficult to process how a community of anti-workers exist  but that society is very unlikely to change and could careless   whatever we value or discuss here is inevitably futile as it is very unlikely anything will be different   besides  it s not like anyone on this sub has actually boycotted working to prove their point  not like that would do anything anyways if it s only 1 person out of  7 billion people ,iizxwj

128,I sometimes feel guilty and untalented about not wanting to turn my passions into full time jobs,the title says it all  i always viewed creativity passion as a sweet escape from the boring everyday life i am forced to live  working 11 hours a day  or less occasionally  thankfully  thanks to school  math  science and physics tutors and homework  i was forced to do a thing i hated or at least did not like that much for most of my day  and then came home  finished the rest of it and did what i wanted  i don't want any advice in this thread  i just want to hear someone elses experiences because i am feeling depressed  numb  and hopeless  filled with despair  i have severe mental health issues caused by bullying  shunning  school and extreme homework hours  it's been like that for three years but things were so much better before 2020 started  to a point where my problems were somewhat managable and limited    anyway  so i like creating  but how on earth am i still expected to enjoy doing it for 8 hours a day every day  how on earth am i supposed to not get sick of it  why do people think that the things we adore can always be fullfilling full time careers for us   i would not mind a part time career related to the things i love  i want to be a part time author  for example   sometimes i feel like a hypocrite for not wanting to do the things i enjoy full time  they are the loves of my life  what on earth would i do without them  but the idea of doing them for 8 hours a day makes me feel sick in the stomach  and i often work on projects for more than three hours  because i genuinely enjoy it but why does any sane person do the thing they love for 40  hours a week  do they just deal with it because the idea of working a normal job and having less time for their passion scares them    sometimes i feel like my art is less important  like my talent is nonexistent and like i shouldn't even bother to create to begin with if i am not gonna turn this to a full time job  like i am worthless compared to those who do it for 8 hours a day  but isn't it more mentally healthy to do what you  like for a limited amount of hours a day instead of esentially having your life revolve around it  if i want to create something  i don't even need a boss to help me with it  i can film a whole choreography without even leaving my bedroom  thats what the internet is for    i have a cartoonist animator friend who has similar feelings towards his work  he says he just wants to become a doctor and that he will hate his passion if he starts getting money for it  a painter friend of mine started selling her work  or doing orders for clients and she started hating her art  now she also has a condition in her wrists that prevents her from painting    why on the fucking planet is doing something  even something you love for so long  many artists  such us ballerinas work for more than 8 hours  considered normal and healthy  i know a pro dancer whose feet bruised occasionally bc of too much practice  that imo is not neccecary for a good quality play  and even if it did impove the quality  humans above ideas  mental health above all  everything in moderation    if i watched tv or read books for 8 hours a day i would be called addicted  or mentally unstable and rightfully so  how is this any different for work or even art    ''find a job you'll love'' is not the solution for everyone  is anyone else sickened by the idea of doing their passion for 8 hours a day  of their whole life revolvin around it i would love to be serious about it  and i am 100  gonna go semi-pro some day  and i won't give up or even retire until the day of my death  but 8 hours is too much even for me ,ijwnzc

130,Day in the life of a factory worker,you wake up  that incessant beeping of your alarm ringing in your ears  you groan  and hit the snooze button a few times  you finally manage to will yourself out of bed  it's still dark outside  you get up and hastily eat breakfast  get your shoes on  run out the door and miserably wipe the snow off your car in the dark  you drive to work  and when you get there the depressing atmosphere is impossible to ignore  at this point  it's still dark as night out and the moon shines above you  how can anyone be expected to be up this fucking early  as usual you see a group of miserable looking fellow workers like yourself  sitting outside the factory smoking cigarettes  etc  including larry  who has been here for 20 years and looks to have barely an ounce of life left in him  his hopes and dreams long gone  you look at your watch   fuck  it's time to clock in    you walk in and hear the same machinery noise you hear everyday once again  bursting into your ears  the sounds that haunt your dreams  you walk into that same disgusting bathroom change room and put on your work shoes safety equipment  you get back on the floor  and realize you have another 8  hours of hell ahead of you  standing in the same spot all day  getting pain and cramps from doing the same repetitive motions all the time  the clock is right there for you to see  you can't ignore it  you try as hard as you can to not look at it but you swear it's trying to taunt you  you swear the hands just moved backwards    your supervisor tells you what to do  and you begrudgingly comply  you get to your station and away you go once more  the machines are so fast  you have to keep up or else you will fall behind  you are not able to even go to the bathroom  you are planted to the floor  unless the boss says you aren't  you could ask him to use the bathroom  but such basic things as leaving for 5 minutes to relieve bodily functions are frowned upon here  after an eternity  you go for lunch  hastily scarfing down a ham sandwich and a bag of pretzel twists  before going back to the grind  you get back  has the clock moved backwards again  eventually  you get home  but all you can do is collapse on the couch  you're too tired that passion project of yours you have sworn to yourself you would get around to someday  your only option is to try to relax and try to cope with your day by eating junk food and watching netflix  before you know it  it's time for bed  and you realize that when you wake up  it will happen all over again   fuck ,ikd3jc

134,Boss Caused Me To Lose A Semester Of College Credits On My Final Semester,just saw a post about a boss trying to make someone work on their graduation and thought i would share my story   when i started at my job 6 years ago i was attending college and at the end of my final semester  i was working part time for garbage money and had been looking for a while for a better paying job that used my skills more  through someone i knew i had gotten the opportunity  you will have to forgive my antiwork trigger words lol  to be considered for a decent paying and pretty good job doing work that i wanted to do  i knew the timing of my semester and the job might conflict but i assumed they would be okay with me finishing my school  during the interview i even brought it up and the manager who was above the boss said  of course  we actually are committed to improving our employees education  so  things were looking good  i could have the job and finish my degree  a few weeks passed and they called me to let me know that i had been selected  i found out the time they wanted me to start and asked about have tuesday thursday off for 3 weeks in order to finish my semester  3 weeks  i was 3 weeks from finishing my degree  the supervisor  my direct boss  said this wouldn't be possible  i explained that i was about to finish my degree and even brought up that they had said they would let me finish my education  he said that he would go to the next candidate if i didn't work the days   i was younger and less experienced then  i saw the job as a great opportunity and the memes of not being able to get a job with my degree were going through my head  so i didn't finish my degree and went to the job  this worked out for me in the end  i eventually finished my degree  took years  and i cut throats until i became the supervisor at my job but i really learned the hard lesson of how little  they  actually care when it comes down to it and thought i would pass it on ,ifsl6p

147,Financially Punished at Work for Being Unable to Drive In Hurricane Laura,as many people know  today louisiana is experiencing an enormous category 4 hurricane and all of the wind and heavy storms that come with it  i live in new orleans so while we may not be on the direct path  today was the day the hurricane tail was projected to be over us  the owners of the coffee shop i worked at closed down last night when they thought the storm would come and when it didn t come then opened up the shop all day today  it s important to mention that these owners all live an hour outside of the city and that the other coffee shop they manage a block away was closed all day  at 7 00 am we were texted and told that we would be open all day  at 7 02 am we were texted and told that we would reassess at every shift if we would be open or not  at 7 03 am we were told to disregard that and that we would be open as scheduled  immediately when i woke up around 8 00 am i sent my manager a series of text stating that i was worried about my cars ability to get to work today  along with a screen recording of the weather radar  the city mandated flood and tornado warnings for my shift time  and time tracked the entire storm for them  i pointed out that at the time of my shift  12 30-4 00  the storm was projected to be the worst and explained that i did not feel comfortable coming into work in such conditions with my shitty car  i was told that if i didn t want to show up that it was my responsibility get my shift covered and that they would not be reassessing the weather  at 11 45 the storms around my house worsened and the wind was blowing things everywhere  i texted my manager again expressing that i did not think my car could make it to work or that i would be safe in out coffee shop which is an all glass building in an area that floods  i was  ignored  i texted again and asked what penalty i would face for not being able to come to work in these conditions  i was told that if i missed my 4 hour shift in the middle of a hurricane that i would be taken off the schedule for the next week  yep  1 4 of my monthly income has been taken away because i could not and would not drive in a hurricane  after expressing to my manager how i felt that that was unfair  she sent a text message in the company group chat about how  sorry to be that guy but you have to get your shifts covered that is not my responsibility and i will take away your next week s shifts if you don t show up  sorry it is raining but the owners said to open today so there is no excuse  instead of just texting me and the one other employee who were scheduled for the day  this is followed up with my other manager sub posting about me on the company slack about how  if you are a no call no show we will take away your shifts  i responded to this obvious sub post by an adult woman and stated simply that i do not believe that i am a no call no show since i have been calling them and updating them on my situation since eight am  to top all of it off my manger sent me a sassy text to end it all where she tried to guilt me by saying that the other employees who worked there were all made at me  the employees i had just got off the phone shit talking about them with for an hour  anyway just started putting in applications elsewhere and believe me  this was only the breaking point these situations are all  the  time   tldr  coffee shop owners who live outside city limits took away my week s shifts because i would not drive in hurricane thunder storms ,ihtt54

183,"""Is there a difference between capitalism and commerce?"" - Quora",commerce is the name given to the process of trade - buying an selling goods  capitalism is a social system reliant on the extraction of surplus value from another s labour to create profit  capitalism relies on the theory of surplus value as below    surplus value - wikipedia https en wikipedia org wiki surplus value    a worker who is sufficiently productive can produce an output value greater than what it costs to hire him  although his wage seems to be based on hours worked  in an economic sense this wage does not reflect the full value of what the worker produces  effectively it is not labour which the worker sells  but his capacity to work    imagine a worker who is hired for an hour and paid  10  once in the capitalist's employ  the capitalist can have him operate a boot-making machine with which the worker produces  10 worth of work every fifteen minutes  every hour  the capitalist receives  40 worth of work and only pays the worker  10  capturing the remaining  30 as gross revenue  once the capitalist has deducted fixed and variable operating costs of  say   20  leather  depreciation of the machine  etc  he is left with  10  thus  for an outlay of capital of  30  the capitalist obtains a surplus value of  10  his capital has not only been replaced by the operation  but also has increased by  10    the worker cannot capture this benefit directly because he has no claim to the means of production  e g  the boot-making machine  or to its products  and his capacity to bargain over wages is restricted by laws and the supply demand for wage labour     https www quora com is-there-a-difference-between-capitalism-and-commerce https www quora com is-there-a-difference-between-capitalism-and-commerce     amp x200b    tldr  your labor is  always  creating more value than the wage you are being paid  start your own business side hustles or whatever to get paid what you are worth ,ig0cyy

222,When you realise that this is just one company of many and working up the ladder means nothing when you leave this company.,everyone in my office is fighting for promotion  they kiss our managers ass and i get so heart broken when i see others progress more than me   then i realise  this is just a bubble in one company  when i m not in this company  none of that shit matters  our manager becomes just a person  the higher titles and promotions mean nothing ,ifiybv
223,Would this be classified as anti-work?,economically i identify as a market socialist  i think all businesses should be worker cooperatives  having said that   i'm a huge proponent of automation and universal income   my thinking is that automation would free people from the need to work unpleasant jobs and a ubi means that worker's cooperatives would form around being able to achieve artistic or intellectual ambitions  for instance  i'm a writer but under a ubi how well my book is going to sell could be a secondary concern  i can focus on making my writing artistically satisfying for me first and marketable second ,ifwieb

225,It’s been one year since I quit my job and what a whirlwind it’s been,in may 2019 i quit a very toxic job  i was feeling good about it  i thought i had enough experience and money saved up to last a few months until i find a new job     things didn t go as planned   i found myself practically begging for a job that paid half as much as my old job   i eventually had to move back in with my parents until i got a job   i knew this might happen when i quit my job and was ok with those consequences    i managed to be unemployed for 7 months until i landed a job in my hometown     the day of my orientation was the day they announced the lockdown  i can t begin to explain how weird it was to be going to work at a time when literally every one else was told to stay home   not only that  but i work in healthcare basically in ground zero of covid   if felt like practically a death sentence   fortunately things are going ok   at least people are fake nice here   i found out my old coworker passed away from covid   he hated that job as much as i did  but he stayed because he d been there for a decade and didn t wanna miss out on the pension and benefits     he never even got to see his earned money and he died in the place he hated ,ifjdpy

234,Do you hate your job or hate work?,what is the point of this sub  you hate your job   you hate work  if you find it mentally exhausting then why not make your money work for you  invest in the stock market  if you despise work why not learn how to day trade  with experience you could quit your day job and earn enough money for financial stability and best part is you can do that through practice and books  no education needed    save money and use it wisely  go on r fire r frugal or the several other subs to help you earn and save money    it seems like majority here work an office 9-5 or some sort of menial job  why not follow what you enjoy  the only thing stopping you from doing so is you ,ih45g0

237,Living in Silicon Valley has me questioning the system,i ve lived in silicon valley my whole life  i have a lot of friends in non-cs  they are engineers too but they make  1 2 of what a jr software dev makes despite having to go through an equally rigorous technical curriculum  and working longer hours  moreover  they will probably not even make that much after 15 years  the culture in this place is disgusting  the amount of bootlicking is insane  and it somehow manages to attract the worst most entitled people  housing prices are now beyond insane  am i to believe that somehow these tech-bros are more deserving to be here than the millions of teachers  workers  engineers  drivers  janitors  and nurses who keep the place running   now i am about to graduate  i m about to finish a degree in computer science and it s a genuinely interesting subject  however  i know that joining this field will put myself in an undeserved position of privilege and i will be working for the exploiters  it doesn t feel right  sipping kombucha and writing code for some questionably useful app while someone else is commuting from 50 miles away to keep the hospital running  tech was supposed to make everyone s lives better  instead it turned this place into a hyper capitalist rat race where the ubiquitous slums are a daily reminder of what happens if you slip up ,ihfk5s
238,Quit my Job Today (USA),i've been working as a census field supervisor since february  we basically supervise the people that knock on your door if you don't return the census  my operation dealt with people living in rvs  campsites  hotels motels  etc  i had some reservations about working a government job in the first place  but the pay was good and  that's just it  the pay was good  for my area at least   i had to train my team on monday  and was essentially thrown to the lions  i had little to no training  no direction  no checklist or itinerary  i was basically told to figure it out myself  while standing up in a room with 5 people looking to me for the answers    my supervisor cares about the workers and is about fed up herself  but this shows me that management can care all they want to  but the system is set up for maximizing output  which in this case is census responses  if the system puts an emphasis in the  customer  for a higher return  and less on the worker getting those returns  a nice manager is going to do nothing for me   it doesn't even need mentioning the safety risks that come with having to talk to 50  people a day that don't wear masks    here's the real trick  the lowest workers  the one's the entire operation depends on  don't get any sort of benefits because we are only working for 8 weeks at a time  if we are in a car accident  we rely on our auto and health insurance and get absolutely nothing from the government to help  aside from being able to file a worker's comp claim    that's the way it works for most jobs  anyway  spit on the poor so they don't realize your profits depend on them  fuck the system ,ihbhhs

246,RANT - I really hate the people at r/massage and I hate most massage therapists!!,i'm so sick of the massage industry  in my state  california  continuing education is not required to renew the massage certificate  most clients like 99 9  of the time don't give a flying shit about anything other than swedish and deep-tissue which i am pretty proficient at  i have been licensed and certified for about 6 years now  i used to have tons of passion for massage when i was in massage school and also the first year i was licensed but getting a hand injury really put a damper in it  i'm not qualified to do anything else and i would rather kill myself than work in retail or restaurants again  i went to massage school first and foremost to get me the fuck out of retail and foodservice jobs  i also went to massage school because i wanted to move out of my parents house  lord forbid somebody goes into a job because they need more money  a lot of massage therapist think that people should not get into the industry unless they are super passionate about massage  i can't fucking stand that  i don't relate with any other massage therapist except for maybe one who is this really chill cool ass girl who i have been friends with for a few years  she admits she hates massage and she hates the industry and so she went back to school for esthetician and laser hair removal  she likes that much more than massage  but anyway   so i go in the massage reddit and i asked if people can give me recommendations for the cheapest medical massage continuing education course so that i can practice massage legally in my state with the covid-19 regulations  massage is not deemed as an essential service  which honestly it is not an essential service  there's people who go their whole lives without a massage  it is not essential i will admit that  but the state does recognize medical massage as essential    one person actually gave a good recommendation and all the other losers told me that i shouldn't choose the cheapest continuing education class because i  touch people for a living   and i should put more care into my education  i don't really give a fuck dude  i give a damn good massage but once they are off of my table i don't really care about them anymore  90  of the clients in this industry will never ever rebook  most of the clients you will only see once literally    but anyway that's just one situation  most of the spas that i have worked at consisted of other massage therapists who were extremely pompous and thought they were god's gift to the healing arts  they all think that they are way smarter than they are even though 99  of them are completely science and math illiterate  they're obsessed with talking about toxins being released even though there has been absolutely no scientific research on fucking toxins being released from muscles after a massage  i mean i'm huge into new age stuff and i'm extremely spiritual but i know that a lot of things in the healing arts are really just a bunch of fucking quackery and hocus pocus    i really just can't stand all these motherfuckers  i went to massage school so that i could do massage in the meantime of going back to school to get a biochemistry degree so that i can have a real job and a real career making real money  because of the stupid economy this massage career is lasting a little longer than i would have wanted it to  it has taken me a really long time to get going back to junior college    the frankly i used to have a lot of passion for a massage but i haven't for a long time and i shouldn't be judged or penalized for that  sorry but i do massage for the fucking money  i've been doing this long enough to know how the clients are and the fact that a lot of male clients are just fucking perverts and that you really can't make a lot of money doing massage  it's also too easy to get injured ,ihv2x6

248,My Manager stopped caring about safety.,i am a cashier at goodwill  over the last few months we have had a hardline policy on masks and people without masks  whenever we've had people without masks we've kicked them out unless they said they specifically had a medical condition  in the case of them having a medical condition we have offered them a face shield which has no effect on breathing ability because as a team we have decided that regardless of what corporate wants  we will prioritize the safety of our customers and workers over people's convenience  we do not listen to conspiracies or bullshit lying by right wing assholes  well today we have had two occasions where someone has come in without a mask  refused to wear a face shield  and actively walked within 6 feet of people  first was a man who was kicked out one month ago for this exact issue  he had previously said he had no medical issue  didn't feel like wearing a mask  and went on an insane rant about how we were all sheep  now he walks freely and is not kicked out cause he suddenly has a medical issue  he purposefully walked by fellow coworkers and customers after being told he needed to stay six feet away and was never punished despite my manager being told by me and other coworkers that he was violating our policy  he also had a ridiculous unibrow but that is beside the point  next was a man i personally had the displeasure of having to deal with  i walked up to him once i noticed him and asked him if he had a mask  he said no and i told him it was required  he said he didn't care  i offered a face shield just to get him covered and he said no  i went to management and they came out  they told him he needed a mask and he said no  my manager asked me to open my till to ring him up since he was already at the registers  i opened up and when he came up he said he didn't have a medical condition and didn't stay behind the plastic barrier  i got mad  threw up my closed sign and said i would not ring him up  he then said  really you need to watch less tv  at me and i told him i did not care i would not help him  then my manager began ringing him up told him he could not come in again without a mask all while ringing him up  he then said he would keep coming back without a mask because he didn't wear one anywhere  he then said we were rude and walked out  this sets a dangerous standard  other people will learn by watching that if they don't want to wear a mask they don't have to  because our management is to afraid to piss someone off  too afraid to miss out on seven dollars   i'm looking for a new job  fuck this corporate bullshit ,ihyddi

250,I'm so curious about this sub and the opinions of those here.,hi r antiwork  i'll introduce myself  i am u diamond rake and have been lurking this sub for a little while  i've got a few questions to ask about your mindset  when i say  your mindset  i mean the users of the sub and not r antiwork as a whole  i can and did read the sidebar  i hope a post like this is allowed  if not  take 'er down    amp x200b   i'll just list some questions and if i could get your opinion on some all none of them  i'd genuinely love that   do you work have a job currently  do you like that job  do you think you are treated fairly at your job     amp x200b   knowing you had no necessities  eating  sleeping  etc  to provide for  what would you change about your current lifestyle    amp x200b   how would providing for necessities work without work    amp x200b   what is important to you jobwise goalwise    amp x200b   what is your ideal society    amp x200b   i'll start so maybe this sparks conversation  wish we just had a big convention center to just chat in  aaanyway  i have a job and i like my job  i work at a large chain auto parts store at the counter  i do like my job  the people i interact with a generally good people looking to save a buck over taking their car to the shop  i believe that  for the skill requirement for my position  i am treated fairly  i'm not asked to do much outside of my job description and get along with my co-workers  however  it is fair pay if i only did what was required of the job  be a robot that sells auto parts  i put quite a bit into the job compared to how i am compensated  this isn't because i am expected to  but because i want to and i'll get back to that in a minute    amp x200b   i was raised pretty traditionally  i feel extremely lucky to be in the situation i am was  my parents are still together and were great parents  i wasn't spoiled as a kid but never had to worry if i was going to eat that night  i'm currently married and at university and loving learning  so  you can say i followed a pretty traditional path    amp x200b   here's where i come into what spurred me to make this post  i place high value on hard work  i hate the feeling of not having anything to do in a day  how do you deal with the feeling of a day gone by without having done anything  do you have sad feelings or is that just not a thing with you  there are some days where i have nothing scheduled and i get chomping at the bit for anything  i always look forward to my days off  until its the actual day and i have nothing to do  just play video games until my wife gets home then watch a few episodes of avatar until my eyes are on fire  i try scheduling things for my days off to put in place of my time off from my job  i'll find more maintenance to do on my cars bike  i'll clean out whole apartment  i'll crave that sense of fulfillment from doing work until i get it that day  i pretty much dislike vacations unless i can find some way to satisfy that feeling  do you have that feeling of accomplishment with work  even if that work is a job     amp x200b   i am pretty individualistic so your business isn't my business unless you share it with me  i see a lot of posts saying someone would rather die than work which is interesting and raises the question of what is stopping you from  living  that dream  wondering what stops people from becoming vandwellers  is it fear of the unknown  responsibilities toward others  do you enjoy the things brought to you by work such as technology  or homes  or cars  or would you prefer to be like a nomad just scavenging enough to survive and exploring around    amp x200b   my ideal society is one where everyone has common morals  everyone is there to help each other  not by force or because it's the law  but just because they choose to  i support a free market but i wish people weren't greedy  i wish those who had extra would choose to give to those who don't have enough  however  obviously this is the real world and people are what they are    amp x200b   so  what are your thoughts ,igtz8a

258,i finally quit (but i'm so upset),so i  20f  have been working at this coffee shop diner for almost a year and a half  its a pretty busy spot and there's usually only 4 employees working at a time  so it can get pretty intense    now i  love  this job  i've been working since i was 13 and this was my favorite  its crazy and awful and chaotic and insane but i love it so much  i have my regulars and my chores and routines  and i get all the coffee i want    the owner is the worst though  she's super intense and just straight up mean  she makes it an effort to scare away the 'weaklings'  so she's super mean to the new employees  it was really bad when i started  the others said they thought i'd be gone for sure    i stuck it out  ended up being one of the only fulltime worker for 6 months and became the 2nd employee to be cross-trained  then covid happened and i helped run the show  with the owner and manager  and one other employee  for the entirity of our shut-down  2 5months  i went on unemployment for only 2-3 weeks and was one of the first employees to return    the owner and i had been on better terms before covid  when we were only doing curbside she started getting aggressy with me again- asking me if i even wanted to be there  telling me i was doing everything wrong  telling me that the water leaking from the faucet  that she neglected to get fixed  was my 'raise going down the drain'  have never recieved a raise to this day  etc  things calmed down again when we reopened for dine-in and some of the other employees came back as the manager noticed and made the schedule so the owner and i would never have to see each other    today she calls me and starts bitching about last nights close  i didn't even close last night  for the record  the last day i closed was sunday and i was training someone in so i was supposed to let her do most of it  she says 'i thought we were done with this  its really not that hard  you have 3 days your scheduled next week and i don't wanna be babysitting when  manager  leaves in a couple months  its not fair to the rest of the employees blah blah blah'    i messaged the manager right after hanging up and told her i was done  i'll finish out my 2 weeks but if the owner says one more thing to me i'm out  i'm going to fill out applications today  i deserve better  which is saying a lot because i am a huge fucking doormat    i'm just so annoyed  and everyone's like 'its a really hard job  you did your best' in that condescending way  the job isn't that hard  i mean i've been working 3 positions simultaneously this week and its hard but its not impossible and i love it  i just hate that everyone assumes i 'couldn't handle it'  like its not that fucking hard the owner is just a massive cunt    anyways  i'm going to be reporting the owner  she never pays on time  tries to skimp out on paychecks  and verbally assaults her employees  all while running off to her timeshare in the bahamas every 2 months meanwhile i can't pay my rent because she doesn't feel like filling out our paychecks  and even when she does i usually have to get it corrected because she somehow missed the entire back side of my timecard  plus there's probably a whole bunch of technically illegal shit going on in there  let alone things that could get her business license revoked  i'm usually not one for vengeance but this woman is a fucking monster and i'm sure she's gonna be dragging my name through the dirt for a while so might as well ,ighxvf

262,Can we talk about how work under capitalism destroys intelligence and free thinking?,i truly think media social media is a convenient tool for capitalism in that it further reduces our ability to do meaningful work  as in  we work day in and day out doing meaningless  soulless jobs that don t satisfy even a fiber of our beings  we come home exhausted and  even for those of us still lucky enough to have creative or  meaningful  hobbies  we re so damn tired that we just sit our asses in front of youtube or facebook or reddit  engaging our brains in easy-to-digest  more meaningless content that slowly rots our brains to the point that we crave instant gratification at all times  this further robs us of the ability to engage in meaningful work hobbies  because we re a  too tired exhausted to under capitalism and b  our attention spans have been ruined due to social media and the like   and i truly think this works in capitalism s favor  the more people are engaged with meaningless drivel  the less time they spend engaging in meaningful hobbies that humans are actually designed for  activities that can actually stimulate the mind and allow you to broaden the scope of your thinking  so you go through life completely ignorant of how shitty the world is under capitalism because you literally don t have the energy or the time to critically think anymore ,igq9i2

266,"Leaving the Military for ""more"" personal freedom",hey everyone as you can tell this is a new account because as we are all aware our social media is something that employers can look at for some reason  this is especially true given the fact that i am a  marine  even more so that i am part of the propaganda producers and my job is to actively create social media media  content to convince young kids who don't know better to join the marines   any who i've done my 5 years and ill be leaving this organization soon because i cannot stand the culture and lack of personal life i have   however  reading your posts and talking to people it is apparent that if i go into the  real  world i will be just as un happy as i am here  unlike many who join the service i joined after a few years of work in the service industry  and already understand that companies will work us as slaves  in the marines it is common to work from 6-5 at least and have every understanding that at anytime you are on call    one of my junior marines does something stupid  yes ill be there in 10 even though its 3 am on a sunday  so going into a job in which i only work 9-5 seems like a step up  however this is not what i want     i've forgotten what my post was gunna say  but help ,igl8ll

291,"[Rant] I've been given a bullshit ""golden opportunity"" with our company exec",at my job we have these employee relations type people  it's a non paying  opportunity  where as well as your regular job you also need to canvas the office  get opinions from people in how they're feeling and feed it back  by feed it back i mean come up with bullshit excuses for the negative feedback and really hype the positive because as i found out people's feedback directly effects my performance at reviews which is very fair   unfortunately i drew the golden shit ticket so i'm one of these lucky few  i came into work to an email today from my boss who very excitedly told me my next relationsions meeting will have our company exec attending  see every few months he comes down from his golden throne to pat us workers on the head and say  good job   i'm being told that this is my chance to really shine and impress  so i asked my boss out right  what's the incentive for me to shine  her only answer was a pissy  the exec will see how hard you work  so i pushed her some more and asked about actual tangible rewards and she told me my attitude won't get very far  i should be doing this because i'm passionate about my job  this really fucked me off  i'm a data auditor for an insurance company  who the fuck is passionate about auditing   i know have to churn out a presentation for a guy who does not give a shit about me or the work i do and will most likely forget my name as soon he leaves room  i'm essentially a dancing monkey putting a show for a guy who makes more a month than i'll ever see in my life time  he got a 10 mil bonus last year  and my reward is a  good job   the worst part is the other employee relations people are excited to meet him  why  he's not going whisk you away in his diamond encrusted chariot if you impress him  he's going to feign interest and then rush home as quick as possible to shower the poor off of him,id61bj

293,I’m feeling particularly anti-work today, i am sad because of the world i have been born into  i am sad because to live i need to work most of my life away from my people i care about most  i would be much happier if i could spend my every waking hour with the one i love  but no  instead we have to both come home from work stressed at our worst selves instead of being the loving  happy people we usual are on breaks from work  we are trying to make our own business so we can spend more time together  however  we need money to start a business  we have soo many ideas and every time we get money  a new bill comes up   council tax  fine  water bills  insurance   the worst part is that the poorer you are  the poorer you get as for example  when you can t afford to pay your council tax bill which is around  120 per month  they tell you that you need to pay  1 400 upfront- and obviously now you can t pay that so they throw court bills on top of that to fuck your over even more  people tell you to that you are lucky to have a job- lucky for what  for pay that doesn t even allow me to live only to be pushed around like a farm animal  then you re told that you re poor because you don t work hard enough- i m sorry that i can t work harder when i already have no fucking life to begin with  the annoying part is that starting a business is the only way to go and if feel that you need to be born into money for the most part to start one successfully   sorry for the long post  i m just venting as i felt particularly strongly about this issue today   i hope we can all find a way out of the system where we can live happily without giving our life up to be a clog in a machine  ,idfinm

311,Having a really shitty day at work,this is probably gonna be a long post but i promise the excitement picks up at the end  also on mobile so of course sorry  alright  this literally just happened to me and i had to tell someone it was just all so ridiculous and unbelievable  here goes  so let s preface this by saying one i almost never shit myself and two i m actually a pretty hard worker when there is work to be done  you give me a task i ll do it  especially one that makes sense to me and needs doing  i start getting anti work because no manager boss gives tasks like that    i ve worked full time since i was 17 years old to support myself  and through the years have just become more and more disillusioned with having to do this  but i gotta make ends meet  so right now i m working as a janitor for a university  because i m diabetic and need insurance  in a union  over the summer  i have been cleaning student apartments top to bottom to have kids move in  i was working my ass off for months  anywhere from 4-8 full sized apartments that were typically left disgusting because college kids lived there  but i got it done  in fact i was getting compliments from higher ups at how good i was getting it done  like i said if there is a job that needs doing i ll do it  even if i don t like it    cut to lately  finished every single apartment on campus  my boss kind of forgot i was over there  normally i work in a dorm  and so for the past 2 weeks or so i have been at same apartments with nothing to do  with all the apartments cleaned  there arnt a whole lot of areas left  just some hallways to vacuum and a very small lobby and laundry room  all in all to completely clean all that takes about 45 min  my shifts are 8 hours  first couple days i honestly tried to stretch it out to last  even called to ask if there was more i could be doing  nope keep the apartments clean  so here i am  with literally nothing to do    another important fact is despite having cars were supposed to drive on campus  i take my personal vehicle cause i like going home for my lunch break just makes it easier  so then it hits me  i have nothing to do  so i ll just go home  so for the past 2ish weeks i ve had an amazing time at work  i clock in  get my shit done in about an hour or a little more i m in no rush now  then i literally just drive home  because if my options are sit and twiddle my thumbs at work or go home  i m taking door number 2  it s been amazing  i d make myself nice lunches  watch tv  take a lot of naps  all on the clock  at one point i even went and got a haircut during my shift  another i slept through going back to clock out and ended up getting paid overtime  the ideal situation for an anti work person right  but all good things must come to an end    yesturday i got a call from my boss while i was at home demanding where i was  it was about an hour and a half after my lunch break was supposed to end  and she was saying she s here and where s my car and where am i  i am a bad liar at the best of times  so i mumbled well i m on the way  rushed back over to get chewed out  assured her i just lost track of time that day  she told me i was no longer allowed to drive my personal vehicle  which was always technically the rule  and that she was gonna have to drive me to the apartments  there s 2 different buildings  and pick me up  i sighed and said alright  actions have consequences and i knew my luck wouldn t last forever    so today first day i m being babysat  i get dropped off at first apartment  which only has a laundry room  the laundry room has no bathroom  just a small janitor closet with a sink and cleaning supplies  and washers dryers  she gave me about an hour and a half till she said she was coming to get me  and like i said i can finish this laundry room in 5-10 min  i clean it everyday it s not dirty  so i was actually feeling kinda good like oh ya i ll just knock this out and sit around play on reddit  whistling along cleaning away  another important fact was i had 2 cups of coffee this morning  i wanted to be awake for dealing with this bullshit babysitting    coffee always makes me shit  i had to go as soon as i started  but figured i d just hold it out till we got to second apartment with a bathroom  i do hate not being able to go to the bathroom when i want at work though  but i m still feeling alright  things aren t too bad  had a pressing fart  no one is there it s early  i figure hey i ll let some pressure out  like i said i havnt shit myself since i was a literal toddler  but that all ended today  out it came  i confidently squeezed out a fart  and a heavy rush of warm diarrhea came out instead  immediate panic  i waddle over to closet and close and lock door  i drop my pants to assess the damage  it s bad  it s really bad  step out of pants and underwear  now just butt ass naked at work with my dick hanging out  at this point i kind of laugh at how ridiculous this all is and think i guess i ll have to just throw the undies away  wipe with a rag and water and go commando    that s when i remember  i have had the same pair of work pants for several years  i wear my work clothes till you can physically not wear them anymore  this particular pair has a large rip that covers basically the entire crotch  never cared before  coworkers made fun of me but i d just wear sliders no big deal  it s a big deal when those very same underwear are now covered in diarrhea because you a grown man just shat yourself  panic again  i can t go commando  i have to drive around with boss  she sits right next to me could glance over and see my dick and balls hanging through pants  oh no  normally i d just drive home real quick and laugh about and whatever  not today my car is miles away    realization is slowly setting in but i m looking for other solutions  i attempted to make a sort of diaper out of some rags  no good  time is ticking away before my boss with keys comes a calling  had this happened any day earlier it would have been totally cool  but today  i did what had to be done  i strapped some gloves on  covered my underwear in cleaning supplies and did my best to hand wash it in sink  i m sitting here  butt naked squeezing shit out of my underwear as best i can not so happy to be at work anymore  i do the best i can  attempted to dry them with a rag and slid my wet semi dirty underwear back on  desperate times call for desperate measures  i got all the shit rags i had used to wipe and clean up with and threw away the evidence  got picked up and no one was the wiser besides a comment about slight smell    but i know i just shit all over myself  and can t even change because i am contractually obligated to be here for 8 hours  they determine when i can and can t have access to bathrooms  they determine when i go home and when i can t  i am so sick of shitty ass work  thank you for reading all this if you ve made it this far  hope one day soon we can all live in a utopia where we can shit ourselves in the comfort of our own homes on our own times and not worry about it ,idb2fc

328,The last time I worked I almost died,tw  suicide  the last job i had was in 2019 and i was paid  11 50  that was okay because my folks helped me out with some stuff but i m definitely not advocating for such shit pay  anyways i worked as a linen technician at a hospital and it was physically hard work  i am disabled so it was worse  i ended up falling twice and having a seizure on the job  i ended up in the er and they sent me home  well after i was sent home  this was a thursday i believe  i was supposed to go to the doctor to get a doctors note saying i could work again except i didn t realize that since i had gotten one for the previous time  so on sunday i attempted suicide  there was a trigger for me to do it but the main issue was because i desperately did not want to go back to work the next day   the whole time i was in the hospital i was still suicidal and scared of having to go back to work  when i was discharged i went back like normal still not knowing i was supposed to get a doctors note and my boss came in and told me i couldn t work yet and asked if i got injured so i could fill out a form  i said no and she gave me such an awful look  she didn t realize i was in the hospital because i wanted to die rather than work there    i left and decided to go back to school  i called my boss s boss and told him i quit  i ve been in school since and i ve been afraid of going back to work  i ve been afraid of feeling that bad again  work shouldn t fucking do that  i even took a mental health day when i was there but i felt incredibly guilty for doing so  i just wanted to share my story of how work almost killed me ,ie308m

335,Work Problems,   start by saying i hope everyone is holding up okay during these crazy times   little background before i get into the main issue  i have been working for a small it company for almost  3 years now  it has its benefits such as whenever i have a dentist appointment i can pop out no problem or show up a little late if something happened in the morning you know the typical small company benefits  previously i worked in a environment where i was completing an apprenticeship  after i finished college  in it communications and networking  i worked at the previous place about a year and 6 months completed the apprenticeship and moved onto a silly banked hours contract and minimum wage  that office environment really got me down and i worked with some toxic people so i left and came here  i started with a 6 month probation at  15000 a year which was minimum wage for my age at the time i believe then after 6 months it went up to  17000 which is the wage i stayed on for until about a month ago where it became  18000 a year because another guy left  now this is where i'm going to sound really ungrateful because i know a lot of people would kill to be in my position during the pandemic where i have stable work but if you could try forget that's a thing for this post  i think i'm being really underpaid  being a small company i understand i'm not going to ever get the big bucks but we recently took on an apprentice who's 27 and i worked out as soon as he completes the apprenticeship he will instantly be earning more than me just because of his age  he has no previous experience in it and doesn't even know what a vga cable is   i've worked so hard to get where i am and i work my ass off every day and in my own time to get stuff done for this company even though we are an absolute laughing stock i've stayed here i even re arrange my holidays to suit their every need  not had one in over a year  the business is months behind on invoicing and the office is a dump and always has been since i've worked here  there no career progression or organisation at this place its become a meme amongst my bosses how disorganisation and stuff this place is they joke about it like its fun   i spoke with my girlfriend and she thinks its a joke how much i get for how much knowledge i have and how hard i work  she earns more than me at her call centre job which she jokes a child could do her job and it requires no skill or experience   an example of how un-organised it is  i've worked here almost 3 years and i still don't have a contract because they've not got round to it   i get no extra benefits other than the ones told previously  my wage doesn't increase with inflation  i get 0 bonus ect  i get clients coming directly to me now which they know they shouldn't do because they know i'm the one who gets stuff done   for the specifics i handle everything from server builds installs voip systems active directory admin   i am 1st line and second line support  cisco network admin ect  as i'm sure you know working for a small company you do everything  i've been working on many certifications for years but i don't have the time or money now but i've still retained all the information from them   this post is me asking a question and ranting   i want to know if with over 4 years in the it sector am i being underpaid   should i leave this s  show of a company is the grass greener on the other side working for a bigger company   talking to them wouldn't get me anywhere   please ask me anything  i just need some advice from people who's worked in this industry longer and know more   should i scare them and ask for a reference and see if anything changes or should i quit whining and man up and get on with it because i don't have enough experience to earn more   if this is posted in the wrong place i'm sorry   oh my bosses play the same 90s rock playlist every day and are mildly racist and pretty sexist ,idsvja

340,Getting fired from a toxic job made me change my priorities,i just graduated college in may  my senior year i was working in my first big girl job  it made me feel really accomplished that i was working in industry while still in school but honestly it was horrible  i was scared to eventually move to a full time position there because all of my coworkers were insanely overworked and everyone i talked to hated it there  also in the span of a year that i was there i saw our office go from 35 to 20 people  all of those were people who quit  i never really understood what a toxic work environment was until i started there  i cried every single day at work due to coworker pettiness and frustration because i was given little training and a lot of responsibility  i was promised i would be given a full time position once i graduated but instead a few days after i graduated they told me my position was eliminated they told me it was nothing against me  i think budget cuts because of covid  but said  if you see were hiring you should totally apply   yeah right  even though i knew i wasn't planning on staying i was devastated the job market is rough but especially so for new grads  but with all this time off my mental health has been a million time better and its really made me rethink my priorities  i've decided to take some art classes because this is something i've always wanted to learn  also i've started a side business with my sister where we sell vintage items  i did actually just get a new job  its part time and low stress  i will never give my all to a company again because i've learned the hard way that they really don't give a damn what happens to you ,if5tng

356,Shady shit from an employer I had an interview with last week,with my extra  600 ending on my unemployment and only getting  300 week i decided i needed to look for some worn  i saw an ad for a job that paid  16 hour and i got a call back for that job after i sent them my resume on indeed  at the interview there were so many red flags though  first  the  16 hour was only after 90 days  the first 90 days was paid at minimum wage  but they said if you stay past 90 days then they ll retro your pay rate  my thought process is why not just pay me the rate you re advertising then  after they mentioned that strange policy i asked if there was an issue with high turnover and if they had many people not lasting more than 3 months  they didn t really want to answer that question  it makes me wonder if they ll just fire you before the 90 days so avoid paying over minimum wage  they offer little to no training for their property systems which was rather unusual  i held an ace in my sleeve though when it came to my acceptance of the job  i didn t fill out their application and since i never gave them an actual application i can honestly say i didn t refuse a job in my unemployment certification    oh and to top things off this company is one of them who sent it people to lansing bitching about how the extra unemployment benefits is hurting them fill all their open positions  it s not the extra unemployment that was stopping them from finding people to work for them  it s the shady shit with only  9 hour  but we ll pay you the remainder in a lump sum after 90 days of employment ,iep7aw
357,It feels like my coworkers are brainwashed...,so  at my company  we have these roughly-quarterly meetings with our directors  these meetings are half q amp a  half presentation on how well the company is doing  i was not surprised at all during the meeting to find out that our productivity was down  given that we moved all of our staff to work-at-home rather than having people come into the office  but who cares  right  numbers are down  big deal      monthly  i attend meetings with a team of people who escalate concerns of our peers to our teams of supervisors and directors  the meeting started with the topic of our productivity not being tracked correctly  for about half an hour  people swapped personal anecdotes about how their work has a large amount of variety and thus it's impossible to report their  true  productivity  so they want something done to show their productivity more accurately      at this point  i chime in and the conversation proceeds as follows    amp x200b   me   why does it matter if your productivity isn't reported accurately   group   well  it's just not accurate  it should be made more accurate   me   well  sure  it should be more accurate  but why do you personally want it to be more accurate  are your supervisors telling you that you're not doing enough work   group   no  they say that we're doing fine  it's just that we have a lot of assignments and it's difficult to complete all of them   me   okay  so you feel like you're being given too much work   group   no  i don't feel like we're being given too much to do  it's just we have a lot of work that isn't getting done  maybe if our productivity was more accurate  we would hire more people to get everything completed in a timely manner   me   but why do you care if we're getting everything done in a timely manner  it's not like you're being forced to complete extra work to make up for a lack of bodies   group   right  but our directors say our productivity is low  so we need to adjust how our work is being reported so our productivity is higher   me   but you say your supervisors have no issues with your productivity as is right now  and it's not like our directors are breathing down our necks trying to get us to work faster  so why do you care about our collective productivity  what is there to worry about   at this point the few people who have their webcams on seem visibly exasperated  one person delivers this next line in a way that makes it seem like it's their final say after much deliberation   person   we need our productivity to be tracked more accurately so we can more easily set goals to increase our productivity  the company wants our productivity to be higher  so that's what we want too  we want to make our goals align with the company's goals   others in the group agree with this person that this is what they meant by saying they want our productivity to be tracked in a better way  here  the moderator for the meeting cuts us off and abruptly introduces another topic      i was completely dumbfounded after figuring out the reason for this impassioned debate  to me  it still seemed like a bad reason  if our productivity goes up  we gain nothing  we don't get paid more  and if our collective productivity goes down  we lose nothing  the company doesn't go around docking pay  and they certainly don't start firing individuals because of the company not meeting a certain goal   plus  if our productivity increases  that just causes directors to move the goalpost  our directors will literally always say they want us to do more  work more  and work better  at no point will they ever stop us and tell us that we're being too productive  so increasing our collective productivity is pointless  as it will never stop our directors from asking for more   i don't think i'll ever understand why i was the only person to speak up and try to define a goal or reason for wanting to increase our productivity  but i think the team i meet with resents me for it  how  dare i suggest that we're doing fine  right  the word  stagnate  was getting thrown around a lot  i seemed to be the only one who accepted the idea of our productivity reaching a plateau  while everyone else apparently wants to do more and more - for the company ,ie0upw

363,People on this sub need to be realistic about their expectations and also look at their own behaviour and attitude towards society,i believe that one day technological automation will reach the point where all of our necessities  food  running water  shelter etc  are provided  supplied and maintained without human interaction  a world where our logistical  medical and agricultural needs are all streamlined and automated    unfortunately  we re not there yet    our society still requires a hell of a lot of human labour  people are required to grow  package and ship food  people are required to build and maintain houses and the facilities those households need  people are required to build and service our cars  people are required to look after our sick and elderly  people are required to maintain and update every website and entertainment platform you browse and to secure and maintain the data centres that they re hosted upon  for society to function we need a hell of a lot of man hours   if you want to work part time at a dead end job that s completely fine  you just can t expect to be able to reap the same benefits from society of those who put in more hours at a higher skilled job  do you not find it hypocritical to expect to be able to live in a house built and maintained by workers  drive a car built and serviced by workers  enjoy food grown packaged and shipped by workers  go to shops and restaurants and be served by workers but not want to work yourselves   while we re on the subject of hypocrisy let s talk about wealth inequality  it s no secret that our capitalistic society has a massive wealth inequality problem  it s awful that we live in a world that has billionaires with private jets and super yachts whilst simultaneously having people dying of starvation and exposure  i m sure you ll all agree with this  let s get to the hypocritical part   lots of you will happily complain about wealth inequality while simultaneously buying products from companies which perpetuate this inequality  you ll complain about what a hard life you have working 40 hours per week but will happily buy nike trainers and iphones even though you re well aware that they re the products of child labour  i understand that necessities such as food must be purchased regardless of ethicality but designer clothes and smart phones are far from necessities   then let s look at how anti-landlord and anti-corporation lots of you are  you ll complain about landlords who often just own a single extra property and small business owners who have a couple of employees but you ll happily pay into a bank account which generates interest  an isa  401k or pension scheme  how the fuck do you think these systems generate money  by pooling your cash together and investing in stocks and properties   i like the idea of this sub  i like the idea that one day we ll work less and everyone s needs will be met  what i don t like is how many of you are simply uneducated hypocrites ,idfn0j

366,Real freedom is incompatible with Capitalism,that's why many countries are so big on  freedom  propaganda    most people have literally no say in the way they live their lives  they are going to be employees for someone no matter what they are like or want to do with their lives  they will be taking part in one particular type of economic system even if they disagree with how it works  there will never be any sort of choice or freedom in the matter    it's honestly impressive how well economic and political propaganda work  people actually think freedom implies waking up everyday to work against their will in exchange for things they shouldn't of been deprived of in the first place    freedom implies having the freedom to live as one chooses  whereas under capitalism  you are forced to take part in employer   employee relationships no matter what  that is not freedom ,idr08c
367,Highly Recommended Reading!,i was at the library last week when a title caught my eye    the freedom manifesto  by tom hodgekinson   it's been an entertaining read  the author details sentiments similar to those i find on this sub  from the evils of capitalism  its roots in puritanism  and the free ways of medieval peoples   he ties it into permaculture  which is an interest of mine  and i believe it may be an interest many of you share  being a  manifesto  he proposes many ideas  while he doesn't detail exact methods  he backs up his suggestions with examples and sources  alongside his own personal experiences   while it may not be totally new information  i have found it satisfying to watch as someone else connects the same dots i have  and proposes a few more points  i hope some of you will enjoy it too   feel free to ask me any questions about the nature of the book ,ido1ll
368,Literally spent two minutes looking on the job boards on Craigslist and I just remembered why I wasn't going to look for work during this time.,i just went on craigslist and looked on the job boards for about 2 to 3 minutes and then i remembered why i hate looking for jobs and why i love being unemployed and collecting unemployment    why are most of these bullshit  at home   jobs just glorified mlm's  no i don't want to make 5000 fucking dollars every day with your bullshit website  just give me a fucking job that will pay me enough money  how many fucking vector marketing job listings do there need to be    now that the  600 of extra unemployment is over i think now it's time to go back to work but i'm at the mercy of the department of state health services for them to give the okay to the california massage therapy council so i can go back to work  i did not go to massage school to get a goddamn massage therapy certificate to be looking for these bum ass low-wage loser fucking jobs on craigslist    in all honesty we shouldn't even have to look for jobs  employers should be looking for employees and the employees should be the ones interviewing the employers ,idm5v2
369,Actively suicidal due to work burnout &amp; all the “support” I’ve gotten is job recommendations,sorry if this isn t the right sub for this post  it s the first place that came to mind   like the title says- i have been sitting on the floor of my bathroom crying and truly deciding whether living is worth it  i am mentally ill and disabled  and my worth has only ever been tied to my ability to feed into the capitalist machine    i am dead broke as my main employer has been ghosting me since the start of quarantine  one of my side gigs only earns me  1-3 every other week  and my freelance artwork only sells if i charge about  1-2 hr   i hate that i was born into a world where i must work to survive  and as a mentally ill person with chronic pain  it is near impossible to hold a standard job   it just feels like a crazy kind of irony to yearn for death over being born into a system where i have to break my body and mind just to survive  only to be recommended new methods of breaking my body and mind to survive ,ifh47h

375,Idleness as a path to a more sustainable way of life, departure into emptiness - climate crisis  idleness and mysticism  essay by jupp hartmann  excerpt   i    not as much    that is the imperative of our age  less plastic  less co2  less  consumption  less stress  that sounds like a renunciation  of meat  of  flying  of  driving cars   but does  this necessarily have to be a renunciation  it would be renunciation to  deny yourself the fulfill ment of a deep desire  not doing something  because there is a better choice  that is freedom   there  are good reasons to use that freedom  need ing less can be full of its  own  pleasure  it means be ing less dependent and - instead of  constantly chas ing after the satisfaction of needs - having more time  for the really important things    those who have lost by being moderate are rare   confucius  analects  iv 23   ii    doing and leaving   are what shape our perception of the world  a woodcutter  a biologist  and an in vestor perceive the same forest in a completely dif ferent  way  whoever is taking on a task must be careful not to be taken over by  the task  the more the focus is on predetermined goals  the more the  view of collateral damage is lost   in  a world of numbers and financial streams  every thing becomes a means  to an end  the earth be comes a raw material warehouse and people become  human capital  everything becomes a utility  what is useless or not  useful enough from an economic point of view is in danger  primeval  forests are being cut down  animal and plant species are becoming  extinct  in the name of utility a huge destruction is underway   it  would often be better if less were done  but this is difficult to  achieve  because many people despair when they have nothing to do  they  cling to their occupations  often  work is the centre of their lives -  and for many it is the source of their identity   in  our performance-oriented times  this can be seen with extreme clarity   that it is not a new phenome non  however  is proven by a more than two  thou sand year old text from china    when  the farmer has nothing more to do with grass and weeds  he has nothing  more to hold on to  when the merchant has nothing more to do with alleys  and markets  he has nothing more to hold on to  only when the people of  the crowd have their daily work  do they make an effort  the craftsmen  depend on the skill and handling of their tools to feel themselves  if  he can not accumulate money and goods  the scrooge becomes sad  if power  and influence do not expand steadily  the ambitious man becomes  desolate the slaves of power and wealth are only happy when in the  process of change  if they find a time when they can act  they cannot  stop acting  they all follow their path with the same regularity as the  cycle of the year  they are caught up in the world of things and cannot  change  so they run along  internally and externally trapped  sinking  into the world of things and never coming back to themselves  oh  how  sad   zhuangzi xxiv 4   so  what can be done is done - and that is often much more than what needs  to be done  we virtu ally suffocate under the mass of products that our  productivity produces   iii    idleness   a word that has fallen into disrepute  idleness  as the proverb warns   is the root of all vice  and more than a few even see in it the worst of  all vices  the refusal to perform in a performance-based society   the  calls for deceleration  which are becoming louder and louder  have  rehabilitated idleness to a certain extent in recent years  in the  wellness sector at least it has found a firm place - and in countless  magazine articles when it has to do finding oneself or burnout syndrome   idleness  requires free time  this is more than leisure time  it is a time free  of constraints  empty time that can be filled with what the moment  offers   caught in the daily hustle  and bustle  it is difficult to develop new perspectives  one is so busy  mop ping up the water that one does not even think of turning off the  tap   in order to get a grip on  things at any time  your hands should be free  being idle means to have  time to do the right thing at the right moment   iv    inspiration   the muses like idleness  to be kissed by the muse is the pictorial  description of what many artists experience  a higher power seems to  guide the creative process  this process is more of a letting happen  than a conscious creation  not the conscious ego - it paints  it writes   it composes  this state is called flow   in  this way  making art becomes a communication with something unknown   are higher powers at work here  or is it simply neurobiological  processes  either way  it seems like a miracle   but the flow does not come on command  you can only create good conditions for it  there's an an cient chinese story about that    a  wood carver carved a bell stand  when the bell stand was finished  all  the people who saw it were amazed at its divine work  the prince of lu  also looked at it and asked the master   what is your se cret  the  latter replied   i am a craftsman and know no secrets  and yet there is  one thing that matters  when i was about to make the bell stand  i was  careful not to consume my life force in other thoughts  i fasted to  bring my heart to rest  when i fasted for three days i no longer dared  to think of reward and honour  after five days i no longer dared to  think of praise and blame  after seven days i had forgotten my body and  all my limbs  at that time i also no longer thought about the court of  your highness  thus i was collected in my art  and all infatuations of  the outside world had dis appeared  afterwards i went into the forest  and looked at the trees in their natural growth  when the right tree  came before my eyes  the bell stand was ready in front of me  so that i  only had to put my hand on it  if i had not found the tree  i would have  given up  be cause i let my nature interact with the nature of the  material  that's why people think it's a divine work   zhuangzi   xix 10   v    art   is often the art of omission  capturing the at mosphere of a place with  just a few strokes of the pen or grabbing the audience with a few notes  is considered high art  it is often important not to do too much  if  you try to speak a text in a particularly beautiful way  you will  quickly appear artificial  if at a jam session all the participants  constantly wanted to show all their skills  it would be very exhausting  to listen to  only when others hold themselves back can individuals come  to the fore with their solos   as  much as through the emphasis of its tones a rhythm gets its special  character through its pauses  a scale gets its special sound by omitting  certain semitone steps   the white  area left blank on an old chinese ink painting appears like the water  of a river or like wafts of mist between the mountains  the emptiness  here is an essential element of the composition   in  the early twentieth century  abstract painting de veloped through an  increasingly consistent omission of all references to objects from the  outside world   this led to an  undreamt-of freedom in dealing with colours and forms  and since there  is no predeter mined meaning in abstract paintings  they are an  in vitation to the imagination to go walking   vi    let it happen    trust in the momentum of the cre ative process  that was my basic  attitude for decades when i was artistically active  for me  abstract  paint ing became a voyage of discovery    painting always had a  meditative aspect for me  when i painted  i let the spontaneous impulses  of my body take their course  i let my hands do it  without a plan   without thinking  i tried to leave the door to chance as wide open as  possible  what happened to me often went far beyond what i could have  thought up by myself   i playfully  found my artistic way  over the years i did a lot of different things   pictures made of  ce ramic tiles  lit objects  digital art  abstract  anima tions    it was not a  planned development  one thing led to another  each connected to the  other  appearing   in retrospect to be logical  but for me  every new  turn was a surprise  i saw my own artistic development in the way that  train passengers sitting with their backs to the direction of travel see  a landscape  i never saw what would come next   i learned to have faith in the continuing process   and that i would discover more in my journey i d ever dreamed of   vii    cognitive methods   the modern sciences are atheistic in their methods  i e  the recourse  to reli gious beliefs is taboo in the scientific framework for good  reasons  this does not mean  however  that one needs an atheistic  default position to do science  the atheism of science is purely  methodical and not ideological  even those who are scientifically active  have questions that cannot be answered in this way  then one can decide  for or against believing some thing specific  as long as the scientific  activity remains unaffected by this  all is well   besides   the sciences cannot prove an atheistic world view because their method  is atheistic  they cannot prove what they presuppose  that would be a  circular argument   just like a  methodical atheism there is also a me thodical spirituality  as an  artist  i become more open to inspiration when i feel that there is  some thing greater than my conscious self  and that i can open myself to  this something in my creative process  i just need to have the capacity  to be amazed  miracles are more likely to happen when i beleave they  are possible   as little as scientific knowledge can support athe ism  so can artistic experience serve as proof of a higher powers   the  word  inspire  comes from latin and means  to breathe in  it raises  the question  who is breath ing in  but all answers to this question  remain speculation   it is  possible  perhaps even reasonable  to talk about creative work with  religious or esoteric vocabulary  then one interprets experiences within  a given pat tern of explanation  this makes them easier to  com municate  this is legitimate  but it proves nothing with regard to  the pattern of interpretation   beyond  all doubt  the experience itself remains  in tuition can flow more  freely the less conscious con trol you exercise  it is an experience  that probably all people can have  no matter what they believe or don't  believe   viii    success   basically  it's quite banal  of course my art will be better if i'm  painting  focused on what i'm doing  and not constantly thinking about  what oth ers will say or whether my work will yield  enough money  the  freer my head is  the more attentive i can work  with attention comes  wonder and with wonder comes awe  with awe i have a good chance of  succeeding in what i do   in his book effortless mastery the new york jazz musician kenny werner makes the observation    that there are good players who  for some reason  have little impact  when they play  everything works fine  they are  swinging  and all that   but still  some thing is not landing in the heart of the audience    p 10  he attributes this to the fact that they are caught up in  their thoughts and are far too much guided by ideas about how right it  should be   one must practice surrendering control to a larger  or  higher force  it s scary at first  but eventually liberat ing   ibid   i  very often experience my painting when others talk about their art  be  it music  painting or litera ture  whoever wants to taste abundance must  be come empty   ix    emptiness  is of crucial importance in daoist phi losophy    how  the nose breathes and the ear hears  is essentially emptiness  all  things use what they don't have on the basis of what they have  if you  don't believe this  just look at a flute or a pipe made of reeds    huainanzi  xvi 6b   this is  not about an abstract or metaphysical idea of emptiness  it is about the  very concrete emptiness between things or within things  it's about  empti ness interacting with what's there  an emptiness that can be  experienced   emptiness means potential  an empty space can be filled  empty time can be used  an empty sheet can be written on   not burdening oneself with unnecessary things means freedom  to become empty in this sense is the best way to find oneself   to be empty means to have room for

379,"What made you say ""I've had it with this shit.""?",for me  it was late 2018 early 2019 when i was working at a data entry job for  14 hr and no pto  but i had 15 days of unpaid time off  i finished my bs in cs in june of 2018 and could not get an entry level job in software development to save my life  because i had no pto  i had to eat the money that i would have gotten for working in order to waste my time getting rejected by companies  of course  the only thing i managed to get was extremely sick and back pain due to my back being introduced to some concrete steps during the winter  there was also one time when i left work at 5 and didn't get home until 8 because of a blizzard  so that was fun  in april  i took a monday off from work to get some work done on the car and to take my dog into the vet  turns out he had cancer  he died that thursday and i was laid off 2 weeks later because the startup i worked at had a contract that fell through and they needed to make  budget cuts    since then  i've hated working  especially the job hunting process  now because of this pandemic  i lost my job at the call center i got in december 2019 and lost in march and have to do this damn process all over again ,idqqt4

389,Wondering what's next after this job...,31 m  been at a tech company for 3 25 years in a compliance role the last 2 years  i do kyc aml which is just approving or denying new customer accounts  this means i don't have talk to customers by phone or email  this is a huge benefit  however  i'm grossly underpaid   17 50 an hour  denied a due raise to  19 that should've happened in june  due to covid  i can confirm the company has saved a fortune with it's universal wfh policy  and also a cancelled annual company trip to the hq overseas that costs millions every year  instead of throwing every employee a  2 000 bonus as they should've done  they tightened up on every penny  including salary increases   now that we realized the company is going to do just fine and is perfectly profitable in a fully remote scenario  we're an online only financial institution with no branches or stores  they are slowly  phasing back in  salary reviews  but not before they are going to do a  benchmarking  every year they do this crap  where middle management undertakes a completely pointless 3-6 month project to re-assess the median income for your role in your city and state  i view this is nothing but a stalling tactic  it's data for data's sake and it stalls in the actual implementation of the overdue raises  i'm not sure if the company is run by mouthbreathers with analysis paralysis  or if this is a deliberate tactic  or both   so my salary equates to about 37k  which is enough to get by with a small 1 bedroom apartment in my state  but it's a dead end job  boring as hell and the company has made it clear their priorities are automating and outsourcing  they don't even hide the fact our jobs are threatened and the mood in my department is one of pure hopelessness and despondency  everyone feels the same  and despite the company's lies  we're paid about 20  under median  as generally this position starts at 45k elsewhere   in august 2021 i am going to reassess  in june i'll be there 4 years and they do provide a 6 week paid sabbatical  i figure  ride it out until then  take the break and hope the pandemic and job market have improved in the next 10 months   but then what  all my experience before compliance was in customer service and sales  i could literally never do that again  i consider getting into compliance in 2018 a  big break  as getting out of the public eye reduced my stress levels at work considerably  in the spring i put out resumes for other jobs in this area for big banks and financial institutions and got zero bites  i literally can't go back to sales or cs  i wouldn't last 2 days ,iew8fn

394,Working for a Murder Mystery game company nearly killed me.,this company is the kind push the idea that they've been doubling in growth each year to their investors  and yet when the writers making 35k in a big city area  or worse  warehouse employees making 24k or less  ask for a livable wage  suddenly the company  is still a startup  and we are  entitled  for asking   for over two years  i gave my all  and they kept taking and taking  demanding more of me until i had nothing left to give   i gave them a smash hit that got press coverage and a celebrity  i gave them the most in-depth games they currently own  i gave them a whole new brand  i  along with the other writers  gave them everything we got to increase their customer base and bring in positive reviews   and what did i get    working every night and weekend consistently for months to make deadlines  chewing on my tongue in my sleep from stress and not being able to taste anything  heart palpitations for the first time in my life  stress eating and weight gain  trauma and anger built up from daily interactions with incompetent managers and a micromanaging and condescending producer  broken promises left and right  crying most nights  unable to enjoy life outside of work   the cherry on top is that i was part of a mass layoff  8 women-- 3 lead  senior writers  a project manager copy editor  and two customer service reps-- and 1 man from the warehouse   no white man from management or marketing ever gets fired  even for terrible mistakes or reprehensible comments made to female employees   we were told the layoff was due to covid  but they've been hiring people since then  they just wanted to  clean house  of the oldest and most disillusioned employees   within 3 days of being laid off and the shock had subsided  i had already felt so much healthier  i was actually sleeping  i wasn't stress eating  i wasn't dreading talking to anyone  or pulling my hair out trying to make an unreasonable deadline  i wasn't being condescended to anymore   i felt lighter   i still have a lot of anger when i think about it  no doubt it's trauma that i need to talk about and sort through   but at least i don't have to fucking work for that depressing  toxic place anymore    i just hope they go under some day  and badly ,ieb34g

401,Having a Rough Time,this is the only group i feel like will  get it   i'll try to keep the rant short-ish   this is the only place i feel like i won't get constantly bombarded with empty motivational platitudes and told i'm  lazy  or  whining  and to  suck it up and hustle  this epic post is a little bit  woe is me  and that's just how it is    later  eh screw it  i apologize for nothing  i'm posting this somewhere as catharsis  and it's entirely your choice to read it  i just need to reach out because my internal well-being and stability has slowly been worn away  maybe i'll post it to a blog or something to show others where i came from  when i cross this mountain  i dunno   anyway    commence     for starters  i consider myself reasonably intelligent  who doesn't  i have a lot of constructive   healthy   productive hobbies  i'm a 3d artist  i've built my own 3d printer  i'm learning game scripting  i practice martial arts i say this because when i  give a shit  i don't give up  i keep learning  i keep doing  like many of yourselves  i'm definitely not  lazy  life is too short for a single focus and i pride myself on being so multi-faceted   most of this is possible because i have a living situation where i live with family and can get by working only 19 hours a week  i'd love to be a self-sustaining artist or gamedev  but my biggest struggle is maintaining a mindset to do so  i see all these people who managed to do it  even though they had to slave away at full-time jobs or  careers   i know i'm in a privileged situation  and i feel exceptionally guilty that i can't make something better even with those advantages    i'm increasingly convinced i have adhd  and right now i'm struggling to even get an appointment and figure out a proper diagnosis  my moods change on a whim  i'll be inspired and confident and ready to rock n' roll and then in 5 minutes i'm a worthless sack of crap who will never amount to anything  i'm ready to start a digital sculpt and suddenly i have 35 unrelated wikipedia tabs open because i made the mistake of looking to the internet for reference    i stopped playing games  if i can wrestle my brain into agreeing with me for once  i work on my skills  on projects  on tutorials  i occasionally buy games on sale because they look so fun and yet i feel  guilty  playing anything because the longer i play now  the more shifts i'll have to endure  later  so they sit there  waiting for an imaginary day i can finally  get to them    i'm sure at this point most of us have a backlog that  if played in its entirety  would be triple our own lifetime   the exception being   i play the occasional game my so and i can agree on  because it's a way to spend time together    but yeah  the point is to dispel the assumption that i might be dumping my life into games and complaining that i'm not getting anywhere  i know those people  i hurt for those people  and i'm not those people   i jumped into a game jam hoping i could test out the new skills i learned  but it took me forever to code basic functionality  the day-job-work-block hit  i won't have anything to submit  i failed    amp x200b   where the hell is all my time going    amp x200b    but maybe if i work on my self-talk   maybe if i learn this time-management skill   maybe my art will be good enough soon   how the hell do these people find the time to learn this stuff so damn fast when i'm so slow   yeah  i screwed around in high-school because gamedev wasn't exactly an established field at the time  i had nobody to  mentor  me or explain to me otherwise  i have no artists in my family  the thing that hurts is when i ask most skilled artists about their  origin story  they tell me a parent or sibling or best-friend or what-have-you played a huge role in guiding them   if anything  i took so many detours believing i need a  fallback  that's stable  and vastly underestimated just how demoralizing the  working world  actually was     where i'm at now   so after a series of terrible customer-servant-jobs  that's landed me in my current job  i work at a pseudo-government institution and my job is to help with whatever stupid computer questions from any human-refuse that happens to wander in  i'm often alone  and often without a line-of-sight to know who i'm about to encounter   i thought i'd get to help people learn computers  how wrong i was  mostly i'm just there to help the incompetent apply to kfc and print out paperwork for loan-sharks   or lots of landlords who wanna print out half-assed tenant agreements   i want to make it clear i will bend over backwards to help people in need  but usually i'm just there to be taken advantage of  mostly old boomers come in and immediately tell me  how dumb they are with these computer things  and just as soon start flattering me with how great i must be  so i'll do it for them of course     my usual response lately is to look terribly confused   well that's quite an assumption  i'm not that bright    i grew up helping my parents and old relatives with computers and being patient  it's not like i'm an elitist jerk  i'm just tired of the same old narrative  i just straight-up  politely  call it out now     oh well you're young so--     no  it's a skill like anything else  like cars  computers have been commonplace for literal decades  much of gen z has no idea how to use something without a touchscreen  so please  don't   the place can either be packed full and peaceful  with people just doing their business  or empty save for 3 people who will run me ragged an entire shift  raising their hands like schoolchildren to summon me for idiotic questions  like  and i shit-you-not   what do i do after filling out this job application  the next button    i've also had plenty of people try to get me to help them cheat on  if there are 10 apples and you take 2 away  or  if the register says ' 14 32' and they hand you  100 00   otherwise  it's not being able to find the black-on-black address bar in chrome  or having to attach a resume to something  or an email attachment  or nothing is working because they opened internet explorer     amp x200b    gt i clicked the 'e' for internet     -actual quote i've heard more than 30 times i swear   plenty try to get me to write their resume  for them     the word  resume  tastes like corroded pennies in my mouth to this day    basically   imagine waiting tables except you can't hide in the kitchen or enjoy a panic attack scream in the freezer  you get no tips  and  all of the customers are campers who stay as long as they'd damn-well please   they'll even joke about how they're making you dance-monkey-dance   heehee making you work today huh     boundaries crossed   despite the internal screaming  i must come off as rather nice  because it's gotten me stalked numerous times  usually by creepy leopard-print-clad women circa 1950-something  and i mean  stalked  she'd call my coworkers multiple times a day asking for me by name  and it took a long time for anybody to take it seriously because haha how cute i'm a young man and i must be cougar-bait how flattering    a steady schedule is usually a wonderful perk for a job here it works against me   she literally would set up her laptop at my service desk and refuse to leave  she'd ask inane questions like  how do i change my linkdin profile picture  which somehow turned into  i look young in that photo right   i refused to comment  she even asked if she could  take me home   thankfully she just stopped showing up or calling one day   i had another aged foreign woman the other day say  were you running late  i saw you running  i was waiting for you   i just shot back  oh  that's weird  yes  late is how i roll  why    amp x200b     i've had another regular threaten me because i politely said they could put their big-ass big-gulp on the shelf in the back instead of next to the computer   management immediately tucked tail instead of backing me up    numerous karens who expect top-notch hand-and-foot service they aren't even paying for    don't even get me started on  friendly  people who keep trying to touch you    this is all the same during the pandemic  i literally cannot social distance because i work in a cramped space and often have to lean over people to point out what they should do  or take the mouse myself  so they'll just  friggin  leave   sometimes i deal with cool people  sometimes i get crackpot conspiracy theorists  and sometimes i just get your compost-variety assholes  the great part is  being a community center as it is  the worst of them tend to live  right around the corner    you know how sometimes you meet that crazy meth-head and decide to put it on the  creepy encounters  sub  well hey  at least you'll never see them again   well here  that nutcase is gonna be a recurring character in your particular story  and there's nothing you can do about it  they're a local  they like it here  they know not to do anything throw-out worthy but they'll get right up to that line without crossing it  will they show up today  tomorrow  when  who knows    but don't worry  they will    and always  always  without fail  when you're  alone     back to  line-of-sight    there's a big ol' open door in front of me  i can't see them coming and excuse myself to let anybody else handle it  unless i'm standing up tall and peeking out a window my entire shift  i can't know what the monster-generator is going to throw at me from one second to the next  is this next person just gonna print something and leave  will they suck out my life force my entire shift  will they yell at me for something i can't solve  will they form a romantic attachment because i told them how to connect to the wi-fi network   i try to be empathetic  but i never signed up to be a psychological counselor or make excuses for everybody's misanthropy   i can look down for a second  and look up to have my heart skip a beat because  oh look  they've suddenly materialized and they're ready to make my day    or  i just watch them stroll in and take a seat  my hands get clammy and my breath gets ragged waiting for them to start something   there's been a few of these bullies   villains that i hadn't seen since the pandemic  work began to get slightly more tolerable  my anxiety calmed down  i stopped having panic fits in the car on the way there    i wonder why i have such terrible anxiety problems    fun trivia   the lockdown mysteriously solved most of my psychological symptoms  wow who'd a guessed   s    now  just after i remember to count my blessings and practice gratitude because i hadn't seen them  i think   maybe they moved   maybe to a 'farm upstate'  just sayin'    they're starting to come back  and most often there's more than one at a time  it's like the most insufferable run in packs   because of this  i can't just  leave work at work  as is constantly suggested  i can't just  ding  breathe a sigh of relief and hope tomorrow is better  no  it  gets to me  it  stays with me  what will i have to deal with soon   i'm always running  combat-scenarios  in my head preparing for the random chance i'll have to put up with their shit  i'm constantly trying to bolster my assertiveness and figure out how i'd get them to leave without bringing heat down on myself  i hate confrontation  and i'm really bad at knowing when and how i should act when they cross a line   i had a particularly nasty jackass come back the other day  who also abused my coworkers across the building  i'm afraid he'll be back in my next shift that starts soon   lol gonna be late  ranting online   i'm so strung out inside that i'm more than willing to just use up my good-will and tell his aggressive  complainy self to stop coming back  if he hates it here so bad  can you believe i'm hoping he acts irrationally and starts a fight so he can be trespassed and we can get this whole game over with  that's not right   no  this way of thinking isn't healthy  yes  i've tried cbt  and telling myself it's all in my power to control my emotions and my reactions and feel the force as is penetrates us and moves around us as we control our breathing blah blah blah     sarcasm aside  i'm not dissing it  it really does help sometimes it's not enough though   it doesn't stop the freaking skinner box of randomized punishment  and i feel like the creative  loving  generous person i used to be has been reduced to damaged goods because i'm just sick of people and want to be left alone  pre-lockdown i would even puff a weed pen before my shift just to cope   i'm concerned about effects on my lungs though   i've been putting up with this job alone for about 5 years      why not just leave   i don't have a degree  i get paid  20 00 an hour for this  literally anywhere else would pay me less than half as much for more than twice the work  there is zero upward mobility  mostly that degree thing  and my job will aggressively keep me  in my lane  if i even so much as try to do anything mildly intelligent or autonomous      hence why i want so badly to just do my own thing    but i can't  i can't think of ideas anymore when i was once brimming with them  i start projects and the  block of suck  part of the week arrives and i can't touch them again for another 3 or 4 days so there's no momentum  i'm not at the point yet where i can ask somebody for money and expect to confidently deliver an end result in a freelance arrangement   i've had a few freelance experiences all disasters so far   now i have this reputation as that guy who's so excited and ready to start something amazing but never follows through  i feel like i'm just not good enough   even if i found another job  they're all the same  they're all corporate  run by corporates  there's still the bullshit  i'll take more abuse for cheaper  interview process  it could likely be worse  and if i went full-time  well  i feel like i'd never actually accomplish my dreams  that  stable fallback  stuff is a trap  it's not like i can save up to have a comfortable  next life  or something  this is it     the worst part is the forced art   capitalism paradox   i have to fool myself into thinking i'm doing it  just for me when i know that this is my only alternative to slaving away forever  i have to be  marketable  if i'll ever escape   i know i shouldn't judge myself by others' success  but yeah i see people who make art because they enjoy it  and that led to them being good at it  and now they can do it for a living   i see people starting youtube channels  and i worry that i might have  at one point  had a vibrant personality that i wouldn't mind sharing online  but now it just feels like well  more  public contact  is the last thing that would be good for me   meanwhile i know i do love it  but i have to get good at it  so i can finally obtain my freedom  but besides life's events in general  i'm constantly drawn back to this forced obsession over what i'll be forced to deal with at this godforsaken  job    i feel i don't have the leftover energy to do freelancing even if i could  because i just can't handle more people demanding things of me right now   annnd what if i couldn't follow through   i'm sicking of hearing all these stories about former  company-men  who saved half their salaries  asked their boss for paid vacation  got a sign-off from the wife  and had a  runway  to  follow their dreams  i don't have that  i have triple digits as an emergency fund if shtf really bad  and i can't let down my wife like that     conclusion   thanks    i really don't know why i wrote this  but i just had to put it somewhere  i feel like my struggle is misunderstood by

406,I used to love my job.,tl dr i loved my work but after a few experiences of being treated like shit  i'm feel i don't wanna work anymore    so this is more of a rant  it's ok if no one finds it interesting or reads it but i wanted to share a bit of my life experiences and why i'm so pessimistic when it comes to thinking about work  also english is not my first language so there will be few grammatical errors here and there for sure    i love what i do  i always did and i find it fun and exciting  while studying i worked as hard as i could  i would get there at 6 in the morning  get back home at 7 in the evening and work some more until it was bed time  i manage to be one of the best students of my class but i never liked smooth taking myself with the professors since i believed in meritocracy  but it became clear that if you wanted to land a good job after the studies  you had to lick the ass of the important person in front of you and that's what happened to some better at licking asses than actually working   anyway i got an internship that was ok-ish  being treated like trash but hey it's the first job so that's normal  i thought  then i got an internship in a company i always dreamed of working at  i still remember how happy was when i got it  oh boy i was wrong    i worked around 12 hours a day to try to impress the people there  the commute was 2 hours in total  i had so many responsibilities that an intern shouldn't have and i was terrified by the ceo who you would hear screaming stuff  you're a fucking retard  to people during meetings  luckily i never spoke to him  i got  offered  at least 5 times the  possibility  to declare myself handicapped so the company wouldn't have to hire real handicapped people  i don't have any handicap  just a couple of fingers that look a bit different than normal  but i always refused for ethical reasons  they left me home because of that  i was paid around 600 bucks a month    i found another job  looked cool and fun but i discovered they weren't paying people  they blamed it on us and they still owe me 4 months of salary after 3 4 years  the owner of that company keep telling us they're trying their best to give us our money but he just got a tesla so i'm sure i won't see that money in this life   i moved to another country because i didn't see a future for myself there  just because of work tho since i always had many great friends and a loving family  got a good job in a good company and at the start was actually pretty nice  best salary i ever got with the  promise  of great yearly rises  better work life balance and the ceo was a great leader who always listened and asked our opinions  he knew every employer and had great values but he resigned  i believe pushed by the stakeholders  and now everything went to shit thanks to the model  you there  do this task now  and if you complain they think you do that because you're lazy  the yearly rise was insulting  they used the excuse of the budget  classic move  while the new ceo gets 300 400k   my point is  i really like my type of job and i'm sure i'll be able to get better and better offers but i'm almost 30 and i'm already so fucking tired of this shit  i'm tired of being treated like a fucking machine and have to say  thank you  for having a job  how is this normal  why should i be happy to overwork myself and in the end it doesn't make any fucking difference    sorry is a long  confusionary and boring post  but i just felt i needed to vent ,ibdrxr

415,Workplace Culture in a Post-Covid World (Share if You Agree), tldr  people do not enjoy their jobs  covid has made it worse  workplace culture needs to find a way to acknowledge this underlying truth and treat employees better   the intersection of work and mental health has been at the forefront of our covid discussions since march  when the pandemic began in earnest for the united states  our mental loads have increased  as evidenced by the output of think pieces discussing everything from parents trying to wfh while teaching school-aged children to essential workers shouldering the extra burden of increased sanitization tasks on top of their existing job duties  in fact  all of this has given way to even more think pieces about how companies can support employees through these tough times  a few popular suggestions that come to mind include    1  allowing for continued remote work if possible   2  ensuring employees have all the resources to do their jobs from a home office   3  establishing regular meeting cadences with direct reports to check in on progress and well being   4  being as transparent as possible about company change  growth  etc   this is all fine and good  but it isn t everything  it probably doesn t even scratch the surface  which is why we have therapists if we can afford them  out of all the articles  blogs  and narratives that encourage us to press on working in the face of catastrophe  i finally feel entitled to this word  while also letting us know it s okay to cry  there s one element of our post-covid working lives that i ve yet to see discussed in any real detail   the fact is  when it comes to work  despite all the passion and productivity we re supposed to bring to the table  most of us are disengaged and would rather not be doing it in the first place  now  don t get me wrong - i m sure that this sentiment comes in drastically varying degrees across the population  some of us really do enjoy our jobs and that s wonderful  however  i m willing to wager a few bets on the subject    1   most  people would choose to not work if they were financially capable of doing so   2  if given the choice  even those who do enjoy their jobs probably wouldn t choose to be at them 40 - 50   not to mention 60  hours week  during their most productive waking hours  instead  these people would opt for a more part-time arrangement    3   most  people view work as transactional in nature - simply a means to an end to afford basic necessities and whatever luxuries can be mined from the remaining surplus  this train of thought in and of itself isn t particularly new or radical  but during covid it s been swept completely under the rug when it needs to be a much larger part of the conversation  think about it - for anyone following national and local guidelines  not everyone is  but that s a separate issue  their lives have been drastically reduced to  1  work and  2  home in the most literal sense  all of the  extras  that used to go into a full and complete life   be it time with friends family  shopping  vacations  sports  etc    are not happening as frequently  and when they do happen  there is a logistical burden to remain safe and distant  the result is a balance that s more heavily weighted toward work than ever before as employees log extra hours under the expectation that always home   always available   so now we have a large subsect of the population that s not only overworked and anxious  but also severely depressed as they cope with the realization that work   never quite the high point of the day in pre-covid times   is now their primary  sometimes only  means of interaction outside of their households  lives have been whittled down to zoom calls  long walks  and socially distanced bbqs and  as winter approaches  it will be more and more difficult to partake in the activities that are making our days a little more bearable over the summer   with so many people regarding their jobs as merely tolerable  what happens when you re in an environment that forces it under a harsh spotlight  we didn t plan on  needing  to like our jobs  not everybody gets that lucky  but  we rationalized  it was okay to pursue a transactional relationship with work in order to enjoy our time outside of it  well that theory is shot to shit now  isn t it   if you re reading and none of this rings true  then congratulations - you re in the 1  or whatever minority  maybe you re a successful business owner  a top performer in an artistic athletic field  or just one of the lucky ones who truly enjoys a job that many would find monotonous  i m not writing this for you  i m writing this for everyone whose feelings around work have been marginalized by the rhetoric that our jobs should provide both economic and emotional fulfillment  i m writing this against the idea that we should keep working at any cost  pushing ourselves to be better and better  while constantly upskilling and hustling  but even without a raging pandemic to consider  that s really hard to do  the difficulty  from what i can tell  is that  most  jobs seem to break down into four components    1  something tedious    i e  spreadsheets  data  reporting   2  something challenging    i e  being forced to learn a new system with little to no training   3  something anxiety provoking    i e  yelling clients and or managers  multiple tight deadlines  emails at all hours   4  something ambiguous    i e  very vague goals and direction that result in all of the above  proving that stress and boredom are  in fact  not mutually exclusive  even if there were some sort of emotional payoff at the end of all this minutia  it s hard to justify repeated exposure to the above as making it all worthwhile unless it were really  really big  paradoxically  workplaces by their very natures are not designed to play well with emotions on any level  we re repeatedly told remain professional  which means not getting upset  crying  or losing our tempers  so how likely is it that we d be able to truly feel joy from our work if all the other emotions that help us recognize joy are stifled   if at this point we can agree that  1  work is not a great source of emotional fulfillment for most and  2  covid has regressed work from tolerable to a matter of quiet desperation then the issue becomes about how to have a workplace culture that acknowledges this misfortune without completely bucking the system  that s a tough thing to ponder  but i m going to take a stab at it  before i list off what i think this may look like  i should probably also define what it does not look like  a post-covid office culture does  not  look like this    1  managers apologetically asking employees to turn in their tps reports because they know employees would rather be doing something else   2  employees taking advantage of more nuanced management by turning in late sloppy work and going mia while wfh   3  employees feeling emboldened enough to let their tempers flare during conference calls or over emails  we still need to be reasonable about workplace norms even as it becomes more difficult to normalize the rest of our lives  as amusing as it would be to have all companies rewrite their mission statements to  here until we win the lottery  it s not going to pay for our food  clothing  and shelter  instead  managers  let s try the following    1  do not require us to be passionate on your time  simply require us to be pleasant  don t hire for passion either  hire those who possess the skills and qualities to be successful in the position    2  understand that we do not have to enjoy our jobs to be grateful for them and give our best effort  we may not love the day to day hassles  but we understand they re what make up the building blocks of our paychecks    3  do not assume we have more time to devote to work just because we are spending more time at home   4  allow a reasonable amount of slack for late assignments and missed deadlines if there are extenuating circumstances from otherwise strong employees   5  encourage employees to take vacation to mentally recharge and provide adequate coverage so they don t come back to a shit show   6  make video on zoom calls optional whenever possible  we don t need to expend any more physical mental energy getting our faces  and houses  camera ready    7  recognize that covid recovery for many may take even longer than two weeks  do not pressure sick employees to come back prematurely  seriously  don t do this  and help recovering individuals make a smooth transition back to work   8  don t say things like  it s business as usual  if your particular industry company wasn t impacted economically  if business is good  that s great  but it doesn t mean your employees are fine to emotionally plow through the muck and work in a vacuum   9  find out how people s homelives have changed over the past several months  are they struggling with homeschooling  caring for a sick family member  or simply having trouble coming to grips with a new reality    10  lastly  understand in an unspoken way that no matter what people say or how they act  work is still  not  how most of us would choose to spend nearly all of our goddamn time  understand that we are doing the best that we can  we are doing it for the money  and that that s perfectly okay   as the dust settles and we look to the future  let s have a bigger dream than simply going back to normal  why aspire to bring back all the problems of pre-covid workplace cultures  in a post-covid world  let s raise the bar on normal and create workplaces that  sigh  suck just a little bit less ,icfowm
416,Even careers for high fliers doesn't seem so attractive to me now,a lot of people think working sucks coz we are poorly paid wageslaves  if we just got into real jobs we wouldn't be suffering    but i'm thinking would even getting jobs for high fliers be that much better  such careers include   high finance  investment banking  hedge funds  private equity  venture capital   management consulting  mbb   biglaw  top law firms   medicine  management level at a f500 company  these are the typical sort of safe prestigious careers many top uni grads wanna go into    but will it really be your dream job  2 things to consider   1 people are obviously gonna be smart  these are very selective fields and naturally they will screen out people who don't have good grades on their cv  maybe they won't be the next isaac newton but generally these people learn fast  think fast and act fast  and i won't be able to catch up   2 but not only are they smart  they are not anti social nerds or whatever  they can communicate normally  deal with many tasks  handle pressure etc  i mean most of these jobs are client facing and they face important people  in short they are nt or if not  are very damn good at disguising it  at least they act  street smart  to function properly in a corporate environment   so you already have people who are 1 smart and 2 able to act properly in a working environment  but thats not all  chances are almost everyone there has a competitive type a personality which brings me to   competition among peers  these are elitists field which only pick the best to enter  but its a pyramid shape and room for those at the top is even smaller   a lot of elite companies all seem to use a variant of the  cravath system https en wikipedia org wiki cravath system  or a extreme version of the  vitality curve https en wikipedia org wiki vitality curve   in short even if you made it into these elite firms  only a few can make it to the higher levels  if you don't make it to the next level within a certain period  its time for you to leave  this means insane amounts of competition  its not enough to be average here  you have to stand above your peers so you can be promoted or you will be forced to leave  this will in turn means massive amounts of politics and backstabbing   if you're not ready to deal with this kind of pressure  you might as well not enter coz you're basically a walking target for all your peers to gang up on      in short even if i had the intelligence remain in these elite fields  i just wouldn't be able to take any of the social aspects of it  too much competition and pressure  i couldn't stand constantly looking over my shoulder to see who's the next guy to backstab me  i'm not even mentioning my would be boss who's glad to have an easier job ripping people up in their next annual review  call me a quitter i dont care  i'm not made for this and i should finally accept it for my well being   tldr  i quit being ambitious and trying to aim at the elite levels  i rather just have a decent paying job that i wont hate  not like that exists either lol,ibgcjl
417,What do you mean by “end work”?,title   it sounds absurd  if no work is done then nothing will be achieved  a doctor can t heal a patient without working on healing the patient  for example  a farmer can t grow food without working on growing food   a world where literally no one works would thus be a world where the sick get no treatment and  everyone starves   and since this is so obvious  i figure you must surely mean something else than that  so i m curious  what does  anti-work  mean ,ibyq0e

421,this is what i do not get,people talk about their jobs as if their work was  family  and can talk about how good of a place it is to work etc etc and how meaningful their career is and how it's important to them and it's providing them satisfaction in life etc  but if there was no   involved  nobody would be with that work family  nobody would be doing that career  how could a job ever ever be about the good of the community or literally anything when the people who do it would not show up if they were not getting paid  how could anyone at work be family if you would not all be there together if nobody was getting paid  i do not understand this  how do people look this over so often  i know this isn't the most readable so i'm sorry  still trying to find a way to communicate this frustration i'm having all the time in a way that makes sense  basically  how does everyone just conveniently look over forget that if it were not for money exchanging hands  and someone making a profit  or someone needing   to survive  none of this would run  why are we all engaged in the constant business of denying capitalism itself and trying to assert meaning in places where i just can't see it existing  or is it that i am a grouch and all this stuff is meaningful and i'm stuck not being able to see what others can  this could be like the smallest to the biggest thing  like a weird small example is some people could love x vet clinic because they really care about your pet but like my take on it is no they could never care about your pet because if you had no money at the door they wouldn't take care of your pet ever  am i a cynic  it's depressing to live this way  but it's just like how i see the world  to me  if someone wouldn't be nice to you for no money  it doesn't matter how nice they are when you have it  how do people just go through life believing that everyone they pay to care about them really cares  or do people actually care and overlook the money part and i'm the one who can't see that ,ic0r25

423,Waste or capitalism?,i decided some years ago to quit my job and live in my grandmother's house in the rural area  all fine and dandy  i managed to get the crops started  grow myself some vegetables  potatoes  corn  i have two goats  chickens  a lazy cat  the whole deal   although the labour is intensive  i don't owe anyone anything and all i produce is mine  now  as many of you that rant about how they would like to quit their job and live free and without work by picking an apple from the tree and eating it know  this is a labour intensive process that keeps you tied up all day  you have to feed the animals  clean after them  water the plantation  gather firewood  gather the crops  store them etc etc etc  all this beside maintaining a household like one would do in the city  you know  vacuuming  dusting  doing the dishes  the laundry  cooking and so on   now  having a micro-farm  i like to call it this  has it's challenges  some things are a struggle  my potatoes are very small  i can't get them to grow larger than a golf ball  others are ok and others are flourishing  my chickens are flourishing  poultry and eggs production is through the roof  and i live alone  this is my problem   i don't want to throw them eggs away  after all  they're the fruit of my labour  and i'm sick of eating omelette  my cholesterol is too damn high   so i was thinking  maybe i could take them to market and sell them  but i live alone  online market is not an option  i use the public library's wifi every now and then  and i need to be around for the chores i bored you with earlier  the only other option is to hire someone to sell them for me  but that would make me a capitalist that enslaves other people   let's say i can make  100 by selling a batch of eggs  if i hire someone  i will have to pay that person a share of this  100  it should be a fair share  i wouldn't want him to feel like a wage slave  but a fair share to him would mean an unfair cut from my end  if it's unfair to him to receive less than the profit he deserves for his labour  why should i get only a cut from my  100 because i have to be home to tend for the animals   so what do you recommend  should i hire someone to sell them or throw the damn eggs in the bin ,ibah6i

432,Why do companies pretend to be family with the workers?,we are not family and not close at all and i'm just here to get paid  i don't care if you think we are family  i think they just do this because for some people it will be hard to say  no  when they ask you to work longer or do some more stuff when they said they consider you as family  it's so disgusting  if we wouldn't need the money we all would just tell them to fuck off  i hate when companies do this ,icc58p
433,Just a minor rant,so i work at an auto parts store  independent franchise   i put in my 45 a week normally   worked every weekend for the last 7 years    last friday the store manager was fired because apparently  five grand a day in sales is not enough    now  because we're  short handed  i get to work from open to close every day    they have no plans to replace the former manager    and even though memorial day is on my normal day off  they informed me i have to work that day  so other people can have the holiday off   this shit ain't worth  14 an hour ,ico9l9
434,"I don't want to work, but I want to consume.",how would this play out in an anti work society  i legit support the idea  i seriously just don't understand how i'd be able to live my dream of collecting cars and travelling the world if everyone was doing only a job they wanted to do  would there be exciting cars still  or would they only be basic transport for necessity  who would want to work at the airports or be a flight attendant  pilots i could see  that's an interesting job  but the boring ones  and yes i understand automation  but not everything can be automated  i haven't found the answer yet because it seems most others with this ideology want to live a much simpler life  while i still want to hoard a bunch of random expensive shit  lol  but i don't want to work to pay for said random expensive shit ,ici5uq
435,What the fuck can I do???,i decided to post this here because i don't know where else on reddit would really care to listen and relate to how i feel   i rent a piece of living room floor to sleep on from my sister for  400 a month because she doesn't want me sleeping on her couches  yet she lets people that she favorites to sit and sleep on the couches  she talks down to me like i'm shit or like i'm an incompetent but that's another story for another day  i'm tired of living with her   i don't have time to go to school because i need a well paying career now so i can get the fuck out of her place asap  i live in los angeles  ca and i went to the calhr website to see if the office typing exams were available again and they still aren't available  i wanted to take an office typing exam so i can get an office job with the state of california  but the exams aren't available because of covid  and even if they were available  they require you to be enrolled in up to 50 credits worth of office tech classes and they want you to have at least a year of office training or experience  i don't have either of those  and i can't find any paid apprenticeships that i can qualify for that aren't heavy duty work made for men  like hvac and mechanic  i'm a female   there are other employment programs by the edd called targeted local hire and bridges to jobs  but these job programs hire you on some stupid fucking lottery based system  once you apply they place your application in an application pool and you are randomly selected  they said you can end up waiting up to a year to be hired because so many other people applied  this is so stupid  why do they have job programs that play russian roulette with people's lives  why isn't more money invested into training people for well paying careers  i have aspergers and leap is a sick joke  i went to try to find a leap worker to help me at my local department of rehabilitation office  i found a worker but she was no help at all  she had me waste my time applying and then when i leave the office she never follows up with me like she said she would  i waited almost 2 months for her to contact me and she never did  i finally contacted her and told her that i will leave a bad review for her and the office that i went to   i am so frustrated  and with this covid stuff going on it now seems impossible to get out of my sister's place  i feel like i have exhausted all of my options  i love computers so maybe i should buy a laptop and start practicing coding and then apply for programming jobs before i am even ready to be hired  i heard that some companies will hire you to be a programmer well before you are even ready  i understand the logic of coding and why computers do what they do but i have never programmed a game or application in my life  i have  3 048 saved up in the bank that took me months to save up  maybe i should use it to buy a laptop and then go join a coding bootcamp   all of us at the bottom of this gigantic fucking pyramid scheme called society are suffering  meanwhile the greedy fuckers at the top of the pyramid are getting richer everyday especially now with all of this lockdown shit going on   i feel like giving up  i really do  i'm tired of going in circles and not getting anywhere in life  i've been stuck at my sisters place for about 3 years now  i want to just disappear i really do ,id3w2m
436,I'm so sick of working my ass off for bare minimum wage,and my managers wanna bitch at me anyway  the only reason they can treat their workers poorly is because too many people are brainwashed to take it up the ass  in theory we could stand up to them  and demand higher pay and better treatment for the work we do  but in reality people would rather kiss ass than do something about it,ict3vk

443,Does browsing LinkedIn make you feel inadequate?,for example  in my class of 2010  everyone  barring myself  went onto have careers in their chosen industry  ditto for another field i tried to break into  so when you look at  my network  which i avoid  but sometimes browse out of curiosity  you see how far they've gone in their fields and how you're still stuck at square 1  does this make anyone feel what's the point  up until maybe last year i worked hard in general  but i'm skeptical whether most people work that hard at all  the jobs market is dialed to  extremely competitive  but out and about i don't get that impression from the vast majority of people at all  and more than that competition sucks and working hard after a certain point  becomes kind of futile ,ic5sov
444,Anyone have practical advice on how to power through a job you don't like (work from home)?,heya anti-workers  i'm looking for some practical advice    first  let me tell you my situation  i work in corporate it  which mostly means shifting through the same 3 or 4 excel sheets for weeks on end and occasionally downloading data from a 20 year old system that is barely still standing   it's very boring and annoying and i don't enjoy it one bit    i have been working from home for the duration of the pandemic and it has been an improvement  when it's quiet i can more or less take the day off  but this comes with the downside of making me resent any work that i have to do  it also removes one of the few pluses of my job which was talking to my coworkers    i really  really  really  times a thousand  dislike this job  but i am not in a position to quit right now  the job market is very bad and i would not be able to shift easily into a new job while working from home  i also don't have enough savings to retrain or take extended time off  although i am saving quite a bit    i reckon i need at least another 6 months in this job before i can practically leave  but that presents a problem  which is getting through these 6 months    the main problem i have with my job is how boring and unfulfilling it is  it's tedious and repetitive and i find myself procrastinating or dodging work  which usually just means more problems in the long term     amp x200b   so  any practical coping mechanisms or tricks i can use to get through the tedium for at least 6 months   any help would be greatly appreciated ,ibxlg2

446,Getting drunk mid-week,this won't be the most enlightening of posts  though it is my first  so cheers to me  but as much as getting drunk in the week is a symptom of working  it is sometimes a glorious break from work too  naive  i know  but let me fucking drink and type for a second  christ  i don't know how why  i suspect due to a shit storm of late  but today a few of us went for beers  when normally it would be off the table  literally and figuratively  and it added something  probably because it was during working hours  lol  and i don't mean a sit-around-and-network session  but fucking beers with people who think the same  also a rarity  today felt like the slightest of middle fingers being pointed in the right direction  instead of up my fucking arse  and call me naive  but it's one day not having to work when i should've been  so at least that  after all  life is about the brief moments  due to work  so i'll chalk this off as a win  even if my sober  more cynical self will wake up tomorrow and read this back and think 'ya twat'  yes  tomorrow will be gruesome  but tomorrow is tomorrow and today is today  how gross a thing all of this is  on reflection  but still  stick your jobs up your arses  ya bastards  just like i'm  not  doing  much love and take it easy x,ic3elj
447,My new job is a union job!!,of course  being antiwork  i'd rather not have to labor at all but this is a step in the right direction for me  i've always wanted to be a union member and now i finally am  people don't appreciate unions enough and are actually fed propaganda against unions  just found this    gt disadvantages of union membership     gt     gt union dues and initiation fees  dues for unions can be several hundred dollars a year  reducing the higher wages received by union members  dues are used by union management to pay for officials' salaries and union activities  occasionally  members are not pleased with the amount of dues they must pay and how these funds are used  members also question how the funds are spread among their local unions and the national office     gt     gt loss of individuality  workers lose their individuality by belonging to a union  in which decisions are made for the group's entire benefit  even if members disagree with union management  members are bound to the decisions of the union     gt     gt financial hardship from strikes  if collective bargaining fails  union management may call for a strike  all employees must support the decision if a majority of employees approve  extended strikes can cause financial hardships for the workers  but it would be for the greater good if the results are better wages and benefits     gt     gt seniority  while having seniority is an advantage for older workers  it is a disadvantage for younger employees  for example  promotions are usually given to the employee with the most years of seniority  skill levels  performance and qualifications are not considered  the person who may be the most qualified will not necessarily receive the promotion     gt     gt no compensation for hard work  union contracts mandate that all workers are paid the same  regardless of work performance  raises are given out at predetermined intervals according to the terms of the contract  workers do not have any incentive to strive for better performance ,ibjp2w

481,Work seeping into the rest of our lives has been normalised and it sucks,checking emails and replying to work texts outside work hours is basically an unwritten expectation of any job  it s almost impossible to fully check-out from work   same for coming in on a day off or having last minute shift switches with no respect for our time  often they ll ask if we can do it instead making it an order but saying  no  often has adverse consequences   i just spent basically a full day of my day off completing my annual appraisal exercise  just because my boss suddenly told us we need to complete it by tomorrow  i could just not put any effort into it and get it done in a couple hours but it affects my salary increment next year   yet when the reverse happens - leaving the office early on a quiet day for example  employers lose their shit ,ibc2an

486,Thinking about quitting my retail job.,hey guys   i'm 19  i just started a new tech job  where i work from home  answering calls and helping people with their computer problems for  15 hr  i work 5 days a week for 5 hours  i'm still going through training    before getting this new tech job  i worked  and still work  at a local grocery store  where i help bag people's groceries  or stand behind a cash register  before becoming a cashier i often did menial chores  emptying trash  cleaning stuff  god i hate cleaning restrooms  sweeping the floor  etc  i still do them from time to time  but now i'm usually cashiering   i've been working my retail job since december 2019  i got it right before covid hit  i get  9 hr  minimum wage in my state  and i usually work a few nights per week  usually 4-5 hours per shift at most    overall  it's an alright job  i get to buy whatever i want at the end of each shift without having to walk to another grocery store  my bosses are usually pretty chill  my coworkers are nice  most of them at least  and the customers are 99  reasonable people who won't make you want to find the nearest gun and blow your brains once they walk out the door  i get a karen every now and then  but it's not as bad as something you would see online    i started thinking about quitting my retail job when i realized that every shift i took  i was risking catching covid and getting infected myself and spreading it to other people  i worried the most about spreading it to my parents  afaik they aren't immuno-compromised or anything  but why take that risk  right    and i was doing it for minimum wage    even though my area hasn't had a  major outbreak  everyone at the store is required to wear a mask when they get in the building  we have plenty of hand sanitizer  and get our temperatures checked at the start of every shift  i sometimes think  could this be the day   i'm also thinking about quitting because working two jobs  even though they may be part time  puts a serious drain on my motivation to do other things  on days where i have to work both jobs  i only get a few hours of free time at the most  which is mostly spent recuperating from watching training videos for my new tech job  before i all of this  i wanted to play guitar and learn to draw and make comics  i liked art and wanted to leave some kind of legacy for myself   i say all that in past tense because in recent times  i feel like i've lost my passion for anything besides work  surfing the web  especially reddit  gaming  then sleeping just to do it all again  it feels like my mind has become preoccupied with work  putting that above all else  i feel like a wage slave   my parents seem to be happy that i'm working 2 jobs  but i'm not  they like to say i'm a working man  and that now moving out seems possible  but i'm slowly getting depressed at how  out of control  my life has become  like any young wage slave  i'm looking into the future at what my life is gonna be like for the next 60  years  it doesn't look good    whenever i bring these things up  my parents heavily advise against quitting my retail job  they only said i could consider quitting once i've worked both jobs for  six months  i'm not suicidal or anything  but if that's how long i'd have to do it  i'd probably spend my hours working longing for the sweet release of death    i never thought i'd say this  but one thing i miss about high school was that hope that my life would turn out okay  that unwavering optimism that once i turned 18 my life would get 1 000x better  god i miss it  i never thought i would miss anything about high school tbh  the older i get  the more pessimistic i become    i want out of this rat race  i want to really start working on my passions like i originally intended when i picked up that high school diploma and shook my principal's hand one last time    to make a small change  i just asked to set my availability to 4 hours per shift instead of the usual 5  i don't know if it'll be accepted or not  and i don't really care  better a small change than no change at all  maybe that's enough for now  but should i just quit altogether   btw  i don't know how to drive yet  so my  opportunities  besides these two jobs are like next to zero    anyways  that's all i have for now  hope you read through my wall of text    tl dr - young wage slave is depressed cause he feels like he has to work 2  customer service  type jobs to support himself  thinking about quitting minwage retail job  and looking for a way out ,ic7cuw

491,My work decided to withhold my pay without telling me,i don't know what to do but i am shaking with anger  last week i noticed that my pay hadn't come in on time  i decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they were getting to it  but they were just super busy    finally i raised it with them yesterday and politely asked if there had been a mistake because i had not received my pay  for context  i am part-time and i work a consistent schedule every week  i turn up  sign in  sign out  and do everything i am supposed to do  often going above and beyond what i need to   well  they immediately respond saying that i didn't 'confirm' my timesheet  i was confused because the app that we normally use to confirm time sheets has been broken  and i had not realised it was working again  regardless  i thought that if you don't 'confirm' it   you were meant to accept any mistakes  not fucking miss out on your pay    so i apologised and said it was an honest mistake on my part  and could i get paid  they said i would have to wait for the next pay period    we are in a fucking pandemic  and me and my partner are financially struggling  we live pay check to pay check  my partner has been stood down from his work  i cannot afford to skip a pay period  also if i had never said anything to them  it seemed like they were just never going to mention it   i turned up and did my work  the fact that they are choosing not to pay me over this is just mind blowing  i can't find any legal advice online  but surely this must be illegal   anyway i have been having bad feelings about my work for months  and this has just confirmed everything i suspected  i am worth absolutely nothing to them  i am worth less than the dirt on their shoes  i have never felt so worthless in my life  all the energy and effort i have been putting in to my work as been for nothing  it means nothing  i should have known    before this incident  i still had some small sliver of motivation left  now i have nothing  i'm done ,icguyi

It’s so beautiful 😭😭,4 - y  the answer clearly isn t economic  it s moral and political  the ruling class has figured out that a happy and productive population with free time on their hands is a mortal danger   think of what started to happen when this even began to be approximated in the sixties  and  on the other hand  the feeling that work is a moral value in itself  and that anyone not willing to submit themselves to some kind of intense work discipline for most of their waking hours deserves nothing  is extraordinarily convenient for them   once  when contemplation the apparently endless growth of ,ick1z9

529,this is what I do not get,people talk about their jobs as if their work was  family  and can talk about how good of a place it is to work etc etc and how meaningful their career is and how it's important to them and it's providing them satisfaction in life etc  but if there was no   involved  nobody would be with that work family  nobody would be doing that career  how could a job ever ever be about the good of the community or literally anything when the people who do it would not show up if they were not getting paid  how could anyone at work be family if you would not all be there together if nobody was getting paid  i do not understand this  how do people look this over so often  i know this isn't the most readable so i'm sorry  still trying to find a way to communicate this frustration i'm having all the time in a way that makes sense  basically  how does everyone just conveniently look over forget that if it were not for money exchanging hands  and someone making a profit  or someone needing   to survive  none of this would run  why are we all engaged in the constant business of denying capitalism itself and trying to assert meaning in places where i just can't see it existing  or is it that i am a grouch and all this stuff is meaningful and i'm stuck not being able to see what others can  this could be like the smallest to the biggest thing  like a weird small example is some people could love x vet clinic because they really care about your pet but like my take on it is they  the company  could never care about your pet because if you had no money at the door they wouldn't take care of your pet ever  am i a cynic  it's depressing to live this way  but it's just like how i see the world  to me  if someone wouldn't be nice to you for no money  it doesn't matter how nice they are when you have it  how do people just go through life believing that everyone they pay to care about them really cares  or do people actually care and overlook the money part and i'm the one who can't see that  how are there genuine relationships when money is involved and exchanging hands   another example of this is how are there so many interviews with athletes  celebrities  artists  politicians  ceos  etc  that never mention money even one time  like why did you tell this story in this way  why did you release the movie at this time  why did you decide to promote this product  and the answer is never  because it will make me more money  it's always some sort of cover answer  how does everyone believe the cover answer  or am i really genuinely out of touch for not believing it ,ic17a6

561,How to avoid working as much as possible until the big Fuck Off?,i have a pretty sweet setup  if you don't count the fact that i inherently hate working  i'm a developer who has been working from home all pandemic  and i already know i'll never be able to go back to a normal office setting  i'm a decent developer so most of the time i don't have much work to do   i'm a one woman team so nobody bothers me most of the time  the problem is my boss  she's a workaholic who has been at the company 20 years  she wants to retire in the next couple years  and i'm her intended replacement  as she reminds me often  this has revealed to me that she has terminal yes-man syndrome  and has picked up a laundry list of useless tasks throughout her tenure  she's been training me to take them over  and many have nothing to do with my job description   most of it is spreadsheet hell  auditing sales documents from a decade ago  or documentation that literally nobody will ever look at   to put it plainly i just don't want to do them  she also doesn't know i have no intention to be with this company 6 months from now  my plan has always been to restore my savings  after an earlier attempt to fuck off from office life failed  and then fuck off to live in europe  at this point i can't give a shit about anything but the promise of good wine  cheese  relaxed work culture  and beautiful old architecture  the pandemic has set back that plan  but i'm determined   regardless  i'd rather die than stay in this city at this job  i will not be here long enough to make learning this bullshit matter to me  too bad i don't have any teammates  who might have been able to relieve me of some of them  how do i avoid working when the buck stops with me   i was thinking that since these tasks are not what i was hired for  i should just pretend to be bad at them  she might get frustrated and continue doing them herself  if she thought these tasks  which are not worth my pay rate  imo  would take bandwidth away from me doing development   have you ever done this  do you think i could get fired for being incompetent at tasks that are secondary at best to my main job function  what would you do ,i8gvou
562,I must leave r/antiwork,i love this sub and i have finally found a place where people feel the same way i do   the world has always made me feel lazy for not wanting to live this way  but you guys have shown me that there is an inherent  wrongness  with the way society functions   but  i know that this will never change   even if there was the tiniest glimmer of a possibility that things could get better it certainly isn't going to happen in my lifetime     so as much as i love this sub i have to leave it for the sake of my mental health   the game is rigged and they will always win ,i9kinl
563,What type of labor do you find meaningful?,it always amazes me when i occasionally see glimpses of meaning shine through the purposeless existence i've been conditioned to accept in my career  i've realized that  work  isn't what i hate  i hate the purposelessness and futility of my work  some of my own surprising examples of finding purpose and purposelessness in labor are listed below  but i'm curious -  what are some unexpected types of labor where you've found a sense of purpose or purposelessness     by day i'm a bureaucrat  but i sometimes do side projects  and damn if they don't sometimes feel purposeful  recent examples include planting plants and pulling weeds  shoveling muck out of a lake  and painting a house  another surprisingly purposeful example of meaningful labor is helping landlord friends and tenants connnect  i know  i know  but still  i find it beautiful to help broker deals where everyone wins   i also play music for   sometimes  and for fun all the time  but surprisingly it does not feel purposeful or  righteous  to get paid to play at rich people's weddings    i'm curious if you all can relate or have different examples ,i90yee
564,"I find it somewhat ironic that in order to not work you have to work a lot, save a lot, and then enjoy your free time of intrinsic purpose with years of extrinsic conditioning.

569,The person who (unknowingly) made me anti-work,not sure if this is the right place for it  but i wanted to share how i became anti-work  mainly anti-corporation  last year i landed an internship at a large multi-billion dollar company  which i was super stoked about because  even though they didn't pay me very well as an intern  it was very prestigious  and i thought it could lead to a further career with the company  ha  anyway  my supervisor there was the person who  completely unintentionally  'woke me up' to the problems with work and corporate culture     -she was in her early thirties  but all she talked about was how excited she was for retirement  she would always share her future plans for travel and such  and would cross her fingers and say  only thirty-eight years to go  if the only thing you're excited for is almost forty years in the future  and you're essentially just trying to make time pass until then  what kind of a life are you living    -she seemingly did nothing except for work  she was always in early  stayed late  took on extra responsibilities  she had meaningful contact with almost no one outside of work but her parents  she told me she hadn't been out with friends in over a year    -she was always extremely stressed out  so much so that it was intimidating to approach her  with questions or even just to say hi in the morning  she also always looked sick and exhausted  huge bags under her eyes and sickly yellowish skin  even though she was a fairly attractive person  she looked awful to be blunt  she would spent her fifteen minute breaks dead asleep in the storage room with a pillow  upper management probably didn't know about this    -my internship was only for one semester  and i was returning to grad school afterward  on my last day she told me to enjoy school while i could  because its  way more shitty  in the work world   interacting with her  and just seeing how hopeless and empty she was  really affected me  especially since she seemed like she'd be a pretty cool person if it wasn't for work just beating her to a pulp  now that i'm graduating myself  it makes me scared  i'm terrified of ending up like her  and 'losing my soul' so to speak  but i need income and don't know what my other options are  it makes me feel hopeless and empty myself knowing that that might be my fate   anyway  i know this is long and don't really know what my point is  but just wanted to share ,i95diw
570,Goal-setting; what a joke!,i find the whole notion of setting goals in the workplace to be a complete joke  especially now during covid times  i m not sure where i m going with this  i just needed to rant    the company i m in has seen revenues decline considerably  so much so that they were forced to cut everyone s salaries by at least 15  management got even more  but their salaries are so much greater so they can still survive  unlike us peons    catch is  we still have to go through our mid year and annual reviews  where the main focus of them is the goals that we set for ourselves  usually  the driving force behind these is an annual salary increase and a bonus  those aren t happening this year    i just find it hilarious that they re expecting us to put any kind of effort when our salaries have been cut  one of the goals for ppl is to learn a new skill  were a tech firm  so you re saying we should increase the value we provide to you as a company while we don t even have the possibility of getting a wage increase  in fact  the opposite   what a joke  i hate the concept of a review  it exists solely to build a case for why someone doesn t deserve to be employed by a company anymore ,i99mfj

573,General Strike,i see general strike trending and being discussed online and just wanted to drop my 2 cents and remind to all the antiwork community that strikes are amazing and powerful tools for liberation  show solidarity to all striking workers by striking yourself as well  support them with emotional and material support and never cross picket line and scab yourself   get the ball rolling keep boosting and organizing  from what i gather so far in terms of american discourse the general strike is being planned for september 1  also note that the longer a general strike goes the better  so plan accordingly and organize your communities and build food and other necessities distribution spots    wish you best of luck in the upcoming struggles  remember to take it one day at a time and eat well and rest well  solidarity from greece,i9dp1h

576,2nd Personal Phone Number,so  my company has given us phones to use for work purposes  i always turn it off when i'm done for the day   due to co-vid and being furloughed for 6 weeks - which i absolutely loved - i had to give my personal phone number to a few senior managers so they could contact me    my line manager has contacted me a few times after work when i wanted to forget the work  hence  me turning my work phone off  while it hasn't been anything major  but i want to circumvent the situation where if i am on annual leave or if i am after work i am getting contacted  i don't want to make them feel like they can contact me whenever they want  i don't want to know and hear anything from my work during my free time   now  saying to my line manager not to contact me via my personal phone and only use my work phone might not be the smartest of ways as this could cause unnecessary friction  i want him - and other managers - to feel like  i am part of the team  and think that they have my phone number   so  instead  i am thinking of buying another phone number and using it as my true personal phone number that only my friends and family have while treating my current personal number the same as a work phone number - turn it off after work and forget about it during holidays  weekends or evenings  i would buy a crappy mobile phone for  30 or something for it as not to have to change my sim card too often   sure  that would mean i would have to change my phone number to login to my bank or gas payments  but this would avoid unnecessary questions as well as make it much more difficult for my workplace to contact me when i don't want to be contacted  if they asked anything about it  i would say that  oh  my area has a crappy signal  or  my phone's battery died  or something   has anyone done something like this  how did it work  did it annoy your coworkers managers ,i8jai1

593,I want to drive trucks and give zero fucks.,i am 35  i worked 20 hours a week since i was 15  i worked full time as soon as i finished high school at 18  i had one  burnout  crisis 10 years ago  but that was quite simple  it was purely because of the shitty job i had with a lot of responsibility and zero free time  i usually spent whole saturday just sleeping  and sunday's drinking and dreading the monday  i took couple months off  found a better job and was back in the race  this time in less shitty job  around 2016  in spring  i started feeling a bit anxous around large groups of people  even people i knew  i was in a hotel in vienna  at our annual company conference  about 250 people  i was about to go on stage for my bullshit powerpoint  which was part of my job at least once a month  never had issues with public speaking  i was sweating profusely and 10 minutes before my time slot i chickened out  dumped it out of the blue on one of my coworkers and said i don't feel well  locked myself in the room and didn't leave until the next morning  i was not able to step in front of more than 20 people and talk to them  ever since  2015 was the best year in my career  i finished 2 long running projects with high praise from all the fatcats at the company  i had pretty good work life balance  took 3 week vacation  first time in my life i went somewhere for 3 straight weeks just with the target to not do anything but relax  i still remember how amazing i felt when i came back  but it was also a time when i started to spend money like no tomorrow  2016 in my job was what 2020 is now for the whole planet earth  work life balance meant the life part is the time you come home after 9pm every day  but i suddenly had to keep up this cult of consumerism i was living in  after all that expensive watch is a great purchase  if it gets to be worn for 15 hours a day at the office  at times i would just buy expensive shit that ended up unopened piling up in the hallway  i think i still have a pair of expensive shelf speakers in the garage that i bought 3 years ago  but by the time they arrived - 2 days later  i was no longer interested in upgrading my audio setup  because i had no time to do so  long story short  too late  i tend to ramble  i let myself become an anxious  shy  angry and easily irritated pile of garbage human being  which is not really good for an executive job position managing couple dozen employees and couple dozen million budget for r amp d  i wanted to quit in 2017  they always convinced me to stay a little longer  with empty promises about different job position i wanted  i finally quit in october last year  and the last few weeks in the company  after i knew it is over  felt like the gravity stopped working  because i was skipping with ever step i took  la di da  i found a job in one day  home based  no direct people management  i lasted 2 months  when christmas holidays were close to end i could not fathom to spend another day on the phone dealing with morons on 3 different continents  i had enough of my us colleague who wanted to  touch base  every other day and just drown me in small talk for 30 minutes every time  i hated speaking to colleagues in india who never  in the 15 years i worked with indians  could tell me what the fuck they actually think  i swear to god the yah nah headbob over the phone is 20 times worse than in person  because i don't even have chance to see your face to learn something is wrong  so i every phone call is basically an interrogation if i want to learn something that you are afraid to tell me because it means there is a problem  no sir  everything is fine  oh yes sir  half of the team quit  yes  everything is fine  the delivery will be on time  oh yes  the delivery has to be posponted by 3 months  how i wished to say fuck you to everyone  i realized i am the asshole  if you meet an asshole in the morning  you met an asshole  if you keep meeting assholes the whole day  you're the asshole  i quit after just 2 months in the new company and i am not working now for the  8th month  i am still not ready to work again  every couple of weeks i get really anxious  with the corona shit happening  we had one of the lowest infection and death rates in the world  but also with full shutdown for several weeks  our economy tanked the most in all of europe  that i won't find a decent job any time soon  even though i know i don't want one yet  but for the first time in my professional life something happened that never happened to me before - i did not get a response to my job application  nor did i ever need to send more than one before  but receiving no response is still far better than those  we are sorry but you did not fit to our criteria this time  rejection emails  i had to dumb down my cv  which landed me 3 interviews  all 3 of which i cancelled an hour prior  i was afraid i would accept an offer if they would make one  after i realized in april or so that i won't be working any time soon  i claimed unemployment from the government  first time in my life  that was another low for my self esteem  i felt like a leech  still do  i have to keep reminding me that in taxes i pay more to the government in a year that they will give me for 6 months  and even if i did not count taxes  in the unemployment insurance i paid for the years i was working i paid a lot a lot more to the system than i will take away  the society tells you are a parasite if you are not productive for the society  which i agree  if you never worked  don't want to work  and collect money from government  but the society  well  fuck society  the family thinks you are a parasite  if you are not working  the family will call you  using expensive phone and cell plan you bought and pay for  to tell you that you should get back to work and be a  valid member of society  my dear mother told me that she  could let it go  after i refused to enter college and started working  she politely forgot the fact they threw me out of the house after high school and we didn't speak and visit for 3 years because of that  all the kids of her friends have degrees and succesful careers and families and kids and houses  and all her friends vere envy about how  important  i was at the company  i worked for the largest employer in the county with 5k employees  how everybody in town respected me  and that nobody in history of the company ever quit at the position i had  because you either get fired or retire from the executive jobs  so the gossip in town is i surely had to be fired  the gossip 9 years ago when i got the job at 25 was that i surely had to suck a lot of cock to get it at such age  but now  my dear mother told me  she has to fear in shame somebody will ask her how i am doing  so my dear mother keeps telling people i still work for the company i quit alredy 8 months ago  my dear mother offered to give me money when i got rid of my expensive german car and bought a small city hatchback for 1 5 of the price with a 3 cylinder engine   oh  if you can't afford it anymore i will give buy you the car  what will people say  when they will see you driving in such car  that surely you are broke  fun fact is  i would gladly take the car  why not  free car  but it wasn't sincere offer from a mother to buy something for her son out of love  it was just to keep a facade of  success in all endeavours  for every family member  i thought only she can be so shallow  but i actually had 3 people over the last year ask me why did i buy such cheap car  one  a car mechanic changing my tires  asked me if i am not ashamed to drive in the car   a man with my status  this is what i hate most about our society  what i hate myself for doing the same for almost all of my life - to value our self worth based solely on our  status  education  job position  house we live in  car we drive  i can't compare it to drug addiction  only because my bade does not bode will any drugs otherwise i am pretty sure i would have a drug problem  but addiction to social status can be pretty hard to get rid off too  it could make you miserable for 23 hours a day  but that one hour of high will keep you living with it  for some it is the feeling when they earn another fat cheque  for some the deferred behavior of employees who  love  hate and fear you  another loves to see their name printed everywhere  i myself  i think i am done with any creative work  done with using my brain  my brain is dead  or it feels like it most of the days  all day i am content just watching netflix and play hearthstone  for hours  i really feel brain dead  writing this post was probably the longest thought i processed over the past few months  i can't deal with people anymore  i can't deal with complex problems  i signed for driving school for big trucks  i honesly feel like driving around in a big truck  sleeping in the truck  will be something i will be happy to do  weeks on road  alone  can't wait to see the face of my dear mother when i will tell her that  wearing a truck yeah cap and tank top with playboy bunny logo ,i89rio

595,"Anyone else feel deeply guilty and terrible about working full time and not spending time with family, pets, etc.?",i've been working 40 hours over night at a warehouse for a month and a half now and i had just gotten done talking to my mom  i was going upstairs and she asked if i was going to bed and i said no and asked we she asked  she said she was going to go to bed of i was since we barely spend time together anymore since i started working  although it wasn't meant to guilt trip me at all i just felt horrible  i can't take this as life  i despise existing ,i8b1p2
596,"This is the sub I've been looking for. At least now, I understand what I'm feeling.",i have struggled with finding a career for a long time now  i went to college but i wasn't really passionate about my major  exercise science  i thought i wanted to be a physical therapist but realized it isn't for me  i've worked somewhat low wage jobs since graduating  real estate admin work  logistics  and now customer service  at each job  after about  6 months  i start feeling really burned out    the idea of working 40  hours a week is really depressing to me  i would rather travel and experience life to the fullest  but i feel like the only way to survive is being forced into the 40-hour workweek  how do people just accept 2 weeks of vacation a year  a couple holidays  and a few sick days if you're lucky  the idea of living in a van and traveling out west is more and more appealing to me ,i8dl5w

598,My story on Antiwork,interesting subreddit  i found it scrolling through popular  this looks like a place that i mostly agree with  since i absolutely despise the thought of working 40  hours a week for your entire life at a thankless job that would replace you before your funeral if you suddenly died   short story about me  when i was a teenager  i used to visit an old folks home a lot and talk with the residents    some of the questions i would ask them were    what do you wish you would have done more of in life  and what are your biggest regrets  not a single person said they wished they would have worked more or watched more tv movies  most said they wished they would have worked less and spent more time with family and friends  some said they wished they would have spent more time doing hobbies or whatever they loved  like traveling or writing    later at 28  i just couldn't take the 9-5 anymore  so i quit my job sold everything and went traveling to south east asia    now about 5 years later  i am living in cambodia  working 24ish hours a week  and saving more money than i spend every month  with my lovely wife and kid  i have plenty of time to spend with them and on the things i enjoy doing    i am only working as much as i do because we want to buy some land and build a house a little farther outside of town  total cost for land and house should be around  40k  to me being anti work does not mean laying around all day doing nothing    it means doing what i love doing with no regrets now or in the future  while reducing eliminating the time i have to spend working for others    i do not want to be in my 70's and be thinking  what if i would have    ps  i do not recommend moving to another country  most people would not be able to handle it  i wouldn't say i am one in a million but i would say i am one in one hundred thousand    pss  new account because i never had a personal account before  my other account is for my fantasy writing  and i do not want to conflate the two together ,i8ty0j

600,A random thought,my grandfather was a carpenter  the old school kind  with hand tools only  very skilled guy  all the furniture in his house was handmade by him  but it took him forever to make even the simplest stool   he worked for a random furniture company where he had power tools  coworkers  logistics  marketing  finance department  whatever a company has  they were making and selling a great amount of furniture   i don't think that he could have been so productive on his own to match the productivity he had at his company  on his own he would have had to take out part of his carpentry time to go buy the materials he needed  then he would have to carry the materials home  after the furniture was done he would have had to store it  sell it  he would have had to be a carpenter along with being an acquisition specialist  truck driver  marketing specialist  salesman  accountant   even if companies are bad  greedy  steal the fruits of the labour and so on  even if he was paid less than what he worked  he still earned for himself much more than he would have on his own   so my question is this  how do i know i won't end up working much  much more for less revenue benefit income if i were to quit my corporate job ,i8ttqn

618,Sick Time Guilt? -Vent-,hi guys  first time poster    tl dr at the bottom   with everything thats been going on in the country both socially and economically  ive been lurking around this sub as well as r aboringdystopia and r latestagecapitalism and generally just agreeing with and laughing along with whats being posted    im lucky enough to still have an income during the pandemic  entry level auto technician  but the job or atleast the company i work for fucking sucks  50  hours a week  benefits are ass  0  employer contribution to 401k  1 2 a day pto earned a month  which counts towards both sick days and vacation  the pay scale is super low compared to others in the industry  management has been super misleading about pay expectations advancement  etc  ive been with this company for almost 2 years now  and im not expecting to be pampered or given a free pass to master tech  but what they expect from us and what they give in return is fucking infuriating  especially with how busy we've been over the summer  im not the only one fed up with their bullshit either  we're having people quit left and right  management is in damage control mod rn  but we are hella short staffed and over worked  which brings me to my point   over the past week ive had a harder time catching my breath and breathing in general   no problem  i says   its just my fat ass struggling in the heat and humidity  i'll lose some weight and quit vaping  then i start getting random headaches  and i get dizzy if i go from prone to standing too fast   no problem  i says   i hit my head pretty fuckin hard the other day on the lift  im sure its nothin  then my stomach starts turning knots and im moonlighting as a septic super soaker in the bathroom every hour and a half   no problem  i says   never gonna trust free burritos from the mexican food place next door again  ill just take my day off and rest this whole mess out of my system  and thats what i did  all day yesterday i slept and took vacations the the toilet  but i didnt feel any better  if anything i felt worse off today  been fatigued all week but this morning was a legit effort to get into work and doing the job felt like pushing a bolder up hill  i tell my manager im going to a minute clinic at lunch to see what they say  i get there and describe my symptoms  and they says  sorry  we dont do covid testing here  you will need to go to the other minute clinic  and im like  dont put the fucking c word on me  i dont have that shit   well in any case  we wont be able to see you today  we are booked full    thank you for choosing not-a-doctor-visit-clinic  please come again  god damnit  i text my manager and say they want me to do a covid test and i drive to the other clinic to see if they can get me in today  i get there and again they are booked for the rest of the afternoon  but they atleast tell me how schedule an apointment for the test  i call my manager and tell him i wont be able to get one done until tomorrow  he says its fine  but he will need me to come back so they can get my temperature  no fucking idea why or what thats supposed to do but apparently ive been running a 100f fever today too lol  he informs me that i will need to stay home until i get the results back from my test and not to worry because my time away will be paid  but the real kicker is that the company posted a paid time off for covid policy around may when our city first went into lock down that basically boils down to  we will pay you for up to two weeks if you are away with covid related issues  your banked pto days will be used first  and then through our good graces we will give you free pto that you have to earn back at the standard rate  1 2 a day per month    so here i am at home  bitching to strangers online about my crap job  worried that ive caught the literal plague  concerned that i wont have another paid sick day or vacation for the next two fucking years  oddly enough i feel guilty for being away from work  why  i fuckin hate the job  but i am thankful for the income  i resent the increased work load with no clear incentive  but i have been increasingly stepping up my game to match the demand and i feel like im letting someone down by not being able to continue doing that  im incredibly burnt out and my mind and body have been begging me to take some time off  and i guess my wish has been granted in monkey paw or sarcastic ass genie style   tl dr - my job sucks  i might have covid  and i feel guilty for taking sick time ,i9wp81

626,You have to have open availability for full time.,not sure if this is the place for this  but i'm just venting  i  f 26  work at a lowe's hardware store  i have worked for two full years and i did just about anything to earn full time  as it so happens  they were looking for someone to fill in the position for lumber cashier and no one wants closings and i thought   why the hell not  i get to sleep in and all  anyway  at one point  i wanted fixed days off because i kept getting 8-10 day weeks and i was exhausted  still am   i asked the manager in charge of my schedule if i could have monday  tuesday off  she didn't have a problem with that since the other cashiers already had the weekends off by default  i do not mind working weekends  anyway  it was going well up until now  i tried to update my availability to have monday  tuesday off to have some sort of a life with my wife  sadly the previous manager in charge of my schedule passed it on to another manager  that manager had me fill out a form for the hr lady and as soon as i took it to the hr lady  she immediately began to shame me for wanting a fixed schedule because as a full time worker i'm supposed to have open availability and basically keep at it like a wind up toy it seemed like   to make the long story short  she was pissed and clearly doesn't care about anyone but herself  thankfully i spoke to my manager in charge of my schedule and she personally took my availability to be able to work with me as much as possible   i don't understand why it's such a big deal to want the same days i was getting for almost a year  off  i signed up for the hours no one wants and we just need someone to close for 2 days that i'm not there  hr lady made me feel like shit and needless to say she's not well liked  but she makes me realize how ae are shamed for even trying to have free time with significant others and even a life  because work is our life  sorry for the rant   tl dr  i wanted the same fixed days off that i was getting for nearly a year  hr shames and scolds me for it despite there already being people with fixed schedules ,i9atjh

629,I don’t believe in responsibility.,my angle on feeling this way stems from the fact that i never asked to be born  i ve never been happy  chemically  medication  or organically  i never wanted to be here  so why do outside forces or people feel they can demand my attention  i don t believe that anyone has the right to tell me what to do    just because something needs to be done  or changed  does not mean that i need to do so  or that i m the person to do so  i don t believe in taking the effort to make something happen  it s either too much work for barely anything  or a feeling of  accomplishment  that either goes away in 10 seconds  or sits in the form of a trophy or reward  broken or collecting dust  laundry  dishes  the world won t explode if i wait  i believe society grooms children to become worker bees  and never question or form their own morality    i don t care about time  chores  jobs  or consequences  i do believe that the world owes me  because again- i did not consent into a world where i suffer  and if i am not allowed to take myself out via euthanasia  i m not going to participate in society    in short  i believe being comfortable is the most important over all  and i do not believe in responsibility ,i8rijp

631,Any suggestions for minimizing time working? what are good jobs to do part time?,i'm currently 20 and about to enter the world of adulting either college or a job  and i'm feeling so lost and the despair of it is really creeping into me and making it hard for me to focus stuff  like the traditional path of work 40hours a week bullshit chores and errands just to be able to live and have almost  no time for what matters seems pointless like why bother living   so i'm trying to find a why out that's not suicide  i cant figure it out my parents who id usually ask think my goals in life are bad  idk if this is the right place to post but you guys at least get what i mean   anyways i know what i want  i just want to have enough to be able to not die  and be able to do what matters in life art  writing  and time with friends and family  like none of that is terribly expensive to pursue but the real thing required is time and imagination  so need to figure out a way to minimize  work time and stress so low cost of living and such   i'm thinking probably best way to do this is either to live out of a van  or try and find a small place in a rural area just somewhere enough for internet and amazon orders  but i'm really stuck on how to figure this out i suck at planning  or what kind of job i can do part time but still pays decently per hour  ideally remotely to save on commute and so if i choose not to live in a van i wont need a car  this is just very confusing and overwhelming to me  and with college rearing its head and i'm not sure i need it i want to figure out sooner rather than later so i don't get myself into a whole  just doing part time community college tell i figure stuff out    amp x200b   does anyone have any advice  it'd be appreciated  thank you for getting this far ,i9nfyy
632,Why?,why do some of you hold onto the idea of some sort of  revolution  happening  people have been talking about profound systemic changes since before i was born  and do you know what it always leads to  more talking  your children and their children will more than likely be doing the same thing  i want someone to tell me what they think a radically positive change in society would look like  what form s  would that take      let's drop the good-always-wins-marvel-avengers last stand fantasies for a bit and be realistic with ourselves  we live in a point in time unlike no other in history  because now  we have technology  technology has given us many amazing things  like this phone i'm typing on  convenience  instantaneous entertainment  and much more  inversely  its also given us many terrible things  like mass surveillance  too much convenience  shorter attention spans  collective apathy  and too much power to those who are fully capable of stomping out any potential dissent     so what exactly is the solution for all of us  and for the love of christ can we please stop pretending that voting has solved any of our problems thus far  we're not gonna fix a broken system by using it against itself  it doesn't work like that  there's a reason why things have been getting progressively worse instead of better  insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results ,i7w6r2

635,Some Ideas to work less,i love the idea of working less also of working for yourself instead of others that don't care about you   it seems a lot of people who want to work less or leave the system want to become self sustaining farmers  to be honest i personally hate that idea  way to much work just to survive let alone doing what you want  i would much rather be a day laborer 1 day a week to pay for food than work a farm everyday   to each their own though if you like farming do it  if not here are some more ideas      this is the most important  figure out what you want to do when you get more free time    examples  travel  writing  painting  making things  reading  staring at the wall etc   greatly reduce the amount of money you need  if you need less money then you can work less and do what you like more    examples  vanlife  living with roommates parents  buying some land and living in a    trailer yurt camper etc    amp x200b   some things you can do to make money that might be more fun than 9 to 5 work       youtube channel - do something about your hobby or something that is actually interesting to you      i had a robotic voiced  health  channel making  2k a month before yt changed their rules  not easy but not exactly hard either    writing - write and self publish a book on amazon and other places    small engine repair - ethanol in gas is horrible for small engines  easy to fix if you are mechanically inclined    make something yourself and sell it at flea markets  craigslist  ebay etc  you could make paintings  furniture  hand carved signs  wind chimes  your only limit is your imagination   tip look at best sellers on ebay and etsy   just selling random stuff at flea markets    work online - mturk  micro workers  be an online esl teacher  write articles for people  farmers market stall - lots of the sustainable farmers are busy or hate selling  buy products from different farmers and sell it  at a different farmers market than them  this helps multiple people get out of the 9 to 5   be a day laborer - lots of cities have  labor ready  drive to town 3 days a week and work  the rest of the time do what you want    junker scrapper - be the guy in the crappy truck that collects metal from all around town   move to another country and start a bar resturuant hotel   hopefully something here got you thinking about what you could do     amp x200b   figure out what you want to do and make time for it  even if you dont know make time to try different things    for me being my own boss took away most of the stress of the 9-5   amp x200b   also remember star link will be available soon  giving you high speed internet anywhere in the world    great time to figure out how to make some money online and save  then when it becomes available move to the country side and live a more relaxed life ,i8vlka
636,Restaurant Work,rant  i'm trying out work at a morning diner  i was hired for register but as usual my employer lied to me and put me on for making serving orders instead  no work schedule yet and haven't even done the official hire paperwork  i'm forced to wear a clear visor shield  which isn't even affective against covid  additionally works us just under 8 hours so we only get a 25 min break    neurosis of coworkers  all female bootlickers who shout like its the er quite literally  why are we overstaffed and the register women trying to do everyones jobs  my ear has been shouted into too many times to count from them   we are told  always be moving always be busy    its slow  we are grossly overstaffed  cant move  what are we supposed to do  if someone stands for more than a minute a bootlicker will harshly scold like they are scolding their ungrateful children lol ,i9wyqf

639,Stuck trying to decide on education,first time posting but after a bit of lurking i feel like this subreddit really  gets  me   that being said  here's my dealio  through working full time and living with my parents up until a couple months ago i've managed to save up 33 000  however  i have no credit  very little equity  no 401k  and outside of speaking a foreign language and hs diploma i have no education  i'm a real piece of work  i know  but i don't have kids so i suppose that's a plus  now  i'm beyond fed up with my manual labor factory job  i  hate  it  there  everyday i aim to clock in  make as much money as i can  do as little work as i can get away with  and leave i've been thinking of   a  quitting and going to tech school for electrical in november  seven month program costing 5 800  the drawback here is i'm afraid after finishing school there would be nobody willing to hire me as i'd have zero job experience with electronics  or the only places willing to hire would want me to start on night shift    b  obtaining an associates degree online in quality assurance  it'd be a two-year program at 4 000  a semester  so  it's costly af but  although quality control has never been my job title  aspects of it have been in some of my previously held  and even current  position s  theoretically i could work full time and go to school full time but then it becomes exponentially harder to pass and my quality of life plummets as  free time  will become a thing of the past   have any of you worked went to school full time  was it miserable   any feedback would be appreciated  figured i'd post it here where i'd be among like minds lol ,iaduse

669,It's astounding how many of you don't realize the problems you have in capitalism you will still have in communism. Basically nothing would change for the common man.,i am very much antiwork   mainly just on the personal  non ideal connected basis that i hate working  also for the notion of automating the workforce  having machines handle everything  not that we can properly do that yet   i am very much  not  communist though   that's not to say i'm a big fan of capitalism  truth is  both systems are utterly horrible atrocities that should never be considered   anyhow  the basis for this thread is that when i come on here i often see people making a complaint about capitalism and wishing for communism  when the complaint they are making is something that would still be part of their daily life in a communist society  only some details would change  i'm not feeling the drive to type a whole essay here  but the gist is that here in capitalism you are shoved down by an oppressor and forced to do work you don't want to do just to have access to the basic necessities of survival  and under communism you would be shoved down by an oppressor and forced to do work you don't want to do just to have access to the basic necessities of survival  the only real difference is that capitalism is more successful at causing those basic necessities to exist in the first place  leading to less starvation than the alternative ,i8gxfj

675,My Existence is Being Robbed,right now  i work monday-friday  9-5 30 pm  sometimes a little later if i get caught up in a call with an idiot customer  i've heard for years from the people around me that i should be  so grateful  and  appreciative  that i have a such a  stable  work schedule and what not  honestly  i just feel like my entire existence has been robbed right before my eyes  this is probably my 18th job in the last 10 years and none have ever brought me satisfaction or have stimulated me mentally  i always end up feeling trapped and bored  unfortunately  those feelings manifest both physically and mentally and end up affecting all areas of my life    i just can't believe that our minds and bodies have evolved over millions upon millions of years and this is where i  and many others  have ended up  what a chance it is to be conscious and alive and here i am sitting behind a desk for 8  hours per day making someone else rich doing menial work  i question if there are any other options out there in terms of way-of-life  i feel down on myself and wonder if maybe i'm not smart enough or lucky enough to ever live a different way  but then  i look around and see that almost everyone is living the same way  the difference is  a lot of those other people are somehow content devoting their limited existence to working a bullshit job   i guess this is just a sorta rant to get my feelings out  i gave on trying to express the way i feel to my family and friends  they don't get it and will say the same old lines   find a job you like   it could be worse   some people aren't working right now   that's life   you have to do what you have to do   go back to school   find another way to make money   sorry to hear that   don't be lazy   take a few days off  etc  it's the same stuff i've been hearing for the last 10 years over and over again    if this is what the next 40  years looks like  why even continue on living  so the rich can get richer off of my existence  so i can continue the facade of being a  productive member of society  it's all just sickening and i'm not sure what to do or where to go at this point ,i8fgch

685,Working from home is important for public health and safety but I can see bosses using this as leverage against workers in the long run,working from home is cool  but the increased personal costs are not offset  i think it will have long term negative effects on workers  i really don't want to sound like some pro-capital anti-labor or anything but something about all this feels really bad   i'm using my lights  my food  my living space  my water  my internet  my everything to make megacorp money  they give me a laptop and a vpn and eveything else is me   more operational costs on pushed on to the worker  and they are not offset in any way  sure i don't have commute to the office anymore but that hardly makes of for all the additional costs  also because workers don't have to travel there are tons of bosses that expect people to be on and available even more now  while it's good and correct to socially distance and all that good stuff but i think this give gives bosses and c-level folks more power over workers in a warped way   also i'm more and more atomized  isolated  and removed from work  i'm far less likely to speak to co-workers  less likely to organize and i'm pretty sure bosses want it that way ,i77yom

690,Employees should be paid to commute,every other resource used buy the business has to be brought to the business and that process has to be paid for    for some reason labour is free despite commuting effectively being a work task that is completed by the employee    if you commute more than 40 minutes one way on a full time contract  that is the same as a whole extra 8 hour work day per week just dedicated to commuting    employees should be paid an amount to cover their commute pro rata depending on where they live  this would encourage businesses to hire locally because not doing that would come at a cost    of course this could be open to fraud by saying you live further away than you do  but you employers could just go by the address on your drivers licence and it s an offence not to update that anyway if you move house ,i6z38s

693,the customer is always right...,if you believe this you are one of two types of people  the first type is a business owner  for them  this line is a commandment on the stone tablets  you can not argue with them and you can not reason with them about this  from my experience business owners rarely deal with difficult customers  that is why they have managers and to an extent cashiers to absorb the abuse  in the cases where a customer demands to see the business owner chances are that the staff member will be sacrificed to placate the customer    this happens all the time    the second type is a special breed of customer  this customer is the obnoxious type  entitled  they look down on you and what you are doing  they assume that because you are working retail you must be stupid  or lazy  i doubt that 'because i have to' as a reason ever comes into their minds about why you are working there  the unfair system they are a part of does not  bother them in the slightest   this type of customer is unaware of the basics of how a business functions and expects things to 'just happen' or things to 'just be there'  they don't have an idea of how a fast food restaurant works yet they will attempt to tell you how to do your job  they have no idea how a particular business functions but they will abuse a cashier for an issue that is actually managements' problem  they don't understand the concept of 'shit happens' and that you can not plan for every eventuality   this customer is more financially privileged than the people they bully  they assume that money gives them the power to abuse people  my theory  they only pick retail places to exert their 'influence' because no one else will take that type of attitude from them    respect is not given  if anyone desires to be respected you should first respect other people  being a customer does not elevate you to a level above other people   the customer isn't always right,i7prq7
694,Companies give no shit about the capability but a piece of paper.,i literally started to earn money by the age of 14  i tutored english for kids  after high school  i never stopped working  i tried multiple jobs and ended up with the one i enjoyed in 2 years     i got married and moved to america  my 2-year experience being a general manager in a different country means nothing  i've struggled to look for a job because of the  qualifications  of college degrees     i thought companies need capable people in order to save time and effort on newbies  or i was lucky enough to work in the company that thinks the same way     i used to work with a lot of graduates who were not bright enough to be aware of what they were doing  i was the one that trained those with college degrees  and now i'm the one that needs a degree to work      the most important thing i learned in school is that the most important thing i can never learn in school     yeah  but where is your degree  what the actual fuck  i enjoyed my job back then too much that i really forgot how exhausting it is to have look for a job ,i7iz53
695,"It's not just that I don't want to work. I couldn't even if I wanted to, at this point. I fear for my future, if I even have one.",this post is horribly written as i am so broken up by everything that i can't do it properly  but i got something down so i am sharing it anyway   i m glad to have found this sub  i desperately need to talk about this  i have felt extreme levels of guilt  stress  and pain due to my inability to tolerate work for nearly all my life  it s been so severe it s driven me to be nearly permanently suicidal  and eventually started to effect my physical health  if you end up reading all of this  thank you  it means a lot   since i was a child i have resented and feared the concept of work  it s complex as to why  but one of the earliest factors was my father  shortly  he s a fascist who has long praised the virtues of hard work  particularly where you suffer  don t worry  i disowned him 2 years ago  for most of my life i have felt so deeply incompetent due to my seeming inability to find my stride and do well with work  i thought i did in high school  but that started to slowly shift following that  my first 40h a week job was the summer of 2008  and the entire experience of it just crushed me  i did it  but the sheer length of time it took out of the day left me with so little left inside when i got home  that summer  i did basically nothing and was horribly depressed  it lifted once i got back to school  but that experience lasted with me  since then  i have dreaded and feared the day where i d have to join the 40h grid   i did get thrown in earlier than i wanted  at the end of the day  i m actually no schmuck  i have a phd in organic chemistry  i tried  i tried so hard to make myself grow tolerant of working long hours  if i did something i loved  i ve wanted to be a chemist since i was 10 as the subjected fascinated me  maybe it could work out  but  it didn t  graduate school was enormously destructive to my mental health  well being  and completely killed my interest in chemistry  i m a shell of my former self at this point  i started my first  full  job 5 days after my thesis defense   5 days  i needed the money despite being so destroyed by grad school  i didn t want to  but i had to  i held this job for 2 years before it crushed me   when i started my job i was honestly  terrified  that i was going to be fired in a matter of days  i thought i was lucky  but would never be able to keep up with it  the work itself  i was able to do most of it  but the sheer terror i felt over it  plus trauma from school which prevented me from performing in key areas rendered it downright destructive  if you include graduate school  i have gone through 14 psychiatric medications to address my mental health issues  years and years of quality therapy  none of it dented my problems  still  i somehow managed to hold onto my job for 2 years and even win award for it as i have supremely good people skills  also  i managed to squeak away with some loopholes  i was actually working around 30-35 hours a week and got away with it due to being salary  and using therapy driving time as an excuse to leave early on some days  as well as coming in late   around a month before i quit i got in trouble for coming in late  and my hours began being tracked  i had to work 40h no matter what  i lasted a month before my health declined to the point of going to the emergency room  i was at my desk  utterly overwhelmed by stuff piling up on me  not being able to will myself to do those tasks  and i felt so ill and in pain that i went to the er  3 days later  i quit  this was a year ago now  i haven t worked since  and am very lucky i have managed to do that with the help of family   in my year off  and through this pandemic i have figured out several things that i have refused to admit to myself  i do not want a job  period  i never have  i have felt so much immense guilt and shame over that all my life  and i though the problem was all on me  but the poor benefits  long hours  too low of pay  too low of resources  and increasing societal demands for more and more are out of my range  literally  at this point  i quite literally  can t  work  i am so scared  drained  and in poor health that i could not work a job even if i wanted to at this point   currently  i am living with my grandparents and they can easily house and feed me  i am so thankful for this as without them  i am pretty sure i d be dead  i tried looking for work a few months ago  but it honestly started to fill me with a sense of panic and extreme dread  much of it  knowing that i would last maybe a few weeks before i d be fired  i just have not gotten any better in the past year  i was hoping the time off would lead to me healing and being ready  i ll never be ready  i tried  i really really did  but the fact of the matter is  it is a literal impossibility for me to work a 40h a week job  maybe i could work a 20h a week job  but it doesn t pay enough and i have 125k in student loans from undergraduate  if i actually want to support myself  i have to do something that i cannot do   i feel overwhelmingly trapped  i don t know how long i can stay with my grandparents  probably a while but certainly not forever  i fear the day i will have to leave because i don t think i ll survive on my own  i really didn t when i was on my own  the job made it impossible for me to take care of my home  my health  my friends  anything  i m just flat out not cut out to work  maybe it could have been different  but my experiences have damaged me to the point where i can t anymore  i deeply hope i can find myself in a place where i have a small stream of income so i can stop worrying and fearing for my life   for most of my life  i have not wanted to work because of a buried feeling that i wouldn t be able to cut it  i tried to make myself  i truly went to the end of the earth to do it  and it didn t work out  now  i m at a point where it s not just that i don t want to work  but that  i can t  yet  not working means no money  which means no food or home  which means death  this is why my mental health is so destroyed  it s why it s been so bad for so long  not working means death  and if you re not able to pull it off  it means you ll die   i m sorry if this post hard to follow  i tried to write it multiple times and i would just freeze  i barely have the strength to explain this anymore  it feels impossible to properly explain all this coherently  so much has happened and it would require a book to explain it all  if you read all of this  thank you ,i6f06a

704,How to Escape the System,this is a question that i have noticed has been discussed on this subreddit previously  and something that i have spent a good amount of time thinking about myself  i am certainly no expert on the subject  but i do have a number of thoughts on the subject that i would like to share with the intention of sparking a conversation if other people have thoughts or ideas they would like to share    now keep in mind i'm from the us  so my experience may be different and what i am going to write about may not simply apply to everyone  also  every avenue will require work and will also require a change to your lifestyle    now before i get into how to get out  i want to go over some fundamentals that i believe    at a basic level  capitalism is a trade  you trade your time for money  i understand it is more complex than that  you also trade labor  expertise  knowledge  skills  etc  if you accept this fact then you quickly realize that time is the most valuable asset that you possess and will ever possess  time is precious and it is always fleeting    in a capitalist system  money equals survival  without it you won't be able to buy food or shelter or any of the other items required to live  so you have to make money to survive which means trading your time for money  now logically  the best thing would be to figure out how to trade the least amount of time for the most amount of money  which leads to people going to school and specializing  again i understand it is much more complex than that    now the trick of the whole system  debt and advertising culture  i strongly believe that capitalism is designed to get people in debt  want to go to college  debt  want to buy a house  debt  oh you got sick and don't have insurance  debt  combine that with a culture that demands endless consumption which again leads to more debt and you have the perfect system to keep people controlled and in jobs they hate but need to do to service all of their debt  honestly when you realize the whole thing it is kind of amazing    the short answer is that there is no easy answer  i don't think there are generally easy answers when it comes to life  life is hard and requires work and to truly escape the system one will have to put in a lot of work  now i am going to try and outline some different avenues that i have explored and thought about    1- choosing to be a hobo  believe it or not  this is something i have thought about  just pack up  hit the road and see where life takes you  this to me would seem to be the most extreme  challenging and possibly the most freeing  i think you would want to have a backpack with essential items  to include a tent so you would always have a place to stay  you would also probably want to have some kind of savings established and a way to get and do odd jobs as you go along  i think you would also have to rely a lot on the generosity of others and you would probably always want to stay near some kind of larger population center to take advantage of the services that they would have available     2 - living in a commune or communal based society  they exist and honestly seem pretty freaking cool  this is probably the quickest and easiest way to escape the system  i myself have dreamed about joining such a community but have not done enough research  for one  the very large  established and well known ones are generally in other countries  i'm personally not ready to leave family but you may be  there are also likely ones in many different states that are not known about  their presence only shared via word of mouth  i knew someone that lived at one for a time and i went and visited them  it was kind of weird to be honest  i really loved the idea of it all but the social dynamic was weird  a family owned the farm and people would stay in the barns and around the house  everyone who stayed had to help with doing chores around the house  whether it was cleaning or working in the garden  work is how you paid for your stay  you really didn't need to have money unless you wanted to buy stuff    3 - the van life   or a tiny house  i think this is a cool idea and also something that i have dreamed about  this option would definitely require some more money  money to buy the van  and keep it gassed and serviced  i do follow the vandwellers subreddit and there are a lot of people who are doing this  and a lot of blogs about it  there are people who are able to secure jobs remotely and actually continue to have some kind of a way to make money while your expenses would be so incredibly low    4 - debt-free lifestyle  this is the one that i am trying for  pay off all debt  as quickly as possible by eating cooking at home and not buying much else  the idea is to keep reducing your monthly expenses as much as possible  now i know about financial independence which also requires having a lot of money saved up and put into investments  once your expenses are low enough you can make enough from the investments to not have to work and essentially retire  i am trying to go at it a little different  i also want to try and grow as much of my own food as possible  and get my monthly expenses as low as possible  i think that i would still need to work but at that point i could do something that i enjoy like working in a greenhouse and i would only need to do it a few days a week to survive    5 - move to another country  norway  sweden  switzerland  countries with much better social support systems and just generally a better quality of life  this option i frankly know the least about i am sure that there are restrictions  and forms  applications  processes that would all have to be completed to be able to do it    anyways those are just some ideas that i mull around in my head  the stuff that i dream about when i'm in the middle of doing a job that i hate but need to do to survive  hopefully one day there will be a ubi and it will be much easier to work less ,i5ikgj

707,The moment I became anti-work.,too long of a post  but here it is   i've worked since i was 17 - 44 now   i have always been in administrative positions and was groomed to believe hard work will pay off   every position i have been in i've left it all  on the field   yes sir ma'am i can stay late or come in early   no problem  i will do that task outside of my job description     after working hours - not even an issue let's get the mission accomplished   job interviews   yes this is my dream job my only weakness is i care too much  etc  etc   can you pass this complex test for this low paying job   absolutely   after numerous interviews for different positions in this company i landed a job that paid me  15 an hour   my college degree was really paying off now   medical costs - don't mention it  brings my pay down to about  10 an hour    this admin position was an 8 hour work day with a lunch of 30 minutes to 1 hour with 2 fifteen minute breaks  i had a manager that was a task master and was borderline micromanaging   i took my breaks on time  was prompt for lunch breaks  and did everything as instructed   after working in that position for a year a diff position opened up in the same cubicle area with a different manager   it came with a whopping  1 50 pay raise bringing me to  16 50   the manger for that position pulled me into her office and said i would be a good fit   i applied  and was granted an interview   i put my best foot forward threw on a tie   the interview consisted of her telling me that since i am not a millennial i would be a good fit for this position   she spent time belittling millennials  i nodded my head and lucky me i got the job     in this new position i did all my work and was super efficient   there was no hard and fast requirement to be at the desk  because there was no office traffic  or anything that would ever require a customer  or co-worker to come to my desk   if someone sent me an e-mail i would respond within seconds   after being there for a while i learned i could clock in and out on my phone  and respond to any e-mails the same way   this position did not require any phone calls     my manager would come in the office once a week  and when she was there i was always there   when she was not i would take all types of liberties by clocking in and out on my phone  and responding to e-mails the same way   i did this for more than a year   one day on a random friday my manger showed up to the office   i was doing my usual routine of a long lunch  and decided to actually show back up to the office   she called me in and said  where were you  i show you are clocked in from lunch   i didn't come up with any complex story and really did not say much   she let me know that my co-workers had complained that i was not there on some random like 2 months prior   again  i did not say anything   she said she would think about what she was going to do on the weekend  and let me know monday   congratulations   you're fired   i took the walk of shame out of the office   my co-workers were glued to their desks  check-in  check-out promptly   keep in mind their management was not even in the same state  and had no office locally   they were soooo full of integrity that they wouldn't dare falsify hours  or take longer breaks even though they would surf the net all day     there were people there in same positions still making  16 50 after 20 years with no hope for a raise   getting fired even though i was performing at a high level  because i was not glued to my desk was my moment   anti-work   you're telling me i get the job done  but because my lame brain non-social internet surfing co workers want me at my desk i am fired    ahahhahaha     there is so much more about what happened here  but that is all i will share for now   after moving on i was liberated  i fought for it and was granted unemployment   was lucky and received the extended unemployment  took care of personal affairs to include my military disability   i recently signed up for a work from home job where i will actually be helping people     the system is bs  and i finally figured it out   let's keep this sub-reddit strong ,i6d1t3
708,At the end of my rope,guys i think i have undiagnosed autism thats making working complete hell and ruining my life   i'm 23 and i don't know how to drive  i've tried learning but whenever i physically get in the car it's a disaster   i dropped out of high school because i couldn't learn anything math related and i felt so fucking dumb   completely socially retarded  never had a girlfriend or anything  basically have never been out anywhere in a social setting my entire life   i have only 1 friend from middle school who i talk to  its strictly an online friendship   i still live with my dad and his wife  they give me rides to and from work all the time and i feel terrible about it  public transportation is virtually non existent where i live   i've gotten jobs though  my current job and 1 previous job  both are warehouse jobs i got by going to a temporary agency  temporary agencies will hire anyone   got laid off from the first job because it was strictly temporary seasonal work   my current job i got hired on after a year or so  it would be a great job if i didn't have to be around other people     everyone who works there are miserable people with no lives and have nothing to talk about  so when they see me quietly minding my business and doing my work i become an easy target for scrutiny   our supervisor constantly has me do my coworkers work for her while she blissfully works as slowly as she likes and while she talks shit about me with everyone   she's constantly behind on her work because she just knows the supervisor will get me to do whatever work she doesn't feel like doing   no matter what i do she has a problem with it  i could literally just stand up and walk by her and she calls me a dumbass under her breath   i haven't done anything wrong as far as i know  the only reason she hates me is because i ignore her like the plague and just quietly do my  and her  work   she herself is miserable and has no life outside of work either  the difference is i'm completely fine with it because of my nature or autism or whatever    she on the other hand makes herself feel better by walking around to other areas and talking shit about me to other people  she lies to them telling them i'm lazy and don't do anything  its complete bullshit    i've confronted her on 2 occasions asking her what she said  she loses her shit and tells the supervisor that i'm crazy and i'm making it up in my head   supervisor always sides with her  basically i can't do anything  me and my coworker work in a workshop area away from everyone together alone so its impossible for me to prove the way she acts around me   i've tried standing up for myself and telling the supervisor i shouldn't have to do her work for her especially with the way she treats me  but he says its  teamwork    it's making me depressed as fuck and im seriously considering suicide having to get up every single day to go into work to deal with this   i want to quit so bad but i know it will be very unlikely ill ever get another job    i know if i was a normal person i wouldn't have any of these issues  like  if i was able to socialize with my coworker like a normal person she wouldn't have come to resent me  but i just can't  deep down i feel like i don't have autism but it's becoming increasingly clear that i do    so wtf can i do  can i get disability for my apparent autism  like i said its not diagnosed  would i have to go to some sort of doctor and convince them i'm fucking retarded    if i could get disability and live in a tiny place somewhere and never have to interact with people ever again that would be my ideal life   i have to figure something out soon  if my dad were to pass away suddenly i would be completely fucked because i rely on him too much  i would be homeless and i would definitely just jump off a bridge at that point   thanks and sorry if anyone reads this long ass ramble,i6v2y6
709,Yesterday I followed through and quit my job,i have a bad habit of not following through on things  leaving toxic jobs in the dust being one of them  i ve been miserable for months and i was actually laid off in june for all of a day before being picked up by another department within the same company  which was a big red flag since it showed me they were willing to set me adrift in the middle of a pandemic when not much of anyone is hiring    that being said  the last straw took place a couple weeks ago when i was in the office  i started in this new department about a month ago and was still getting the hang of everything after barely being trained  basically i asked my new supervisor where i should put away some folders full of things that i had been working on once i was finished with them  she pointed in a vague direction and said  put them in the room with all the boxes  now a few days prior i had been shown a room with a bunch of boxes and trays where things were stored  so i headed there and about 3 4 the way there  roughly 40 feet from where my boss sits  she yelled across the office and in front of all my coworkers  what are you doing  not there  the other one  and proceeded to make some comments under her breath  at which point she and the group of women that surround her desk all laughed  not so much as even glancing in my direction   that one interaction made me feel so small  i m young  only 27  but i m old enough to have gray hair and a college degree  and i hadn t felt so insignificant and humiliated since i was the new kid on the first day of third grade  absolutely awful   so yesterday morning i decided to just go in first thing and gather my things and leave my badge with my notice that it would be my last day  i will concede that giving your 2 weeks is a courtesy that should usually be extended  but so is treating your employee like a human being who deserves respect   i have a part time job lined up with a small company near me  pending my background check  and i m going to do that catch my breath for a bit  i hope you all are treated with respect by the people you work for  because you deserve it  we all deserve more,i5o3ia

712,"If you can opt out of Capitalism, you should.",i know this isn't realistic for the vast majority of you  i'm strictly speaking for people like myself who are in a position to drop out of capitalism without being starved to death or left in the streets    if you can do this  i'd highly recommend it  getting all your time to yourself to better your life  learn  think and have fun is very much worth it in my opinion  i know there are downsides  there is very little choice in anything when you have nothing  but you can still get by using the internet since everything digital is free if you know how to find it  yes society will hate you  but if you really care about the truth  that won't bug you    the world needs more people dropping out to use their brains instead of pretending money has value  if you spend your time right  dropping out will be of major benefit to society  in that you can help to spread knowledge and be a good example to your fellow man  you can spend your time shaping the way you think to better help others follow suit  in the way i am doing now    we need as many humans as possible doing the right thing  so if you can do the right thing and drop out of a system that hurts your own species  you should  a world of information  knowledge  contentedness  happiness and understanding of the fundamental nature of reality await all those willing and able to use their time wisely ,i6iaap
713,If your economic system has access to modern tech but still can't feed everyone then it is not functioning.,we have everything needed to make sure all the needs of humanity are met  in fact  technology has been there for a very long time at this point  the amount of suffering and death that could have been prevented with the use of technology  but wasn't because a economic system made it impossible  is gut wrenching and disgusting    if a economic system has access to modern tech  but still cannot find a way to feed everyone  then it is by demonstration  a failed system  we let the capitalists try their system worldwide  and it failed to meet the needs of everyone    they lost the argument  their system didn't work when we let them try it worldwide  so it's time to  for the first time in modern human history  try a different system worldwide  and thanks to the fact that humans are naturally inclined to share  we will eventually make the switch from capitalism into a system that values human life rather than money  we're already starting to see the shift thanks the covid showing everyone just how prepared capitalism is for things ,i6i4u5

716,How to go about unemployment without getting fired,hey everyone  sharing this incase anyone has been in the same situation and knows how to go about it  or is in this situation and can follow this post   so a few weeks ago i got an email from my daycare center saying they see an increase in enrollment  and are calling people back  and were looking for my decision  after thinking about it  i decided to go back  only two days a week  they said all the safety and cleaning procedures they were going to implement  but they said wearing masks for anyone over 2 was optional  even tho all staff had to wear them   so  i was observing everything back at work  and not much has changed  there isn t much distancing like they said  the masks are  optional  and i ve only seen one kid with one  the 6-7 year old group  and everyone is so close to each other breathing on each other  and sharing the same toys  the only change i see is that staff has to disinfect the toilets each time a kid goes    the other day at work  in my classroom  i noticed a few kids coughing and sneezing all over the place  no masks of course  i tried to distance myself  but it s hard when everyone is contained in one classroom  a few days later  i started to not feel well  still don t currently  sore throat  dry cough  stuffed up nose  and i m highly certain i got this from the daycare as i didn t get sick once this corona period since i took a temporary lay off of my job in march  i also saw a few posts saying that cases are rising in children  and it has me a little concerned as i work around multiple children all day  i do not wanna go back next week for my safety  and to not be around any more sick kids  wether they truly have the virus  or just a cold  i know a way to get unemployment would to be getting fired  and stop showing up letting them know  however  i do not wanna do this    i was wondering  1  how do i go about filing for unemployment successfully   like what to say without getting fired  2  what to tell my work that won t disqualify me from getting approved for it  like for example if i refused to come back to work when they called me back they would of notified the state and my unemployment would of gotten cut that way   i would love to know if anyone has been in this experience  and what they did  thank you ,i68jia

735,Why such a bad stigma against college grads?,everyone seems to think it's entitlement that you want a job that pays a living wage with a college degree or a job in your field  it's always the college grad's fault  it's never employers  given the debt and training you take on  i don't think that's unreasonable  i think it's just a strong bias against young people who want professional careers  but there's really no  entry-level   i feel like entry level job postings aren't really for entry-level candidates  see words like   expert proficiency  or  3  years experience  they're just for people willing to settle for entry-level wages    i sometimes hear  people just want to start at the top  but i don't think that's really the case  college grads aren't applying for senior level positions  people just want to not be struggling to get by living with their parents  i don't think it's entitlement to resent that ,i6lsfg
736,Should I just call a ceasefire for now and settle into a career [Vent][Advice][etc],im 26  from the uk a graduate from a 3d art and design course and i guess technically self employed but not enough to live on sustainably so i am looking for something i can call a career   any time i think about moving into a long term field of work i just get so incredibly stressed because even though i know i am a capable person even outside art and design everyone who is employing has stupid criteria that are making me second guess myself and anyone who i could work for is going to extract my value for their own gain and despite being inherently immoral are probably so in other ways too and i just keep asking  do i really want this  is it worth my soul    the problem is i know i need to work for my own well being if only to escape from my parents and take my mind off my still raw break up and further than that i know i need to make a career so i can earn more than nmw and maybe cut the next 40 years of work down a bit  so should i just bury this deep seated hatred for having my wellbeing held to ransom and just choose a career path already   i just know of the past few weeks when stuff was going south relationship wise i did get to thinking what would i want to do and why  and i have been ruminating and ruminating but ultimately the answer i keep coming back to is that  everything sucks and i am overthinking it  looking for ethical value in a career where such is impossible  ill be clear i want to end work  and i think there is still part of me that is clinging to the naivety that i could ever actually feel at peace with the work i do   so should i just do a job for the money  the challenges it brings and the people i get to know and be venting here and on late stage capitalism about how shit it all is   do i accept that really i dont need the work to be fulfilling on every level of my consciousness andthat if i at least find it stimulating and it helps me commit to learning a skill that i can use to make money and help others then that is ultimately at least a partial win  even if my employer reaps the most benefit   i think i am answering my own questions a bit here but i guess i would just like to talk to like minded people and maybe i can make it out of my current predicament safely and at least have a job to show for it       sorry for the rant a,i7etsq

739,My coworkers are such try-hards,i just graduated college  and found a decent job at a company doing sales cold calling  the management is actually nice and they seem to actually care  so i feel lucky compared to the horror stories i ve heard  there isn t a strict quota or requirement when it comes to our work  but the people i got hired with are doing double of what they said was expected  and i m consistently at the bottom of the pack each week when we go over our numbers together as a team  i don t understand it  we all make the same amount of money  and i m doing exactly what they said they expected from us  but somehow i look lazy just because the other people are busting their asses for no good reason  i just had to vent about my dumb coworkers  people like them are the reason why this whole rat race exists  companies know they can find the people who would voluntarily try and get a 105  in classes  knowing full well that a 93  is the same grade  but i m just going to continue doing exactly what is listed in my job duties  as if they actually think they can pressure me to do more than that ,i79jwc

743,Used to not like but tolerate work. Now that I have health problems it's become a nightmare.,work used to annoy me at best  i'd always be upset that i could never work hard enough for the company  even if i would pull overtime for months and not use any pto  the one moment i slipped by getting the flu or any unavoiadable life events it was like i was the worst worker in the world to them  so yeah  corporate world never sat well with me  but like everyone else i had to eat and pay rent             however after one very particular bad flu  that i was still forced to come in with when recovery was kicking my ass  i fainted at work  it was all downhill from there  over the years i acquired pots  convulsive syncope  sometimes i vomit or shit myself  ibs  anemia  migraines  frequent infections  constant bloody rashes  precancerous cells in random areas  severe vertigo attacks that would last all day  then subsequently the mental illnesses that follow having all of these like severe depression and panic attacks               drs don't know wtf to do with me     however getting back to the subject of this sub  jobs are absolutely destroying me  working until i collapse every other day  getting eye rolls like i can help it or something  jobs not understanding or even trying to understand my situation        and now if i quit i could end up homeless and lose access to my treatments        i didn't know so many people lived like this in america  it's terrifying and i'm still in shock that this is accepted as normal        i would cry if we had ubi  i would literally start bawling tears of joy  because working until you collapse over and over just to avoid dying sounds like something straight out of a third world country  but for way too many is a reality here ,i7cynf

828,Why to be anti-school too.,yesterday i made an anti-school  post https www reddit com r antiwork comments i6qyfk be antischool  that gained some interest  but it was a low effort expression of my ideas  here i'm trying to further conceptualise and explain these ideas in such a way as to avoid some of the disagreements i believe were more down to miscommunication than actual ideological disagreement   the main opposition was that  education is good  because we need knowledge and understanding to progress  i do not disagree with this  but i believe the educational systems of schooling and education are counter productive and actively damaging to children    1  there are two main definitions of  education  which are almost diametrically opposed    2  the process of receiving or giving systematic instruction  especially at a school or university   an enlightening experience   i am arguing against  1  because through my experiences of formal schooling and educational parental practices we are inadvertently sucking the enlightening elements from children's learning  in place of definition  2  i use  learning  to describe the free and enjoyable exploration and assimilation of cultural ideas and concepts  this is an imperfect substitutions  but the best i currently have   while the difference between education and learning may seem semantic it is useful to create a distinction between these terms  education has come to refer to the compulsory  organised  educator led  systematic exchange of cultural information from one generation to the next  an extrinsically motivated process often enforced through punitive and coercive means  learning on the other hand is best described as the self-directed and intrinsically motivated acquisition of cultural information  this is a naturally autotelic process that all humans engage in as long as they have been able to retain their evolutionary drive to explore and learn  in education we are taught how to make a clay model  through learning we explore how to make a clay model in line with our own thoughts and feelings  the significance of this distinction is vast in regards to the effect on our learning   school and all it's associates  preschools  further education  higher education  are educational institutions that provide some form of access to learning opportunities  though they come with conditions and  for children  are mandatory  you have to be there and you have to learn what's on the curriculum  regardless of your personal interest or investment  indeed  schooling will often reduce opportunities to engage in self-directed learning  while there is some specific knowledge that it is vital for children to know  school is not best way to ensure children have access to and understand the importance of this information   humans are born with the drive to learn pre-installed  it is an evolutionary trait fundamental to our success as a species and our continued development as a civilisation  the greatest strength of learning is that it is intrinsically motivated  meaning we do not need external rewards or threats to motivate us to do anything about it  it's like a perpetual motion machine and all it needs is space to keep moving  the problem is that extrinsic motivation  motivation to gain rewards or avoid punishments  is seductive and powerful  in fact  if we begin to offer extrinsic motivators for an existing intrinsically motivated behaviour  the intrinsic motivation disappears and does not easily return  while intrinsic motivation is self-perpetuating  extrinsic motivation requires constant reinforcement or else the learned behaviors deteriorate and may eventually disappear  furthermore  we are far more creative when learning  exploring or expressing through intrinsically motivated autotelic means  because we have nothing to lose  if you want your reward you are going to take the safe option every time  you know it gets the job done  so why risk creativity   our educational institutions are built on extrinsic motivators for the very reason that it was necessary to use coercive means to get children to learn this stuff  children are emphatically not intrinsically motivated to learn everything on the curriculum  while it could have been argued that we needed to give children this vital knowledge base in order to ensure their future success and survival this is no longer the case  the advent of the internet and the smartphone have given almost everyone immediate access to the entire collection of humanities recorded knowledge  or at least more than enough to get you started on any field of knowledge you may want to engage with  as a result  our educational institutions are obsolete  now only providing laboured access to semi-knowledgeable individuals  teachers  in an environment of stifled creativity and authoritarianism  even the niche fields of brilliant academics can often be accessed online  the only reason access to some knowledge is still limited is that exploitative luddites are trying to prop up a cash cow that has recently become deceased   with this obsolescence  school has become little more than a holding pen for children to waste their lives in  waiting for their parents to get home from wasting their lives at work  talk about dystopian  not only this  but the archaic practices of a fundamentally flawed education system are actively damaging the mental and emotional well-being of our children at a time when they are most highly responsive to learning and most vulnerable to trauma  the damage lasts a lifetime and many never get back what they have taken from them  i will not even begin to delve into the damage a conformist system has on those who are neurological  physiologically  or experientially unable to conform   our defense of  education  stems from a lack of understanding of children's true abilities  children are voracious learners who only stop when they find something more interesting or collide with an immovable authoritarian object  such as a teacher with a schedule to maintain  there is an alternative  but it is radically different from anything in existence today and not something i am yet able to effectively paint a picture of  it will however take a drastically different  community based format where an open learning environment is created for people of all ages to learn together  sharing knowledge and working collaboratively  where parents  free from work are actively engaged in every aspect of their child's learning process  providing a cultural and emotional anchor from which a child can  and will  find their own feet   not only is this the natural progression from the counter-oppressive antiwork attitude  but it is a means of explosive creative diversity when done right and a radical change that will be necessary for the adaptation of the human race to suit the needs of our unpredictable future   this is but a fraction of my thinking that i've been able to force out through my fingers  but i hope it has at least created some discomfort with the idea of sending children to school  that you did not have before  school is no place for a child   i am very keen to discuss any perceived flaws in my line of argument as i am still very much working it all out for myself   thanks ,i76t1l
829,"I feel like I can't meet people, make friends, keep friends, date, or find a girlfriend/wife with how much I work.",i work 8-12 hours a day and that leaves me with little time or energy to do anything else  i feel like i'll never have friends or a girlfriend because i don't like the people i work with and don't have time to go make friends  find a girlfriend  and keep those new relationships if i make any going ,i6qgz4
830,"It's not enough to be exploited, you have to be gagging for it and exploit yourself some more.",absolutely agree  in the other hand  some people don't just grudge through work  they try to make the world a better place and get a sense of accomplishment out of doing the difficult task  hard work is a virtue  of t's a passion or a calling rather than just a paycheck  you would willingly work more hours than required  it's about thriving rather than just surviving   grant that this isn't the case for many people  but we're taking about those that at least might     reply giveaward share report have ,i2fiss
831,I wish that I had less Hypocrisy for the Homeless,   hello everyone  is been a while since i created a post in here  i had many faces and many life events none of which were at the same level as the vagabonds on this sub  maybe when my wife and i left home and had to sleep in my financed car for some weeks with no income  but even so i wasn't a true vagabond at heart  sometimes i dance with the idea  especially knowing how meaningless it is having to do something for  40 hours to receive papers in which everyone in society agreed in the monetary value of it  even so to the point of judging other people's values by the amount of money they hoard   i include myself in this mess since i never helped any homeless and don't even acknowledge them on the streets because they are  crazy  or just a  druggie  this mindset buggies me  since i always been a lurker of this sub for years  also always having trouble fitting in society's need for the constant state of production  my life situation is closer to them than to the rich  which is funny of how much the average person works for how little freedom and money they have  the majority of those that have to work don't have access to healthcare and are not even the honor of the roof they live in  they are 2 to 3 paychecks away to becoming homeless   of course  i want homeless to have shelter  to receive aid  to receive better jobs  psych help if need it  but those are concepts that go in the political field if i truly believed i would do something to help  either preaching the word or volunteering  i feel even worse than my paycheck goes 80  on bills  the rest i use for traveling  which is something that i could do without working  right now i am sitting on my porch reading a book  looking at the trees as the wind and sun interact with the scenery and i feel satisfied  this is what makes me happy  it is my day off and i think of how privilege i am  but why should i feel this way  why i have to work  40 hours overnight if my needs are that simple and why is there more people who can't afford even that  that they can't have a roof over their heads and the simple need for food it is something to keep in mind every day   anyway  an outflow from my day off  hope it is understandable  a long time lurker  and wish anyone reading this post the best  this post the original intent was aimed at the  r vagabond community ,i38vwa

(Or teachers who want to quit?),i quit my first teaching job about a year ago  i quit around 3 4 through my first year  i haven t returned to teaching for several reasons  after i quit  i was so burnt out i couldn t do anything but live off of my savings and shut myself in    i ve been thinking a lot about work and stability  i wanted to see why other people got into teaching and why those same people left  or want to leave   personally  i just couldn t work anymore  i was so emotionally and physically exhausted  i worked seven days a week because it never seemed like i could get ahead of all of my responsibilities  i was totally alienated from my peers as well  almost everyone there hated being there  the second the work day was over  people packed their things so they could spend a few meager hours with their families before they had to shut in and grade  the job was also to be done at home this meant we were also alienated from our families    teaching  in its current model  basically requires you to work two jobs  the school only pays you for direct instruction  they do not treat planning as part of the job  that s not my main issue  though  if you care about the children or the nature of the work  it wouldn t matter how much schools dedicated to compensation  i don t want to work two jobs and be paid for two jobs  i just want to work and be paid to perform one job  i actually enjoyed thinking of lessons and preparing them until i had to do so very much of it    i found the work i was assigning was pretty pointless  it was all career based  it was all numbers pushing  there was an obsession with standardized testing and sat or act scores  the administration was obsessed with the school s letter grade the same way capitalists are obsessed with gdp or some other shit that doesn t reflect the quality of life for the average person  education is actually really subjective  there is this constant pressure to measure output  however    the schools also focus on certain subjects  like english and math  the school was so in need of core teachers that i  a person who has a license to teach history  was hired as an english teacher because of some previous tutoring experience  if you can find a job within your subject area  your focus isn t very much respected anyway    i know this was a bit long  i was curious as to how other people felt  i haven t the slightest idea of how to solve these issues ,i380bp
870,Another reason why you should slack off extra hard today.,so  raises  promotions  all those things those companies dangle in front of us to extract more work from us    when you think about it  from his perspective   why  would your boss pay you more    they already got you employed  you're already slaving for them  they pay you what they pay you and you're busting your ass already  why the hell would they actually go through with a raise   they got what they wanted just by dangling the  possibility  of a raise in front of you   your productivity    or maybe they will give it to you   have fun with 3  it's nothing to them  and it's nowhere close to what the added work you had to do to get it was worth   but hey  they didn't lie   you got a raise      i used to believe in all this shit  drank the corporate kool-aid or whatever  worked myself to the bone  actually  almost to death  then i woke up    i'm still making the same amount of money doing bare minimum than busting my ass  so i'm just reminding you to slack today  extend that break  have an especially weak bladder on this fine friday    fuck them ,i5ay6a

872,Would you take the money?,let's say you have a passion for something  maybe you create hand-written greeting cards  or you create video games or cool phone apps  maybe you have a gift for home decorating on a budget  it could be anything   because you're really good at what you do  people start to notice  they offer to pay you for it  we're talking about good money  like  5 or 10 times what you thought they would pay  they are happy to pay you because they really want or need what you offer   you start doing this occasionally  then a little more  at some point you realize that spending one hour on your hobby brings in more cash than working all day at your crappy regular job  at that point  you realize that you can quit your job and just do the passion project   would you take the money  why or why not ,i48cfs

874,"Seriously, how do you actually get a job? It feels like an impossible thing. One of the reasons I support a job guarantee program and universal programs for basic biological needs: to break the mold of workplace ""productivity"" coercion",don't have a degree  get a degree  got a degree  get a better degree  have a good degree  you are overqualified  or should have gotten an internship  the individual is to blame  not the system  just because 1000 people apply for a single-spot internship doesn't mean the system is broken  you are just a bad candidate  oh  we shipped more jobs to china  don't worry about it  we get access to their educated workforce as well  it is great for consumers and our bottom line   have crippling debt and even worse depression  tough shit  that's just life  get used to it  you think your low wage job sucks  i did even worse for way less pay and never complained   get a job  join the cult  gatekeep others today   so if jobs are so important  why are they so difficult to get  and even if you get one  eventually it is a lower hanging one that only allows you to gain skills for other lower hanging jobs  it isn't like the  7 25 minimum wage work is training you to become a doctor  engineer  coder  or something difficult but rewarding  no  the joke becomes that you have to get into massive amounts of debt for the potential of getting something that isn't retail or fast food  to join a company cult and become indoctrinated  and this requires you to not have had any issues physically or mentally when growing up  and the ability to read at a college and post college level  surprisingly rare in the usa   so why is getting a good job so difficult  systemically  there are a lot of factors at play  but no one is  allowed  to criticize the system so the individual is the only thing society focuses on as a distraction   what has been your experience ,i2ga2x

876,Being furloughed was the best thing that ever happened to me.,i ve been working for about 10 years now in various different office jobs  the basic 9-5  i was being made redundant in march this year just before lockdown and luckily  i thought  got a job lined up for april  however  then lockdown started due to covid-19 and my start date for my new job was delayed until 1st july  between march and 1st of july i was easily the happiest i ve been in the last 10 years  no stress of commuting every day  no 8 hour days of bull shit office work  no anxiety about my job  every day between march and july was built around what i wanted to do and what made me happy  i didn t realise how depressed working the same corporate 9-5 made me  anyway  i ve been in my new job for a month and i already wish i was back on furlough as i can feel the depression anxiety coming back every sunday night and all through the week    anyone else experience this during the pandemic ,i2k8x5

878,Just a little vent,sorry for how long this will be    just found this subreddit that perfectly sums up my feelings  especially since covid started  about my job   work in general  just thought i d rant to people that would know how i m feeling  i can t complain to a lot of my family because they just say  well you have to work  it is what it is   just go back to school   idk what i d get another degree in  and also easier said than done  and more debt   just get another job   again  easier said than done   you have a good job  just suck it up   i have a bachelors in psychology  i was originally planning on getting a masters or phd and going into academia or maybe going for therapy   social work for veterans  that did not end up happening  getting to know myself better  i knew i would be a poor fit for those jobs and i hated school  college was miserable for me    right after i graduated  i went to work managing short term disability claims for a fortune 500 company  the perks  the pay allows me to live comfortably  i don t have to work evenings   holidays   nights  my manager and most of my coworkers are awesome  i have full wfh schedule since covid   the cons  boring office job  stuck behind a desk for 8 - 8 5 hrs per day  the work is stressful and too much for one person to handle  you re on the phone with disgruntled rude people for most of the day  everything you do is ranked by metrics  ex  calls taken  calls made  claim decisions made  etc    our workload has doubled in the past several months due to covid and there is no end in sight  another office is in an even worse spot than we are so we need to help them and weren t even asked if we wanted to  so because we re helping them  we are now falling even more behind  our department is basically going up in flames and there isn t any relief for this coming  people are constantly quitting  going out on leave  calling out randomly  if they don t flake out on work then they are constantly stressed  snapping  crying  or just generally miserable   anxious   depressed  and the work keeps piling on us because the more people that get covid  the more claims we get  the more claims we get  the more calls we get  which then puts us behind  which increases call volume   which puts us more behind because we re stuck getting a new call every 2 minutes  it s a never ending cycle  so when people get a call  they don t pick it up and let it roll over to the next person because they re trying to get caught up  then they get in trouble because they didn t pick up the call  but then they also get in trouble because they re not day-current on their daily tasks  wtf  our workload is over double what it  should  be  something has to give eventually and we re only human    then even at the best of times  the people that don t do their job and just sit around don t ever get reprimanded  or just get a slap on the wrist  and then the people that do their work then have to do more work because they have to pick up the slack from the other people  so i m getting paid the same as this person who isn t doing their job  so why would i do mine  i could just go sit on the couch and clock out at 4 30 and say i was working    every day i fight the urge to quit  but what would i do then  i have to have something else lined up  like it or not  we need money to survive  i have absolutely no clue what i want to do for a job  i want to not work and have more time to do what i enjoy  my grandfather passed away last week and didn t get to do some things he had been wanting to do  it made me realize life is too short to put up with this nonsense  i want to go hiking and camping with my dog  i want to go on road trips  i want to spend more time with my aging horse while i still can  i want to spend more time reading and writing  but at the end of the work day  i m so drained all i can do is watch tv  and then i go to bed dreading waking up the next morning    if i had to pick a dream job  it would be an author or a pilot  unfortunately  both are a little far fetched for me  making enough money as an author to live off of is a combination of luck and great talent  and to be a pilot you need big bucks to go through the training  plus the aviation industry won t be doing too hot for quite a while because of covid    basically just feeling really stuck and depressed right now  if this is how the rest of my life is going to be  then i m not looking forward to it ,i2lnbx

883,Why is it so hard to fully enjoy time off from work?,tomorrow i go back to work after a week long vacation  and all i can think about is the distinct feeling that i wasted my time off  obviously because of the pandemic  we were limited in what we could do  i e  no major travel  even if we could afford it  but just the time away from work should be enough  right  throughout the week we went to a local state park  did a little biking  ordered takeout  relaxed  spent time on our hobbies  but even with all that  each day was a count down until the vacation was over  and i still wish we could've done more to make the most of our time  now it's sunday night before returning to the grind in the morning  and i just have this heavy feeling of depression  why is it so much harder to return the longer a vacation is  is this what life will be for me for likely the next 50 years  working full time at a job i mostly tolerate just to afford existence  and not even being able to fully enjoy the few times a year i can get away  is there any possibility of ever getting to a place where we could work part time or even not at all  without sacrificing a ton along the way  all this is just hitting me really hard right now  sorry for the rant ,i2mz0c

891,"Have worked through this pandemic and made less money than those not working, had my job held over my head, and became more stressed than ever.",sorry for the rant  but i need to get this out  i'm 21 and a debt collector for two very large banks who finance for multiple stores  ive worked here for 2 years and have been a in the top 15  of collectors multiple times  over 300 associates  but its never good enough  right now im paid  17 an hour  its not bad  except for the fact ever at that rate i still can't afford a place to live and have money to put into savings  my time here has been nothing but negative  every day we receive emails with our stats that constantly remind you you aren't meeting goal stats  even when im a top collector im not meeting goals because those stats don't determine your collecting like they think and tell us they do  supervisors constantly reminding you you're not meeting goals and pitting you against everyone else  one of my supervisors is a snake and i despise him  6 months ago he called me in his office saying i broke a rule  which wasn't a rule  but he saved me from the corrective so now i owe him  he constantly has it out for people and will manipulate you non stop  the higher ups aren't any help and will do the same thing  if you have a legitimate argument with stats and facts to back it up they use hypothetical numbers to confuse you then talk circles around you until you give up   i collect the company over  360 000 a year and make less than  35k before taxes  and yet through this whole pandemic my supervisors have been holding my job over my head because i'm not ranking  still collecting  30k  a month  they don't care that im not ranking because i didn't cheat to build a pipeline of payments 12 months out and can now focus of collecting for other months instead of same month  i  and every other bottom collector  collect about  20k more same month than the top collectors who collect maybe  9k same month  of course we can't catch up though because we are on correctives for ranking and don't have the 6 months to build up a pipeline large enough to compete with those top collectors  the bank ultimately prospers off this though as they have the top collectors floating on pipelines and collecting for a year out  and then us bottom collectors collecting same month payments just to try to stay afloat  we are working to pay the bonuses  the past couple months have been  5k incentive checks for the top 15  for the top collectors while being shit on and told we should feel grateful for our job   while i'm having meetings every day with my supervisors chewing me out for not being as productive as they want me to be because i ran out of my medications three weeks earlier than i was supposed to because i trippled my daily prescription just to operate on the level they wanted me to  despite my stats showing i rank in the top when i make fewer calls and not burn myself out  people are collecting unemployment and making almost 2 times more than i make in a month  while i'm trying to juggle my job  the risk of homelessness  family crisis  and my own mental health  people are going on shopping sprees   they dont care about me  back in february they called me in their office and asked what they could do to help me perform again  they didn't even bat an eye when i told them i need 140 mg of adderal as thats what i was taking the 3 months prior that i ranked while working 70 hour weeks  they dont care that my body aches  it feels like im having a heart attack  and can't sleep for days on end because of what i have to do to work the way they want me to ,i4g8p0

908,The productivity bar keeps going up at my company.,i work at a warehouse and they measure every single minute of our productivity  the goal of course being at 100   everyday  the thing that pisses me of is that they keep reducing the time you're allowed for each order every year  this means of course that the old timers had it really easy back then and are now the supervisors  it's incredible how out of touch they are of how hard it is right now since they haven't selected in years  i can't even go to the bathroom comfortably without my percentage going down  we have a 20 minute lunch and one 10 minute break  your time will keep running once your glorious 10 minute break is over so you're always fucked,i4b37m
909,Do you have a bank account which generates interest? Do you pay into a 401k or pension scheme?,one thing i don t like about this sub is the bad rep which all land lords seem to get  there was a post which was glorified on here not long ago from someone saying that their tenant had moved to a different country  taken the keys and not paid for a couple of months rent and people were congratulating this as if it was a good thing   most landlords are just people who ve worked hard and saved up enough to buy a second home for some extra income  they re not millionaires with 100 houses  they still have a mortgage to pay on the house most of the time and the amount of money they make directly from rent is very little   i understand that you might be against the current system but i ve no idea how you can be against the people struggling to do their best in the current system  if someone manages to scrape together enough money to get a mortgage on a second home that doesn t make them a monster  it makes them someone who s trying to live within this system and provide a decent quality of life for themselves and their family   are you against landlords  if you are and you have a bank account which generates interest or you pay into a 401k or pension scheme then you re a complete hypocrite- how do you think these systems generate money  property  stocks and bonds  they use your money to invest in things to make more money to then pay you ,i46epb

919,"Put my 2 weeks in, need ideas",i work at a gas station  and it sucks for all the reasons you would imagine  but the real reason i started keeping my ears out for a new job is that i found out 2 of my co-workers were convicted of sexually assaulting children and possessing child pornography  another did time for neglecting his own children so badly that they were unresponsive when cps came to investigate   i felt bad for snooping into their past  i believe people like that should have jobs rather than be put out on the street to reoffend  but i cannot stand next to these people for 8 hours and pretend to be their buddy  and fuck my boss for not disclosing this information when he hired me   i have another job lined up  so i need some ideas on how to live it up for the next two weeks  my first idea is to wait for someone to come up to the counter and say  sorry i left my mask in the car  this happens at least once a day  my boss refuses to turn away customers without masks  instead of telling the customer it's fine  i'm going to say something like  god forbid you should have to walk all the way back to your car to protect me and my family from a lethal  incurable disease   i will try to steal a decent amount before i leave as well  and give nice customers free things  but i need more ideas  what would you do at work if you knew you had two weeks left and another job lined up ,i48xhx

926,A rant about the nature of work and some other thoughts about it,hi all  been a long time lurker here  first time poster   first off  i'd like to express a thank you to this community for being one of the few places both online and in rl that express the same sentiments and thoughts i have about work  for a long time i thought i was the only person who felt this way  i was surrounded by people hungry for more work  who identified with their careers or were aggressively competitive to achieve goals i just couldn't understand  ie  become next second assistant manager of corporation x etc  i thought it was all bunkum but i never expressed it  i was too afraid of being marked out as weird lazy socialist freeloader  even now  although i have revealed my thoughts and feelings about work to one or two people  i'm still pretty careful about what i say  career culture is strong  but here  even the very idea of no work at all ever again is celebrated  such an extremist idea from where i've come from    so thank you   at the moment i am currently working full-time in marketing for a non-profit  i am on medical leave for about a week and a half for work-related stress and anxiety  right now  i feel so much calmer and settled  i will be seeing a psychologist in a few weeks to sort of a number of issues  but i've often wondered would it be even necessary if i never had to work again or at least  work far less hours  i've also wondered if a lot of mental health issues around the world could easily be resolved with less or even no work    i think the thing that irks me the most about most of the jobs i've ever had  is the inanity and lack of purpose or point behind them  oh sure there is a  point  to it - paycheck  but any other meaning it had was to me so abstract  so removed from reality it often made me question why we did such activities  an example would be formatting fancy pants documentation for government consumption  but knowing these would be rarely read  almost never adhered to and would end up at the bottom of some bureaucrat's dusty paper stack  it was just to ensure another box was ticked  at my current position  i hardly see the connection between what i do and the workplace's goals  or that even my work contributes at all to benefit our non-profit's recipients    on top of all that  there are the endless meetings where nothing of true value is discussed or concluded upon  the managing of personalities and politics  the cringy team building activities that were created in order to force build friendships between people  all this  cream and cherries on top  just adds to the sheer inanity of my current job  it seems to be imho that most modern day work is ultimately empty and has no intrinsic value besides ensuring people have a paycheck to keep them from being homeless   over time as i dealt with this  i have become more and more despondent  as of late  i have reached a point where i questioned even the point of existing  if all it was  was endless  pointless work  the fact that we trade up finite precious time to do empty meaningless work just to survive  it is as if our lives our marked with a monetary value and we are reduced down to just economic input output units  it was this entrapment and dehumanization that spurred my despair and anger into life  we are given enough to not drown  sometimes not even then  but never enough to clamber onto the shore    i tried to manage this growing despair and sense of meaningless  so i did the usual  journal  exercise  attempt to establish some sleeping pattern  didn't really work  talk it out with friends and family  but i couldn't really express just how deep my hopelessness went  i applied for new jobs  part-time roles  but in this day and age  jobs are hard to come by and every job has a hundred applicants or more  i attempted to upskill  hard to do on an ft position  just too tired to do anything  tried to consider employment through different perspectives and of course  browsing r antiwork  at best  some of these methods mitigated my despair and constant questioning  but eventually that sense of hopelessness  overwhelm and meaningless came to colour my whole world  i would attend work each day  my stomach roiling and my heart hammering  dreading the day ahead  as of late  i went to the doctor  expressed what was going on in regards to my mental health  and she was sympathetic towards me - which was surprising  we organized some medical leave  counselling and anti-depressants  the anti-depressants are what helped me work full time once upon a time  i decided to go off them earlier this year due to feeling extremely flat and emotionless about most things in my life  it turns out zombifying your brain is how one is able to cope with ft work  i have a little bit of hope back regardless of this    i'm not sure what i'll do next  i'll enjoy my time off as much as i can but after that idk  i'm sorry for the long post  i feel that there is nowhere or no one else i can truly express the depths of my thoughts or feelings on this topic  so thank you for reading if you have gotten this far    amp x200b    tl dr  expressing my thoughts on the anti-work sentiment and basically my journey of how i got to this place  thanks all ,i5800r

937,Power tip #2: bound your productivity,your  work  or your job  is a relationship between you and another entity in which both parties try to maximize the profit they can extract from the other  the problem is that in general  there exists a large intellectual and power differential between the strategic capability of winning this game between the sole employee vs the corporation which has teams of experts dedicated towards widening this power dynamic ever further in the name of profit   this dynamic translates to a work condition for the employee that relentlessly approaches the conditions of slavery -- no pay for exhaustingly laborious work  keeping this in mind  it is imperative to take the appropriate measures at both an individual and communal level to ensure that you are at least not complacent in allowing this quality of life degradation to proceed at full pace   bounding your productivity is something that anyone  blue to white collar  can and should be exercising to both maximize their quality of life and fend off an increasingly dystopian workplace which inevitably leads to greater income inequality for all  here are some generalized tips around this matter   1   estimate the minimum level of productivity required to maintain your job  for example  if you are an hourly dishwasher and know that washing 100 dishes per hour is good enough to satisfactorily ensure job stability  then there is no reason to make yourself go at a pace that achieves 101 dishes per hour  be cognizant of the fact that this extra effort  if expended  is you  voluntarily  working for free and eating the full costs of labor and giving the full profit to your employer  who is at war with you  if it's rush hour and the restaurant is backed up  that is not your fault -- there should be more dishwashers  if you are comfortable talking with your coworkers  this is a good mindset to share as it will alleviate significant pressure not just on you  but on  everyone  fostering reward-less competition and peer pressure amongst coworkers is a strong tactic used by the employers to increase stress and productivity -- costs that you pay but profits they take exclusively  2   realize the law of diminishing returns wants you to do less  as visualized here 0  an application of this law posits that the harder you work beyond your minimum level of productivity  the less value you gain  in proportion to each additional unit of energy expended  this is bad for you  the more bad it is for you  the more beneficial it is to your employer as it asymptotically approaches the financial model of free slave labor  for example  this can be thought of as the following  you get paid 10  for washing 100 dishes  you get 15  for washing 200 dishes  assuming the effort of washing dishes is nontrivial  you would be best off maximizing your returns if you wash 100 dishes for 10  and then go do something else that has the value of at least about 3  an hour  such as another job or relaxing  the 3  as opposed to 5  is to make up for the fact that washing those additional 100 dishes is more exhausting than the first 100 dishes just like running the last mile of a marathon is more costly for your body than running the first mile -- therefore you don't actually realize the full 5  of reward  3   discuss these dynamics with like-minded peers  in the usa  it is illegal to prevent employees from discussing salaries and pay rates  you should aim to be more comfortable discussing this with peers because the employers cultivate and leverage this taboo-culture to ensure they can pay you less than your coworkers who does the same job  in the end  it only hurts the employees  first step towards this is to learn to approach these topics in a safe and calm manner  the sooner employees stop being ignorant and silently complacent is the sooner you can aim to improve your situation  remember  you are getting ripped off -- almost by definition of having a job -- and you won't get a refund on this  that's why you this is a hot issue and you are incentivized to address it asap  you don't want to end up doing this too late as the poor employees of this famous company did recently  1    0  https pmctraining com site wp-content uploads 2018 04 law-of-diminishing-returns-chart png  1  https www bloomberg com news articles 2020-08-03 blizzard-workers-share-salaries-in-revolt-over-wage-disparities,i3vk1c
938,Power tip #1: understand they are your enemy,i ve noticed that a lot of people don t understand the dynamic that they have with the workplace they are affiliated with   in fact  it s worse   they think they understand  but are flawed  this leads to massive losses that are hard to see as they re not tangible beyond slowly seeping consequences such as frustration   it is faulty to believe that your workplace is your friend  ally  or your superior  it is faulty to think that you should be extraordinarily grateful to have a job  if you play the game of friendship with an agency that is playing the game of maximizing personal profits at the expense of others  you will lose  this is corroborated by the fact that you are on this sub in a miserable state of mind   realize that your employer s entire relationship with you is defined by their attempts to maximize profits off you   how much they can steal and get away with  this comes in many forms in which they give you less value than the value you provide them  search wikipedia for  scrips   don t let them do that  treat them as the enemy  but be polite  work extra hour for free  nah  clock in only after you re arrived at the office and changed and done some prep work  nah  remember they are your enemy and you should try to treat them as such  they sure treat you that way ,i3pyvo

946,How do I retire early?,hey guys  i am 23 years old and i work as a tech support in a phone company and i get paid minimum wage  the job is quite easy  even though the learning curve was quite steep  but once you get the hang of it  it's quite nice  bosses treat me good and i like everything about the job really  except for the pay  and also except for the fact that i despise work   i do not want to wake up every day and do this shit for 8 hours and i hate that it has become normalized in our societies  that we have to do this until we die   so i am currently exploring real ways on how to escape this lifestyle  i would really like to retire before i am 40  but that is of course just a dream as of now   my current plan is becoming a real estate agent where i should definitely be able to make at least 1 5x what i am making now  and with possibilites of making a lot more if i work harder   with my savings  i am going to invest them in stock options and index funds  and by using the power of compound interest  i should have enough money by the time i am 40 to  retire   basically just work if i want to  or when i want to  i have also explored some options by buying properties and renting them out  or just doing fixer uppers  but that takes more capital than i have as of now   i am actually a quite  lazy  person  i do not like to work at all  and i prefer to do my hobbies all the time  video games  fitness and weight lifting  painting  hiking  photography and more  i hate having to spend most of my waking hours on doing something i don't enjoy so that is why i am trying to create some concrete plan which will enable me to live my life freely   feel free to share your plans on how you are planning to retire early as well ,i32980

956,My Experience,apologies for a long post  i wrote this hoping to achieve some sort of catharsis from sharing with like-minded people  tl dr at bottom   i graduated college in 2011 and got a job shortly after  a couple years into the job i was ready for something more  i decided to quit and return to school to get a second bachelor's degree and pursue a career in tech  another 2 years later  with second degree in-hand  i began searching for jobs   job searching is one of the most demoralizing and dehumanizing experiences a person can have  i learned that tech jobs are on a whole new level of dumpster fire  after months of applications  rejections  no responses  and getting jerked around by elitist tech recruiters with superiority complexes  i was finally hired by a large software company in a technical support role   there was no training  zero comprehensive training on the software i was now expected to support  despite this i was quickly thrown into action resolving issues for clients  we were expected to  just ask questions  if we didn't know something  imagine showing up to work every day having to ask your coworkers how to do your job  having to ask how something was supposed to work  having to ask how to go about investigating the cause of an issue  everyone hired around the same time as me were in the same boat  this software wasn't something that could be picked up easily  at no point did i ever feel unqualified or incapable of performing my job  the problem was the knowledge of the software's complex functional and internal intricacies was a massive barrier to entry  it was the most unintuitive and broken software i've ever encountered  even after a year  i still relied heavily on input from others to do my work   asking for help to do your job on a daily basis begins to affect your psyche  it damages your confidence  it makes you feel incompetant  it makes you feel like a failure  i had already begun slipping into anxiety and depression during the job search  now the job itself was dragging me even deeper  on top of that  after the time taken by sleeping  commuting  and working  i was left with only 4 hours of personal free time a day  it was all chipping away at me  at some point i realized i wasn't doing many of my hobbies anymore  i went to bed and woke up every morning with sickening existential dread  i came home from work with no motivation or energy to do anything else  the negativity from work began to seep into my personal life  i did this for 2 years   i eventually applied for a position in a different department of the company and was hired  i saw it as an opportunity for a fresh start and it was one of the only ways to get a promotion  at the time of starting the new job i was already well beyond the point of absolute soul-crushing burnout  there was no training  i was quickly thrown to the wolves working with clients again  unlike the awesome people on my previous team  the people on the new team were pretentious  tryhard  wannabe yuppies  this was so far from the person i am  i grew to detest them  i had an absentee manager who largely ignored my emails asking for help or clarification on my duties  i was pushed further to the breaking point when a coworker began shit-talking me and the quality of my work both to my face and to my new team  including my manager  i will despise this individual for the rest of my existence  despise is not a strong enough word  after several months the day finally came  my mental health was below rock bottom  i couldn't think straight anymore  i was losing the ability to function  my brain felt like a mire of tv static at lightspeed  at the end of the day i talked to my manager  i said  i'm done  i resign  today was my last day  i just walked away  i had done everything in my power to make the job work  but at no point had this company ever invested any effort to set me up for success   i took a couple months off to regain some of my mental health  after that i was able to get a part-time retail job while i worked on some personal projects  this was february 2020  then coronavirus hit  when asking my manager if i could wear a mask one day  the response was   i'll have to check  it might alarm the customers  seems the company's bottom line was more important than my wellbeing although as far from  essential  as you can get  this business remained open until they were legally forced to close by my state's mandatory lockdown  i was laid off the day of closing   it's been a few months since then  i'm profoundly disillusioned with our society  my experiences left me cynical  jaded  and contemptuous toward the system as it exists  i never want to work in corporate america again  i never want to sit in an interview with some condescending hr manager testing how much boot i'm willing to lick before they'll hire me  i just want to spend my time doing things i enjoy with the people i love  i was able to find a job back at the first company i worked for after college  back where the story started  i actually enjoy it and i'm working to monetize some of my hobbies  i am now in the best mental health of my adult life  quitting my tech job was one of the best decisions i've ever made   i want to extend thanks to this community for sharing your stories and helping me feel like i'm not so alone in these sentiments   tl dr  got a degree  got a job  got burned out  got a second degree  got a tech job  suffered immense mental emotional stress and trauma as a result  quit on the spot  now pursuing a more meaningful and fulfilling life ,i4v9ci

965,"I guess wearing a mask to protect yourself and others is a ""horrible"" violation of your liberties...",but being forced  to spend hours and hours of your life at a grueling  boring job  planning your entire life and everything secondary to that job  being at the mercy of your employer  not being allowed to say anything negative about them on social media--all because you were born and you exist and need a job as a result--that's not a violation of your liberties  that's a blessing from 'murica      how can people not see that the biggest thing that keeps us not free is being employed    people are used to public schools existing and roads existing and they like it and agree with it--and yes  it is supported by those evil horrible horrendous taxes that make all the republicans shudder  but mention that having free healthcare would be nice too and everyone poops themselves  nothing in life is free  if i have kids and they don't enjoy being a wage slave  sucks for them  that means they're just a bad person  good people like working  i'll just have lots of kids so there will always be someone for the rich to exploit  mark zuckerberg and jeff bezos deserve our worship    it is forced if your only alternative is starvation,i3wkb7

969,Dealing with boot-licker family,my family are all boot-licking  capitalist flag worshippers  when i visited for xmas last year  we were all gathered at my grandmothers house talking and my stepmom was sitting in one of the hard wooden kitchen chairs  she was fast asleep just sitting there  it was maybe 4 in the afternoon    she works at walmart as a manager and is exhausted most of the time  makes okay money  probably not that much more than i do working an office job from home  and also being 30 years her junior    i expressed sympathy for her when we all noticed  saying  poor stepmom  she is so tired all the time    my boot-licking cousins who i barely see because they re constantly working  did not miss their opportunity    that s because she works hard op   yeah that s what it s like when you earn your way  etc etc    in what world is being so exhausted you can t even be awake for a rare family gathering a good thing    she is basically a slave  we all are  i don t understand why they think praising hard work to make someone else wealthy is a good thing  yes  providing for your family is good  and living in financial stability  but the price is too steep  people basically work out of fear of the alternative   basic needs should be a human right  but they re not  people continually perpetuate the idea that someone has no right to life unless they  earn  it    well who gets to decide what you ve earned  some billionaires who don t give a fuck about you  that feed you your mainstream media so you can become a bootlicker and defend them  despite ultimately contributing nothing to society and actively shut down competition and keep the 1  club exclusive    i feel like i am a completely different person than most of my family thinks i am  because i do not think like them ,i382vj
970,Why is your wealth seemingly the sole measure of your worth as a human being?,does anyone else feel extremely stressed out over this societal expectation that you need to have a high paying job to be worth anything  it feels like i'm being judged because i don't really care about money or a successful career as much as other people do  and that becaue i don't share the same entrepreneurial mindset of  successful  people  i'm being looked at as if i'm not  driven  or  hard-working  enough    the worst thing is that i've been told this for so long that some part of me still holds this to be true  i'm scared of telling people how i really feel in fear of ridicule and ostracization  how do i break free from this cycle of thought ,i3far1
971,What can We actually do to change the nature of work aside from sharing and reposting memes on some obscure corner of the Internet?,that's a trick question because i think memes  are  the key to changing how we view and understand 'work' and all the other concepts intertwined with it - value  labour   property  hell  existence itself   it's memes all the way down   but seriously  just look at the front page of this sub - it's all memes   the internet is a network of connection between nearly every single human consciousness on the planet - information now travels both instantly and constantly - the internet is human connection manifest - what do we use it for   memes   of course we're already witnessing how that can be twisted and perverted to serve the interests of capital - disinformation  distraction  polarization - but maybe all we need is a critical mass of awareness - awareness that can't be stopped given the instantaneous spread of ideas and information   what if 90  of people in your community agreed friday was the first day of the weekend   that's literally all it would take to be true   now what if 90  of people in the world accept money as an illusory abstraction of power with no actual power outside of a shared and communal belief in its 'realness' and legitimacy    can we memes ourselves better  or is the memetic gravity of consumption so great that destruction by our own hands is inevitable   memes  gt  guillotines,i4ybjn
972,Told work to get fucked today.,for a bit of context  i work in childcare  a famously shit work environment  toxic culture  high stress  ridiculous bureaucracy  and minimum wage  i am deeply commited to the betterment of early educational methods as i believe it is the most effective path to radical systemic change  as such i have been trying to maintain a career in this rancid sector   i have always stood up for what i believe is right and have tried my best to adhere to the rules of the system  regardless  i am not well liked by my managers  it's hard tk reconcile the need to put children first when profit always comes first    anyway  prior to covid i experienced burnout and suffered from depression and suicidal ideation  there was a rather major breakdown at work and my manager told me to take a couple of weeks off  paid  to get myself back together  unexpectedly generous  but i'm sure you can guess where this is going   into my second week of compassionate leave and the pandemic is declared sending my mental health spiraling further out of control  i get in touch with work and tell them i need more time  but am happy to use up my holidays  as was agreed im advance with my manager  unfortunately my vile area manager gets back to me explaining that paid leave is not offered by the company and they would be retroactively removing the offer  forcing me to use my holiday for the weeks i had already been off  when challenged my manager made some weak excuse that i misunderstood her meaning  it was clear as day at the time  but silly me for trusting managers without a written agreement  i was too busy thinking about killing myself to ask for it in writing   after this i asked to be furloughed instead  but was told i could not be furloughed because i needed to be  back to work ready  and my mental health suggested i was not   as a result i have been signed off on statutory sick pay of  95 85 a week since the pandemic was declared    now the fun bit  as childcare settings are preparing to open again they want me back at work because i am the most highly qualified person in the place  sorry  still sick  while being signed off i have adapted my life arangements and no longer need the job  now i'm signed off for an additonal 3 months after which i'm not coming back  they can't fire me or fill my position because i still work there  so they just have to sit quietly and stew while their industry collapses   i feel great   that story was longer and less exciting than i anticipated  so thanks for listening  find the small ways to fuck the system and fuck it good   tl dr - work screwed me over out of spite so i screwed them in return ,i4wugi
973,Only losers willingly partake in systems that can't feed everyone,capitalism is a demonstrably failed system  you can point to it's failures to prove this point  like the fact that capitalism is unable to make sure all humans have food  water and shelter while having access to modern tech   any system that fails something so essential and basic with modern technology at it's disposal is beyond laughable  and only a complete loser would think otherwise    if you can't figure out that humans deserve food  water and shelter  and that your current system isn't capable of providing that  then you are  by definition  a loser    you lost     you let a economic system determine right from wrong for you  rather than reality  again  by definition https www merriam-webster com dictionary loser  this means you are a loser    definition of loser -  a person who is incompetent or unable to succeed    just like your system was so incompetent as to be unable to provide the basics of a human life to all  you too were incompetent and unable to recognize it as a problem and instead defended it  you are incompetent and unable to succeed in terms of recognizing reality because you think your economic system determines right from wrong    i honestly feel bad for you and those like you who are going to be lead down a path so detrimental to your own well being  as well as the well being of your entire species    instead of a life spent gaining wisdom  bettering yourself  focusing on your family  your health  having fun  doing what is right and contributing to society  you're going to work  in exchange for things no human should ever be deprived of  you're going to be forced to live in a way that is not actually realistic  and you and your world will not be as complete or healthy as would be possible if you were not having your time taken by a outdated economic system    and you're going to defend it in masses  thus signing your kids up for the same unrealistic  unhealthy and morally deprived system  you're going to tell them it's right  you're going to tell them people like me should be ignored  that earning a living by spending their lives doing things they don't want is okay  that forcing billions of humans to do things against their own will is moral    the silver lining is that capitalists are wrong  and this is easy to demonstrate  they are not living their lives in well rounded or healthy ways  they are not setting good examples of what it is to be human for their children  people are starting to wake up  and all i can say is thank you to all the capitalists for years of making bad arguments and stating that only market participants deserve food  your bad arguments and immoral stances have helped our side  a lot   tldr - giving up years of your life to immoral economic systems is for losers ,i5aehf

1013,How do you think society should reward productivity?,in a world where jobs are obsolete and everything is provided for free  say robots are doing nearly all the work  if there is no money system    how would you incentivize people to do work that is necessary for society to function    e g  fixing and maintaining the robots  upgrading the technology  or doing work that robots are not capable of doing  and how would you reward people for doing this necessary work   also  would rewarding productivity lead to inequality between the productive and non productive ,i2cwjb
