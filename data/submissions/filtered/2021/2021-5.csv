5,Work Should be a Choice For Extras,every person born has the right to a good life   instead we have a society where four billion people live in poverty  2 billion work every day just to survive  one billion work 40  years to have a few years of retirement and a few hundred thousand live in total luxury     what we need is a universal basic package   humanity has the means to pay for this  why aren't we doing it   what i think the basic package should include   1   housing with a minimum of 400 sq ft  per person in the household   e g  a couple gets 800 sq ft  a family of 4 gets 1600 sq ft   air conditioning and heat provided based on the location  2   clean water 3   basic food - rice  beans  bread  eggs  milk  spices  etc  4  cookware - plates  glasses  sporks  pots and pans  stove  oven  etc  5  utilities - gas and electric 6  basic furniture - couch  chairs  tables  beds 7  clothing 8  gym membership or exercise equipment - this will pay for itself with a healthier population 9  transportation - i think the form of transportation depends where you live  e g  city metro pass  minivan for family  pickup truck for work  but up to  3k a year year for getting around is easily doable  10  education - kindergarten through college should be paid for  its the students right at the end to decide if they want to pursue working for somebody else or use their education to focus on their own life  11  information technology and entertainment - basic tv internet package so humans can share information with each other and share cultural experiences  e g  movies  shows  sports games  etc  12  1 educational vacation per household per year   i don't think on a basic package you should be going to disneyworld  but maybe to the beach to learn about the effects of plastics pollutions in our oceans or to europe to gain a better understanding of the horrors of the holocaust   things i don't think should be in the basic package   1  video games 2  meat 3  eating out 4  air or aquatic vehicles 5  alcohol or marijuana 6  movie or sports tickets 7  premium cable - you need to pay if you want faux news   so in my plan everybody gets the basic package and then if you want to add on to that  you can go out and get a job for those things   this way you're not having to worry about working to pay the rent or making sure the power stays on   you are working for the extras like a ps5 or a night out with the family ,noj5x6

38,My company's latest retention scheme to stop people from leaving,so because employees have been leaving due to shit ass management and lack of proper direction  the managers came up with an ultra innovative strategy which sucks ass especially because it's shit pay and it comes with a billion terms and conditions   you get paid a certain amount as bonus now  after 1st year  and after 2nd year  it's not some extraordinary amount  mind you  about 2 months of extra pay which is not much after taxes  and apparently this is some extra generous deed that you have to keep it a  secret  oh no   so what are the terms  - eligible only if you haven't submitted your termination notice before the agreement  fair enough  - you can't leave the company within that year  if you do leave then you will have to pay the amount back for that year  lol  like i can totally see legal issues chasing you even after you decide to leave the company and paying back a few bucks short  also they don't mention if you should return amount before or after the taxation  red alert  - eligible only if you perform well and get a good score above a threshold in your performance analysis  lol  it''s them that decide what score you get  if you get lower score they stop all subsequent payments  i can totally see them increasing the already high workload expectations just so you will fight harder to get that score for that beautiful compensation  like i've been in this company for majority of my career and still i have to  prove  myself that i deserve that amount of money they're so generously giving away   - you can't be on leave for some amount of consecutive days  this is easy  everyone knows you can plan illnesses or injuries for the coming 3years  otherwise even if you work well before and after that rest period you still won't get the money  fuck you rofl manage your illnesses better   also if i get that money it'll be spent soon or invested somewhere and it would be more trouble to pay it back if i decide to leave because they don't realise that unlike them people don't have deep cash reserves sitting in offshore bank accounts  you'd have to keep that cash untouched because god forbid if you have to leave due to some unforeseen circumstances   they don't understand that employees leaving makes them worthless  so i don't get the point that they still determine our worth with their expectations  it's not really a goodwill gesture if it's accompanied by so much legal terms   i also can totally see them paying less annual bonus or salary rise because this extra amount has to be deducted somewhere from our own paychecks  but of course none of this would be mentioned in the agreement   fuck that  i'm not signing that and creating more trouble for myself  that agreement actually made me decide that i should leave soon so no point in taking it and paying back  good luck to anyone that signs it ,np4ps9

real  very first post on reddit so please be patient with me  and mods please if i do something wrong please go ahead and tell me so i can correct it next time   today  i'm a 23 unemployed swiss dude with no papers or graduations whatsoever  or accomplishments in his life     i'm sorry in advance if this is a mess  i'm writing this on the spur of the moment and have never been good narratively   when i was a kid  i had a lot of problems  as probably like many others  i was heavily bullied in the small village i lived in  my dad had died when i was 3 years old of lung cancer which apparently had left some sort of trauma in me that i could never notice directly  my mom owned a restaurant bistro which had living quarters upstairs and that's were we lived since when i was born  i lived with her  my half bro and half sis who were both 10 and 7 years older than me  as i mentioned  i was getting bullied almost daily by the kids in my village  i never had friends and was often thrown into the village fountain we had next to the bus stop to go to school  which made me backtrack and head back home often to change and had my mom stop work to drop me off there  the biggest problem i had and i'm  even today  extremely ashamed to admit it  but one of my problems  apparently tied to my dead father trauma  was that i could never go to the bathroom to relieve myself  feces  and used to wear diapers until very late  i stopped wearing them after being a few years old but the problem followed me further into my life   when i got to the age of 8  we moved out of there and started living in a big city  where nothing was better  i joined a new school  where the problems i had were still very apparent  i didn't want to be with anybody and would still have the same toilet issues  it would smell bad and people obviously disliked it  i was then a year later thrown into a special class with only 6 other kids who also had problems and where the teachers would work with us more slowly  its a good time to mention that i've never been smart at all or studious  i wasn't a troublesome kid but i had nothing good going for me  i don't really remember how many years i spent in that school  but at some point the problems i had were becoming increasingly problematic for a kid so my mom was forced to put me into a boarding school for 2 years after having spent 3 weeks in the hospital to try and help me out  this was a hard time for me  having to be separated from home and my family for the week  as far as i can remember  i had a lot of great experiences there because the teachers were great and the other kids wouldn't really bother me  i for the first time had a few people i could call friends  with which we used to play pokemon on our nintendo dss and such  during those years  my toilet problems finally seemed to be gone and i could go to the bathroom and relieve myself like a normal person  after those 2 years  i was reintroduced into a more normal class in an other school  where again we would only be a few kids but we worked more on studies and grades  next year was the year i finally was introduced into a normal class again  i was  at the time  3 years away from finishing normal school  it was probably the worst class i had been in yet tho  i joined it mid-year for some reason and so was put into a class were people knew each other already and had groups left and right  i remember i was still very introverted and didn't want to attract too much attention  but the other kids let me know very clearly they didn't like me  i was very soon put into a situation so difficult that i couldn't process anything when i was at school  and my grades had dropped so low that they let me pass the year but put me into a lower-grade class for the remaining 2 years  its during that hellish year that my older brother gave me his xbox and i finally had something i could enjoy doing fully  i would play mw2  halo reach  borderlands and such every time i had the occasion  i wouldn't do anything else during my free time anymore  i would even wake up 1-2 hours early each day to play the games some more with people i had met online  the remaining 2 years were fine  people were nice in my class but i didn't really have anybody i could call friends in it  but the ambiance was good enough so i could enjoy it  i then graduated from school   but as i still had no idea what i wanted to do in life as nothing seemed to be enjoyable  so if i wanted to get into highschool i had to do an additional year with more difficult stuff to learn so i'd be caught up from the normal-grade class i was ''demoted'' from  during this year i found what i could call real friends which i still have contacts with today which is good to mention i believe  after that year which i passed with ok grades  i went into highschool since i still couldn't find an apprenticeship  i had yet to know what i wanted to do in life  i was at the time 1 or 2 years older than the average kid    here is the part that starts to be a little bit more important in my opinion to today's events  but still part of my background   so i joined highschool  and the first and second years were pretty uneventful  i had failing grades in a few subjects but i still barely passed  i had some great times and most people were nice  getting to my 3rd and ''final'' year  something had changed  i don't know why and how  but i slowly started getting depressed  i cursed to hell every day i had to spend there  and right around february  i lost the strength to go there  it started slowly throughout the first part of the year where i would skip 1 or 2 days of school  then at some point i just stopped going at all  maybe because it was of the stress of finals coming and i knew i wasn't prepared  i could never remember anything i learned there for more than a month  so i got to my 3rd year without remembering anything i had learnt until now  i knew i was going to fail  school was very easy i always felt  you learned basic stuff  and there wasn't much of it  but highschool to me was different  i always got away with studying the night before because i just didn't have fun learning all those subjects and facts everyday there  german  history  maths  psychology  i just had no interest or fun in learning any of those things  i wouldn't go and would stay hidden in the dark in my room until my mom had left  yeah  i'm a pos  i knew her and i knew she wouldn't understand  she would cursed me to death and would throw me back there by force if she knew  but i felt extremely anxious and out of place now in this class that i used to enjoy being part of  my mom was very strict in a lot of ways but only to some extent  she knew first hand i had a difficult childhood so she gave me space and time for the things i enjoyed doing on the side  but its different when it came to school and grades  i should have always done more and better to her  i could've been happy having good grades but she'd often them me it could've been better  so of course if she knew i was skipping she'd kill me  i didn't want to see or talk to anybody from that class either anymore  and i think it was the same for them  all those people i felt ''close to'' didn't give a shit that at some point i'd just stop coming all together  the stress and guilt were too heavy to try and go back  but the days she'd wouldn't have to work  i'd feign going in the morning and hang out in a caf  just waiting for the time to pass  i was so scared of going back  even when i left the house to go somewhere i didn't have the strength to bring myself there  after a month of fully not going  one day that my mom didn't work  we received a letter in the mail saying they hadn't seen my for a while and of course  my mom exploded  she called me while i was supposedly on my way to school telling me we received that letter  so i went back home  tried to explain myself and got the beating of a lifetime  she yelled  cursed  pulled my hair and said all sort of stuff you'd expect  rightfully so  my mom legit hated me for a few months because i had lied to her about going to school  at this time they sent me to see a psychologist  my mom never understood nor wanted to understand my problems  but my sis alongside our family doc convinced her to try and send me to one  after 6 seances  nothing really came out of it  i don't ever remember what we talked about with her but we just stopped because there was no point  i didn't want to go and talk to her  until now i never really felt comfortable talking to people about what i had inside my head without bursting into tears and feeling like shit  remember that i've always been introverted to an extent  so outside of school and online friends  i wouldn't talk to anyone and didn't want to spend time outside of my room   my mom since the moment she knew i didn't go she just wouldn't talk to me for a long time unless forced to  that had me fucked up for a while  i was still in a very bad mental state at the time  and since i had no other choice but to repeat the year and go back in august  which was like 4 months later  i just went  but i couldn't  i went there for a few weeks  but i felt miserable  all the time  i was around 3 years older than most  everyone knew each other and frankly speaking  i wasn't interested in getting to know them  i wasn't interested  but i still felt out of place and looked upon as a nuisance or a bug that shouldn't be with them in that classroom  so i did it again  but this time  i caught the letter they sent home and destroyed it  i didn't have the willpower or strength to go to school for every reason in the world  but i could never face my mom again with the same shit happening the next year  after i told her i'd go  i was in a pit hole getting crushed by anxiety and guilt  every day and every night  i'd cry on my own and acted as if nothing was wrong because  i never felt understood anywhere  what would the point be of trying once again to explain my situation  i knew how it would end up  so i just acted for months until the end of the year and just announced that i had failed  even then my mom was pretty fucking angry and would yell at me and would constantly ask herself what she did wrong as a mother as if it was her fault  which i knew it wasn't  but seeing her like that hurt like hell on top of knowing what i had done this repeated 3 year that i didn't attend and kept hatting myself for a while     still background  but i'm gonna mention my professional life from here on out which is much more important than my school years probably   so  after those events  i had to go to the army june to october 2019  it's mandatory in switzerland so i had no choice since i was ''done'' with my studies  but i felt like it would be a great 4 months  i have no idea why  but i had positive apprehensions about it  boy was i fu  wrong  probably the thing i hated the most in my life yet  more than anything  it was hell everyday  i felt like i was useless  i didn't know how to properly do anything  i always had to rely on my other comrades and i was exhausted to 200  everyday  i was getting yelled at everyday and the stress was on an other level  some of the recruits were nice  but the other half were bullies  once again  they would sometimes be ok-ish nice  and others utterly annoying and mean  fortunately  when they saw i was having a hard time with anything  even if they were a bit angry  they'd help me out  the other recruits who i got along well with were the nicest people out there  i was decently obese and asthmatic since i was around 10  so sports weren't really my thing  but they really pushed me up and helped me out when i needed it  even our sergeants  they knew i was trying so most of the times when it was something physical they'd be understanding that i couldn't do it as well  it seems nice at first  but it was still hell  this kind of environment wasn't for me  getting yelled at constantly  having to do things over and over and over  learning stuff i didn't like doing  out of all things i had to work as a firefighter in the swiss bunkers  i was given the little motivation i had in my by my friends helping me out constantly and trying their best to support me  but i felt like a weight all the goddamn time and i hated it just as much as everything else  i somehow ended my service like everyone else and finally got home   since i didn't have anything  my sister found me a job in the shop she worked a few weeks after i was done with the military and i started working there with an ''extra'' contract  meaning i was an ''extra'' and would just do the same work as anyone else but they'd just give me hours of work when they needed another person in the shop  i was still very much introverted and didn't want to interact with other at too much  but it was fine since it meant i was getting paid well for the low amount of work i had to do  i was still mostly happy tho  i had just come out of what i felt like was hell  and i could finally earn a little bit of money to help out  my brother and i were still living with our mom  my sister had moved out a few years ago already  that's why i could do it  only working a few days per week  sometimes 2-3  other weeks maybe 4  and of course for christmas i worked full time but i was still fine with it  as it was 1 month and after that i knew i could get new parts for my pc only hobby  then covid came  and so i didn't have to work for 2 months  but during summer we opened again and i'd go work a few hours each week since there weren't many customers coming at the time  we got to november of last year and i unfortunately lost my job  my sis had quit since she wanted to start new studies and some other of my colleagues did as well  so the shop got a brand new staff and since they didn't need the ''extra'' anymore as they had enough full-time employees  i was laid off     today  main subject   so after losing my job in november  my mom told me i needed to find an apprenticeship  i didn't finish highschool and had pretty much nothing in my hands  but the more i thought about it  the more i knew there was literally nothing i wanted to do  i had experienced a few things in my life already  and no matter where i looked  there was nothing i was interested in  i had been able to work only a few days per week because at home both my mom and bro were working to sustain us  i felt like the least annoying thing would probably be working as a computer-scientist  so i started sending letters left and right  but i never received a single positive answer  at 23  i hadn't graduated anywhere and only had a little bit of work experience  so no one was interested in me  i was actually supposed to find an apprenticeship in 2020 but with covid and me still being pretty confused about what i wanted to do in my life  i ended up still working at my previous job without looking for an option    a thing i forgot to mention concerning my health alongside that i'm pretty fat  100 kg  and my asthma  is that since around being 20 years old  i started having a lot of bowel pains and painful  long lasting diarrheas  after some tests  we knew i was lactose intolerant  and not gluten  so i started avoiding everything containing it  but to no avail  it wasn't ever  too  annoying but it was still there  during the army there were plenty of time where i felt like i was going to explode  and so did the other recruits  most likely because lots of water heavy exercises bowel movement  same during my previous job  but they were very understanding  it was a small gift shop without too many customers bliss since i don't like having to interact too much with people as mentioned  and that i don't enjoy working in retail  so i could just go have bathroom breaks whenever i needed them  but those past few months it's becoming increasingly more severe  i had done some sample tests mid-2020 that i send to my doc  but they all came back negative  no parasites  no ibd  nothing  he thought it was either stress or food allergies  i'd like to point out that those would happen very often  it could be fine for a week once in a while but then every day for a full months i'll be having abdominal pains and would be stuck in the bathroom for hours each day   so after never getting positive answers to the letters i sent to get an apprenticeship  my mom was getting pretty mad and annoyed that i couldn't find anything  so she started pushing me to find something else  like in retail  i know for a fact i'd hate it with all i have  the one job i had was a dream job  but wouldn't be able to sustain someone on their own with the amount of hours i had   the only reason i thought about being a computer scientist was because i knew a few people who enjoyed doing it  and since i was always in front of a computer it seemed fine  but the more i thought about it  the more thinking about being in that environment scared the sh  out of me  having to deal with people  learning stuff  getting yelled at for anything   as the years passes  i feel like i wanna distance myself more and more from everyone  i don't talk to my 2 best friends i had back in highschool  working with customers is hell  i quite frankly don't like the people around me  the amount of time my family had been unfair to me in so many different scenarios has made me not want to spend time with them more than i need to  the only times i enjoy being  here  is when i'm online  that's the only thing i can say makes me happy  not going outside  not seeing friends  not spending time with family  no sports  absolutely not working   up until now  as i said  both my mom and bro were working full time to sustain us  my mom especially as she's been working her whole life doing many jobs for long hours as she had to take care of 3 children on her own with a little bit of help from her boyfriend  now she's getting to a point in her life where she's sick  tired  and would like to finally be free in a few years so she can leave and retire peacefully   i understand that i need to do something so i at least tried  so when my mom managed to get me an  internship in a multimedia shop through some contacts  i accepted  it's only 2 weeks long and with the experience i got i thought it should be fine  but no  it actually wasn't  i hate it  that's my very first full time ''job'' in a long time  and i genuinely do not understand how people can do that for the rest of their lives  wake up at 6 45am  and come home at 7 30pm being so fucking exhausted you can do nothing but fall onto your bed  how  how do people even do this  i don't want life to be this  you just wake up early  got to a god awful day of work  come back late and can't do anything so you just sleep  it would be even worse if i lived on my own and there was all the other stuff you have to take care of in the house  i hate how life is about this unless you've got all the money you want in life  it's not worth it   i've been depressed for a few months now  i hate my life  i don't know what i want to do  i have my own health issues who prevent me from having a normal job-life if i were to ever get one  and i don't find enjoyment in anything aside being with my online friends  life still goes on and i need to do something  but i don't know what and how to  my mom is killing herself working until my bro  my sis and i find something stable  my sister is in trouble as well now  but with money and still hasn't finished anything to have a stable job  my bro works at 80  but that's the only thing he does  he can't do anything when it comes to housework  i know it's mainly my fault and i hate it  but i'm not able to do anything  i couldn't finish my studies  i don't do anything interesting  i couldn't get a better contract at my previous job  i can't keep friends  i've pretty much been a failure my entire life  everything i've done was trash and i've only been a pest to everyone around me  i can't keep a job  i can't get an apprenticeship  because i know i will not be able to finish it like highschool  i've never had the willpower or strength to finish or do anything properly for the few years i've been here  i hate who i am and what i've done  and i don't want to keep being such a burden to my family   don't like saying it  but i've previously thought about suicide  to me it seemed like the best option  i'm against a wall right now  and it feels like the only way out is banging my head hard enough on it until i drop  on one side  if i can't find an apprenticeship  which my mom made clear was the only path that would lead me to a normal life  but i know i wouldn't be able to do it  but if i don't  my mom is gonna keep suffering from it and she shouldn't  i wished many time to not be there  not be a burden to everyone around me  not be such a failure who can't coop with work and people  i've only ever enjoyed and been able to do one single thing in life and it's gaming  that's why i thought ''if only i could get motivated enough to be a streamer  even a small one with the bare minimum to live with''  i'd like to do it because the way i see it  it'd solve all my problems  i'd also maybe finally have people who'd like me for who i am and would enjoy me and my content  while being able to care care of my bowel problems more easily  but who knows if it's going to work  who knows if it's now just another waste of time while my mom is working everyday until she can retire in a few years    i just hate what my life has become  i'm a loser  a pos  i can't accomplish anything and never will be able to  i wish everything had turned out different  and wouldn't have had to pester everyone by just existing   people of reddit  after reading this  what would you recommend  i will take any advice  no matter how dark or how mean they seem to be   thank

96,The difference from working in retail to working as a software developer.,hi everyone  to give a bit of a background  i m 32  never went to college  and worked retail jobs since i graduated high school  i come from a very poor family  when i was 26  i moved back in with my parents to lower my costs  still paid rent but it was much cheaper then living in a studio apartment  when i was 30  i enrolled in a coding bootcamp  and when i was 31  at the start of covid  i got my first and current software development role at a small growing startup  i still currently live with my parents as housing prices are still climbing despite covid in my area   i started to become pretty miserable at retail  i would be treated like subhuman  if my manager had to do something  he would just say he isn t coming in  when i was sick  he would text me in the middle of the day to see if i can come in on the second half of the day  vacation days were super hard to use  he would text me on days off to cover shifts  had no consideration that maybe i had plans  he would watch to make sure nobody finished lunch 5 minutes late and would check the bathroom if we took to long  it felt like prison  they would treat us like machines   i almost felt lost when i started my development job  i didn t have to clock in  people would respect my time  i never get a call during my time off  when i called in sick  the only thing my manager said was  thanks for letting me know  hope you feel better  no extra texts  just acknowledging  and moving on  didn t try to guilt trip me like in retail  whenever someone messages me during off hours  they let me know that there is no rush and that i could respond when i m free the next day  nobody cares when i start my day  i would often start around noon since i hate waking up with an alarm  i got a performance bonus for the year as well  in retail  nobody would give a shit if i did well at my job  bonuses were none   employers should respect their employees ,nowoys

159,How I worked at an up-and-coming cult and got out of it,i usually lurk around here  this is my first time posting and i want to get this out because this previous job that i worked at made me realize that i don't need to sacrifice my life over it    i'm a teacher  it took me a while to realize that this school that i worked at was a cult  i won't go much into the details but it was a school that fell under a certain sect of mysticism  the leader of this sect was revered  regarded highly among the followers and remained in shrouds of mystery    the first thing i learned while working in a cult organization is that they don't show obvious signs of cultism  rather  they will welcome you and chant mantras such as  we're a family  not even  we're like a family  but straight-up  we're a family  they will shower you with gifts and show the ideal version of themselves  they will promise you the stars and the moon    then  once the honeymoon period is over  they will show you their true selves    for us  the honeymoon period was over once the school started  the gifts dried up and the promises that they made simply never existed  no brand new resources  no state-of-the-art gym or programs that would be implemented for students  we were forced to teach in certain ways but those  certain ways  were never elaborated clearly  thousands of meetings happened but none of them served any purpose other than the admin giving  pep talks  that ultimately was about glorifying their leader and their sect    the admin tried to break us through the meetings or morning announcements  every day  all teachers and students were all forced to mindlessly chant about how great their leader was without knowing the true meaning behind it all  this time period was only supposed to last about 20 minutes but it actually went over an hour and on some occasion  even three hours so that they could praise their leader  they would show us redundant videos about the  power of your mind  how  you are a robot  and the classic  we are all one big family    all of these videos and mantras chanted during meetings and within the auditorium made no sense  it was all a total waste of learning time and socialization time for students and teachers    did the teachers voice their complaints  yes  some of us did  including me  another thing you need to know about cults is that they don't like it when they have opposition within their community  some of the more vocal complaints from teachers were stomped out through forced resignation  the school kept us all under control through fear and manipulation  it was funny because there were only a couple of students who needed to be expelled for serious offence such as violence but they never were expelled  the teachers who tried to work with those students got fired instead because  someone needed to take the punishment  it would've looked bad on the school if they had a track record of students who got expelled but high turnover rates obviously meant crap    they tried to break me a lot  they tried to indoctrinate me with their leader's videos and if i didn't comply  i would be threatened for not  living up to my teaching standards  there was high amount of favoritism and passive-aggressive micromanagement from the admin  those who were not favored were punished by having the worst classrooms with pests and no resources    we had a couple of teachers who were on near verge of death and hospitalized  guess what the admin forced them to do  that's right  work on their hospital beds and smile at that proudly  yes  in fact  this was what all of us went through at this organization  we worked non-stop  sometimes for 24-hours straight  there were a couple of staff members who were so proud of  hustling  but it was all toxic positivity talk and brainwashing from the cult that made them think this way    at some point  after taking brutal amount of psychological punishment  i realized that there was nothing that they could do to me after seeing the hypocrisy and lies that the school lived up to instead of teaching proper character development  what broke me was actually seeing the school not care about the students  i felt like such a fool for believing that at least the admin cared about the students because that's what they always said  the admin always told the students how they were regarded as the admin's  kids  and how much the admin  loved them  yet  this admin who said that they loved kids did not provide proper funding for students with special needs  and left students alone in classrooms on several occasions  this was all later revealed to me after i learned that they falsified their budget reports and heard the news on how they handled substitutes    after enduring mental torture that finally wore me down physically  i ended up leaving the school but not before i reported the school to the government  i learned that no job is worth your health  be it mental  emotional  or physical  watch out for any organization or companies that exhibit cult-like behaviors  even if it's small  you might wonder why i took this job or why i didn't leave sooner  well  that's what i used to shamefully think when it came to domestic abuse  of course  i used to think about domestic abuse like that when i was a kid  wouldn't it be just easier to leave  don't you see the red flags    the point is  sometimes  you just get so blinded and swept up by what seems  ideal  that you end up losing what's actually important  i thought that in order to chase down my dreams  i had to sell my soul to the devil  and let me tell you  it wasn't worth it   you are important  you matter  you're not just some organization's little slave  you are your own free agent  don't be a mere cog in the machine  don't sacrifice your soul to places that don't care crap about you  i wanted to be a teacher to do meaningful work for society  but once i worked at that school  my work became meaningless  i am trying to reclaim who i am and who i want to be    don't let anyone try to force you  period      tl dr i worked at a school that turned out to be a cult and slowly revealed its true colors over the

160,This capitalistic society depresses me so much,i know that this problem has probably been mentionned multiple times on this sub  but for god sake this fucking capitalistic society depresses me so much that i have to vent about it somewhere where i won't be judged by all those wage-slaves irl who are so proud of themselves because they are literally selling their time   body to an employer that doesn't give a shit about them  the only reason i'm even working is because it's still mandatory   but then i was also thinking about seeing a therapist for this  but then i'm also like   but that's so stupid lol   like what the hell is he she going to do about it   like i wonder how the hell therapist are suppose to help mentaly ill people that are sick because of the way society is structured    for me therapy seems like putting a bandage on an open wound in that case  because therapists are only going to threat the consequences that this sick capitalistic society have on people  anxiety  depression  suicidal thoughts  but then the cause will still remain the same  that seems like such a waste of time and money for me  but i don't know what do you guys think    like i don't know how most people can be so naively enthusiastic and thrilled about the fact that we have to work at least 8 hours a day  5 days a week for 45   years and then retire and slowly die at home once we're too old to work   how is this a normal way to be living life   like you gotta be some kind of masochistic person to enjoy suffering that way and for such a long time   and also how fucking sad is it that humans are literaly the only living species that need to  earn  the right to live by working their asses off   why the fuck can't we just chill and do our own thing at home with our friends and family   why do we have to work for some international company owned by a psychopath sociopath of a ceo that doesn't give a fuck about us    we have to pay for everything in this cursed capitalistic society   food  water  shelter  education  medication and a lot of other things for fuck sake soon enough we're gonna have to pay for the oxygen that we're breathing   and i don't mean that society is the only cause of my depression  they are probably other things as well that are causing it  but i still think that it plays a huge part in worsening it ,nnin50

292,How I lost faith in the employment system in this country I love so much...,hi    i was a court clerk for 3 5 years  i made  13 an hour  i spent half my time in court and the other half of my time auditing attorney requests for money  in this auditing portion of my job  i saw massive fraud - attorneys faking billing  lying about how much time they spent in the court room  lying about how much time it took them to write motions just lying all the time  i fought endlessly with my bosses about it  telling them that we had to act i put my heart and soul into it  and for 3 years  one of my bosses and i fought and we tried to stop these people from stealing tax payer dollars  unfortunately he retired and was replaced with a micromanager  and it turns out the micromanager liked to read employee emails and didn't like people shitting on her attorney friends  and after 3 5 years of giving 100  i was fired because i was  sexting  my girlfriend on my work computer  i was dealing with insane depression issues and my parents were about to get divorced   my fault i guess   so i applied for jobs within the court system and got hired a few months later  i didn't really level with them about why i lost my previous job because it was too embarrassing - i just told them my position was eliminated from my last job   2 months into my new job  i get a call from my boss  i'll make this story short - my previous boss who fired me went out of her way to contact my new boss  told him what happened  and so he called me in and fired me on the spot  before my probation ended so i had no employee protections   this is when i slipped into a major depression   after 6 months  and after applying to 135 jobs  and disclosing to many why i lost my jobs  didn't want to get fired a 3rd time  i got hired  the new employer asked me to never talk about why i lost my previous jobs ever again  as if i really wanted to  i started there and things went great for about 6 months   6 months into the job  my supervisor quits and they decide they will not hire anyone or promote anyone so it's now just me doing 2 people's work  i immediately find another place to apply to and i was able to get hired  on my way out after resigning my  boss  pulls me into their office and berates me to the point where i left in tears  so that's 3 jobs in a row of me leaving in tears if you are counting   i start my next job and things go okay for the next 2 years   after 2 years of this job  there was an incident  not involving me  in a week's time we had 2 people quit and there was no one to cover their duties  i had been training them so i was reassigned to their work  2 people's workload  i worked 70 hours weeks for many months  giving 100  to make it work  and i succeeded  after months of working long days  i had it under control   then my mother almost passed away  thank god the hospital saved her life  during those weeks  i still kept working  i didn't want to disappoint my employer because we were so short-staffed  i was giving 100   a few months later my supervisor quits and i applied for her job  i was the only internal applicant  only internal interview  i had 3 years of experience at this place  i get a call one morning from my friend at work and he says   oh you dirty dog you  i heard they sent out a job offer and you didn't even tell me you got it  turns out they told people they gave out an offer to someone else before they even told me that i was out of consideration  i found out from my friends  my boss called me  10 hours later to tell me i didn't get the job   and then a year goes by  what a fool i was to stay   and 3 weeks ago my new supervisor quit   and today i find out they are promoting a new person  recently hired in the last 2 years  to be the manager over me the guy who has been doing 2 people's worth of work for going on 3 years the guy who worked while his mom was in the hospital  how dumb i am the guy who cleaned up the mess of everyone who kept quitting   it has been a tough day   but i've been fortunate enough to end up on the lucky-side of capitalism in my life  when i was in my early 20s and just started working at court  back in 2012 and 2013  i invested every spare penny i had into tesla stock  i had no friends  no social life  nothing so i just spent my nights reading and learning and i was blown away by electric cars  the investment didn't amount to much for the first 6-7 years because i didn't have much money to even invest in the first place but in the past year or so i've managed to make nearly  1 million dollars  most of which is now cash life-changing in so many ways for someone who takes home  25k a year but yet i never let it actually  change  my life  but after what i've been through with employers  and after being passed over again today  i'm sure as shit thinking about letting this money change my life  i also would like to get revenge on 1 employer for a change and make them feel bad for once   what do you think  should i continue to be humble  keep my head down  and ignore the money i've saved  or do you think its time to tell someone to f off   i'm 30  single  blessed by the stock market gods  but miserable because my employer uses me and never thinks of me for anything they just think i'm a peon   fuck them for thinking i'm a fucking peon  i'm not some dumb shitbag  i'm worthy  i'm a good person and i give 100  but the employers in this country are evil and are turning me into a monster  i'm mad all the time  sad  angry its not what it should be at all not when i've been blessed the way i have   sorry for the rant  i'm so exaughsted  i'm taking a mental health day tomorrow so that i don't end up rage quitting ,nmpmm6

305,Why they really want you to go back to the office.,there are a couple reasons why all of the sudden covid is all good now  does not seem to matter like it used to  time to go back to the office even though your life became greater working from home  there is less pollution because of all the travel  more time for yourself  seemingly at no expense for the company right  i mean  work output is the same to them so why is it company bosses vs workers on this one  well   here are a couple of the real reasons   1  real estate value  the basic  most capitalist thing we all know about businesses  its all about the bottom line money  value  revenue - costs   profit  all of the sudden  that nice modern glass-everywhere building loses its value  becomes abandoned    2  middle managers and hr  what is their job anymore  the link between the all mighty executives and the peasant workers  looking over your shoulder to see what you re doing  organising team building  walking around giving the workers praise for things they dont actually understand  having pointless scheduled meetings  no need for that  workers can just zoom call  their workloads are slashed and almost made redundant   3  fear of change by the bosses with the old person mindset  someone on top of their game should be able to adjust  get out of that office space lease fast  accept this is how its done now    4  and finally ofcourse there are workers who enjoy the office politics  their ability to kiss the boss  ass and undercut their coworkers far outweighs actual skills  or they might be a good person that let work take over their life and they dont know what to actually do with their spare time ,nn6mm3

324,Mental impediments to antiwork ideas,hi   it's been quite clear to me that an antiwork-centric society would be far less alienating for everyone and could possibly stand a chance against climate change  however  the way there isn't easy and people have integrated a lot of political ideology that moreless gaslights them into accepting the current system as it is and basically go to work as expected of them    what are those blockages     any sort of wealth redistribution reform will be perceived  even by a large majority of the modest people  as a crime against  economic freedom  taxes that would fund infrastructure and social programs are perceived as  parasitic  and people who are actually more in need are dehumanized    this is grounded in further unconscious mental structures  the idea of merit is central to this  for the reactionary ideology to work  people's real-life position at a given point have to be the expression of their moral value through  motivation   grit   seriousness  or  hard-work    the reactionary ideology has to posit that the rich man has worked hard and deserves his wealth  however often inherited  and that the poor man's condition results from bad choices  bad morals  laziness  or even intellectual inferiority   now  obviously jobs aren't allocated out of  merit  nor  intelligence  in the real-world  determining factors have been scientifically proven to boil down much more to your parents' cultural capital than it does to whatever individual faculties you may have    that's why reactionaries love to glorify  free-will  as an essential part of human nature and tend to reject more deterministic accounts as  apologetic for the lazy  or other negatively-loaded terminology meant to label the other party as a bleeding-heart liberal ,nmk6j1

341,"In Labor Sectors, Why Are Bosses, Managers, Supervisors Needed?",in the very early 20th century  the teens and twenties and continuing into the 30's  if we look at the business press and various publications of the time  they were very worried  terrified even  by a new kind of labor strike  the sit-down strike  it began in u s  steel production  rather than protest and march to deliver grievances to capitalist bosses outside of factories  workers simply sat inside the factories and did nothing  they realized that they held all the power because they were the producers  many of them began to question   why do we need bosses  we have all the skills to produce everything ourselves  we can be the enterprisers and run everything  we can take over and own the factories collectively   why have bosses  managers  foremen etc  from steel  it went into the garment industry  from there it moved into textiles  meat packing plants  machine shops and on and on  the popular phrase  we know what to do  so why do we need you  took hold  sit-downs became an effective tool and was predictably met by capitalist with the forced removal by cops  it was a scarier form of strike for the employers because the capitalists couldn't simply have workers killed  as they had done in the 19th century and so it was eventually driven out of them in various ways  mass firings  political repression etc   if workers do indeed know how to operate machines and run factories  why then are bosses necessary ,nmf5tc
342,"""Laziness Does Not Exist""",  the title refers to an essay that is in this sub-reddit's  library    i read it and was a bit surprised at its inclusion in the sub's library  the message of the essay is essentially that laziness does not exist  because any failure to work can be attributed to fixable barriers  in other words  the essay upholds the idea that healthy people want to work  and even work in the ways specifically administered by society  but encounter obstacles that prevent them from realizing this desire  in fact  the author states that  lazy behavior is not an active choice    to me  this message is not anti-work at all  it does not criticize modes of work or ideas about work  instead it insists that individuals must  and want to  adapt themselves to working  and someone who flat out does not want to work is an aberration--ultimately not that much different from the original idea of laziness  but instead of pinning the blame on free will  the essay pins it on mental health or unfavorable circumstances    i wonder if anyone else has noticed this ,nmnwib

344,"How This System Works - We Lose, They Win",work is basically an employer paying you  then you using that money to pay your expenses   most people live paycheck to paycheck  so the money their job pays them goes to pay their living expenses    it all boils down to this - pay the workers as little as possible  make the expenses as high as possible  and take the workers labor  daily  every day we work  they give some payment  and the payment is used to keep living    at the end of the day  or more like at the end of every day  they win as they get our labor and the profits that come from it  and we stay  running on that treadmill  thinking one day we may make it   it's cruel   but we know how their system works ,nmjg0d

350,Anyone feel like it's getting worse?,i feel like in the company i'm in  everyone is being pushed to work more and more and more for less and less money    also  the treatment of each person seems to be plummeting  treating each person as an output machine and not even holding back on saying it     all this while pushing to pay everyone less and under market value    for instance  hr says  this position should be a  100k team member  and management says   find a truly desperate soul to do it for  40k   it's horrific      cut budgets and achieve more     fire people and still hit all your  numbers    have 8-10 hours of unproductive meetings every week but still do your job and produce the expected output     do not bring up the fact that the economy and covid are still problems - the made up fucking numbers have to be hit  regardless    no one will care if you work more  after hours  just do all the work  no one will thank you     does anyone feel like what they do during the day is the literal opposite of what they would want to do  there isn't a single minute of overlap of what i would do with my day vs  what i have to do    but this is the best way for me to  earn a living  and stay alive with enough money  so what's the alternative    i never felt like such a slave to the system  is it really going downhill and getting worse for anyone ,nmxzjz

439,Dream Jobs,i've seen a fair few posts here that criticize the notion of a dream job  but i have to strongly disagree and i want to open a discussion about this   this sub should focus on how many work environments are toxic and that there is a sick mentality in most of the world regarding the role of labor in society  the notion of labor itself is not the issue though  there is nothing inherently wrong with labor or even wanting to work - it is when you have no choice but to work  else die  or your employer undervalues and mistreats you wherein problems exist   if you have a deep desire to teach  to heal  to discover through research  or other such pursuits  then work may very well be the best path towards reaching those dreams  if you want to teach  being a teacher or professor will offer you the best opportunities to do so  if you want to heal  being a nurse or a doctor will allow you to do so  in that sense  it's not the job that's the dream  but what you are able to achieve through that work   of course  not everyone has such a dream that is best realized through a job  if you want to create art  employment may not offer you the best path towards realizing this goal  if you want  to explore nature  a job might not best give you the opportunities to do so  that's not to say that jobs that allow you to freely follow these dreams don't exist  but they're not inherently the best paths towards doing so   in summary  this community shouldn't be so critical of the notion of a dream job  labor is important  and people who pursue their dreams through work play an important role in our society  it is only the notion that you must have a dream job which should be abandoned  as not all dreams are best realized through labor   discuss ,nlhir7

violation amounted to  64 per week or  3 300 per year for a year-round worker nearly a quarter of the worker s earned wages and affected 17  of low-wage workers  the authors detail who was affected   young workers  women  people of color  and immigrant workers are more likely than other workers to report being paid less than the minimum wage  but this is primarily because they are also more likely than other workers to be in low-wage jobs  in general  low-wage workers experience minimum wage violations at high rates across demographic categories  in fact  the majority of workers with reported wages below the minimum wage are over 25 and are native-born u s  citizens  nearly half are white  more than a quarter have children  and just over half work full time   a back-of-the-envelope estimate  extrapolating from the bernhardt  milkman  and theodore  2009  study  suggests that by 2016 aggregate wage theft was on the order of  52 billion annually  mcnicholas  mokhiber  and chaikof 2017  this estimate does not include the stealing of tips where the wage received is nevertheless the minimum or violations of prevailing wage laws  this understated estimate of aggregate wage theft is  nonetheless  four times greater than the fbi s  13 billion estimate of the total annual value of all robberies  burglaries  larceny  and motor vehicle theft   other insights can be gleamed by identifying the amounts recovered in wage theft suits and enforcement actions by the u s  department of labor  by states  and through class action settlements  mcnicholas  mokhiber  and chaikof  2017  did so and found  880 3 million in 2015 and  1 1 billion in 2016  for a total of  2 billion over both years  this estimate  according to the researchers  likely dramatically underrepresents the problem of wage theft  since probably only a fraction of victims actually file government complaints or are involved in class action settlements   shierholz  2021  details the reasons for the prevalence of wage theft   one reason is workers  diminished bargaining power relative to their employers  the fact that this unlawful employer behavior is not being  competed away  underscores that  for a variety of reasons  workers do not have the ability to quit these jobs as a de facto form of enforcement   another reason is that government resources devoted to combating violations of workplace protections are insufficient and have diminished  for instance  at the federal level  shierholz writes   in 1978  there were 69 000 workers per wage and hour investigator on average  but today that ratio is 175 000 to one  the increased use of forced arbitration agreements  as detailed in a later section  has prevented workers from holding their employers accountable both in court and in the private arbitrations they are forced to use  frequently without the ability to do so as a class  as shierholz  2021  notes   to underscore the importance of class-action lawsuits in our enforcement framework  in 2015 and 2016  the top 10 private wage and hour class-action settlements alone exceeded the combined total wages recovered by all state and federal enforcement agencies  forced arbitration with class and collective action waivers make it virtually impossible for low-wage workers to get any meaningful type of remedy   last  declining unionization enables more wage theft to go unchallenged  in effect  nearly every option workers have of holding employers accountable for stealing their wages has eroded in recent years  there is less protection through government enforcement  weaker access to legal recourse  and far less union advocacy in workplaces   how much does wage theft affect wages in the middle and at the bottom  we do not have an estimate of aggregate wage theft across the wage spectrum or for middle-wage workers  so it is not possible to assess the impact of wage theft on the median wage  among low-wage workers  bernhardt  milkman  and theodore  2009  found that 68  experience wage theft violations averaging 14 95  of earnings  this translates into an average loss across all low-wage workers of 10 2 32 even this estimate omits certain types of wage theft  and we do not know how representative the study s sample is of the national low-wage workforce  nevertheless  the bernhardt  milkman  and theodore study indicates that wage theft drains a substantial amount of low-wage workers  earnings  we also do not know the extent of wage theft s growth over the 1979 2017 period  though researchers judge that there has been substantial growth  a speculative estimate is that if wage theft has doubled to the 10 2  level implied by the bernhardt  milkman  and theodore study  then it caused low-wage workers  earnings to fall 5  over the 1979 2017 period due to weaker wage standards enforcement  less access to legal recourse  and eroded unionization  for mid-level wages  theft of overtime pay  unpaid worktime  and the undercutting of prevailing wages likely also had an adverse impact ,nlyhen

527,"After being curious about the sub for a long time, I have finally become anti-work, due to an increasingly rediculous situation of gross negligence and nepotism at my job.",i  22m  work as a care attendant at a home for mentally  disabled people  there are a few homes in the area i work at  taking shifts as needed  one home is actually an apartment for a single man who was to violent and unpredictable to be left with other residents   there is one worker at this home that i have no idea how they still have a job  multiple cases of violating patient rights  reports of texting and driving  calling in sick almost once a week  and more  being a care position  this type of behavior just isn't acceptable and that's made clear when you are hired  it's actually against the law  and in my mind should result in immediate termination  see  we are always short staffed  so i assumed the lack of consiquences was due to a fear of the inability to fill the position  it's somewhat valid  but also in my mind negligent to leave the resident in their care knowing their history  just because filling the position is hard   my company pays 13 an hour btw  well below living wage here  but  no  turns out my boss is their brother  see  if all of the reports of their conduct had actually turned into write ups  they would have lost the  three strikes you're out  game long ago    so  a few days ago  a comcerned neighbor tells me the bad employee left out resident alone in the apartment  on the balcony  to go talk to their friends in the parking lot  we are not allowed to leave them unsupervised  they can be in a different room  but we have to be in the same building  nothing bad happened  but that is a huge no-no  if something did happen  it would be a huge deal  this person would probably go to jail for negligence  the program would go under investigation and could be shut down  if it was found that i knew about a case of negligence and didn't report it i could very well be charged as well    i don't like causing trouble  i am very much a person who wants everyone to like me  so i go back and forth on reporting  i mean  nothing did happen  i hate feeling like a narc  eventually i tell myself it's the right thing to do  i email my boss saying this is the situation  please talk to them about the rules  my boss then emails me back saying he accidentally forwarded my email to the person i complained about    let me just say  i do really like my boss  i think they are an extremely good person  and an extremely good manager  i struggle to say they did this on purpose  if it wasn't for the family relation it wouldn't even cross my mind  my boss has expressed they are upset with their sibling over their actions multiple times to me  i am rather certain there is nepotism  but i just don't know how far it goes    so now this is the situation i am in  i can't quit my job or move to another department  i am going back to college in just a couple months and won't get hired elsewhere  i need the money  i could report my boss and the whole situation to hr  but then all i get is everyone mad at me   almost all management are friends with eachother and me reporting my well liked boss would surely make everyone upset  i am graduating college soon and need the good reference to start my career  i was even going to use this boss as a letter of recommendation  i am expected to just go back to work and act like nothing happened  like there isn't something majorly wrong with a company who can continuously employ someone who's technically committed crimes under your employment by violating the patients rights   a lot of this stems from them only paying 13 an hour  we can't hire anybody when every target  walmart  and mcdonald's pays 2 dollars an hour more  turn over is constant  it isn't an easy job  so many people start and quit before they even finish all their training  we hire anyone without a criminal record  we can't fire the bad employees when they are all we have  i've seen the finances and know we could be paying more rather easily  someone is getting rich  which is weird because we are mostly government sponsored  furthermore this company would throw you under the bus at a moment's notice  accidents happen  especially when you are one person taking care of four disabled people all with strict medication scheduals  health conditions  and behavioral issues  you just aren't going to do everything perfect  this company would throw you to the wolves to save itself  let you be criminally processed although they are the ones who don't hire enough skilled help    it disgusts me that someone is getting rich off of providing mediocre care to disabled people  that abuse and negligence  even though it's  minor  is being swept under the rug  and it's so easy too  we hire so many pot heads and deadbeats it's like i'm the only one who can see what's happening  they are happy doing the bare minimum and ignoring what's wrong  they can sit on their phone all day and ignore the residents because everyone else is either just as lazy or you're the only person on staff    fuck the system that allows places like this to prosper all over the country ,nkzd0w

541,Why is working for the non-corporate sector not an option?,i am genuinely curious - is working for the non profit  social work  care   development sector something that you guys consider  i feel like this does not get talked about as an alternative in any post  after two soul crushing years i have sworn to never work in the private for-profit sector ever again  i now work in international development and i know i am making way less money than i could in the corporate sector  but for me this was my only option as i was loosing my will to live in this meaningless mashine  i know i was privileged to be able to get a good education and get this job and have noone that depends on my income but myself  but there are so many other low threshold options if you want  or need  to escape the corporate sector  i feel like i am missing something  i would love to get some other perspectives on this  also apologies for my english  thank you ,nldrqy

549,Fired from first corporate job,just need to rant  i'm not really sad about it  mostly in panic mode right now trying to find another job while not knowing what i'd actually somewhat enjoy doing   who will even want to train me  i'm 22 btw with 4 years of work experience  mix of it and clerical jobs during after college  so still pretty entry level i suppose    this job was wrecking me mentally  i was a client coordinator at a real estate office  which in this company meant receptionist with extra steps  filing  basic administrative duties  etc  pretty average and not difficult but the environment is what eventually got me dragging myself to work every day  everyone was so goddamn negative to each other  talking crap behind others backs  including clients   etc so it would be no surprise if they did that to me because i was let go after 3 months  even though i was to go through a 90 day probation period  last thursday they let me work most of the day and called me into hr to fire me at 3 30  just to pack my shit and leave basically  here's your last paycheck bye bye    up until that point my supervisor and coworker who trained me said i was doing well and kept hyping up the  upward mobility  and  great things  that go on there  neither of them were there when i met the chopping block  according to the hr woman  i was being let go  because of things  supervisor  and others were saying and it's just not working out  can anyone explain what this means  huh   maybe i'm just a little startled because it's my first time like i said  i'm still learning that people being nice to my face at work means nothing apparently  i'm trying my best not to judge future jobs based on this one  but i have a feeling it'll always be like this and i have to be extremely careful and always assume i'm going to be let go for just about any reason or non-reason   phew,nksa1y

553,A work-free society also for low income countries?,hey everyone  i am new here and hope i can post this question here  i love all the images  quotes and memes people post here as i have been intrigued with the thought of a work-free life for quite some time now  i love reading about the success of four day work weeks and similar experiments as they are giving me hope that there is indeed change ahead  even if it s at a very slow pace  i can realistically imagine that work-free living can become a reality in high income countries  like the us and most of europe with the adoption of a universal basic income  taxes on machines and so on  but how would this work for low income countries  for example most african countries  how would they generate so much income when automation is not even close to the same level as in the west    ps  just to clarify  when i say work-free i don t mean no work at all  i just mean that people no longer need to work to survive and have basic necessities because they get a basic income from the state  this frees them up to pursue whatever it is they want to pursue and of course  lots of people will still end up working but on different terms ,nkgq03

555,Accessable self employment instead of UBI/benefits?,the work itself never pisses me off  it s the atmosphere  the lack of control and being under the thumb of an apparent cabal of psychopaths all working in conjunction to torture the most humane of us    so  what if their was a job you couldn t really get fired from  you want a break  you take a break  you want a day off  you take a day off  never even have to ask anyone  you just make that choice   it s the freedom that western society champions  along with the capitalist nature of earning your keep  it s very nature could never be compared to socialism or communism so even the hardest right would be stretched for a reason to fight against it    what if our government s had an endless supply of work that needed doing  and instead of creating a nationalised industry or outsourcing to conglomerates  they instead created the  uber  of this industry  you just show up and get paid per work unit done  self employment where the government is your customer  accessible to all and job security for life   companies would lose their teeth  no more fear culture  no more bullying  only incentives    i call this change  the great redundancy of psychopaths  because they d lose their control over us    the only problem with self employment is the uncertainty  a limitless supply of government work would rectify that  you d be more comfortable financing things and taking loans you know you can repay    sure the lack of sick pay  and pto sucks but that s why you save and take short term zero interest loans  it s the price for freedom   plus it d be funny to watch the likes of bezos to cry when an even tougher labour shortage is generated    not sure how this would work in america though  in terms of health care  you d probably have to put in some additional hours  at your own pace without pressure and get private health insurance    anyway  interested to hear your thoughts ,nkau3i

563,Is there an escape?,currently live in the us  i have a college degree but i'm working at a company trying to build up hours to apply to grad school with experience    i work 40 hours a week  but my schedule isn't set due to the nature of my work  i finally got a set schedule and am working out the kinks of it  i switched from 8 5 hour days to 10 5 hour days also so i would get more full days off  nothing has made me less miserable yet  i think working 10 5 hour days actually made me more miserable because i have even less time in the day and the three days off is only nice when i have them all stacked in a row  however  i spend all that time dreading the last day off and trying to recover from my long work week  the job itself isn't bad  it can be busy at times  but my coworkers are great  some days i literally just sit around and do almost nothing all day and sometimes i even leave significantly early enough while still getting paid  i only make  16 an hour but the job is extremely temporary until i manage to get into grad school  however  i dread of resuming 40 hour weeks after grad school  i dread of not having enough money to take care of my kids or take care of myself when i get older if i don't grind on a 40 hour work week now and waste my youth on working  i'm also afraid that all this grinding wouldn't even pay off in the end  read the end game by corey abramson  i'm afraid of the alienation that comes with working 40 hours a week  i barely see my old friends now and we're drifting apart    is there any way out that doesn't involve exploiting other people  is there any way i can just work 20 hours a week and not worry about the future  i want community and i want time to experience the world and i want to be comfortable and healthy and have access to basic resources such as decent healthcare in my old age     my friends are convinced the only way we could make this happen is by going off grid in a community or exploiting others via becoming a landlord or dealing in stocks and crypto  i could be fine with living off grid with friends and family but the other options aren't ideal to me ,nkyb1w

623,I'm writing a book about my corporate experiences,the title says it all  i'm writing a book about my experiences in corporate life and bullshit work  of which i have been part for many years now  i'm not going to post everything i have  but i'd like to get some feedback  and hopefully at least brighten your day   i'm actually not going for a snarky tone  this is just an account of my experiences  so i'm just writing about what happened and what was going through my mind  i've had some people read these  and they think they're somewhat funny  but i'm honestly not even going for funny    anyway  here are drafts of two chapters  not in chronological order  i have about 7 chapters so far in various states of completeness  and an outline for about two dozen chapters  i don't think i will ever run out of material  although for now  i've got to keep it vague enough so that i can't be identified because  obviously  i don't want to lose my job    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------   being a pro   next up was a real career move  i got hired at a major professional services company  i figured that maybe in this place they'll have me do all the buzzword stuff that i learned to do in college and which you hear a lot about in corporate fluff and jargon  now it was time to apply complicated code and higher mathematics and anything you could dream of and i'd make a name for myself and reap the rewards   after all  that's what i sold myself with in the job interview   what follows is a true account of my experience in a major professional services firm that charges ridiculous fees from clients in order to  unlock  all kinds of value   i was placed into a function that was to provide an it service for a client  when i got in  the system that was in place was such that a manager was taking requirements from a client  but because that manager was a foreigner  one of the countries where basically all it gets outsourced  he couldn't read the requirements because the client was promised service in their native language  even though all parties involved in this service on both ours and the client side spoke english   so since the requirements were delivered in a language he didn't understand  he had to forward the requirements to a translation service that was located in yet another country  this translation service had no technical knowledge  so obviously all technical terms weren't translated very well  add to that  the translated document was incredibly messy and basically every word in the original language was followed by an english translation of that word in a different font color   few people can say they've read a document where every other word is in english and every other word is in another language  i've read these and was paid to read them   so this manager got his translated document and sent it to a team of  software developers in his native country  who obviously had no clue what they were supposed to do because these requirements were not only in a messy document  they were translated in a confusing manner  the  developers couldn't get to work because first they had to come up with an estimate of how long it'll take to do the job  often this process took longer than the actual job and was also included in the estimate  so even if the client didn't approve of the work estimate  the client  was charged for just being provided with the estimate   the client was obviously unhappy with this situation and the professional services company's management was tired of the complaints  so they made the only decision they could come up with    this was obviously a resource issue and the solution to resource issues is to allocate more resources to it   so they threw me at the problem  now  you might think  as i did  that since i could do some programming and spoke both english and the client's preferred language  and since i had previous experience from dealing with requirements  that it would only make sense we just have me take the  requirements  do the necessary coding and that'd be it  no need to throw all these people at the problem   if you'd think that  you'd be wrong  the client wanted to interface with someone who could speak the language  but everything else had to be in english because the developers and their manager only spoke english   so instead of the client sending the requirements document in english  they continued to send it in their language  now  you might think that since i had the necessary technical expertise  i could then translate the  document   again  you'd be wrong  my job was to forward this document to the translation service  when i asked why i couldn't just translate the document myself  i was told i'm too busy   now  because my job was obviously not managerial in nature and the developers had their own manager  i obviously needed a manager of my own  so the setup was 7 people allocated to this process that i could have done on my own in a fraction of the time and frustration that everyone was subjected to  two of those seven people were managers  4 were  software developers and then there was me who  again  could do the entire thing on my own if i were allowed to   now  this overly complicated process was allowed to continue  and the managers wound up only making powerpoint presentations about who's fault  it is that everything is a mess  they never blamed me  i mean  they were good managers in that sense  but i found it really strange anyway    so the managers spent all day every day writing up powerpoint slides of recorded phone call transcripts to shift the blame from us to the client    premium customer service right there    it's also sort of funny that typing up phone call transcripts into a powerpoint with the singular purpose of blaming the client for everything that went wrong was also work that was charged to the client   i also need to point out that the service we were providing was incredibly mundane in nature  it wasn't critical at all and often served no real purpose  the most interesting tasks that came up in it were  deemed too complex  meaning the work estimates were insane and so the client  declined to have them done  citing that it's too expensive   i couldn't help but agree   i still had no idea what my job really was  i didn't really do anything  besides forward emails  i even stopped answering calls at one point and asked everyone to submit their requests in writing for  auditability  i often disappeared for days because i went out to party and binge drink  no one noticed my absence   i didn't stick around for too long because this wasn't a healthy place  for me  every time i had a suggestion about how stupid the whole setup is  i was told i was too busy to think about things like that and that i should get back to work  whatever that was supposed to be    amp x200b    ----------------------------------------------------------------   foot in the door   when i was about 18 or 19 and wasn't enrolled in college yet  i was forced to go looking for a job  i remember walking into an interview at a temp agency since i was what people would call  unskilled   i figured the interview would just be a formality  but it really wasn't  apparently getting a job at a warehouse lifting boxes would really require a thorough vetting of my interests and career aspirations    so i walk into the temp agency office  and i was greeted by two twenty-something pantsuit-wearing hr aces and asked to step into a tiny room  i hadn't really been in a job interview before  nor was i prepared for one now  so obviously i had no idea what to expect  so i sat down in an armchair that was so deep my feet almost dangled in the air  but i maintained my composure in what seemed at the time like a highly skewed power dynamic     amp x200b    what is your name    - sir galahad    what is your favourite color    - blue  no wait    amp x200b   after apparently making sure i was indeed a teenager looking for a job at a warehouse  a position they themselves had posted online  they started asking me questions that to this day seem rather odd     amp x200b    gt why do you want to work at this warehouse we're staffing for    - because i need the job  well  that was my first reaction  but i thought that that would be too crass  these people are smart and they probably want to hear a smart answer    - well i'm looking for an opportunity to apply myself  i think i would be a perfect match for this warehouse   i nailed it  that must have been what they were looking for  although i really felt like an idiot  all i need is a job to keep me occupied for the next couple of months and then i can go to college  they had to have known this  so why were we pretending this was anything else     amp x200b    gt where do you see yourself in 5 years   my world stopped for a minute instant as a part of my soul died     - well probably at that fucking warehouse  then    amp x200b   i didn't land the job     amp x200b   luckily  temp agencies are a dime a dozen  so eventually i found one that staffed people to all kinds of call centers and office mailrooms and front desks  that's what i did for a while  answered phones and sat at the front desk of various offices  it wasn't very hard  but apparently a lot of these companies thought i did a good job of it  although i have no idea how you could measure performance in relation to someone else in a job like that   now  these were oddjobs for the most part  but eventually i got a step up to do data entry  which was a 30  salary bump compared to the mailroom  and i felt like i'd won the fucking lottery   data entry was just that  i was handed a piece of paper with product codes and names on it  and my job was to type them on a computer  that's it  it's not hard to get it right once you develop some muscle memory on the numpad  so i was really good at it    so one time i was handed a piece of paper that would get printed out as a bill of lading or something like that  the problem with this was that the data to be entered was too long to fit into the fields the software could handle  so i had to truncate or abbreviate the data  i was told not to  that it wasn't allowed  but obviously  how else could it possibly be done    so i did it anyway and it didn't matter one bit    now  while working in data entry  of which i was very proud  since none of my friends had a  cushy  office job  i would often run out of things to do  so naturally i found my boss and asked her if they had something for me to do because i was done with my work  sometimes she had an incredulous look on her face   could it be possible it's done that fast  so naturally i was asked to redo the work since i must have made a mistake if it was over so soon  i redid everything and about 20 minutes later i found my boss again and said i've now done this mundane task twice  but since they'd hired me for the day  i was told i could ask around the office if anyone else had something for me to do    i was very proud of course to be so efficient that now i could learn about other things that go on in the office  but it was very rare that anyone ever had anything for me  and my asking around was considered something of a nuisance since i would interrupt them while they were doing all kinds of important things   as much as it sounds like a caricature at this point  i was once asked to do  some filing  yes  there is always  filing  to do  even if everything is already filed - you can always redo the filing  so i did  and when that was done  i had absolutely nothing to do  sometimes i would redo some data entry i had already done because otherwise i'd just have to wait out the clock  i had indeed sold my time so they can do with me what they like  even if it is just sit around and wait to go home    so this job was  about 30  bullshit  now that i write this  i see why it paid 30  better than what i had previously made    perhaps i might be onto something ,nlcy7v

626,Surprised by what I found in this sub,i guess i didn t dig deep enough through the archives  but from the bio i was expecting some kind of revolutionary insight into escaping the rate race  instead  all i see are memes  most of them i like  and just constant streams of people bitching about their jobs  even before they have started them in some cases   that is probably to be expected given the name of the sub  but i feel like i was made to expect some positivity and guiding light  i ve watched a couple of the videos from the links supplied and enjoyed them  but the sub itself is not so inspiring or revolutionary    i agree that big business is corrupt and workers should be paid more  and have better conditions  and everything else that the rest of the people here want  but i m prepared to put my mind to trying to make things better for myself rather than just complaining and expecting everything to fix itself    i m a proponent of fire and believe wholeheartedly in the principles of gaining your independence from employment and being the master of your own destiny  now  there s more ways to skin that cat than just fire  and that s what i had hoped to learn here    downvote me  and throw insults if it makes you feel better  but unfortunately the only person who is gonna be able to make a difference is you  it s probably not gonna matter who you vote for  or how much you protest  get yourself and some likeminded comrades together and put your heads together to make it better rather than suffer in isolation ,nkws3g

655,I never thought merchandising would be easy but I didn't think it was this hard either....,i started merchandising for pepsi back in december and it was ok for the most part  i was part time up until about march  i believe  then i got full time  honestly  i just don't want to be a merchandiser anymore it sucks   i genuinely didn't mind the physical aspect of it  but when you're busting your ass just to keep yourself on time for the next store  day by day  week by week  it starts taking a toll on you  i thought it'd be nice way to keep active  i've suffered from being overweight my whole life and that's caused severe depression and anxiety in me and i feel like this job is just making it worse   every store i've worked  i've seen coke  7-up and frito lay with multiple people servicing the 2 big stores in our schedules  walmart and krogers  i've also seen multiple merchandisers for said companies servicing smaller  easier stores  but for some reason at pepsi  we're on our own and when i was in training  i was taught to not be the guy asking for help all the time  as if having help is some for of taboo  and yet  as a part time  i was bouncing around various stores and would occasionally help out a full timer maybe once a week and the stores would look nicer and be done quicker because of it  i just don't understand why we can't have at least 2 people per route    amp x200b   my start time is 5 30  i had a walmart first and the load didn't get there until 8 30  i asked for help to keep myself on schedule and there was literally nobody available to help until 1 00 pm at best  so i busted out 7 pallets by 12 00 pm  essentially sprinting and burning myself out before my other stores  and even by then  i still had several carts of front cooler single serve items that could've gone out but i ended up doing the bare minimum and leaving because i needed to get to my next store to work the load  and not that it was his fault because he had his own loads to deal with but my help didn't really get there until 2 30 when i was almost done with the 2nd store and from then on we did the last 2 together which went quickly because we were together  but i didn't get home until 4 30 that day  and that's slowly becoming a normal thing now    meanwhile  on my days off  when i make time to get groceries  i'll see multiple sales reps across the stores working it all together  i just hate this no help attitude for the merchandisers  you can work 7-12 pallets on your own and leave one case or forget one little shelf space or one little cooler and the sales reps will make you feel like the worst person because of it   i don't think i can handle it anymore  the pay and the benefits don't even feel worth it because of this stress i'm feeling but what else am i going to do  i kind of trapped myself  thinking this would be a simple enough job to just stock shelves but there's just a crap ton of obstacles that will get in your way in the process and its not an enjoyable experience  i've spent my whole life trying to figure out what i want to do with the rest of it but i genuinely don't know ,nj7nii
656,What pushed you into an antiwork stance?,my story of how my mindset changed is kinda long  like most of us i was conditioned from q young age into thinking i wanted a dream career and all that  when i was in college i started to have my doubts after watching friends graduate with good degrees and still work minimum wage jobs while swallowed by debt  but i didn't fully switch until i experienced the worse year and a half of my life    i had 3 family members pass all within a year and a half of eachother  the first in december of 2018  i never got to say goodbye  i saw her after the fact and i was just devastated  as i held her cold hand  it struck me then that i had missed out on my only opportunity to say goodbye because i'd been at work for a job that didn't care about me    i told them i would need her funeral off  they told me i would work when they needed me and they couldn't give me the day off  and i told them i quit  i wasn't going to let them take this from me also  i ended up having a breakdown a month after this  and dropped out of my second year of college and moved home with my parents   i didn't even really have time to recover before the next death occurred in december 2019  by then i had another minimum wage job  i called out the day it happened  and instead of being told   oh i'm sorry  of course  take this time  i was told   are you sure you can't come in  if the person has already passed  what good will you do for them now  i was in shock and ignored this  as it seemed like the least of my problems at the time as my world crashed down around me for the second time in one year    the third death occurred in april of 2020  i called work sobbing telling them i couldn't come in as i was on my way to the hospital to say goodbye  i received major attitude on the other line and was actually hung up on    i received the worst treatment of my life while i was at my most vulnerable from these managers  it rocked my worldview and other than the shit wages  totally pushed me into being antiwork  the shit treatment  unsafe conditions  and poor pay of working on the front lines during the thick of the covid outbreak only set my stance in stone    so  if you've made it this far  thank you  and i would love to hear your own stories of what pushed you into the antiwork mindset as well ,nja0di

667,What's the plan?,i  like many other subredditors  am tired of the incessant tyrannical expectations put upon the modern worker  i could go on for days about the injustices i experience in my place of employment  i want to democratize the workplace  i want technology to absorb the bulk of our efforts  i want to feel valued as a human being instead of being valued for what i can contribute to a corporation   that said  i feel stuck and overwhelmed over what the anti-work community's next move should be  i sympathize with almost every post here  but i see far more griping than i see action plans  i don't have a plan myself  but i'm desperate to come across some insight that might propel our sentiments into actual change   does anybody have or belong to a group or network that could be useful to someone who wants to actively participate in the destruction of today's wage slavery  i need to actually do something about these injustices  i work in the southeastern us  where unions are practically unheard of and adamantly ridiculed when they are discussed  i've had the same job for more than five years  no pay increase  no sick days  never got more than 80 hours vacation per year  no air conditioning despite the 100 degree  high humidity summers  i could bash my employer and the entire job market for days  but i need something more tangible to lean on   what is someone like myself to do in this situation  are there any groups that you're aware of that are seeking to bring about real change in the workplace  who might i get in touch with to get the ball rolling  i have thought about starting a union at my current place of employment  but i worry about the repercussions  that  coupled with the fact that nobody around here even knows the first thing about what a union is  are highly deincentivising prospects  any feedback would be appreciated  i don't understand how the situation got to be this bad and i'm shocked at those around me who have been indoctrinated into thinking this is normal ,njpysh
668,Post Pandemic anxiety,i got laid off at the start of the pandemic and have been living off unemployment since then  the problem is i know that the economy took a toll on businesses so they either cut out a lot ofimaginary jobs to say they were job creators or whatever and the rest of the work from home people literally proved that location doesnt matter so once they realize that they can outsource more jobs to slave wage countries even more people will be applying for the few jobs im actually qualified to do  i have a hard time working in general since i have severe anxiety and depression so while i know i technically qualify for disability  chances are because of my age i wont be getting enough to live on  even with my already limited spending  and i'm unsure of what my other options are  im young so i dont have a ton of savings either so im not entirely sure what to do since we appear to be opening back up and a  ok pandemic over go back to consoom  is coming and i feel really stuck and the whole thing gives me anxiety on top of my anxiety ,njqfca

694,I’m a Health Care Worker who burned out during the pandemic.,i m not sure where else to post this essay  and i m not even sure  why  i m posting it  i guess r antiwork seems like the kind of place where my frustration and disillusionment will be understood  and if it doesn t resonate with you  that s okay  it still feels good to get it off my chest               i m a support worker  and i worked for a well-known organization that helps people with a range of disabilities  i loved my job  i made strong connections with the people i supported  got along wonderfully with my coworkers  and felt respected and valued by my supervisor  it was the first job i had that didn t feel like  work  i never had to drag myself to the office  or motivate myself like in some other jobs  the deep sense of meaning i derived from supporting people helped fuel me through the pandemic for more than a year  while many others were at home - understandably avoiding the virus and doing their part to minimize the spread - my coworkers and i were sweating through our masks and gambling with our health for the greater good of the residents we often grew to love  we left our homes and entered a community that harboured an invisible virus  and many of us did it for less than  600 a week         but as much as we deserved better pay  it was never about the money  i was driven by the people who appreciated me  and the powerful connections made by stepping into the lives of people in true need  but nothing can polish the fact that the life of a psw is haunted by part time and casual positions  full-time hours are rare and coveted roles  often going to those who have seniority  companies and organizations keep costs low by creating only a small handful of 40 hour work weeks  and the rest are forced to work two jobs  or scramble to snatch any crumbs that might fall off the table when someone calls in sick  it sometimes felt demeaning - i can t deny it  you can work for  years  and still only be handed 25 - 30 hours a week  and the pay  nothing to write home about  the job involves monitoring the health of vulnerable people with sometimes complex medical conditions  and can require quick thinking and sound judgement to save the life of someone in medical crisis  and yet i was paid only  18 an hour to sometimes be the only guardian of more than 10 souls some in wheelchairs  some unable to see or easily communicate their needs   18 to be willing and able to respond to what can sometimes seem like a galaxy of demands   18 to potentially save a life  but i did it   we  did it  everyday thousands of psw s just like us are making similar sacrifices and are being rewarded with crummy pay and barely enough hours to survive  i m a 41 year old man  and my dad helps me with rent because the organization i work for doesn t provide a living wage  and i still showed up  until eventually the grind and sacrifice  the poor wages and measly hours  they began to pollute my appreciation for the job  they tainted my desire to come to work each morning  the notion that i was making these sacrifices for an organization that wouldn t give me livable pay and hours began to erode my sense of belonging and soon my motivation suffered  too  the job no longer enticed me in a way that made a day that starts at 5am tolerable  i needed more sleep  cared less about myself and my life in general  and felt like i was sleepwalking through my days off because i was too preoccupied with the next strenuous shift to really enjoy my free time         and throughout this questionable journey  i was continuously receiving tone-deaf emails from head office reminding me of the importance of self-care  i was told to sleep well  exercise  and meditate to help off-set the horrible pay and part time hours i was being handed by the authors of these emails  they had the nerve to preach the prudence of mindfulness and sleep-hygiene to the same people whose mental health their policies and treatment were actively destroying  the irony sometimes sickened me  it all became too much one day  and after a particularly nasty and abusive experience at the hands of a new resident  i called my supervisor and calmly told her that she needed to come in and cover for me because i was done  i had enough  being kind and thoughtful  she discouraged me from officially quitting and asked me to take some time off to catch my breath  i agreed  and went home to lick my wounds  after a few days of rest i felt more focused  stronger  ready to possibly come back to work in a diminished role - ideally with less hours so i could ease myself back into work  and emerge successfully from my burn-out  front office even reached out to me  requesting that i detail the incident in writing and explain why i left the way i did  this person also expressed concern for my mental well-being  which was the first time anyone had personally addressed the importance of my state of mind  i was hopeful  for a moment i felt protected and valued by my employer  but that didn t last         after writing an email explaining what happened  and why i left after being verbally abused  i received a call from someone at hr who explained she wanted to hear  my side of things  i talked at length about the stress  the low pay  the bad hours  and how being bullied by a resident just added more weight to a structure that was already overloaded  she feigned sympathy  she thanked me for my honesty  and promised to call me the next day to discuss my possible and gradual return to work  the next day my phone never rang  by 5 30 that night my instinct told me the call was never coming  so i checked my email and there it was  they informed me i was no longer welcome at the office  and that they wished me good luck in my future  after all their song and dance about the importance of mental health  all the patronizing seminars and workshops they encouraged me to participate in  after all my sacrifice despite poor pay and rotten hours  they just tossed me aside when i finally burned out  and they weren t even decent enough to do it over the phone  i had to read it in email         i learned a painful and bitter lesson that when push comes to shove  they don t care about me  since then i ve strongly considered leaving the field  and finding a job with more pay and less sacrifice  i want to find an employer who proves they value me through real action and reward  instead of coaching me with hallow emails that lie about how concerned and focused they are on the well-being of their staff  i haven t decided yet if i ll leave my career behind  but if i do it will be a bitter break-up   i will always feel the loss of the connection to those that support work bonded me to  care-workers deserve real pay  full time hours  and the true respect and support of head office  anything less forces even the best workers to seek better employment elsewhere  simple as that  and you know what really annoys me  a month after being let go  i m still getting those same tone-deaf emails telling me to eat right and go to bed at the same time  every night ,njxspi
695,Here's my antiwork plan,i agree with the antiwork movement  i hate working too but we still have bills to pay   so i've been trying to get my bills lower so i don't have to work as much  all my bills right now are about 900 us  that includes a 336 dollar mortgage payment and a 262 dollar car payment  i live in rural nc  after 5 years my car will be paid off and my bills will drop to about 600  after the house is paid off  it'll drop to less than 300  some of that 300 is food  water  and electricity all things i can reduce  i thought about growing my own food and selling what i can't eat  collecting rainwater for bathing and drinking  getting solar panels  etc  my electric bill last month was 37 dollars so i wouldn't need a big system   if i can grow enough food  i might be able to sell the surplus and make enough to cover my expenses  or save up enough where i can make most of that in interest  then i could give the idea of having to work the middle finger  in the worse case  i'd have to work but getting 300 a month would be pretty damn easy  if 15 hr becomes the law  i could work anywhere and make enough to cover my monthly bills every 2 5 days  there's 260 business days in a year so after just 1 year  i'd have 104 months  8 66 years  worth of savings  not including taxes  i can't wait,nj7wbk

714,Why employers don't care about loyalty anymore.,company loyalty is a relic from the dinosaur age when people would spend 40 years working at the same factory and retire with a full pension  today what businesses use is the mcdonalds model of staff turnover    they will take a new recruit and give them on the job training  after a few weeks the new hire will be basically fully trained  the total cost of training a new hire is therefore equivalent to maybe 2-4 weeks of entry level pay  so let's just say the cost of training a new hire is  2000 as an example    the cost of a long term employee receiving a yearly 3  raise must be calculated  after only 2-3 years it will cost the company more to retain loyal workers than to train entry level staff  due to compounding interest  also the loyal employee will receive more entitlements like vacation pay  sick leave  etc   therefore it's a simple mathematical equation as to why companies don't want loyalty anymore   x   the base entry level wage  y   the cost of training  z   years of employment    the value of y x times 1 03 z  is greater than the value of x y after z amount of years    it is therefore cheaper to have high staff turnover than to retain long term employees ,njmf74

787,I feel as though I’m brainwashed.,idk i was thinking how when i started my job a year back  i kind of didn t care about work ethic and i didn t understand or get why people yelled at me  but after a year after making some friends at work  and working and shit the way i think is different  like i think i wasn t huge on work ethic until like 6 7 months ago this whole dramatic thing happened with the  coworker friend  betraying my trust and idk me learning that a lot of drama has happened around this  friend  and then like bonding more with these work friends i made and like i think then they corrupted me  like not even meaning to but just this ex friend that i lost trust and respect for did some terrible stuff imo  but the thing they planet in my brain was that she was a bad person cause she didn t have work ethic    and then my thoughts became different idk i used to always view  lazy  workers  as understandable cause idk i always think i m lazy personally  i still do  but idk i found these workers other people considered  lazy  started bothering me more after that  and now i feel idk i think in a more capitalist mindset  and i know i still have my empathy and generally i try to relate to everyone  and i have an understanding for lazy workers  though i just feel some part of me has changed and i m slowly being turned by society into staying in this weird capitalist mindset of being like some lower class dude that values work ethic all s like alot of my friends are  i feel like i m being molded into something by society and i m not a fan of it ,nifb1a

842,Genuinely confused about this sub,hey y all i don t wanna sound disrespectful but what is the point of this subreddit  are y all against working altogether  or are you just against working for another man and his goals  i m genuinely confused because the whole statement of the idea sounds lazy and irresponsible  to me at least  i think about it like this  there are people in this country who break into houses for a living  is that not a form of work  because to me that s more respectable than procrastinating or making up a bunch of ideological bs so you don t have to deal with your problems  because you need money to do that  my final question is this  if the entire definition of work is the effort expended getting from point a to point b  finishing a task  so if your against work altogether wouldn t that mean your against getting anything done  because the whole idea of work is a pretty harmonious concept the boss has a business running but needs more hands to keep growing his profit  so he pays you to work for him  you may not be accomplishing anything for yourself but at least your getting a steady flow of money for yourself and it s not like your a slave  if you have something better to do you can do it  you may be fired  but you always had the option to quit  and it was your choice to get a job in the first place  i have a problem with the anti work shit because personally i have no living relatives and i come from pretty humble beginnings  so all i can do is work  i could always live off government money but i refuse to let myself turn into a nobody who lives for absolutely nothing  i can only stand on my own ten toes and i don t have anyone to fall back on so my job is a very important part of my life and i always work harder than the next guy because i believe thats the key to prosperity  if you were in the wild  do you think you could still survive off of this anti work attitude  if you never make a dollar in your life and refuse to work you re only alive with a roof over your head and shoes on your feet because you have a safety net  anyways thanks for reading feel free to respond however you d like  ,nj2jb8

861,"The Small Agency I work for was sold after 2.5 year, now the new owner says I’m a new hire and don’t have banked PTO",hey all    not entirely sure this is allowed so delete if necessary but i kinda need somewhere to rant about some goings on in my life so please allow me to word vomit here    for context i am an insurance agent for a company you all would recognize  but for obvious reasons i won t mention by name  since september 2018 i ve been with a small agency for a while i loved it  but the last year has burnt me out  at our largest in my time here there were 3 regular agents and the agency owner who didn t do much in line of sales  but was obviously back up  before covid we lost one agent to being a stay at home parent  since covid hit i ve more or less been the only agent  we would take turns having one person in the office  but because i lived much closer to the agency than the owner and other agent  i was usually the one here  then in september 2020  the agency owner found out that due to an incident that occurred with an agent prior to me starting his license with the parent company was being non-renewed and he would be no longer allowed to represent the company from that point forward and would need to sell the agency  that left myself and one other agent as the sole team here  then in early november that agent tested positive for covid and it wrecked them and they started missing even more time than their already super part time schedule had them not in the office  leaving just me literally 98  of the time from november through now    as a result of the parent company s requirement that the agency be open like normal and me being essentially the only person at the agency still able to work i wasn t allowed to take my pto  i m already someone who doesn t take a ton of time off  to a fault  so it wasn t a huge deal but it all has been really taking a mental toll on me and put me in a pretty dark place mentally  during all this i ve also been taking online courses for coding software development to hopefully change careers soon and even had to take a leave of absence from that because of how bad things got mentally  that class is finally coming to an end  but i don t feel particularly prepared for the job search    anyway  i was talking to my partner last night about how burnt out mentally i feel and they encouraged me to take some pto now that the agency has been sold and starting in june there will be other agents  i put in a request for that starting with 3 hours in the afternoon about 2 weeks from now for a doctors appointment regarding my mental health and was denied because  i m a new hire  and apparently i forfeited all my accrued pto when the agency was sold so i won t get pto for 90 days and even then it s 2 hours per pay period and nothing significant until my 1 year anniversary  apparently now in may  i understand it s technically a different agency with the new owners but i was told that it would all be the same    i m honestly at my breaking point and have no idea what to do now  i m not really looking for answers i guess  but just need to vent and someone to tell me if i m being crazy for being angry and near tears over it or if it s even a little justified    thanks for allowing me to get this all out  whether you read or not  and i hope all is well for the rest of you all    also  we don t have an hr department because we re so small so the only persons in the office are myself  the owner  and the office manager  out of location as she works at one of the other agencies the new owner owns and is the one that said they see me as a new hire ,nh38xd

887,I finally snapped.,i didn t snap in the sense that i got angry with someone  but i had no choice but to log off from my laptop at lunch time today    i m a contracted employee at a company i ve been working at since the beginning of the year  i ve been on the usual 5 day a week 40 hour grind like most of you  but something that has been killing me lately is that i don t feel appreciated    i would like to be paid to have one day off  since i graduated from college in 2019  i ve only had contract to hire type jobs  i know i know  you guys might be thinking  why don t you apply to a job with benefits   i just find that the current corporate landscape is incredibly stressful  the application process the interview process several rounds of interviews  i can t do that to myself just to have a job that sucks  i m on the autism spectrum so it would be really hard to sell my personality to prospective employers  i have a fear of rejection and my self esteem is really low   i ve been working my ass off since i ve been hired  my contract is for 1 year  and i was told during my phone interview that there was no potential for me to become a permanent employee    i told my boss at lunch today that i was really struggling with my mental health and that i d be taking the rest of the day off  at the end of it i gave a disclaimer not to worry  as i d only be giving myself credit for 3 hours today on my timesheet  if she really cared about me as a team member  i believe she should have immediately offered to pay me for the full day  instead  all she said was  take care   even if i had benefits  i wouldn t feel fulfilled by work  every occupation out there  i d be looking at myself as a cog in a machine  a very replaceable one at that  if i dropped dead tomorrow  the people i work with would shrug it off like i never even existed   outside of work  i have nothing  i have a good group of friends  i was also raised well  but this fact doesn t give my life any meaning  i m an antinatalist because i don t believe all the suffering we have to endure is worth the little freedom that we have    for some reason  it costs money to exist  if you want to have the privilege to live on this earth you need to work  the way people earn money is from their employer  so we re all dependent on our employers to put food on our table  sure we re  earning an income  but that is all arbitrary  who says that being good at microsoft excel is a useful skill in order for the world to function   that is all i have to say  if you read the entirety of this post  thank you  i would be appreciative of any comments this post gets ,nhys8l

907,About the unemployment during Covid,i used to think it was solely because of unemployment benefits  and while that may partially be true- there is another aspect we are forgetting    people were inside for nearly a year- and many most likely picked up new hobbies and used that time to educate themselves on certain skills  people finally realized their worth and said screw working for a corporation making bad money  and decided to pursue their own dreams  they started selling that product on ebay  etsy  amazon etc  and with how connected we are on the worldwide web  it's not hard to put your business out there ,nhf4ek

910,"""assessments"" for applications are one of the stupidest things to become commonplace.",i just went in to a  job fair  at sam's club  what was it  well  all i actually ended up doing was an assessment on a tablet they have me  i have always been terrible at them - i try to answer like  corporate  would want me to  but somehow i still struggle  i was told right after that i failed the assessment and had to wait 6 months to repapply   the funny part  the listing for the job fair on indeed literally says  hiring is a human process  and they would like to meet you to see if you re a fit  yet they base your employment entirely off of an assessment that you take  well i was there  someone else was literally hired on the spot immediately after the assessment  that's all it's based on    it's entirely useless and does nothing to tell the employer how good of an employee you are  or how good a fit for the job  i kind of sped through the assessment because i didn't believe it would be the only thing they would consider for an offer  i just thought they needed a proper application in the system first    pretty much every major company has them for applications  it's rediculous  makes applying extremely annoying  and is nothing but a time waste  for both applicants and employers  they are hiring for literally every position  and especially now i know they need meat bags to work there ,nh6vt2

922,Antiwork Confessional,what have you done at work that would be frowned on or considered grounds for dismissal  this week i finally said fuck it  i do what i want even while at work  we have a ban on even non thc cbd laced soda  i like the soothing effect it has on my psyche and body so i usually drink one in the evenings  it's been super stressful at work and i needed something to calm down a bit  so two days ago i bought a non thc cbd soda poured it in my water bottle and drank it  the afternoon went sooo much better  i had to tell a woman she had end stage cancer  and listened to her cry for 20 minutes  shouldn't even be my job but management made me do it  and didn't even cry myself  which since there was four more hours to go to my shift was a good thing    yesterday was my friday  when i managed a team   fridays were my out of office lunch day and i would treat myself to a glass of wine  that was an hour long break so i could have a nice leisurely lunch and really enjoy a good lunch  now if i'm lucky i get a 30 minute lunch  so i decided on the last shift of the week i'm having a a wine spritzer on my 30 minute unpaid break  i don't do direct patient care  and the spritzer i chose has 6  abv so it's not like i'm drunk or anything  just slightly more relaxed and happy  yesterday afternoon went so much better moodwise for me   i also use company stamps to mail my personal stuff which is like once a month if that  and make the company buy me the really good  gel pens at 6 for twenty bucks and then take half of them home   what  might get me fired  but makes the work hellscape bearable do you all do ,nhrt10

935,"Nixon Shock, Floating Fiat Currency, and Magical Persuasion?",back in 1971  richard nixon declared the us dollar to no longer be backed by gold  rendering our paper money intrinsically valueless  it's 2021 and the capitalist world is still participating in fiat currencies  nixon had claimed this would be a temporary action  gold never came back into the usd   magocracy - a magocracy is a government hierarchy with the highest and main authority being one or many practitioner s  of magic   i am extremely anti-money  the way that capitalism actually fetishizes numbers scares the fuck out of me  i am also extremely unhappy how there is no consent around money  like i hate having to carry it  i hate having to care about it  i hate it having power over me  i have slept with many people that i didn't want to  just to acquire money   there is already a  qualitative  aspect of having our labor exploited for the benefits of other  but lets make it worse  lets add fucking numbers  lets actually create a  quantitative  representation of the exploitation and the profits   i feel like the modern governments of today have gotten too powerful and there is no going back  people have literally been using imaginary money for 50 years  i know this could be said about gold  amp  silver  but those materials do actually have value  the fact that the world and society has been operating like this scares me  i also do understand that numbers were still fetishized during gold  amp  silver days  but there was still a physical representation of wealth  the fiat currency is the pinnacle point of late stage capitalism   back to my reference to magocracy  if a capitalist society has been using imaginary money for 50 years then i swear  numbers must have a magical fucking power to our psyche  oppressors create such a desperate nature among the masses  that all they have to do is say a number during their speeches and the crowd will cheer  cheering for imaginary numbers   i use  fake money  to buy bread from the store   millions of young children being taught the wrong definition of currency everyday   people begging for monopoly money on the streets   assassins ending lives just to receive numeral in-scripted paper   i do not want to sound anti-socialist at all but i have read about capital realism and the thought of capitalism having an  un-escapable  aspect within it  i don't want to say human nature is capitalistic because that is not my message  but what if literal numerical symbols have an actual psychological affect among civilized humans  is that what a civilized human being is  one who is controlled by numbers   have you ever tore a dollar bill apart  break the spell once in a while ,nhcwug

964,Arbitrary Laws Make Employment Impossible,right now i am doing work for a prominent member of the furry community to develop a new platform for the furry community that would be comparable to other established websites such as furaffinity or inkbunny  both based in the usa  but with a slick modern design and better security features than either site currently provides   both my client and i are based in canada and after a consultation with a lawyer the future of the project is on rather shaky ground as the laws in canada around developing social media websites are far more strict and forbearing than in the us  we don't have the same section 230 provisions that the united states has protecting social media platforms  or they don't translate over very well when being allied to canadian operated businesses  given that the site would contain adult content that is sexually explicit  given the fandom the website is being developed for  which is a whole other can of worms and given the new bill c-10 going through canadian courts that would drastically limit how the internet operates here in canada its entirely possible we might not even be able to release   currently the work i've done is voluntary unpaid employment but it has the promise of pay with various perks and subscription models  ect  once launched  i haven't made a dime yet  right now the government of canada  as well as every other government around the world  is going through a crisis of unemployment  yet they have arbitrary rules and laws on the book that make it virtually impossible for someone such as my client to register a legitimate business that could provide people such as myself and the 10 or so other talented developers working with me gainful employment  if the government prevents us from finishing the website because of stupid laws then i will pledge to never work for anyone ever again  i will spend the rest of my life leaching off the tax payer dollar in whatever form that may be given welfare  crb  or universal basic income  sorry not sorry i'm working for free no more ,nhmw57

966,2 types of passive crypto mining I've found you can use on your phone,   i've been looking at ways to generate passive crypto long term without a rig and stumbled on 2 ways you can mine crypto from your phone without consuming data or battery power  both apps are on google play and iphone store   one is an app called kinfit  it tracks your steps and rewards you in crypto  it syncs to your phones 'fitness app' and is honestly kind of fun and motivating  not much  but its passive and i'm sure it adds up if the app is downloaded for a year or so  i walk alot for work  so i figured why not   the second is called pi network  this one is cool since its still in early release and invite only  all you have to do is check the app once a day to prove you're not a bot  this one is even more passive since you dont even have to walk to earn  the staff in the app is always very active as well to answer questions  if you're interested in the pi network  my invitation code is  slacklink   it has 255k 4 5 star reviews on google play store   cheers  happy mining ,nhz85r

I'll go first I guess.,this is basically just a venting post and i wanna hear about other people's experiences cus i think it will make me feel better lol anyway i was on unemployment due to covid and all that about 6 months ago i decided i wanted to get a job get out the house  huge  mistake  there were red flags all over looking back like how they only asked me q questions in the interview and hired me on the spot and various other things  i tool the job though and holy shit if you gave me a time machine the 1 thing i'd go back and change is taking this fricking job  the boss would tell people he was going to give them promotions if you did xy and z so people would bust their asses for a while and eventually nothing would happen  no matter how many times you asked they'd just put it off until you gave up  i believed them 3 times before i realized the manager will just say whatever to you to get you to work as well as possible  problem is just don't tell me i'm getting raises and promotions then i'm doing my job either way  90  of the employees talked shit about each other actually fuck that it was 100  and we all hated each other which made going into work worse than suicide seemed to be  i personally heard the boss talk shit about all of us there and his bosses and the company  he'd actually perpetuate fighting in the workplace and there was really no incentive to do better work than the bare minimum because you didn't know what was a lie or not or when you were going to get axed  eventually one day when i was there all my coworkers were talking shit  not specifically about me just about everyone in general  because that's usually all they did  after a meeting where they said the close was awful and if it looked like it again the whole night crews getting replaced i finally decided it was over i had enough i walked out and they told me to my face not to try for unemployment because it wouldn't work  the kicker of the story though  i can't go back on unemployment because i technically quit the job  getting a job has left me destitute if i would have just sat my ass at home i'd still be on unemployment for double the money i made at that shithole  fuck teriyaki madness it's a fake shell of a company worse than mcdonalds and fuck you chris your the worst manager i ever had you dumb fuck ,ngamer

1121,Why land and house packages are getting smaller and smaller...,hi reddit   i'm from australia and have been observing that over the years house and especially land sizes has dramatically been getting smaller and smaller    take for example a typical house back in the 60's was 700m2 squared   20mtrs x 35mtrs  you could fit a decent house and have a big back yard  over time the land sizes become even smaller    650m2  excellent back yard    600m2  nice back yard    550m2  good back yard    500m2  okay back yard    450m2  mediocre back yard    400m2  small strip yard    350m2  no back yard     300m2  nothing only back fence 1 or 2 mtr away    250m2  boxed in with neighbours fence    200m2  concrete to concrete    150m2 which is now the smallest   now it's nearly impossible to find anything that's 650m2  without having to pay for both kidneys  most houses now are only 350m2 as the standard    the issue is if you have a big back yard that's 650m2  you can ritually grow a garden full of veggies and at least 10 fruit tree's which will last you a life time  have a few chooks and you will constantly get egg's every week  meaning that each season you will always have a replenishment of fruit and vegetables all for free  you simply only need the seed and mother nature will do it's work for you    but if you limit societies land size technically you can't grow your own fruit's and veggies or raise chooks  the only way to obtain them is to buy it from the shops which are full of pesticides and all sorts of poison  which means you have to pay extra money for food which you could of grown yourself in your back yard for free   what if land size was never restricted but every one had big land sizes to grow their own fruit's and veggies   what would happen then  ,ng3xf1
1122,"If a few of my coworkers and I share the same or similar salaries, that doesn't mean I can pick up their workload on a whim just because we're short staffed",my official title is  office clerk  it's very bland and doesn't mean much on its own  but i do a lot of data entry  accounting and copywriting  i was initially supposed to just be a data entry clerk  but you know how things go  my work has doubled since and i do a lot more than that  i love it  even though i'm underpaid  and yes  i've tried to negociate it and they  respectfully  told me i should starve instead  it has its perks  we have another office clerk  but her work is completely separate  she handles a different part of accounting and deals with the main database in a different way  sorry for being vague  but i think it paints the picture well  we're also supposed to have a receptionist  but she quit about a month ago and hasn't been replaced since    the three of us are paid pretty much the same for the job that we do  but the work itself is not the same at all  the problem is that the second office clerk was hired very recently and i was expected to take on the workload before she could be fully trained  i said i would help her if needed  but i maintained that i wasn't going to do the work myself  it took a bit of back and forth  but they  finally   asked someone else  to do it and that person begrudgingly agreed  i've always made it very clear that i'm not a receptionist and i'm also not a stand-in  they still expected me to fill in the position of a receptionist temporarily while they looked for a new recruit    a lot of employers seem to use the excuse that employees are interchangeable  and disposable  when they're paid the same  we see it all the time  pretty much every workplace is short staffed  but that's okay because their skills are the same  so they can easily pick up someone else's workload if the position suddenly becomes vacant  they won't bother hiring someone else if these changes aren't noticeable    no  they'll wait until everyone is so incredibly overworked and exhausted that they quit and they'll ignore their complaints in the meantime  we all have the same value in their eyes  they only see what we were hired to do on paper and compare that with someone else's job description  it means that we can do the work of three people at once because we're qualified enough  even though it makes no fucking sense    hire more people for fuck's sake ,ng5w3a

1124,Shelter,in many posts on here people lament about low wages but i do not see posts asking what i believe is a question on the other side of the living is unaffordable coin    why is shelter so dear   it's a basic human need and in a lot of cases a basic business need yet it has been allowed to develop into some type of black hole sucking in everyone's finances around it      many people can't afford places to live so they live in vans     others who can can't afford to add to the economy because most of their money sans the necessities are sucked into their rent or mortgage   people starting businesses can't afford to pay good wages because so much of their money is being sucked into paying the rent on their shop    amp x200b   i honestly think until cost of shelter goes down by at least 60  it's always going to be hard ,ng28yq

1126,Amazon...,so i have a long history of job hunting  and i have easily applied to hundreds of jobs in my field   my spouse  who had just gotten an education in the same field  had her first interview    this was a supposedly large company that claimed they were always hiring and that all skill levels should apply  she told me about the interview  and it turned out they were super-picky  only people with so many years military experience coding css  css  for military work  seriously    she went on for thirty minutes about their hiring requirements  it was mentioned there were only two openings  but she should still apply more anyway  even though they wouldn't consider her  and it sounded like some super-small company that has zero clue what they're doing and only has a niche crowd they work for  they talked about how  you could get as many hours as you want   it was salaried  so not that it'd pay more    further  it was a group interview  generally only done when companies don't have anywhere near the personnel to interview anyone properly  and it was being done to a group of recent graduates with zero experience and he started going on about how much experience they needed  even further  one person in the group interview mentioned  if you only hire ex-military  doesn't that mean your diversity numbers are bad    the interviewer started blustering   no  we have a robust diversity policy in our contract  he refused to answer  anything  about their diversity numbers after that  when asked about advancement opportunities  he talked about the possibility of getting moved up in as soon as ten years  that's really bad  both for big and small companies  these were all traits that screamed a small niche company with a tight budget and having to watch every penny of income   so  curious what this amateurish startup would be  i asked what this company was   it was amazon ,nfock8

1132,I'm just so god damned tired. Always.,sorry it's not a meme  i've just been really feeling this more than usual lately and figured i could vent here with people who might be able to relate   i am now 30 years old  by all accounts  i'm a very successful person  i have a graduate degree  a well-paying job  a beautiful wife and a kid on the way  it's really hard for me to justify complaining about anything  but i'm going to   i'm so  fucking  tired  always  i have had a job in some capacity since i was 16 years old  waiting tables  washing dishes  scooping fucking ice cream  stupid mindless clerical work in some musty basement  wiping sweat off of gym equipment  and now  high stress  complex  white collar  professional bullshit that is every bit as exhausting and unfulfilling as all of that other stuff    i spent afternoons  weekends and holidays in high school and college sweating into an apron so some karen could get her sandwich  i sat at tables in windowless rooms in grad school studying and listening to lectures  only to head off to another windowless room after class let out to bang away at a keyboard for  10 an hour    in my professional life i have spent countless nights taking quick naps on the floor in my office to meet last minute deadlines  i've missed out on events with friends and milestones with family  and for what   i'm not rich  if hard work made you rich my father would be a billionaire by now  but nobody here is fooled by that  folk wisdom  anymore   i did what my parents told me  i worked hard  did well in school  signed the loan papers and kept plugging along until i  made it  but where exactly have i made it to  to a place where i have to continue slaving away to pay down the debt i took on for the privilege of slaving away in a suit instead of non-slip dockers    i don't spend frivolously  my car is 10 years old  the last item of clothing i bought for myself was a pair of running shoes so that i can take an hour a day to do the one thing that brings me some peace without destroying my knees  we cook all our meals at home and make our own coffee and i don't buy the newest phone every year  so where does all my money go   loans  insurance  exorbitant rent  groceries  utilities  gas  one bottle of whiskey a week because holy shit can i just have one tiny thing that isn't  good for me  but brings me a tiny scrap of enjoyment   plus  all that only takes into account the hours of my life that have bled away sitting at my desk  the work doesn't end there  the dishes and laundry need doing  the lawn needs mowing  the bathroom sink is clogged  the cars need washing and an oil change and probably brake pads  my wife needs attention and affection and my child will need even more  to top it all off i'm - unfortunately - a human being that needs to sleep every once in a while so i don't die    that's how i spend my  free time  the time i'm not chained to a desk working to earn enough money so that i'm allowed to continue existing  i spend that time doing work that i can't do while i'm at work    i'm not looking for advice or solutions  i've analyzed all this to death and i know that the only way out is through  i've had much darker moments in my life and like those  this too shall pass  there's just nobody in the world that i'm allowed to complain to because i've got it  so good  so i figured i would dump my frustrations on you folks in hopes that you're kind enough to listen  if you've made it this far  thanks for reading ,nffmf4
1133,"Not just anti-work, but anti-money",i think we should globally do away with money  currency  credit  or any other form of 'payment'  i'm no expert  but i feel like one of the biggest holdups on advancing technology is the prohibitive cost of r amp d  i think if we all gave up money  we could pretty quickly and easily achieve automation for all the lousy jobs that no one wants to do anyway  as well as most  if not all  manufacturing  transportation  and production  if there's no money  nothing has a cost  so if you need it you can get it  no strings attached  i think there are enough people who do things for the passion of it  rather than the paycheck  that entertainment and recreation industries could continue  albeit in an altered form  depending how good the robotics are  we might not need human doctors  if everything is free  there's no reason to steal  so crime will go down  put some system in place to prevent people from establishing a means of wealth by hoarding supplies and exploiting people to hand it out  i know i haven't thought of every contingency  and some would dismiss my idea as utopian fantasy  but i think the only real hurdle is the currently powerful wealthy who would lose what makes them special  and so would do everything in their power to keep it from happening ,nfiwur

1136,"Y'all, my workplace is going to get someone's pet killed and I cannot fucking deal with it anymore...",over a month ago i sent the office an update for a client's file regarding a new medication regimen for one of their pets  including pictures of the medication and detailed  step-by-step instructions for administration  last week the client called the office to ensure that this information had been added to the file and that they were aware of the service needing to be scheduled   cut to saturday morning this past weekend  client was out of town on vacation  and since we do not offer overnight services  the client contracted another sitter to perform those services  including feeding the dogs  medicating one dog  and feeding the cats  the overnight sitter was unable to do the cat's medication  so the company i'm currently at was contracted to do only that    cue me getting a bajillion text messages on my day off from both the office and a freaked out client because the person that my company sent over decided to walk the dogs again and give them breakfast  and some other stuff they didn't need to do  the sitter also failed to do the one thing they were contracted to do  apparently   do not feed the dogs or cats  only give  cat's name  medication  were not clear instructions  so  we have two dogs that have received a second breakfast  not ideal  but not deadly  one dog that has been overdosed on medicine  very big deal  and a cat that has not received any medication at all  also a very big deal  to make things even worse  the detailed  step-by-step instructions that i provided over a month ago were not copied over to the client's file  and instead the file consisted of a bunch of randomly jumbled up instructions which were complete gibberish  and which absolutely no one could follow    thus  i had to go to the client's home and administer this cat's medicine  very intricate medication that has to be administered via syringes  and super fucking difficult to do with a busted  stitched up hand  hence the reason i didn't accept the gig in the first place  then stay for an observation period to make sure the dog seemed okay  then come back later for another observation period to make sure the dog wasn't dead    i'm not mad about losing a day off  though i am a little pissed that i had to make use of my busted hand which is desperately trying to heal  i am fucking furious that one of my favorite pups could have been killed  that is a level of negligence that i will not abide  so fuck this place  i'm out  just had an interview today  should know by next monday if the job is mine ,nflm7t

1149,Job search stress,so i've been at my wfh call center position for a year and some change  i was told last week that i'll be forced back into the office  soon  and it's completely destroyed the last vestiges of give a fuck i have left  i've called out the last two days and i've been applying for different remote positions  most of which are supervisory-level  a lot of them require basic assessments in addition to the application  job hunting is fucking draining  and there's no way i'll have the mental energy to do it after a day at work  which is a big reason i've been calling out  i'm considering calling out tomorrow too so i can follow up on the responses i've gotten   it's stressing me out because i don't have any pto so if i do manage to hang onto this job i'm just sacrificing days of pay  and it's also stressful thinking about potentially losing my benefits because america is such a great place to live in  but i will absolutely become unemployed and destitute before i'm forced back into a shitty  stuffy  artificially-lit office cubicle so i can do the exact same job i've been doing for the last year while some middle manager stares at me all day  fuck your  business casual  office attire  it's fucking 80 degrees out  fuck going back to worrying about gas  lunch  and car maintenance costs just because some boomers are throwing tantrums about not being able to oversee the peons every waking fucking second   at this point i'm probably going to keep calling in until i either land a new position and officially quit or get fired  i hate this fucking rat race but i have the skills and the ability to do these types of jobs from my house  which is essential to my mental well-being and quality of life  sorry i like being able to fucking eat lunch with my younger brothers and actually be comfortable while i'm working instead of adhering to some arbitrary dress code because something something professionalism    rant,nfmxcy
1150,Rant: any day now I am going to snap,warning  this is probably going to be pretty long  i am so fed up with every aspect of this job  long rant incoming   i work at a job where it s an inbound call center as well as managing a caseload of clients  so basically you re working on your caseload but you re also taking inbound calls for other people s clients  it s now permanently working from home which is nice  but unfortunately it s an extremely busy job where you have 0 downtime whatsoever and our activity is monitored constantly  so i don t have that going for me   our caseload is supposed to be around 120 but for over a year it s been at least double that  they only just recently started hiring more people to cope and to replace the people that have quit since covid started    it is legitimately impossible to manage the call volume   case volume unless a  you re literally working every single second with no breaks  b  taking every shortcut known to man and screwing up your claims  and or c  transferring every call you get to someone else  which you re not supposed to do    we re not supposed to aux out more than 33  of the day  yesterday  my manager sends out a list of aux times for everyone in the office  i m at 38  averaged over the week prior  5 10 - 5 14  a few people are around where i am at and a few are lower  the vast majority of the office of around 80 people is sitting at more than 60  that means that those of us who are auxed in more get a disproportionate amount of calls because the calls are spread out among fewer people  so on any given day i ll have 20-50 calls received on top of my own people calling in and all the other job duties  everyone else gets like 1 -5 a day because they just sit in not ready mode    so i asked my manager  what is being done to address these massive discrepancies  i honestly hate sounding like a snitch but it is so unfair that for months on end i ve been struggling  and failing  to meet expectations and taking on extra work because everyone else doesn t want to take calls  well guess the fuck what   neither do i  anyway  she responds   everyone on that list that is highlighted is getting an email from their manager   give me a fucking break  they re getting the exact same email i get because i m 5  over the limit vs 30  what a joke       i ve been going back and forth with this one customer for months  i ve explained the payment process 100 freaking times and this lady still doesn t get it  she has asked for my manager multiple times  so  i forward the emails to her   hey we discussed this lady the other day  i ve explained this as many different ways as i possibly can and now she wants to talk to you  my manager says   tell her x y z  i don t have time to respond to her today    so you think i do  she literally said that very morning she only has one meeting so wtf else are doing for the rest of your 7 hours    so i told the lady what my manager said to tell her  a few days later i hear from the woman again  still wants to talk to my manager  i forward the email to my manager who never responds  i figured she took care of it and forgot about it    a few days later  today  i get another email from the same woman   i never heard from anyone  blah blah  wtf  so i forward the email to my manager a third time  i said  hey i sent this to you last week  i m not sure if you saw it  this is the same person that i ve discussed with you several times  can you please talk to her so she stops bothering me   my manager s response   explain the process to her  if she still kicks up a fuss  send her to another escalated call rep   my jaw literally dropped  first of all  there is a mile-long email chain right there dating back to mid-march where i keep telling the lady the damn process  second  my manager is literally the escalated call rep for my team  because she is the manager  is that not one of the basic job duties for managers  to handle and smooth over escalated issues  now you want me to send to someone else    so  i didn t respond  just marked the email as read  i m not responding to the lady any more  i ve done all i can do  of course if she gets to talk to someone else i will be blamed for the lack of ongoing responses but whatever    later on that same day  today  my manager emails me and says  you re above 10 voicemails  please address   i had 12 at the time she emailed  my company has a policy where you can t have any more than 10 vm at a time  if you get above 10 you need to drop everything and answer some  all must be answered within 24 hours of it being left    no fucking shit i have 12 messages  i have 240 claims right now  email my lady back and ill answer my voicemails  gt  is what i wanted to say but i just ignored the email instead       recently i ve made it known to my manager that i d like to try moving to a different department  i asked her what i need to do to do that  i was recently passed over for another position so i wanted guidance because i never got feedback as to why i was rejected without an interview    she said one of the biggest things i need to do is make a big cross-office impact   i said ok  well can you tell me what that means  i did literally every side project you threw at me last year and you still only rated me as a 3  how would i stand out more    her response  i shit you not   well none of that extra stuff you mentioned really mattered  what we look for is special projects that you develop on your own   i read this email and immediately went on my lunch break and called a friend of mine that recently quit  i spent hundreds of hours doing all these extra projects last year just to now be told that actually they didn t matter because they weren t  special  enough  no  i need to take time out of my already slammed work day to concoct some b s  project  whatever happened to  ya know  my actual job  how about the fact that i very rarely receive complaints  have gotten 10 10 scores on customer service surveys  can keep myself caught up on my workbook without assistance  and meet my numbers every single month that i ve worked here except for one  no  none of that matters to get you promoted or even for a lateral transition  because i haven t created a  special project  to work on to make myself look good   and this goes without saying  but it s not even a guarantee that you ll be promoted because of this and obviously you re not getting paid extra to work on it    i m in the process of looking for another job because we all know it s often easier to get another job at a new company than to be hired internally  even if it s a lateral move  obviously it s taking forever  i ve been looking for months but everything just looks like more of the same  i m this   close to just quitting and taking the summer off  i can t take it anymore yall  i m about to take my work computers and leave them on the sidewalk for the garbage people to pick up  fuck this noise

1151,So I had to call out of work awhile back.,i do appreciate my jobs mindset of  the managers need to be the one to find the replacement for the call out  but there are some other problems depending on who you talk to when calling out for work   so i got really sick one day and had to call out for work and just happened to get the big boss on the phone when calling in  his reply was simple  fine we'll take care of it  but he sound very annoyed by the whole thing   i'm not one who usually calls out so i thought it would be ok and i wouldn't get too much lip in response buy hey   guess i was wrong    so next day i come in  still feeling shitty but able to work and the assistant manager talks to me  apparently he was in the room when i made the stick call and overheard it  he asked the boss when he was done with the call  dude you sounded so annoyed  it can't be that bad  to which the boss responds  yeah  i can't make them think its ok to call out for work  apparently i'm the one in the wrong for trying to keep customers and my fellow employees healthy and not sick ,nfg0r9

1167,As long as we need money just to afford the right to live we are not free., the idea that we are free is one of the greatest illusions created by our society  in reality we actually aren't free  first of all  we are not free externally because to afford the right to live we need money and to get money we have to essentially sell our souls  we have to spend most of our lives doing things that we don't care for and that are so unpleasant that they have to pay people to do them  and if you're lucky enough to get a job you will have to spend at least 50 years working continuously    even on the psychological level we aren't free because from the moment you're born  your parents and the society they live in begin to condition you  you don't even have the freedom to choose your own name  i mean sure  you're free to choose your name when you're older but it costs money just to even have that much freedom  eventually your parents send you to school  which only exists to teach you things that will make you useful to the system  school basically conditions us to just be another slave  the less they teach you to think for yourself the better because thinking for yourself might lead you to seeing that you actually aren't free  and this is bad for business   on top of all this  if you see how insane our society is and if you refuse to be a slave  the society makes it almost impossible for you to live and it even conditions other slaves to ridicule and shame anyone who dares to question our current system  i mean just look at the things people say on reddit whenever someone brings up this sub  if you don't want to work people call you lazy and if you decide to end your life so you won't have to participate in this sick society they call you crazy  the only way to fit in is to conform  so it's very clear to me that freedom is one of the greatest illusions we've been tricked into believing  but of course the powers that be know that if people think they are free then they will never question their enslavement  most people actually like being slaves because they wouldn't know what to do with themselves if they were free  they need somebody else to tell them what to do   when i woke up today all these things were bothering me and now that i've expressed it i feel a lot better  anyway  i'll leave you with a few lines from a song i wrote called  'growing up' https soundcloud com zenbreaze growing-up-feat-sula        gt i m grown up now  i got bills to pay     gt     gt i don t wanna sell me soul  but it seems to pay     gt     gt it costs money just to live     gt     gt is this really what life is     gt     gt the cost of growing up     gt     gt is this really what the price is ,ng3e5q

1187,Long and annoying recruitment process,yesterday i received an invitation for a  job interview  that seemed perfect for me  however in their mail they went in details about their recruitment process and after reading it i was quite annoyed  this is what they ask for    1  send them a video where you answer some questions - they say you don't need to prepare it but you kinda have to   2  test at home which takes an hour and a half   3  interview with hiring manager  and if it had stopped right there  i would have been totally okay but      4  half a day doing 4 interviews  about 1 hour per interview i suppose   it's sad to see that recruiters view job applications as an opportunity to get some good quality entertainment  by forcing applicants to crush their self esteem and act like clowns for them   they also probably think that if someone is okay to go through such recruitment process  he will be okay with basically anything   doing extra hours for free everyday  working on weekends  working in shitty office  etc   i have been unemployed for months and i would really like to find a job as soon as possible but  no thank you ,nfipdm

1219,Who was in the wrong?,i have been babysitting for a family for weeks now  they have multiple cameras i can see and i'm sure they also have hidden ones  they have never had a problem with me or how i babysit  the husbands family loved me his mom and grandma were very kind to me  whereas the mothers family made me feel intimidated and not welcome  her mom and grandma  everything was going great until my last day  i was instructed to take the kids 1 and 3 years old to the moms house  where the grandma would be watching their cousin who is also 3  we did this because the wifi was out and she didn't want me to suffer because it was also a rainy day  the grandma was asleep and the little girl had woken up and was playing unattended when i arrived  then the grandma had left without telling me even though the cousin was not my responsibility  after she arrived back several hours later i had put the baby down for a nap and the other two were playing  i then saw the kids playing with her and accidentally fell asleep  only because i knew another adult was there watching them  as i was not feeling well and wanted to take the time i had a break from them resting  i woke up an hour later and the grandma had purposefully woken the baby up and left the children alone in the bedroom  i was fired three days later before i was supposed to return to work for them the next day because i had taken the nap  come to find out the grandma had made up several other things that never happened so i am sure that played a factor in me being fired  since there was no cameras at the house it was a case of she said and she said  her word against mine  mind you not even two weeks before i was asked to come on a saturday for a special occasion and the cousins mom and the family i babysit for mom were talking in front of me about how the grandma had broken the cousins collarbone and was trying to convince them not to take her to the hospital because she was lying about how it happened  they had suspicions that she had broken it by grabbing her and pulling her too hard then pushing her  should i have been fired  if i would have known the grandma cared that i rested i would not have  but she was a perfectly capable adult watching them also  she also lied and said she had left while i was sleeping but why would she leave three children alone if she knew i was resting  her whole story had fabricated pieces that just didn't make sense  if the family has never seen me leave the children alone before and know the grandma lies then i don't understand why i was fired  other than the napping but i made sure an adult member was there watching them as i would never do it under any other circumstance ,nfv2yo

1240,"Give no loyalty, for you shall receive none.",just another story of a shitty employer and my eventual triumph to brighten your day  it's a long one  tl dr is at the bottom    i had been working for this digital content company for a couple of years  i had recently been married  and we were on the fence about moving from il to az   for several reasons  financial  weather sucks  etc  my wife was working a retail job at meijer  so she was fully on board with moving  but we decided to wait until after my 2-year performance review to see if i could negotiate a salary that would justify staying put  originally  i was hired to manage support and deployments for all of the media content players at all client sites  which numbered in the hundreds  i had an extensive it background coming in  but actively sought out this job as a change of pace    cue the bait and switch - they suddenly fired the full-time it guy a couple months after i started  think small company  about 20 total employees  but it was still a full-time job for one person  what has two thumbs and inherited all of those responsibilities in addition to his own  this guy  from that point on  i was expected to perform two  40k  per year jobs while being paid for one  which i did  admirably  i might add  no matter  i figured that i could demonstrate my value and parlay that into a nice salary in the future  boy  was i wrong   when review time came  they offered to increase my salary from  42k to  45k  i brought up the fact that my skillet and hard work had enabled them to trim their payroll considerably and that i had been effectively doing two jobs  not only did they scoff at me  why do  you  deserve that money    but told me in no uncertain terms that i was at the ceiling pay rate for my position  basically  i shouldn't expect to receive another pay raise for a long time  if ever  in response  i threw the hammer down right there during the review and told them i'm moving out of state  they showed no interest in allowing me to transition my role to az  so i just put in my notice on the spot   they scrambled to find a replacement for me  hired a guy  a man nearing retirement age  in texas  wtf  and i found out they started him at  52k  double wtf  so they actually flew me down to austin to train the guy for a few days  i mostly drank tito's cocktails and ate brisket sandwiches in the hotel room  but i got the guy up to speed  i had fully documented the day-to-day tasks of the position and there was a full  peaceful knowledge transfer  anyway  i moved to arizona a month later and we have zero regrets    now the fun part  i kept in occasional touch with the office manager chick from the media company  and i found out that my  replacement  quit abruptly after a few months and left them in a big-time lurch  it took them several weeks to find someone else  and that person had to learn the role completely on their own  clients were lost  bosses were pissed  etc  in addition to that  they burned through that person and a couple of others in the months that followed  it was a big mess  resulting in lost revenue and frustration all around  it felt really good to learn that their unwillingness to pay me resulted in a vacuum that sucked their overall profitability for a period of time    tl dr - left a job that didn't value me  they paid the price and then some and it was hilarious  any expressed loyalty from an employer is an illusion  screw 'em ,nepqt3

1246,Capitalism will never allow a workers market,    no matter how terrible the  labor shortage  we are now seeing in the economy gets  the capitalists will never raise wages much higher than subsistence levels  if labor  being as necessary as it is  got it s fair share in a labor shortage  then that would mean in a labor shortage it would be workers who get to choose what firm to work for instead of firms being choosy about what workers they get  owners would be outbidding one another constantly - every place you apply at would be offering a higher wage than the next one  sterling benefit packages would quickly become normal  and employers would be bending over backward to keep what workers they have  this  they say  is how the market is supposed to work    but none of this happens  instead wages stagnate and owners begin to cry loudly about the  dignity of work  and of the need for  self-starters  and  dedicated  applicants  they have to - if the workers became aware that it is they  not the owners  that can decide what businesses and opportunities get support  that they and not the owners are what make production go - then we would have socialism  the owners can t give up the ghost  not even once  for once the workers find out just how much more they can make without the sky falling as the owners so often claim the workers will never go back to believing the lie   so the owners rely on the phantasm introduced and maintained by the neoliberal project - the philosophy of the  dream job  with it they fooled so many into believing that the point of life was to work  that work was what made one a  good citizen  it made one  moral  a  productive member of society  what nonsense  all just smoke and mirrors to dupe workers out of their wages and to distract them from class consciousness  all so that the gains from technology and automation went to them and not to us   work is bullshit  the whole point of us living together in a society is to be rid of it  i don t need other people to heap work on me - i can find my own way of spending my time  and yet this is exactly what this economy does - the owners are just coming up with bullshit work for us all to do to keep us from forgetting what neoliberalism spent so much time drilling into our collective heads  for only with that phantasm can the people be persuaded into taking the pittance the capitalists offer   so yell it from the rooftops  work is a sin  the hard-working employee is a fool  a clown  a naive dipshit who believes the lies of miserly old men  the politicians are all bastards - each and every one of them will insist that only those americans who work without complaint are  good citizens  worth listening to  the poor and unemployed are just their wards  not their constituents  in other words  the politicians will serve you only if you serve the masters  with friends like these who needs enemies ,neglh4

1252,Am I antiwork? Help me figure out what to do.,so lads  let me tell you my story  i need to share it somewhere  and i can't think of a better place than this sub  please try not to hate me for my white-collar perspective on things    i have been in sick leave for an extended time now  the doctors consider me unable to work at this time  and i am  due to depression caused primarily by lockdown isolation but secondarily by some underlying issues that probably would have thrown me off at some point anyway  i am making an effort to recover  and it seems that i am  however  i am not sure whether recovering is such a great idea  if i never recover  then i never have to work again  or work significantly reduced hours  and i get to keep my income  of course  the downside then is that i probably will not grow  and will not have a career  so i am at a crossroads  one where it's not said i get to really choose the direction but anyway    amp x200b   to provide some details  i'm now in my early thirties  have a decent job  90th percentile income in age-corrected distribution  with excellent benefits  live in a central northern euro country  note that i still can't afford a decent house or anything like that  so to be honest whether you are 50th or 90th percentile really barely makes a difference  the difference is a better car  a slightly nicer vacation  and a slightly nicer house  full stop    amp x200b   without providing details  let's say my childhood was pretty fun and normal until  starting at 6-10 years old  my self-esteem and sense of self-started to become warped  i was  at 10 years old  a philosopher  i figured out how  what you call green  and what i see as green  might be something totally different to both of us and we would never even know  and many other insights  i never read a book about philosophy in my life  my father  who studied philosophy  would always find a way to invalidate my views through some bullshit academic literature  probably why i never bothered reading any  he did many other things to invalidate me as a person on many different levels  long story short  i grew up both fearing and hating the world  and questioning my place in it  whether i was worth one at all  this recently became clear to me and i have been living with this  defect  until now  hiding it from both myself and the world  this obviously impacted my life  both professionally and socially  in a very negative way  of course  this is summarized  but let's say that i constantly feel like i am being rejected and bullied  even when not  and that i figured this out but that it nevertheless takes a massive effort to get through normal daily life this way  and to focus on things which are not terribly important to me  like  this  work    amp x200b   in high school  i was essentially ignored and i ignored everyone  as much as possible  i was never bullied  but i also never had friends  i was just that person nobody knew what to do with  and i knew not what to do with anyone  i  recently  considered i may have autism  but i feel that autism is a rare condition and that getting where i am  and doing so in a way that is both excruciatingly painful and effortless at the same time  seems implausible to say the least  in any case  my social skills and trust in cooperativeness towards the world took a big hit    amp x200b   after high school  i managed to go to a uni where normally only the offspring of very rich parents go  don't ask how  my parents are poor  divorced  my mom is on welfare level and it cost me a lot to go to this place  let's keep it at that  i  and one other kid  were the exceptions to this rule  and a handful of reasonably but not very rich stock  this warped my view of the world even further  i saw first-hand how incredibly effortlessly they moved through life  how much fun they had  how everything that i would have to break my back to have  was simply handed to them by birthright  how they squandered it  how they were  essentially for the most part - and i know i am not god and thou shalt not judge  but i cannot contain myself - human trash  in any case  none of them were any better than the  normies  and most of them were worse  my social skills at the time were still very poor  and my machiavellianism at a very low level  otherwise i might have been more effective and used the opportunity to ingratiate myself with them  after all  being friends with a guy with a boat is better than owning a boat  alas  i dropped out after two years    amp x200b   i then tried and failed at a number of  normal  uni programs  always due to a lack of work ethic on my part  although my reasoning at the time was  i simply want to go my own way  f this conformity stuff  i don't want to be a sheep and they do not teach anything useful at uni anyway  i tried to set up my own businesses or code my own applications to sell  and although others would compliment my progress  quality of work  and work ethic  this never amounted to much actual financial success  in hindsight  it was solely due to a lack of perseverance  which went unnoticed both by myself and my environment  because i am at the same time quite perseverant in nature  it's the irony of progress without progress  that i still can't explain very well to this day     amp x200b   around the time when i was 26 i had still accomplished very little  both socially and professionally  and i saw my life completely stagnating  i decided i had to  do something  and so picked up relatively menial work in it  i thus experienced what many on this sub experience  being treated like a worthless maggot working for someone else's profit  i could not stomach the fact that this company would place me somewhere  pay me 10 hr  14 including all the bennies i would say  and then the client would pay them 50 hr  all the while they assumed no risk because i was a temp anyway  i do not mind paying a middle man for stuff that's useful to me  like placing me in a working position  but you cannot tell me i am worth 50 hr to someone and pay me 10  especially because now the client expects me to deliver 50 worth of output  while i expect to deliver  at the very most  20  so i left  found myself a government contract to tender myself on  and then i was the one taking the 80 hr  started at 40  i did that for 2 years until i became too disgusted with the fact that these managers would pay me anything i wanted because they  liked me   or something  and it was just budget they had to get rid of anyway  given to them by good honest taxpayers mind you  for a job that hardly needed doing  unfortunately  those government tenders are rarer now and only open to middle men generally    amp x200b   so i left and went to complete my degree after all  eventually  i graduated with honours with an msc that's extremely employable  and effortlessly found a job at what could be easily called an a-list employer  i grew dissatisfied  as i always do  and jumped to another job  the offer was great  and what's the greatest about it is that they offered me an indeterminate period contract right from the start  affording me a position of relative power and security   too bad for them i called in sick reasonably shortly after starting    amp x200b   the way i think about it is that for the  premium  slaves to function  their labour camp must have no walls  and lenient guards  these sheep are smart and so they must feel the premium  they need to experience  trust  i talk to my coworkers in more diplomatic terms about my views on how we are exploited as labour  and they all talk about how they are quite happy to be in this position  how they are doing much better than everyone else their our age  and so forth  and i tell them  but you still can't buy a house  raise a family  support a wife  or a husband  i am not a gender role purist  those kinds of things  your parents could do these things  and they were much less productive than you  how is that fair  and their eyes kind of glaze over and they go on with their work  they always talk about how busy they are  it's like they want to be busy  being busy is a massive part of their identity  busy little bees  buzzing in my ear  responding to the question  why do you enjoy this work  i had one respond  well you know  i just want to be in a good position and i think the world will always have a huge demand for people who are handy at solving problems with numbers  excel  and so i see this as progress towards valuable skillsets  i did not tell him that i think most of the world's current ills are precisely because of a huge surplus of people who think they can solve problems with excel  and society is doing its very best to accommodate them all with bullshit jobs    amp x200b   talking to these people was  in fact  a major source of my depression  because i had always figured that once the string was pulled excessively  it would at some point snap  never had i thought it could be pulled as much as it has  and never had i thought to think it could be pulled even further still  and that the snapback might occur when i am well into my 50's  done by a different  less complacent  less childlike generation than mine     amp x200b   in order for me to move from nothing to this premium labour camp  i had shut down my entire personality  i don't have one anymore  my entire view on life  i don't have a consistent view  my entire will to even live  that's mostly gone  nothing about me has any personality  my furniture has good taste  but no personality  my clothes are in good taste but lack any discernable identity  my physical health is great  on measurements  yet my posture is not  there seems to be nothing wrong with me  yet everything's out of place    amp x200b   so now i find myself in a position where i am in a camp with very weak walls and lenient guards  if the camp finds me defective  the camp will let me out and even bear the cost of my departure fully  the camp will afford to me  in essence  the same privilege as is afforded to the rich  namely a guaranteed and reasonably high income forever  until death  without the need for reciprocation  i'll even continue to build a pension  i can even leave the country  and now  considering this  i find myself in a situation where i am essentially dr  jekyll and mr  hyde  even me  even on me  deep down perhaps one of the stauncher anti-work  anti-rich types you will find  this invisible wall has an effect  simply because their hold on my balls is not so iron tight  i am more willing to accept a loose grip  even if the bottom line is the same  i work for someone else's luxurious lifestyle    amp x200b   dr  jekyll says    -you came so far  you are part of the team now  finally  you are on the good side of this  you should stay and do your best    -your issues are caused by personality defects from childhood  these are not really you  good normal people fit in  you pretty much fit in now  just recover and go on     -society is not so bad  look at the social safety net  and yes  objectively  it is much better than what most of you on this sub go through and i truly feel for you and those pulling the even shorter straws  i almost feel bad for complaining at all    -with the covid situation  society is extremely unstable right now  it is better to be in the building than outside of it  i work at a large multinational  yes i am a horrible person  part of the problem  an enforcer of evil  etc     -i like my team members  i like my manager even though they are also corporate drones and bought the fairy tale hook line and sinker  i still see them as people and i do not mind being around them     -if you continue working  you can probably become a premium premium slave and then you can command rates of upwards of 150 hr on the free market  you will have lots more money yay     -fix yourself  find your identity while still being a part of this world  don't go and sit on the sidelines     amp x200b   mr  hyde says    -all you ever wanted in life was to get out of the race  all you ever do is save up  here's your chance  what are you some kind of moron  why are you even thinking this through    -nobody ever gave you anything  nobody ever gave you even a nickel that they did not expect to have you return to them threefold  you do not owe anybody anything    -this country is not for you  this society's values are not your values  you have no business building a pyramid you do not even like  in return for no stake in it  while others enjoy its  your  fruits undeservingly    -what are you gonna work for like 4-5 weeks of vacation a year  what you need is 54 weeks of vacation a year buddy     -you know very well you would do things with your life eventually  do you think you are doing things with your life right now  you aren't  you may not make money doing it  but you will never do nothing  it is not in your nature to want to contribute nothing     -because of my shitty childhood and many many failures in life  unfinished degrees  short-term employments etc  it will be easy to convince the medical community that something

1292,The Burnouts,i've noticed recently a lot of my friends  we're a year or two out of college  switching up jobs  or just plain not wanting to work and being burnt out and some of them are even in good like engineering jobs  is there a reason for this  i fear i'm not too far behind too  just between being put in shitty tasking situations and my own morale laziness slowing decreasing   i don't know if it's just our generation  maybe we're too soft but like it sucks man  having no concentration and just getting frustrated with work because no one is available knows how to do anything and i'm new on the team it's a freakin huge codebase and boy does remote work suck with all the technical issues    i feel like my values have really changed starting with the end of college  what i thought was senioritis might just be me hating the pace and environment and tbh i'm sure the pace environment is worse at other places like amazon ,negjrg

1312,Advice on Leaving a Toxic Job,hi everyone    i just came across this sub while looking for shared experience and thought it would be a good place to ask for advice  buckle in  this may be a long read but i really appreciate anyone who reads it through    i work at a clinic  i got hired last year and worked for exactly one week before i got laid off due to covid  a few months later  they asked me to come back on a limited schedule rather than the full time schedule we had agreed to  mostly to serve as backup for my co worker who had been a fixture for 13 years    our office manager is the kind of person who wants things accomplished her way  no matter who it alienates along the way  that often involves staff and at times involves patients  her condescending and passive aggressive attitude led to her butting heads with my co worker  who was expected to learn a slew of new polices and procedures while working 12 hour days  almost always without breaks and reduced lunches due to the impossible workload    fast forward to about two months ago  and i get a weekend call from my manager saying that my co worker had been fired and if i could come in and cover her shifts  in shock  i text my co worker and she tells me it was done without warning and that the manager and owner were needlessly cruel with how they went about it  i felt dirty and didn t want to help them move on from their decision scot free  but this career path is important to me and i didn t want to no show  at the very least  i decided i would apply for other jobs in the meantime    except that soon became very hard to do because i found myself basically working her schedule  i refused to forego my breaks  but still  long days where i m responsible for greeting patients in person  manning the phones  recruiting new patients and dealing with insurance companies all at the same time left me completely drained  they promised that they would have someone hired within a month  but it s been almost two with only one interview that i ve seen  it s becoming increasingly clear that they re expecting me to carry this load for as long as it s convenient for them  and all without me officially being upgraded to a full time employee  meaning i m getting no benefits    on top of that  they started disputing my overtime pay  i m in ca  everyone i ve talked to and every job i ve worked at has paid me ot for anything over 8 hours in a single day  one time  they went in and changed my time card without my knowledge and said that part time employees only get ot above 10 hours in a day  or over 40 hours in a week  i researched it plenty when this happened  and while i found a few sources that confirmed their claims  i found way more that confirmed mine  when i questioned them  they had a page ready to go from the state saying what they were claiming  which made it more confusing because i had a statement that said the opposite from the same site  feeling drained  i spoke to a lawyer who suggested i let the ot build up  then file a case once i quit for everything at once    anyway  that brings us to last friday  a patient was at risk for being charged out of pocket because of an insurance issue  their doctor told me to call them and let them know in case they decided to cancel and not risk the high payment  between calling the insurance company  handling a phone that was ringing off the hook for 2 hours  handling patients in person and filing 75 pages of paperwork  7 hours with no breaks had suddenly passed  i didn t want to leave my brand new co worker alone too long so she wouldn t be overwhelmed  so i cut my lunch in half and rushed back to the office    in the time that i was gone  there were 5 more phone calls i had to return and a message from my manager saying not to cancel the patient with the insurance issue  unfortunately  i didn t see the message until i returned all the calls  so by the time i did  the patient had already been cancelled  simply put  she was angry  she texted me and included the owner in the thread asking me why i ignored her message  i have a timeline of exactly how it went down  and i was greeted with messages from both the owner and manager basically blaming me for not knowing any better  that i should  ask questions if i don t know what to do   something i avoid because the manager has yelled at me before for asking too many questions   now  my frustration turns to anger because i both did what the doctor told me to do   which i agreed with because the patient shouldn t have be blindsided with sudden charges  and because i ve been directed by the manager to do so  i have also seen both her and my old co worker do it in the past for similar reasons  to imply it was due to my ignorance rather than the massive workload making me miss the message  the short time frame we had to make a decision or the lack of staffing killed me mentally   eventually the doctor listened to me vent for almost two hours and was nice enough to give me a ride home  he talked me down from straight up walking out  but i decided to use the weekend to cool off and make a more rational decision  before i left  i made sure to send a lengthy  but professional text to the manager and owner explaining how frustrated i was because of the workload  how i feel like i m just plugged in as a replacement instead of a valued individual and that this environment is unsustainable  that things will naturally fall through the cracks and that there s no one individual to blame  but an overall failure of management to maintain proper staffing    i decided to give my two weeks tomorrow  mostly because i don t want them to label me as difficult to my co workers who see me in a positive light and because my college friend got me this job and i don t want to have my actions reflect poorly on her  that was until a little while ago when i got a response from the owner saying he s surprised that i did what i did because training said otherwise   again  i ve done this plenty of times and have seen others do it repeatedly  and that it s not their fault that we re understaffed because  they re not just going to hire anybody  no mention of any of the concerns i had like being overworked or set up for failure  just more blame towards me and excuses for them    so my ultimate question at this point is  should i give them the two weeks  it s obvious they have no respect for me and i feel like doing so gives up some of my power  i wouldn t past them to suddenly fire me like they did my co worker for standing up for myself  any other advice regarding the overtime claim or any potential case my former co worker might have for her working conditions or her sudden firing would be appreciated too    thank you ,nezg9x
1313,Heidegger on Work,heidegger's arguments are used extensively in ecological critiques of work  in de-growth based  arguments against work  and in the anti-work scholarship more broadly  yet  at the same time  his arguments are used by others to find and highlight the  'meaningfulness' of work  this article explores the foundations of these paradoxical positions within heidegger's writings and i think it is a really interesting summary of his writings ,nf3jio

1316,The Founding Americans understood and were pro Collective Bargaining,the two most unpopular taxes when the us was founded were the head tax and the property tax   a head tax is a tax someone has to pay just to be alive and the property tax had to be paid if you wanted a place to live  they were unavoidable and the politicians were able to use them to single people out and pit groups against each other    this is why taxes are supposed to be apportioned and not have direct taxes that single out individuals  this is the same idea as a company that favors one group of employees over another to prevent unionization  when the workers are united then they have much more power than they do as individuals   the founders of the country tried to do the same thing with taxes  if everyone has to pay taxes then the people would push back against corruption and an abusive government  but if some groups are punished and others favored then it is much easier to divide and conquer the tax cattle   there is nothing new in politics or the workplace   stand together or hang separately ,nen5zv

1390,How to handle the 'Why were all your jobs so short?' question?,i'm a lawyer and i never thought i'd do so many jobs since graduation  i wanted to just be a lawyer  but stuff happened  heartbreak  illness  i'm too scared to say this to interviewers  i once did and the only thing they ask me is  you're not sick anymore  are you  i'm not  but jobs can make me ill quickly    i did about 8 jobs since 2017  most of them were just for a definite term  i resigned from one  and i ended one mutually cause it was for indefinite term  i did plan on moving once  so i only accepted short term jobs during that period  i also like the comfort of having a job agency look for me   but i still feel like an absolute weirdo because i have a law degree and in their eyes i let myself get treated like a high schooler  they don't understand that when you look for jobs  2 out of 3 is for a definite term with no chance of staying longer  companies who immediately offer a fixed contract are either sketchy or very difficult jobs like taxes  so they need to offer you all this stuff in order to keep you  company car  all that crap   i find the question so rude in fact  that one time i responded kinda harsh  well  that's cause all jobs are short term these days and you just have no choice  i've read about people getting burnout after 20 short term contracts  or 50 y olds not being able to get a contract for indefinite term  social law in my country was ffed up by a socialist minister who tried to do good by getting rid of trial periods  now every job is just a trial period after which you get dumped unless no one else wants to do these horrible jobs   and next time if they ask me that question  if they even dare  and the job i am applying for is - tuh duh - for a definite term  i won't be shy to say  well  this job is short term too  why don't you just give a contract for indefinite term then  rather than using short term contracts as a sort of one long free trial period  why buy the software if you keep getting free trial periods amiright  that's how they reason    in fact my own rant sort of gave me an answer  cause for some reason i am pretty sure that the next job i'll apply for will be for a definite term ,ndimy4

1421,Honestly at this point the only way I see a good life is returning to the void.('rant'/release),so for starters  i'm a nihilist and antinatalist  but for as long as i can remember i chose to observe the world instead of join it  this i guess is a culmination of the 16 years of my lifes observation  people say i'm just depressed or that it's just a phase  bull  shit  if it were a phase wouldn't still feel these things after 7 years   so far its shit  not even gonna sugarcoat it   we dont get a choice in existence  we are ripped from the void  indoctrinated into thinking life is worth living while also being fucked up the ass by wage slavery and 40 hour weeks  on top of that theres the mental and physical shit that can develop  further decreasing lifes  worth  from the day we are developed enough to go to school until the day we're too old to work   people keep saying life is a gift  life is worth living  life is amazing and this and that and this and that and it just keeps going on and on and on and it never ends  it just never ends   you know what the definition of insanity is  it's doing the same shit  over and over again  expecting something to change  we all work  day in and day out  expecting something to pay it all off  but it never comes  the tribulations  the indoctrination  the ignorance  the petty political infighting  and for what  a few minutes of enjoyment  it doesn't matter  theres no point in existence now  not since slavery and feudalism were created  we are born into lives of suffering and lies   we are told everything will work out  that everything will get better  that we should be happy to be alive  but it never will  it will never get better  we will die  be forgotten  and that's it  nothing more  the ultimate end   thats our reward for all the time wasted working  suffering  crying - death  p what's the point in pushing on if the end goal is a return to the eternal void anyway  the economy ruins our one chance at life  life is an amazing thing to be enjoyed  but the system the people before us made ruins it for us  it doesn't help when people say to live life to the fullest and then proceed to get forced into slavery that locks you down with cold chains and holds a blade to your throat if you dare move    i'm drained  your drained  they're drained  and for what  less money that what is needed to survive on top of the plethora of mental and physical disorders we may have  is our reward the slave owners  the final release from lifes sadistic eyes  it doesn't even matter does it  death is the only thing guaranteed by the supposed 'lord above'  and i pray the final day of torment arrives soon    they say i have my whole life ahead of me  that i should enjoy it while i can because high school is the best time of my life  if this place is the best time of my life i refuse to live any longer because fuck that  why should i carry on huh  why  it will never get better  never be worth the suffering  nothing will matter anyway i'll be forgotten and returned to the eternal void and cease to exist  if i killed myself i would be free  if they say suicide only passed on the pain  those people shouldn't have decided to make another poor soul suffer the cycle anyway  i wouldn't care cause i'd be dead and free  if they killed themselves from the strain then good on them  they freed themselves too  if it fails and i unfortunately continue living  i'd be forced even deeper into the hole  why bother anymore   sorry for the long post  needed this off my chest ,ne0oqg
1422,I don’t think retiring at an old age is a good thing at all.,there is a very clear difference between an older person who works and one who does not  sitting in an old people s home or a villa they worked for  i can imagine it being so so boring  your brain activity would really start to decrease  at older ages thats very dangerous   this is why often times you see people going out of retirement and back to work   in my opinion the concept of working hard for a long time and then retiring to relax is depressing  a more logical way would be to take job breaks from time to time  work 2 years  take 5 months off before starting another job  enough time to get bored of your hobbies  what do you guys think ,nde9js

1438,If someone tells me ''welcome to the real world'' when I complain about work one more time I am going to lose my goddamn mind.,in my humble opinion  ''welcome to the real world'' is probably one of the most disrespectful and insensitive things you can say to someone who is dealing with immense stress brought upon by late-stage capitalism  you aren't offering any help or encouragement when you say that     i find that people who use the phrase ''welcome to the real world'' in response to peoples suffering tend to be afflicted with internalized cynicism and bitterness brought upon by late-stage capitalism  they are actively jealous of how ''children'' are given so much freedom and comfort compared to them and this jealousy causes them to experience a sense of sadistic joy when young people are forced into the kafkaesque maze that is a late-stage capitalist society ,ndrwr4

1442,You'll always be someone's b-word,i recently got my first job out of college that i begin this mid-summer  i am extremely thankful that i got this job it's a permanent work from home job  i had to truly work for it to find this opportunity to get the offer after multiple run-ins with terrible jobs and abusive bosses  i interviewed four times until they gave me the offer  now  two months before the first work day begins  these asshole co-workers want to schedule a few zoom meet and greets for new-hires  seriously  the four interviews were a waste of time now they want me to bullshit myself with a bunch of people i won't even see in person  this is the type of job where i work directly with customers and not rely on my coworkers    it pisses me off because even though the meeting is  optional   as per them - which i know is bullshit  there is an immense pressure to meet and if i don't meet  it'll make me look bad because the managers will be there  to be fair  i don't think they scheduled this  but i there's a chance i'm wrong  i've been discriminated against for the silliest reasons  i'm socially awkward and i have a visible anxiety disorder that is apparent on my face  and i can't even begin to imagine what it must be like for other people in worse positions than i am  this anxiety gnaws at me  at first  i thought i was being irrational  but now after self-reflection  i'm beginning to see the truth  my anxiety is rational  it's rational because in the usa  we have at-will employment which means that for any reason  the boss can let you go  for any reason  just imagine  i don't like the way you look at me or i don't like your non-talkative personality  then i'm fired  then i can't pay rent  i keep planning for the eventual doomsday scenario  but that would involve even more stress as a child  i moved every 2 years because my parents couldn't afford the rent and the lease was up  i've been homeless before and reliant on other people's charity to not live in a homeless shelter  now  i feel like working any job is the same concept  but a different medium  i'm reliant on someone's charity for the rest of my life until i die  it doesn't matter if you do a great job  your employer can fire you for any reason if you don't cater to their whims  this bullshit coworker meeting is just the beginning soon they'll sneakily ask me to do more that is outside my job descriptions there's literally no realistic way out  i'll always be a slave ,ne5rlf

How about not glorifying stress at all?,so  where do employers get the right to cause anyone stress  i remember being a child around the year 2000 and hearing the word stress for the first time  i hated that word  people started using it as a status symbol  just like all other nasty stuff like burn out  overworking  multiple jobs  full agenda's and tuhduh drinking  smoking and slurping caffeine and eating nasty salads for lunch at a desk    stress is extremely toxic to the body  and even when an employee think there is no stress  the environment is highly stressful  opening an email can cause the same adrenal response as being attacked by z wild animal  only here  we can't escape from the animal  and we are also not allowed to kill  our minds and bodies then produce way too much adrenaline  which needs to be countered by cortisol  either leading to obesity or to weight loss and trembling   and it's almost like the worse employees feel and the more obvious the news is  half of the population is burned out  8 out of 10 wants to quit jobs  the worse the companies wanna make it  as if they feel like our limits have been pushed higher and they want to see even more how far they can stretch us   stress during interview  stress during commute  stress to learn everything  then more and more stress to not make a mistake either from the imposter syndrome or from the dunning kruger effect  stress from making ends meet  stress of bad work life balance  stress of bad coworkers  stress from lack of sleep  not getting chores done  eating the same nutrient poor food every lunch derived of any salt  fat or flavour    no wonder half of the population is depressed ,nckriv

1522,Palantir is creepy as hell,maybe some of you have heard of palantir technologies  they had an ipo this year  they make software which integrates databases to find patterns  useful for deterring theorists but also for listening on employees    the following is from wikipedia    aided by 120  forward-deployed engineers  of palantir during 2009  peter cavicchia iii of jpmorgan used metropolis to monitor employee communications and alert the insider threat team when an employee showed any signs of potential disgruntlement  the insider alert team would further scrutinize the employee and possibly conduct physical surveillance after hours with bank security personnel  the metropolis team used emails  download activity  browser histories  and gps locations from jpmorgan owned smartphones and their transcripts of digitally recorded phone conversations to search  aggregate  sort  and analyze this information for any specific keywords  phrases  and patterns of behavior   the ceo  alex karp describes himself as a socialist  said he doesn t respect anything about trump  however  from wikipedia   he has said that technology companies like palantir have an obligation to support the u s  military  he has defended palantir's contract with u s  immigration and customs enforcement during the controversy over family separations  saying that while separations are  a really tough  complex  jarring moral issue  he favors  a fair but rigorous immigration policy  he has said the u s  government should have a strong hand in tech regulation and that western countries should dominate ai research ,nd4trg

1524,"Once things ""get back to normal"", I propose we all unanimously refuse to ""smile"" at work moving forward.",i have cptsd  and i have been sexually harassed at my job on several occasions  one of the those times  my boss  and coworker  said i should just  smile  and say thank you for the compliment  this shit needs to end now  i refuse to let any job tell me i need to smile  when the job has no right to tell me how to  present myself  for the sake of others   also  fuck makeup  and fuck bras  don't tell me i need to wear it for everyone else's sake  its  my fucking body  my smile  bra  nor makeup affect my ability to perform a job  maybe it affects others who get easily distracted by these trivial things  but that has nothing to do with me   if there's something the pandemic has taught us  its that we hold the power of the economy  and we can just as easily decide  independently on our own  that we have some goddamn standards   we deserve 2 months of vacation time in a year   we deserve a  15 hr minimum wage  and an  in accordance  raise for those who are making more than the minimum wage  so that everyone's wages go up  otherwise the people who've worked years just to get gradual pay raises up to  15 are going to get ripped off   maternity and paternity leave should be standardized   and we deserve sick pay   leave when we are sick  it should be a protected right  so that no employer can ever get away with threatening your job because  sally came in to work sick  so you should be able to do it too  well sally shouldn't have felt pressured into coming into work  making everyone else sick   cuz like  if we don't deserve this  you don't deserve to profit billions off abusive work practices ,nd3hwc

1527,Just some thoughts,so i have been on here awhile  i used to work for a megacorp where these concepts majorily apply  you end up doing all the work while other people sit around doing not shit  pareto principle times 100  in case you haven't ever heard about the pareto principle  it basically stipulates that the most competent people end up doing 80  of the work while everyone else does the 20  however  this gives you a shit ton of leverage with an employer  the more percentage of the work you do  the more useless your other corporate drone employees are    imagine 90  perhaps 95  or even 99  all while management sits there with way higher salaries  how is that justified  so i decided fuck that  i will just start my own business  i won't slave away for a bunch of people to sit there and collect the  fruits of my labor  i collect my own fruits now    amp x200b   they can go fuck themselves ,ncnxf7

1529,Depression is considered a reason you can qualify for social security disability benefits.,i was researching this because i ve had lifelong depression that means that work utterly exhausts me and burns me out  like all of us  right  and wanted to see if i could apply for disability  turns out you can   obviously i am not a lawyer or disability expert  i haven t even applied myself yet  but several sources say if your depression is severe enough that you are unable to work  you might be able to qualify  other qualifying mental conditions  their words  not mine  include anxiety and forms of autism    i m sure it s not an easy process but hopefully it can help some folks here who have diagnoses for these things and might qualify for benefits ,ncluxa
1530,Time is our most valuable possession., i ve seen a lot of posts lately on this subreddit  as i think in the wake of this major pandemic  a lot of us have become a lot more in tune with our inner turmoil regarding where we stand societally    i m 22 years old  born and raised here in the great usa  i did pretty well in school  had some cool friends  and got to take lots of vacations growing up to cool places like hawaii and nyc  i never had food insecurity in my youth  nor did i ever have to worry about not having a roof over my head  i got my first job when i was 16  working part time at the local movie theater  i was so excited to finally be making some money  and for a first job it was pretty fun  i learned a lot about customer service  and slowly but surely i was introduced to all the spoils of my labor  with my newfound bank balance  i suddenly was able to enhance a lot of the things i enjoyed  i made my first  big purchase  after my first paycheck and bought myself a set of copic markers  a coveted art supply by many young illustrators and artists    growing up my mother always stressed that there are three m s to live by in life  the  motivation  to  market  yourself to make  money  money was here to buy opportunities  not things  i pondered this a lot in my teens  starting to think a lot more about my money and what i really wanted to do with it  i still spent very frivolously for a long time  but i had at began to open the thought channels   fast-forward to a year into working at the movie theater  and i was still liking the job pretty well  it paid a whopping 7 25  an hour  and i got maybe 20-25 hours a week  so i was  loaded  as far as being a teenager goes  with no bills to pay or mouths to feed  life was cool    things changed when the yearly movie theater inspection came around  it was a school night  and i had worked a full 8 hour shift after school  our supervisor had told us that closing would take a little longer than normal that evening  as the health inspection was the following morning and some things needed to be deep cleaned  to keep a long story short  they kept us there until almost three in the morning  scrubbing the walls and deep cleaning the gutters  upon telling them that i really needed to go home around midnight  they had said that if i chose to leave  i d be terminated  despite the clear issues with the situation  this was my first real encounter with the insanity of the workplace  i quit the following day by no call no showing    my parents had expressed disappointment in me quitting at the time  however they understood why i quit and it wasn t a huge issue  i found another job fairly quickly  but the movie theater had left a sour taste in my mouth  as i got more involved with work  i saw more and more things that just didn t make sense to me  sick days were okay as long as long you had 24 hour notice  weirdly enough i didn t have a calendar of my upcoming flus  and was penalized when i called in sick with a high fever to my job working at panera bread  i had tested positive for the flu  and had all the proper documentation  they fired me  you gotta love at-will employment    to keep this already longer post a little shorter  i ll say this  i d become highly aware of the lack of humanity in the customer service retail industry  and had become a lot less excited about the three m s and more focused on the one t   time  was my time being well spent in these jobs  was i doing humanity a true service   senior year of high school i tried acid for the first time  it was super fun  and wasn t a super deep experience on the surface  however i strongly believe that at the young age i did it  as well as the pathways that had already started opening up in my head from my work experiences  i had begun an irreversible battle with  work  i began questioning a lot more things  as well as becoming more and more angry with the inequalities and struggles within the average workplace  i became surprised by how much people seemed to obsess over their jobs  and was shocked by the amount of stress that came with them  it was crazy to me how much turmoil people were experiencing just so  generic company title  could continue making bank and destroying whichever ecosystem was being threatened that week in the news   my freshman year of college was when this really kicked into high gear  having done well in high school and scoring a 32 on my act  i had gotten into every school i had applied to  i was motivated  and really wanted to pursue art as a career  because i had seen the way my art was meaningfully impacting others  my parents had always told me that as long as i did well and got into the schools i wanted to get into  that i d have help with paying  this didn t end up being the case    art school is ridiculously expensive  and with my parents high income and my young age of 17  i did not qualify for grants  nor did i have the ability to take out school loans without a co-signer  even with the 50 thousand dollar scholarship i got to the school of the art institute of chicago  it wasn t a viable option  i ended up having to go to the state school 20 minutes from my hometown  in a town that smelled of cow shit and regret  i hated it  despite the full tuition scholarship i received there  i had been doing well in my classes  and slowly began enjoying it a bit more  i met a few friends  and began embracing the experience  after all  i was lucky to be there    at this point i had been doing psychedelics more regularly  and had become a lot more familiar with my inner voice  at least  i was able to be a bit more introspective than i had been previously   my third month of college  i was involved in a hit and run accident due to a drunk driver in a stolen car  i had been a passenger in my roommates car  and the drunk driver had hit us t-bone style on my side after running through a stop sign  i was lucky  had we been a foot further down the road  i would have been crushed  the drunk driver seemed fine  and i do remember him sort of hobbling out the car with a bottle in his hand and limping off into the night  very much like some shitty scene in a movie  i still very much remember the sensation of shock and pain of our car being hit and then crashing into a pole  smoke filling the cabin and flames erupting from the engine  i was so scared to move  and the next thing i knew i was on the street 30 feet away from the car  i had blacked out and some bystanders had pulled me out while the flames grew larger  i m very fortunate that outside of the concussion and cuts and bruises  i was okay    i dropped out of college shortly after  having had difficulty with focusing on class following the accident  i became very depressed  stopped eating  and stopped doing artwork  my parents had just gotten divorced  and upon telling them i was dropping out  they wished me luck and sent me off into the world on my own  i get their frustration with me leaving such an  opportunity  but the three  m s  yet again were turned by the one  t  time    in the 5 years since  i have worked over 10 jobs  lived in my car  taught english in costa rica  was a ski instructor  traveled cross country living in my suv  and consistently i have been very broke  my dad is no longer a part of my life  he has been living in hawaii for the past few years  and we haven t spoke  my mom has occasionally been there for me in times of struggle  and i even moved back in with her when i threw my back out working at whole foods  which required a back surgery that was not covered by workmans comp due to my short tenure there    despite all these great ups and downs  i have consistently been labeled as a failure by my mother  a failure to launch  a failure to commit  and failure to grow  i ve done a ton mental gymnastics trying to explain myself  to reach understanding  and to be heard in a meaningful way    at this point  i m absolutely tired of being taken advantage of by companies just because of my  financial desperation  it s expensive to have a job  first off  you need money to buy gas to get to work  and if your home isn t very close  you need money for your car and the repairs it will need from commuting every day  you need money to pay the obnoxiously high rent that ends up being more than have your income  and you need money to feed yourself  save money  if you re lucky enough  you might be able to put away 100  a month  but probably not  because if you can t afford to treat yourself even a little  you ll probably erode to the point of not being able to work anyways    so i guess this post is really just me trying to say fuck it  i m done trying to change my inner flame just so i can help make sure that the corporations actively killing our planet  lobbying our rights away  and herding the average american into whether slavery can continue to prosper    i m tired  and i m choosing me over them  and you should too  quit that fucking job  make them hurt  make them realize that without us  they re nothing  otherwise nothing is going to change  i m not  lazy  and i m not unwilling to work  i m unwilling to be a commodity to be bought and sold for pennies on the dollar  i want to spend my time focusing on real issues  people all around the globe are being slaughtered in modern day holocausts  i can t spend my time focused on wether or not linda is satisfied with her chicken cobb salad or bob is going to come back after he wasn t satisfied with the experience he had at the whole foods deli counter    time is what matters  use it wisely ,nchm00
1531,"How School and Work, Actually Work",i detest working  it's so horrible  it makes me so miserable  i think we all can relate   i think i understands why  this also explains how school works as well   do you remember during school  before big exams  midterms  projects - you feel a lot of stress and anxiety  it builds up until you finish taking that exam or finish that project  then it feels like you are happy afterwards  but i think it is important to note what is really actually happening   you only feel good because you are eliminating that stressful event from your life  it's not that taking the exam itself makes you feel good  it only feels good to eliminate the stress and anxiety that you had shortly experienced beforehand    i think a lot of people mistake this and think that doing stuff will actually lead to happiness but often times  it is purely the elimination of the negative state that feels good and is not an actual pleasurable experience itself    this leads to work  of course  people always claim working makes them feel better  etc  but really i think work generates in them all these negative states  anxiety  stress  frustration  anger  etc  thus  when they finally reach the weekend it's tgif  right   people think working is fulfilling them but really all that happens is this generation of pain from work  which we all know too well  and elimination of that stress when projects complete  days complete  weekends come  etc   the problem is that the cycle just happens over and over and over again  i think that leads all of us to be very miserable people  no longer does the pain elimination from completing anything feel good anymore  it's just constantly starting back over again with a new day of work  over and over again  and it is maddening    i think this provides insight into how some people  mistake  work as being rewarding  and how many on this subreddit do not agree  a lot of people live in that pain and pain elimination cycle and thus think finishing a hard day of work makes them happy  but really it's just being done with the bullshit that day that is giving them a sense of relief  they make the mistake of pain reduction being pleasure  but it is really just pain reduction  and that's all ,nc8cx4

1611,DAE Feel Uncomfortable Submitting to a Drug Test for an Employer?,i just turned down a job for an employer in a state where weed is completely illegal  even for therapy  therapy maybe for veterans can't even happen there  so i tried to rationalize with hr prior to it  like  if i show you that the use has been recommended by a doctor  can we have a conversation about its legitimacy     no  it's black and white in the manual    ok  bye    but is bodily autonomy not valued in our country  you have a right to privacy  and why should your employer  who is likely getting your labor at a discount  also get unfettered access to see what's in your body  for free    in this case they did drug tests to show their clients they have a  robust safety program  and to save on their insurance  of course they don't tell the employees they do that  they also don't strictly tell them that if they were to get injured on the jobsite  the first priority for them would be to get access to your bodily fluids so that they can see if they can blame you for the accident that may have jeopardized your life   oh  he did blow  this pipe falling on his head was his fault  again  for insurance to be cheaper    it's like employers are telling them to cover a certain cost for them  if you add up what they save on insurance and the revenue from the client they've gained for drug testing  and divide that by the number of employees  possibly weighted by however you want to measure importance  you'd get the cost that each employee contributes to the company  why are they not also being compensated for that    lastly  i informed them i'd do the job on a 1099 basis or as an independent contractor so they could get the employee doing the work  the reason they  told  me they wanted to hire me was because i was the best fit  but we could get around that pesky drug test requirement  hard no from them  so  did they actually want me to do the job because i'd get it done  or did they want to be able to completely control the person they put in that position and thought i'd be the best fir to be controlled    i'm certain other parts of the world think it would be absurd to provide bodily fluids to an employer so they can gauge how much they can trust you    end of rant ,nbh5k1

Please end this madness immediately!!,i'm a certified massage therapist and i've been doing this for 7 years  this industry is so up and down like a goddamn roller coaster and the pay is so unstable if i knew about this before going to massage school i wouldn't have wasted my time and i would have just gone back to university and got in my biochemistry degree  i went to massage school because i thought i could make a good living and put myself through university to get my biochemistry degree so that i can get a real career making real money  i was highly mistaken   so just recently in the last few weeks i quit my weekend job at this chain corporate spa because i was absolutely sick and tired of getting paid only about  15 per hour after taxes and before tips  people don't even tip that well there  i put out a bunch of ads and i have gone independent charging up to  125 for a one hour massage depending on what sort of customizations the client wants  i have a portable massage table and i do outcalls at the client's homes and in calls at my home  i made  1 000 cash under the table in the first week and a half but i'm really afraid that that was just good luck because this week is not as busy and a few people have had to cancel because they either contact me too late in the day and they don't fucking understand that you should book a damn massage in advance  like they will literally contact me at 10 00 p m  asking for a massage right now like are you fucking serious  these people have no respect for my time  or they ask me if i give happy endings or do anything extra like that which i don't  or they don't want to wear a mask when they come to my house  i seriously shouldn't have to deal with this bullshit  clients don't respect my time  clients don't want to wear a damn mask  and all the asshole clients that asked me about erotic services    so yeah i'm just sick and tired of having to make bullshit money  i could enjoy this a lot more if i didn't have to worry about having to make money  biden needs to hurry up and give me my fucking universal basic income already  i want to go back to real school  trade school is bullshit  and get my damn degree so i can have more options for jobs other than shitty massage jobs  before i got licensed for massage back in 2014  i was doing retail and food service jobs and i don't have any other qualifications and i would rather commit suicide than go back to working in retail and food service so i'm kind of stuck with this massage career that i'm extremely disappointed with    so yeah i have my own business now but it's bullshit  i feel like i have to market myself more than i'm actually doing actual massage  and then i have to deal with bullshit from clients  really shouldn't have to be dealing with any of this ,nbuqss

1713,Actually you are entitled to a job that pays at least satisfactorily in America/Western countries,western countries  america being a prominent example  have sold themselves as a place where with sufficient labour you can live at least a comfortable existence  comfortable means you can afford the necessities such as housing  food  education  utilities and with enough left over for sufficient leisure  that is one of the key ideas of the 'american dream' or  insert your western country  dream    western countries still advertise themselves as this  but hang on  if there's more and more people being homeless  more and more people barely scraping by  the middle class slowly evaporating so you only really have a binary have or have not class  many people are going to question if the dream is still real  the last thing you want people to do is wake up  if enough people are falling down that you can't hide it anymore  that's when everyone starts to wake up  california is a good example of this  with many other places soon to follow in suit    so to keep the dream going everyone is actually entitled to a sufficient paying job to live comfortably  otherwise western countries will need to change their advertising as a dream for the minority and a nightmare for the majority  if they're honest like that  then i guess yes you ain't entitled to a reasonable job  you can decide if you want to live there    so boomers telling millennials they're not entitled to a good job is a really dumb idea  especially if they're relying on the younger generations for their healthcare and social security  but of course ol boomers think that they're the only ones who should get the sunshine  others exist just to please them    a remember a minimum wage means you can afford the bare minimum with a little left over ,nbd4zh

1781,"Right-to-work seems a misnomer, more like right-to-terminate. How is this ethical in a system that requires money to survive?",i understand that the intention in these kinds of us  right to work  laws is to give away the power of those requiring employment to the employer  however  we are also seeing the downside of employers having that power since they can then legally pay less than is required to live  dismal work conditions  and overwork  where there are rampant strikes and refusal to work  for any work that can be automated or done overseas for cheaper  the jobs disappear  that seems like poor planning on the part of the 1  since people can't buy products  amp  services  without income  and if too many people are not working the system shuts down  people get upset and unrest begins  this cycle has already repeated multiple times in history and is happening now yet i've seen no meaningful changes proposed besides taking away unemployment to force people to work  but if working doesn't actually allow people to pay for basic needs  then on some level it makes more sense to just band together with other exploited people and refuse to work  am i missing something  why not have laws against firing employees for no reason like some other capitalist countries  that at least puts off potential unrest and creates a  often false but effective  feeling of stability in the long run  am i missing something   its almost like these policies are misnamed on purpose and also set up to encourage people to revolt  a populace of desperate  disenfranchised people is dangerous to the ruling classes  right ,nariw7

1806,Cliché Rant,i recently got back from my first vacation of the year  a four day trip to colorado with my mom for mother's day  it was nice  i got to spend time with my mom and get out of town and i even took an extra day off to recuperate after getting back as vacations can be exhausting in themselves  the extra day off was just spent sleeping and i felt that i wasted it considering the rest of the week was going to be spent catching up on the paperwork and correspondence that was inevitably going to pile up since i'm the only one that knows the ins and outs of my position  using a measly two days of pto and the weekend for my vacation has already created overtime for myself and it feels like i'm being punished   i almost tasted freedom in the trip  but the knowledge of the busy upcoming week was always in the back of my mind  what am i even doing this for  i did not get a higher education after high school  i didn't know what i wanted to do and i'm thankful my younger self didn't incur any debt  i honestly couldn't imagine that pressure  i've worked in my field for around 10 years now and make around 46k annually which i thought was decent considering the no debt situation  i've been frugal and responsible with my money my entire adult life  i'll be 30 this year  but i can't even afford a fucking house in the town i live  with closing costs and a down payment i could comfortably afford a house in the  120- 125 000 range  but guess what  any houses that price in my town are absolute shitholes or are literally over 100 years old with crumbling foundations  i looked at a foreclosure for  120 000 and the repairs put me way over budget  it's so fucking depressing  i lived my 20s hopping from relationship to relationship  got married then divorced two months later after she cheated on me  i've decided to not try to focus on relationships to find happiness but that also means i probably will never be able to afford a house where i live considering i'd need another's income to help me pay for anything livable    so now that working to support a family is out of the picture  what's the point  like many others in this sub i am so mentally and physically drained at the end of the day that i have no ambition or energy for my hobbies  the weekends are spent catching up on chores and all the books  games  movies  shows  crafts and outdoor activities i like to partake in are brushed aside so that i'm not living in squalor  i'm thankful i have a support group of friends and family to keep me sane  without them i would've committed suicide long ago  but they all seem to be in the same boat i'm in  we regularly gather for board-game nights or dinner but you can see the exhaustion in all of them  who does this system satisfy  in my area the gap between the poor and blue collar is almost non-existent  one bad week and some of my friends might be financially in shambles    i've always fantasized about living in a camper  i've done research and calculated the cost of a yearly lot rental in a town i'd like to live in but i'm afraid to take that leap  my dad is getting older and cuts trees as a side-gig and helping him through the years i would be fairly comfortable taking over that business  i just don't know if there would be enough work throughout the year to support me  if there was a tree or two a week i think i could live comfortably and have the majority of the week to myself to fuck off and pursue my interests  but the fear of not having insurance  getting hurt and being unable to work really does scare me  at the same time  right now i really don't feel like i'm living my one life to anywhere near the extent i could be  another issue with that plan is being judged for living in a camper in a grungy trailer court  i'd like to say it wouldn't bother me  but it'd be hard to take a friend or date home and expect them not to be sketched out  i also prided myself on carving my own legacy and would be slightly disappointed in myself for having to pick up the business that my dad built  although i think i'd get over that one eventually  today i've felt hopeless trying to weigh the two options i can think of  i'm not a risk taker but i think something has to change here  thank you for reading    amp x200b   tl dr  working sucks  i'm debating moving into a camper and cutting trees once or twice a week ,nablbb

1829,I Cant Wait to Leave This Job,ive been with this company for a number of years  and seemingly had a great time moving my way up the corporate ladder  then once the pandemic hit and we were all wfh  the company seemed to stop caring about the effort i put into trying to attain a better promotion to trainer or supervisor  the amount of effort you put into a company does not matter to most of these owners  nor their leadership  henchmen supervisors   i was ignored when i went through the interview process for team lead as the feedback i received was that i did not provide enough substance over other interviewees  what makes me feel even worse is that the couple of people that were promoted over me were not even doing the job they were supposed to as they got pulled aside to handle other projects   my previous leadership tried telling me that they also take into consideration how interviewees take a decline of promotion and said the company likes those who take the feedback and improve for next time  this guy was truly a piece of work too - he would talk shit to me about other employees during our  coaching  sessions   its taken me too long to realize that i was just lucky for some time  and now i can only make more at this company if they say i can be promoted  because get this - they say im nearing my wage cap  lol     tl dr - i busted my ass for this company  working up the  ladder  and eventually hit a proverbial wall since the company doesn't like me,nav5o4

1833,Why work is toxic,i started searching for job 1 year after completing bachelor's in computer science  i attended the amazon sde interview and i had 8 rounds of interview after that i was told i was not up to the mark with sde as i was lacking amazon leadership principles and they gave me support engineer role  and they promised me that they would convert me to sde in a year  when i joined for work my manager didnt allow me to attend bootcamp and gave me data analysis and anamoly detection work in the system and i had to design sql queries and data presentations  for customers to tally every month amazon bank balance thus report generation takes like 120 queries to be run and the consolidated one from the results is the report it takes days to trace back where the problem is when we can't tally   i have been given these repetitive tasks that takes a lot of time each query runs for like 30 min and they rejected my request for more resource for fast computation  during this pandemic i was in wfh and works like 15 hours a day average and in the start of the month i had to work sleepless to achieve the goal that they set   my team member lied that he had done the system migration from europe to india and he was taking alot of leaves  i found that he been telling lies  i could see the reports are generated from data and services located in europe  i asked him about this and he lied to me too and started avoiding me  i told my manager that it will be a big issue instead of telling the truth to customer team my manager asks me to lie his exact words  how will the clients know if you don't tell  it's been bothering me a lot as i was forced to lie i was feeling a lot of pressure when i had to talk to customer amazon team manager i told my manager that i am not comfortable at all i was taking leaves to avoid talking to the customer team too i even told this to my manager after a month my manager calls me and says that amazon employees should comport the problem and talks leadership principle bs i was blamed for things that they failed to do   my manager lied to them after a month that the system in india is having issue and they have to fix it and starts the migration   after 9 months suddenly i was assigned a coding work to make 2 cli i have no experience on amazon systems and i was given 1 week to complete it and the reason my manager gave me was to shift me to sde  i had no experience in java  i don't know the work environments and there were no documentations for my team i had to nag the sde's for everything  meanwhile my manager goes to holiday this cli work is supposed to be completed in a week and the customer amazon team's manager is yelling that i am not available to solve their issue tickets and complaining to my manager who is in holiday  my manager calls me and shouts at me that i should take ownership and tells the same old amazon leadership principle bs   i was able to complete the cli within the time  and after that my manager started shoutong at me for things that i have no control over in team meetings just to put me in blame  my maanger told his manager that they completed a goal months back which we didn't actually start just to get high ratings and already published a success story  and me and 2 sde in my team had to work weekends and all nighters to complete it  just to make our manager escape from his lies  my manager and the customer amazon manager both got promotion for their lies  we came to know it from other team   suddenly my manager started adding negative feedback to my career development page that i am not improving and he has been guiding me for long time  which is complete bs  he started talking to me a month back and had a session of 10 min per week they didn't even let me learn their systems first and expected me to work right away and gives deadlines needed for a  experienced sde   and my manager says that i am not working enough  and states that all amazonian work overtime to complete their goals  i haven't seen my manager work before 11 am and after 6 am in office  he  won't even talk with customer team to schedule our teams work  also he rejects all my internet bill reimbursement with silly reasons and i stopped applying for them   everyone is getting desk chairs  extra montiors and power backup in my team  he started shouting in team meetings for everything   i was overworked  i woke up one day and was feeling very sick and went to hospital and came back   my manager calls me and asks why didn't i join the meeting and started yelling  i told him that i was sick and i'll be taking the day off  he told me that he don't care about my health and yells  the only thing needed is the work to be completed in time i started crying i don't know what to do its was my first job  i was working that day sick  after that day i called him and said that i quit  he said ok and hang up and not even asked the reason  feels like this was his goal after all  he didn't even told the team that i'll be leaving in a month  there's no documentation of the work i do iasked him whether i should create a doc  he asked me to do the usual work  and in the last day he told my team that i'll be leaving  and i didn't even attend the farewell video call   its been 6 months and i don't want to work anymore ,nahcdb

1847,I left a Toxic Mess of a Job,i've worked in insurance for 4 years  1 year in auto and 3 in homeowners  i had just come off of leaving a boring  dead-end security job that had left me both unfulfilled and constantly stressed i didn't have enough money to live off of  not to mention  that security job started requiring more and more frequent hours and my coworkers were growing more and more hostile as the job got worse   i settled into insurance for the first year  really feeling valued  like my work mattered  i was helping people  right  i swallowed my doubts and did my best but decided to move to a different department  hoping to find something a tinge less stressful  i found another boring job where i was basically a tasky jockey who would just do whatever the office was asking of me  what's more  the boredom set in between spikes in stressing out as the very position i was in caused friction with the rest of the department  we were responsible for sorting tasks and sending them to people because  despite their importance  no one had figured out how to dole them out any other way  i also struggled to find things to keep myself looking busy and was constantly talked to about not getting enough numbers   so i  for a month  knuckled down and did my best  i applied for a higher position and  after some time  got it  i had to go back through training but i like learning and i've never minded this so i leapt at the opportunity  i get  on the floor  as they say soon after getting out of training and i'm producing great numbers  it's stressful  i make constant mistakes  but i keep it up  the first year didn't go amazing  was threatened with physical violence a couple of times  and if you've ever done insurance adjusting  you know that people will lie and misrepresent on a daily basis  but i got home at 6 30 every day and i thought i could handle it until i had enough experience to find another job   my final year in insurance  covid hit  everyone was sent home  we thought it's temporary so no one really planned anything out  i was still expected to follow strict rules about timing  but to make sure that we do  they start dropping extra tasks and start watching time not answering calls very carefully  by the end of the year  i was taking days off because of the stress and dealing with stress-induced stomach problems  i had picked up drinking more than i ever had in the past and worse  i thought i was weak because  you're working from home  this is so easy  i managed to get on the wrong side of a vengeful agent  i made it through by the skin of my teeth and by grinding away and going beyond  but i'm constantly tripped up as more work is directed my way   things started to even out as we go into winter  which was when everything slows down for this department i was a part of    spring early summer was when the department was most busy with the lowest amount coming in in the winter   and then  during the slow season  during a period when we have the least amount of calls and the lowest amount of mail to respond to  they called for overtime  the excuse was that we've slipped behind that quarter but i started looking at it and i couldn't figure it out  we were ahead of every queue  i thought it would last a week  but i worked overtime on christmas eve and new years eve  the whole rest of the month too  something was screaming in my head because we'd never pulled overtime  never    then this year  the texas ice storm hit  my department didn't even handle those claims  but we were expected to answer the calls and pull 60 hour weeks--this lasted three weeks--with half our staff moved over specifically to dealing with that  i wasn't even given any training for this and people would transfer calls to me  i broke down in front of a customer because their house was still flooding and i didn't know what to do  i didn't know what to tell them except mitigate and someone would be out eventually  the whole reason i had stayed with this job  the idea i was helping people  and for ten hours a day  every other call i was the worthless sack of shit they threw at the problem pants down  for 6 days a week    i only made it through that because of my friends  i am eternally grateful for every call i made to them to get through that    things went back to normal  but i wasn't able to ignore the problems with the job anymore  everyday was confrontation  everyday was lies  everyday was being the bad guy in someone's story  being a limp-wristed  burnt out goliath in some david's tale  and then  at the quarter's end  they started enforcing overtime  threatening if we didn't pick up the pace  they'd ratchet back up to 60 hour weeks   i've been unemployed almost a month now  didn't have anything else to go to  i'm still feeling the toxicity of that job but everyday i'm feeling a little better  i know i have to go back and work again at some point but man  i really pray i never have to adjust another claim    thanks for getting through all this if you did ,n9dvi0

1849,Honest questions,i just discovered this subreddit today and it seems a majority of the people complaining about low paying jobs seem to be in the fast food industry  i have no intent to belittle anyone who works any job   my question is this  would you not agree that working in fast food or other low paying jobs is completely related to level of skill required to do the job  that fast-food employment is not designed to be a career  but merely a stepping stone to develop further skills and education to acquire high paying high skill jobs    because most fast food workers where i live it's a teenagers first job and they are planning a future ,n9g7d6

I haven't been this happy in years, if ever.",first and foremost  i'm not celebrating the death and misery covid has caused for billions  i wish the worldwide near year-long hiatus  for many countries  was not due to a virus   nonetheless  i think the only way i could leave my miserable job  get the mental help needed  and regain control in my life was something as drastic as a worldwide freakin' pandemic  i worked in a job that left me in tears almost daily  i started drinking more to numb the pain  i stopped trusting people  at all  my social anxiety was so bad  my voice would shake and croak when talking to people  i felt trapped  i'd fantasize of how i'd take my life  i googled locations where i'd do it and how i'd do it   shortly before my work temporarily closed down in march  i told myself  next week  next week i'm submitting my 2 weeks notice  i calculated how long i could survive off of my savings  by a thread  before my partner graduated college and we could move in together    i had my letter typed out  it was literally just one working day before submitting my notice when work closed down  at one point my employers were accepting volunteers  it was voluntary  but fuck that  i thought  so i didn't volunteer  however  at one point volunteering was explicitly stated as voluntary  but truly implicitly expected that we return as  essential workers  this was late may 2020 or so  however  i received a blessing disguise when hr sent me a lay off notice due to  covid  but i know the real reason was due to me sending a demand letter for unpaid wages  after hr had ignored my multiple emails since january of that year  i was committed to filling that wage claim and kept a detailed log   however  i was offered severance  though meager  and thus eligible for unemployment being laid off  the stress of depleting my savings was greatly mitigated  especially with bonus federal payments throughout the year    during that time  i finally got therapy  medication  and time to actually fucking  relax  i had been working for 50 hours a week  for well over a year  i stopped enjoying life  i really forgot it all  my life was on autopilot  my depression was really difficult for my partner to handle  too  i have never been on unemployment in my life  but i had never been this happy in my life    now  my last job has fucked me  in ways therapy won't completely reverse  it's greatly limited other career paths i can choose to not make me miserable  e g  i prefer solo work  and made me realize how much i simply do not want to work a 9-5  the pandemic has given me the time and money needed to pursue something else so i have hope of leaving the rat race  and like many many others  especially on this sub  realize my worth and what's truly  important in this life   tl dr the pandemic was the catalyst to being fired  but because of it  i was eligible for unemployment and got the help needed to treat my terrible depression  i've now had the time to pursue something i'm actually passionate about  which will greatly reduce my need to work and contribute to a content work life balance ,n9q3l6
1925,"I'm working up the courage to turn down a ""great opportunity""",i've reached the final stage of a long  stressful interview process and i'm waiting to hear back if i got the job  their responses have been really positive and they told me i'm their number 1 contender  so it's seeming likely i'll get an offer  it's a full-time permanent position with health benefits at a big charity organization  when i first graduated university  it would have been my dream job   but it's been nearly six years since i graduated  and in that time i've come to realize i am not built for the 9-5 grind  working for charities has helped a bit in terms of motivation  i'm helping to make the world a better place  but it's still mostly an identical situation in terms of toxic office culture  long hours  low pay  no freedom   my whole life i've dreamed of becoming a published author  but i've always been told to pursue a  real career  i've been told that writing can be my  fun hobby  but it's very unlikely i'll ever make any real money from it  and it's true  most writers have a  day job  so i got my day job and joined the grind   it didn't go very well  within three years my mental health plummeted  i became extremely depressed and started drinking and smoking weed every night to cope  and i stopped writing  i didn't write for nearly two years  it got so bad that i sought out an addictions counselor  i was nearing the end of a full-time temp office job  and extremely miserable  when the contract ended  my therapist encouraged me not to seek out another traditional full-time job right away  i told her how i'd stopped writing  and she encouraged me to take some writing classes  i got a part-time job at a coffee shop and started attending a creative writing certificate program  a year passed and i was able to get my substance use under control and start writing a new novel  i felt happy again for the first time in so long    since then i've been working part-time contract jobs that make me enough money to get by  and give me the freedom to set my own schedule and pursue my actual dream  which is writing  writing is the only work that has ever given me happiness  i know it is unlikely that it will ever make me any real money  but i'm okay with that  i would rather be happy and poor than rich and miserable    but the problem is --my fiance  amp  family don't see things this way  my fiance understands a little bit better than my family  mostly because he's experienced my addiction struggle firsthand  but he still thinks i should take this  great opportunity  he is a true-believer capitalist workaholic who is very anxious about saving money for our future  he really believes that  sucking it up  and working the grind every single day is the best thing he can do for our future children  we've been together 11 years and i love him so much  and in every other way we are a great match and he's so supportive  but he's having so much trouble understanding why i don't want this  great opportunity  and my family is much the same    i feel so pressured to take the job  i keep hoping for a rejection email  part of me thinks that if i get it  i should say yes  i should at least see how it goes  give it a 3 month probation period - maybe it won't be as bad as i think  but the other part of me knows that if it wasn't for the pressure from my family   capitalist society  i wouldn't have even applied to this job in the first place  so maybe i should just turn it down  even if no one but me understands why  but hopefully you all understand ,n9esxr

most of them still don't know  they worried about me just sitting at home playing video games  which  btw  are shown to help people with various forms of ptsd  they worried about how i'd be able to get back into the workforce  my job skills stagnating  even now i can tell they struggle to relate to me because i don't have a job  thus i don't have a label  they worry about me missing out on making money  that i could earn more working  that i'm self-sabotaging my life   if you were to ask them if i have value as a person  even not working  they'd say  of course  but the reality is they can't conceive of a life without a job  a label  a title  a wage  i know this because i was there  i bragged about working 100 hour weeks  juxtapose that with being the hr person who argued with management that the cost benefit ratio for more hourly workers was better than paying people overtime  tired people are more likely to cut corners  make mistakes  get hurt thus raising our reject rate  qa issues  worker's comp insurance premiums  etc  it's so much harder to advocate for ourselves than it is to advocate for others  for us  its a sacrifice - we're willing martyrs to the almighty dollar  and when we 'get there' we tell ourselves  i suffered through it  so it couldn't be that bad  so the cycle continues   money is key here  no matter how much i made  it always felt that i was going into more and more debt  get a promotion  need better clothes to fit in  can't wear walmart in the c-suite after all  i can either afford rent in the area i work but not food  or rent and food with an hour plus commute  of course  that commute takes gas  puts wear and tear on my vehicle  but most importantly takes time  that hour commute  one way  becomes 2 hours a day  or 10 hours for a 5 day work week  so if you're pulling 40 hours  you're really pulling 50  more often than not  you're likely working at least 60 hours a week so that's 70 hours of time allocated to work  there are 120 hours in a 5 day work week  after pulling a 14 hour day you have 10 hours to cook eat  sleep  take care of personal hygiene  spend time with family  personal health  exercise self care  before you rinse repeat the next work day  that's simply not enough time so you either eat into one of your 2 days off or drop things the list  exercise self care being the most common    for me  thankfully  the va acknowledged the shit show they put me through and granted my disability  i used to feel guilty about being on disability but as my therapist said  i frontloaded my contribution to society  with my service and what i went through      do i plan on going back to work after completing my treatment  nope  i plan on going back to school to better myself  follow my passions and then volunteer my services to others  i've budgeted my finances to be able to afford a comfortable life on my current pension  there are people who need the type of jobs that i'm qualified for because they don't have that safety net  i still struggle with seeing my own value and i'm still looking for that passion or hobby  over 40 years of brain washing is hard to overcome  after all  i don't know if my experience resonates with anyone but i needed to say this and share my struggle    tl dr you don't need a job nearly as much as you need a life ,n9dw2e
1957,Free healthcare is not so great how you imagine it,i see lots of people from us wanting to have free healthcare  but i'm not sure  if they are realizing those consequences   i live in czech republic  we have healthcare  that we call free  every month i see  that government takes my money on healthcare  and yeah  it's good that they won't throw me out  if i don't have insurance    but you have no option to not pay it  or pay more for better services  thanks to this is our healthcare in really bad shape  it's not like we don't have good universities  but good medical workers always run away abroad  where they won't make 16 hour shifts for the same as me on customer support   so free healthcare  but actually nobody cares  yes  if i'd have cancer  i would be maybe in best hands  we have really great oncologists  but if my father has leiden mutation  he will get help  but not so much    he had twice lung embolism  first time nobody knew  that he has leiden  it was few minutes before he'd be dead  so they started to medicate him  after a month he was back  on diet and so on and so on  and he's got medicine  that he should take til the end of his life  otherwise embolism could happen again   this medicine is really expensive  and you know what insurance company does to not pay for it whole life  after a year they will give you much cheaper and al oat non-effective ones  and if you have another embolism  you will get more expensive ones   so my father need to have embolism once per year  to have proper medication  and he couldn't get it to pay for it    luckily he has doctor friend  so they figured something out with it  but that second embolism was not necessary   it's not like people doesn't want to pay more  they don't have the option  and if you'd see our hospitals i've got lice in one    and this is only tip of an iceberg  so many awful stories  so should i be grateful  when i need to spend another at least 100 dollars per month for fyziotherapy because of scoliosis  another 100 for therapy  and what about dental  it's business here and government pays only for something  and they won't give you materials  that is paid by government  they put the most expensive ones to your mouth without telling you  then they are surprised  that you don't have 1000 dollars in your pocket   think about that and i hope that it's only exception and free healthcare doesn't look like this everywhere  i hate capitalism and when i see what capitalism did to healthcare in us  i'm genuinely sad   p s  sick leave is benefit here  you have government sick leave  but you cannot leave your house at all and you will get only 70  of salary  so everyone's taking vacation when they are sick  because with czech wages almost nobody can afford to have lower salary ,n9dvul

1959,I realized that the hustle culture kinda starts as a kid where i live.,i live in asia  and the culture of studying where i live is kinda bad   like mnay kids have to go to tuition centres for hours after an already tiring school day  and some even have many  extracurriculars every week   it's bad   probably caused by the fact that at 12  you have to do interviews at many schools  and 3 exams from 5th to 6th grade which secondary schools use to judge whether you're accepted or not   also  many extra curriculars make you look great on paper  so that's a big motivator   exams are often hard that just listening at school isn't enough  and you have to go to tuition or you're lagging behind   i'm fortunate to not have such a jam packed sched  but the school i'm in is also kinda top  and the stress of having 16 exams 2 and a half weeks later at 13 might be the reason i was crying in class    no  am not making this up   i'm pretty sure there's kids who have no passions besides scrolling social media because they can't do anything they enjoy  every ounce of free time is crammed with study tuition and stuff    all in all  the culture of  winning at the starting line  by parents cramming their kids schedules and doing it cuz other parents are doing so  it's probably also prepping em for the culture of working overtime without much pay  and not having ambitions besides work   kinda depresssing tbh,n9wwpz
1960,I just came to realize how much of my expenses are work-related.,after realizing how i hate working and that retiring early is my biggest career goal  i started tracking every expense and adopted a minimalist lifestyle allowing me to live below my means and perhaps retire a bit earlier  after doing this for some months  i  just came to realize how much of my expenses are work-related     the biggest one is perhaps renting an apartment in an expensive city  since cities with more jobs tend to be much more expensive to rent in  rent in my hometown is around  300  compared to my current rent 1500  which is the cheapest i could find   the second one is transportation  since it s nearly impossible to commute every day without a car  unless you live in an even more expensive part of the city   since i love cars  i would have gotten the car even if i didn t have to work anyway  but the mileage  gas  and maintenance fees really add up when commuting 30 miles a day    the third one  perhaps less direct  but pretty common is that since i don t have time to enjoy the little things   i tend to spend more on stuff that provide instant gratification  or have unrealistic expectations for my weekends  resulting in overspending   combine these three  especially the first two  and it amounts to about  2000 a month extra    while depressing  i started to think about the possibilities of moving back to my hometown and do my own thing  even if i would earn more in the city  the landlords are gonna take it away anyway ,n9sciq
1961,Thank you for helping me see,i stopped by this subreddit just to see what was up about a month ago  after seeing all the posts it got me to think about my pay and how i haven t gotten a raise in close to 2 years  worked 3 years total at a corporate retail job  after doing some digging i found that not only am i being underpaid to begin with  but when i got rehired  took a 9 month hiatus after two years for 7 months because i moved  they docked me 25c  i also found out that the new hire with less experience is making a dollar and a half more than me  after voicing my concerns my manager has been avoiding me for 2 weeks by leaving 5 hours early every shift and sticking us with the reduced manpower  after all the shit i ve done just for him to disrespect me like this  this subreddit is 100  right and the only thing i regret is not coming here sooner to see how much i ve been getting abused  i put in my two weeks today  but after the way they treated me i think they ll be lucky if i show up for it tbh   thank you guys  you really helped me out and opened my eyes ,n9yxdp

1963,"Should I stick it through a horrible job to have a chance at being promoted to a better, less stressful job under the same employer?",earlier i made a post about how i'm nearing my breaking point  well  here it is  my job has currently gotten even worse  we've lost 5 people effectively  our customer demand is getting higher as more and more people start coming out of quarantine and summer kicks off   the only thing keeping me here is because  2 days a week  i get out of the customer-facing food service hell and i get to work by myself in a one man department that i find very low stress and actually enjoyable    i've been told i'm next in line to manage that department and have even covered for the current manager for a whole week before   however i have no idea when he is leaving or moving up  he seems to be dragging his feet  right now it's the only route i have upwards because the food service job is a dead end    but i just can't take it anymore  today was awful  we barely scrape by each day   horribly understaffed with constant customers  and no structure from management  no lines or signs to help keep customers in check   no one is assigned to do one specific job for the day  we just float around hoping that our stuff gets done  i can't tell you how many times i've started a task  had to drop it for a customer  and then when finished had to immediately drop the task again because 5 people showed up out of nowhere all giving me the evil eye because i didn't immediately get on my knees to serve them  humans were not meant to be under this much stress for 8 hours    i just don't know what to do  i feel like any attempt to have a conversation with my manager will fall on deaf ears because of how understaffed we are    i don't blame anyone for walking out on jobs like this  but i really want to have that other job because it's    consistent scheduling  consistent workload  little to no customer interaction  40 hours a week with benefits and pay raise  covering for the current manager was the easiest 40 hours of my life  but is it worth it to be worked like a dog in the other department until the current manager moves on  i just don't know what to do  i feel stuck ,n9p083

2003,I feel like I discovered a cheat code.,i'm 27  m  i grew up extremely poor in the american south  we literally didn't have a front door  as a kid i daydreamed about how awesome my life would be living in the big city with a fancy job and 40 dollar haircut and money to blow in my bank account   like most of you all i ever heard was get a good job with benefits  work yourself to death for 40 years and move to florida  florida probably won't even exist in 40 years   after high school i joined the military to pay for college   when i returned stateside i went to college and ended up with a graduate degree and shortly thereafter moved to california for a  great  job before i realized what a long con this entire deal is  why am i working full time with a 2 hour commute each day to barely afford to pay rent and jam down processed foods that are slowly killing me  maybe this situation made my resume look good  but fuck a resume  if i hate working in general  why would i care if this piece of paper makes me attractive to other employers  who i don't want to work for  i was flabbergasted that having a  good  job was barely enough to sustain myself and sad for other people in a similar boat  most americans work full time and yet most can not afford to come up with 400 dollars for an emergency  that is a con   it was a hard pill to shallow that almost every working person is having their labor and time on earth exploited for the benefit of the rich  but once you understand that you can change the rules of the game   i created a budget to understand what it was that i needed to sustain a fulfilling life for myself  if i could really figure out how much money i needed to make to support the life i wanted  i could eliminate a lot of waste along the way  even if that meant quitting my job    if i could go a week without any given expense  i probably didn't need it  and therefore i shouldn't be spending money on it  i realized that the only thing i really needed was food  water and shelter  and novel entertainment  which basically means internet connection  everything else is just very crafty corporation messaging  i think this thinking goes back to when i was a child and living in poverty  we didn't have much of anything  but i sort of got used to being able to live without much   i also had to figure out how much i could realistically make on the internet in any given month  i have several little side hustles that i've picked up over the years  i figured that my largest expense was housing  and i absolute had to move somewhere more affordable  maybe even the town i grow up in  since my job is was wfh  i bought a house with 0 down in a rural area for under 100k  the mortgage is literally  1500 less than what i was paying in rent in california  all of my bills combined average around  800 per month   i quit my job the day after closing and will never work for another employer again    i've been here about a month now and not having to wake up at the crack of dawn to join pointless zoom meetings is honestly just the best feeling  i am going to build a chicken coup out back and put up some garden beds and spend the entire summer in my backyard in peace and quiet   the absolute best advice i can give anybody looking to escape the rat race is to buy property somehow cheap and give up the notion that you absolutely have to make millions of dollars to be happy   i will probably crack 30k this year and i have everything i need and more   if you live in the us  you can get a usda loan  0  down  to buy property in a rural area   rural  being very subjective depending on where you are and want to live   i plan on becoming aggressive and paying this off within this decade  and then life the rest of my life mortgage free  so i'll have to work even less   i understand that this won't work for everybody but it sure as fuck beats the alternative ,n9467x

2135,"If businesses keep complaining that ""no one wants to work"" and yet refuse to acknowledge they should pay their employees more, would you consider boycotting them and running them out of business?",i'm so sick of seeing how we're so addicted to services like fast food and retail in this country  i'm beyond angered  disturbed  more than anything  by the responses business owners and managers have had towards this whole underemployment issue    people aren't incentivized to go to work because  you don't pay them enough  you don't offer benefits  you offer shit working conditions   -  that  is why people aren't flocking to you  they're getting what they need from pua because it more accurately matches what something like minimum wage should provide a worker     290 wk is pathetic  plain and simple  not to mention that the  same companies complaining about not getting enough applicants are the same companies that   won't even offer full-time pay  and therefore any benefits  to the majority of their workers  but they're just lazy and on pua  right  it's not you gaming the system and exploiting the most at-risk  vulnerable demographics  oh  the irony   look  we're a tiny group of people compared to the rest of the population  but we're capable of a lot if we set our minds to it  i'll preface this by saying that i have low expectations  but big dreams    do you guys think we have the collective power to help combat those large companies that mistreat their workers and who operate with indifference towards human life  do you guys think we can organize boycotts  or do you think  anyone  would do so  assuming we continue on our current trajectory   i'm sick and tired of seeing those assholes get away with so much  to succeed with such little dignity  of seeing them vilify the poor and working-class the way they do  i'm  s i c k  of it  i want us to do something that hits them right in the gut  and the easiest way is to simply  stop giving them our money  simple as that  stop giving your business to companies that don't respect their employees like human beings  that talk down on them  that assume the worst about all of us  and who currently know they'll get away with running on the same model of exploitation   that's all  may this serve as a rant and possibly not an actual  call to arms  or whatever  but i  really  want people to take some fucking action  bring the ball to our fucking court ,n7gba4

2145,These are the words you have been looking for, 1  the panopticon   in 1791  english philosopher and social reformer jeremy bentham proposed a new kind of prison  the prison was round with cells on the outer walls  in the center was a tower manned by one or more guards  from the tower  guards had a direct view into each cell  prisoners had no privacy  everything they did was visible    the view into the tower however was blocked  so  while the guards could see each inmate  the inmates could never see the guards  this  was the first surveillance state  a population controlled not by force but by an asymmetric vision  the genius of the system was that the prisoners never knew when they were being surveilled  and thus had to assume they were always being watched  they would therefore  surveil themselves  censoring their own behavior to conform to the will of the invisible eye in the central tower  each prisoner became complicit in their own subjugation    bentham called his prison  the panopticon  greek for all seeing  he described it as a new mode of power  of mind over mind  in essence  the panopticon replaced the social control exercised by an all-seeing  all-powerful god  with an all-seeing  and all-powerful state apparatus  for the prisoners  the state had become the new god     2  the electronic panopticon   this was the mode of social control george orwell predicted in his book  1984  in that book  the technology is electronic  but the principles remain the same  the hero  winston smith  and the citizens of his country oceania are controlled by an asymmetric vision  in every room  in every apartment  there s a so-called telescreen that delivers state propaganda  but whose real function is as a surveillance camera that can never be turned off  each telescreen weaponizes the gaze of state power   the ministry of truth    oceania itself has become a surveillance state  a prison  and the citizens assume they are always being surveilled  as with the prisoners  the citizens of oceania become complicit in their own subjugation  censoring their behavior to conform to the will of the all-seeing and all-powerful state  big brother is watching you    orwell died in 1950 fearing his vision of a totalitarian state order might still come to pass  yet today  only a handful of societies would qualify as orwellian surveillance states  north korea  urban china  and  of course  disneyland  orwell s vision of the panopticon state  that exercised control over its population through surveillance and fear  never took route in the liberal west  orwell s fears  it seems  were unfounded    but perhaps orwell s vision was not wrong  but merely na ve  perhaps  the panopticon state was superseded by a newer  more efficient  and more subtle mode of power and social control     3  the real 1984   in the book  1984  a weaponized gaze is directed from a powerful and invisible center to a powerless and visible periphery  in the year 1984 however  everything was reversed  no-one had a surveillance camera in their home  everyone  however  had a television  which they watched  on average  six-hours a day    in the  year  1984  the center was still powerful and the periphery powerless   but the center is visible and the periphery invisible  those in power are visible and omnipresent  those on the periphery are unseen  and anonymous  the population is controlled through the images from the center  of wealth  youth  beauty  and sex  the basis of control is not fear  but desire  this is not the hard totalitarianism of surveillance and fear  but a soft totalitarianism of consumerism  advertising  and the mass production of desire  this is the new mode of power  of mind over mind  the reverse panopticon  but how does this power work  and what ideology does it use to justify itself  if advertising is the propaganda of consumerism  what does advertising tell us about the ideology it serves     4  the ideology of consumerism   every ideology creates a narrative of our lives  a three-act story of problem  struggle  and reward  in christianity  the problem is we are enslaved by sin  the struggle is faith and good works  the reward  is heaven  for marx  we are enslaved by class exploitation  the struggle is revolution  and the reward is a classless society  for freud  we are enslaved by neurotic unhappiness  the struggle is therapy  and the reward  as freud himself said  is ordinary human misery    in each narrative  humans are posited to be flawed  and therefore unfree  it is only through struggle of faith  of revolution  of therapy  that we free ourselves from our flaws  and find fulfillment  so what is the narrative of consumerism  what is the flaw we must overcome  to find fulfillment    the story  consumerism tells us  is that we are by nature  desiring beings  the problem is that we desire goods and services  the struggle is to work and make money  and the reward  if we succeed  is to become rich and to thereby fulfill our desires  the source of our discontents  consumerism tells us  is not sin  or exploitation  or neurosis  but desire  and our endless thirst for its fulfillment     5  the cult of the winner   the standard critique of consumerism tells us that our desires are not natural  but rather fabricated by the machinery of consumerism itself  thus  consumerism does not manufacture products in order to satisfy desires  rather its fundamental task is to manufacture desire  in order to sell products    but not all desires are equal  big cars have a higher profit margin than small cars  new clothes have a higher profit margin than used clothes  processed foods have a higher profit margin than raw foods  so  by the logic of consumerism  goods that are new or big or processed are more desirable than the small or recycled or raw  this is the standard critique of consumerism we are all familiar with  that advertising is capitalist propaganda designed to induce us to buy stuff we don t need  with money we don t have  to impress people we don t know  what thorstein veblen in 1925 called  conspicuous consumption https www gutenberg org ebooks 833    yet veblen went a step further  for him  consumption was not about desire  that was a fig leaf to disguise its true nature  rather  conspicuous consumption was about class hierarchy and social status  we do not buy a rolex because it tells time more accurately  we do not buy a ferrari to drive to work more quickly  rather  we buy these things to advertise our place within a hierarchy of status and respectability    as veblen observed  the more useful and utilitarian a good or service was  the lower its perceived status was  thus  the lower status conferred on farming  plumbing and sanitation  conversely  the more unnecessary a good or service  the more useless and conspicuously wasteful  the higher its status  thus  the high status conferred on diamonds  yachts  works of art  movie stars  and post-graduate education  consumerism was less about the fulfillment of desire than the pursuit of status  through the purchase and display of conspicuously useless and wasteful goods and services  to veblen  this was the underlying ideology of consumerism  that life is a competition for status  for respect  for the esteem of others  and the way we win status  the measure of our lives  and our worth as human beings  is through our ability to purchase and consume as conspicuously and wastefully as possible  these values of conspicuous and wasteful consumption add up to a vision of life that might be termed   the cult of the winner    the winner  owns a big expensive house  he drives a big expensive car  everything the winner owns is new  big  expensive and therefore as conspicuously wasteful as possible  anyone who falls short of such a life  implicitly  is a loser     6  the ultimate winner   today  the hierarchies of status have evolved  there is still the ethos of materialist consumption  mansions  sports cars  yachts  but this is increasingly the province of russian oligarchs  and the nouveau riche  today there is also an ethos of non-materialist consumption  the elite  travel to distant and obscure destinations  attend silent meditation retreats  earn doctorate degrees  they visit museums  attend symphonies  read the latest bestseller  and otherwise engage in the consumption of cultural capital  while avoiding the vulgar materialism of the gilded age  they nevertheless advertise their status through the profligate expenditure of disposable time and non-productive effort  yoga resorts  culinary tours  gap years  semesters abroad  graduate degrees  these are the new status markers    none of these things however can make one a real winner  to be a real winner today  it is no longer enough to be well traveled  well read  well connected  it is no longer enough to be merely rich  the ultimate reward in christianity is heaven  the ultimate reward in marxism is a classless society  what then is the ultimate reward in consumerism  here we borrow an insight from  slavog zizek https duckduckgo com q slavog zizek amp t h amp ia web  the ultimate want  zizek tells us  it to be wanted   the ultimate desire is to be desired    so  the ultimate achievement in consumerism is to become wanted and desired  to turn oneself into a product  to become famous  to be a celebrity  within a consumer society  this successful celebrity achieves a kind of secular transcendence  a holy status  by turning him or herself into a brand  an object  something that can be bought or sold  to succeed in consumerism  to win at being a winner  it is no longer enough to be rich  one must also become famous  and the more attention you attract  the more clicks you generate  the higher the ratings  the bigger the winner you are     7  the new big brother   which brings us  unavoidably to the figure of donald trump  the makers of this have no interest in litigating trumps politics  trump himself seems to have no real interest in politics per say  what he cares about is ratings and reviews and crowd size  trump inherited his wealth  400 million  from his father  but being rich wasn t enough  he pursued the spotlight of celebrity and became a household name  an image  a brand  after six bankruptcies  he left real estate for showbiz   to be on tv once a week  then left showbiz for politics   to be on tv every day  he transformed himself from an outer borough rich kid to the inescapable center of the world s attention economy  in doing so  he made himself into the ultimate winner    trump exercises power not through surveillance  but through the dominance of public attention  as such  trump represents the ultimate reversal of the panopticon  and the final inversion of orwell s vision    today  big brother is no longer watching us  today  we are all watching big brother     my whole life i ve been greedy  greedy  greedy  greedy  i ve trapped all the money i can get  i m so greedy   donald trump  trump is too easily dismissed as his critiques as a vulgar clown  the reality tv star who turned reality itself into a show and made himself the star  but he may also be seen as a cautionary tale  the apotheosis of the cult of the winner  trump s entire life is an exercise in branding  he puts his name on everything he acquires  hotels  casinos  planes  wives  children  all beautiful  wasteful  and useless  and offers them up for public display     we re going to win so much  you may even get tired of winning  donald trump     his life  a mobius loop of television appearances and television consumption  of tweets and retweeting  suggests a hall of mirror narcissism  that is the reductio ad absurdum of our consumerism culture    but this hall of mirrors narcissism  this feedback loop of performance and review  is no longer the province of the rich and famous  today  the culture of narcissism is for everyone  today  everyone can be a winner     8  everyone s a winner   in the year 1984  power worked on a broadcast model   stories and images were produced at the center by the rich and famous  the rest of us sat on the periphery and watched  to be visible was to be a winner  to be anonymous was not  as a mode of social control  the reverse panopticon worked  mesmerized by images of wealth and beauty  seized by the desire for status and social distinction  the population was rendered docile by the hamster wheel of consumerism  working longer and longer hours  to buy more and more stuff  debt and obesity sky rocketed  as did corporate profits  ceo pay  and income inequality    the soft totalitarianism of consumerism proved to be more comprehensive and effective in controlling the population than the hard totalitarianism that orwell feared  by 1990   mcdonald s was in red square    thirty years later however  the old broadcast model is obsolete  today  everyone has a camera and a tv station in their pocket  today  everyone can generate their own images  tell their own stories  but rather than tell new stories  we often retell the old one  casting ourselves in the lead role  we curate images of ourselves not as we are  but as we wish to be seen  as winners  like trump  our lives become a performance   an exercise in self-branding for an invisible and all-seeing audience  rather than escape the reverse panopticon  we have internalized it  and we monitor our ratings as obsessively as trump does  how many clicks  how many likes  how many followers    once  the big eye watching over us belonged to god  in  1984  the big eye belonged to the state  today  it is the audience  invisible  and omnipresent  punishing and rewarding  judgemental and wrathful  all-seeing and all-powerful  that has become the new god    as exhibitionists we have all become winston smith  as voyeurs  we have all become big brother    the genius of the old panopticon was that prisoners presumed they were under constant surveillance  and so modified their behavior even if nobody was watching  today  we live in a state of self-surveillance and modify our behavior accordingly  acting out the role of the winner  even if no one is watching  as such  we have become complicit in our own subjugation     9  welcome to the machine   for most of western history the classic virtues were unchanging  hard work  thrift  humility  charity  mercy  chasteness  generosity  everything your mother taught you    as max weber pointed out   early capitalism derived much of its underlying ethos from the protestant work ethic  to be rich  was proof of one s hard work and thrift  respectability was a sign of chasteness and humility  status was derived from charity  fellowship  generosity  in 1889  andrew carnegie wrote   surplus wealth is a sacred trust  which its possessor is bound to administer in his lifetime  for the good of the community  he concluded   the man who dies rich  dies disgraced    today  social darwinism has replaced christianity as the underlying ethos of capitalism  consumerism has turned these values on their heads  instead of restraint  it celebrates gluttony  instead of modesty - lust  instead of generosity - greed  instead of humility - pride  instead of kindness - envy  instead of mercy - wrath  instead of hard work - sloth  with few exceptions  consumerism promotes and celebrates values that were once seen as the path to ruin and despair  and so  we become ever more anxious  stressed  distracted  depressed  overweight  sleep deprived  in debt  dissatisfied  so  who s to blame for this mess  who are the bad guys in this story   at this point the standard critique tends to find an easy villain in the rich and powerful   wall street  madison avenue  hollywood  but this ignores a more complicated truth  it is a truism today that fame can be a prison  in winning fame  one loses anonymity  privacy  the freedom to move through the world unmolested by the gaze of the camera  but the cult of the winner may also be a mental prison for those at the top  who like trump  spend their lives chasing after the applause of the crowd and the phantoms of status  as such  the self-branded celebrity is merely the most obvious victim of the reverse panopticon state  as any supermarket tabloid will attest    who then benefits from the system of over-consumption  narcissism  and self-surveillance  and how does one escape    10  the matrix   remember those movies where aliens invade the earth  take over the government  and plunder the environment  humans are brainwashed and cast into servitude  working ceaselessly to enrich their alien overlords  in these movies there s often a class of pod people who collaborate with the aliens and enjoy a modicum of privilege  and there s a handful of freedom fighters   a scrappy band of misfits who live outside the system and fight back against the soulless aliens and their bootlicking human collaborators    today  this is not a movie  today  this is your life  today the aliens who have plundered the environment and taken over the government are called corporations  you may not have declared war on them  but they have declared on you  every second of every day  the machine works to make you addicted to sugar  fat  alcohol  caffeine  nicotine  gasoline  debt  political outrage  and social media    every second of every day the machine seeks to take your money  your time  to capture your attention and your data  commodify them and sell them to advertisers  every second of every day  the machine works to make you consume as wastefully and as conspicuously as possible  food  medication  goods and services  leisure  to do so  the machine wants you to become envious  greedy  gluttonous  lustful  wrathful  prideful  and slothful  a class of pod people collaborate with these aliens and enjoy a modicum of privilege  but in the end  they are just as indentured as everyone else  no one is more servile to the corporation  than the ceo    who then  are the freedom fighters  and how does one fight back    11  the revolution will not be televised   the genius of the soft totalitarian state is that it s voluntary  we are complicit in our own subjugation  but that means we also have the freedom to opt out  if you own a lot of stuff  big expensive stuff  maybe you re not a winner  maybe you re a cog in the machine  on the other hand  if you only own what you need  and your stuff is inexpensive or recycled  maybe you re not a loser  maybe you re a freedom fighter  and the freedom you re fighting for  is your own    so maybe  an apple  is better than a bag of chips  a glass of water is better than a big gulp  a book  is better than a tv  a second-hand store  is cooler than a boutique  an old bike is better than a new ferrari  a cheap rent  is better than an expensive mortgage    in her career  dorothea lange took thousands of photographs of migrant workers  sharecroppers  prisoners  in doing so  she changed the way america saw itself  her camera  facing outwards  was a tool of art  in her lifetime  she posed for a single self-portrait  in 2015  kim kardashian published a 450-page book of selfies  it was titled   selfish  her camera  facing inwards  was a narcissistic mirror    kardashian  like trump  is a celebrity  a brand  a product  as a winner in the economy of attention and addict in the culture of narcissism  she has made herself prisoner both internally and externally  of the reverse panopticon state    like winston smith  her life is dominated by the camera  and by the invisible audience on the other side of the lens   in the book  1984  power is exercised through fear  coercion  surveillance  being watched by those at the top  today  power is exercised through the mass production of desire  weaponized status competition  and the hegemony of the spectator society  of watching those at the top    you can watch corporate sports  or play sport yourself  you can watch corporate musicians  or make your own music  you can watch a corporate talk show  or enjoy a conversation  you can take the blue pill of consumerism  and spend the rest of your life staring at a screen  passive  docile  a cog in the machine  or  you can live your life    in  1984  winston smith didn t have a choice  the telescreen in his apartment could never be turned off  you have a screen  in your house  on your desk  in your hand  you are giving it your attention right now   but you can turn it off     12  you must change your life   every ideology presents itself as the natural order of things  christianity and marxism are monotheisms that explain the world  and give us values and ideals that govern our lives  today  consumerism has become its own monotheism  so invisible and ubiquitous it s like the water we swim in  what is the point of life  if not to be a winner  to what should we aspire if not to be rich and famous  here the standard critique returns us to the classic virtues  kindness  charity  thrift  humility  mercy  generosity  to be a good person  like your mother taught you   the makers of this have nothing against the classic virtues  or against your mother  but perhaps there is something else we can aspire to  better than being a winner  or a  good  person  perhaps  we may aspire to become ourselves   perhaps the monotheism of consumerism can be replaced  not be another monotheism  but by a kind of ideological polytheism    let us return to the narrative of problem  struggle  reward  for a buddhist  the problem is suffering  the struggle is meditation  the reward is tranquillity and perhaps enlightenment  for the scholar  the problem is ignorance  the struggle is study  and the reward is knowledge and perhaps even wisdom  for the activist  the problem is injustice  the struggle is activism  and the reward is social progress   perhaps even justice    in each case the self begins as raw and unformed  and is transformed through a regime of daily practice  the transformation of the self  from uncultivated to cultivated  from ordinary to extraordinary  is a struggle of daily and deliberate practice  of exertion and exhaustion  of trial and error  of self-challenge and self-overcoming  nietzsche called it   the struggle to become what one is   the cultivation of the self requires exertion  risk  perseverance  discipline  exhaustion  and the inevitability of disappointment  falling short   failure    it requires that you challenge yourself  that you become active    this  is what consumerism seeks to thwart  what consumerism wants  above all  is to make us passive  to make us alienated  from our lives  from our labor  from our friends  and family  and loved ones  and neighbors  to make us laze at home  clicking endless links while watching other people talk  and cook  and play their sports  and make their music  and have their sex  and live their lives  to make us spectators  cogs in the machine  consumers    we all have one life  one chance  regardless of age  to become whomever we might be  and just as we struggle to free ourselves  from sin  from exploitation  from our own neurosis  we may also struggle to free ourselves from the reverse panopticon of consumerism  and the cult of the winner  we may therefore win the freedom to choose our own path  to pursue our own ideals   the christian gives up everything to become a saint  the buddhist gives up everything for enlightenment  the radical gives up everything to

2150,I'm just...tired,depressing rant time  depressing rant time   i'm sorry  i'm not really looking for advice or to open a dialogue  i just wanted to get this out  mods  i apologize if this is too much for this sub  i just can't sleep   my whole life  the sentiment that not wanting to work was lazy hippie crybaby bullshit was well never really  drilled into me  but sorta felt like it was  nobody was ever there telling me that verbatim  but kinda reading the room it always had that air to it  that it's just what you do and you need to live with it  i don't want to get into my employment history or how i currently make my wages  but the long and short of it is that i'm just tired  i'm genuinely at a loss for how else to put it at this point  the feeling is just empty exhaustion  i have so little time in this meaningless short life  there is so little time  and i know  every day  when i crawl out of bed  i'm going to be spending my waking hours thinking about money  how to make it  how to spend it carefully  who i can spend it on and responsibly  or irresponsibly for some in particular  in what quantity  where i can get more and if it's efficient enough of a means to pursue  it's always about money  everything    i can't look at anything without attaching a price tag to it anymore and it's sickening  nothing too small  even just dings and dents in the walls i ponder if it's worth the time to ask my landlord if i could take some money off this month if i fix them around the apartment  there's a decent chance they'd say yes  but i'm too tired to even ask  every facet of my life  every waking thought  it all just goes back to money  and honestly  i can't really recall the last time i took a significant chunk out of a day to sit back and think about what i want to do and what would make me happy if i did it  something just completely detached from money  because every hobby i might think up  i have to ask myself  is this profitable enough to sustain and could i sell the fruits of this hobby to fund it in the first place  and suddenly i don't care anymore because i just feel drained by the idea  if i do find something i enjoy and it starts to develop those little price tags  i lose interest because looking at it starts to remind me of the very thing i was avoiding by doing it in the first place   the knowledge that i will likely be spending every moment of my life until i die having to think about money just every  single  day  feels choking    i've never fantasized about wealth beyond the notion that maybe  if some miracle hits me  maybe i could just stop  maybe the leaking faucet wouldn't remind me of money  the loaf of bread every time it's a slice thinner  the last week of every month  the gas meter when i start my car and the odometer when i park it inching closer to the next oil change  the hum of my fridge compressor kicking on burning kw h  every upcoming holiday and birthday maybe all of it would stop  maybe if i were wealthy  maybe then these would go away  because every single one of them serves to remind me that i'll never have enough for it to go away completely  i will always be chasing the dollar and it will consume my thoughts for the rest of my life   and supposing it didn't  maybe i get a reasonable 9-5 and it  is  enough and i can retire and live comfortably  in my limited time on this planet  after which i cease to exist and everything i have ever done and worked for meant nothing  that i had to spend 2 3 of it toiling away just to enjoy the remaining 1 3  it's crushing  it feels heavy  deep in my chest this sinking pit that just keeps filling with gravel  because for the most part  i know it's just inevitable   in truth  i really hate money  in such a post-scarcity world  where there is more than enough of everything for everyone to be comfortable in every country on earth having come so far that basic necessities like food  water  and shelter are all but completely automated processes that this is still something to even think about god it sounds like such  libtard commie bullshit  as some might put it and hell  ya know what maybe it is  but  fuck  i don't care about the tax impliocations or the ins and outs of who's paying who however much or for what  just the notion that we have the means but not the will to end this miserable  pointless struggle for millions upon millions of people and we just don't  it's infuriating  but i can't even bring myself to be mad about it anymore because i've exhausted myself holding onto that feeling  it's almost like when you shake a 2l bottle of soda  you see all the fizz rush to the top but you don't open it  you just watch the bubbles rise up in a torrent and if you release the pressure by juuust cracking the seal  in a few seconds you see it all fall back down and fizzle out  doesn't overflow  there's no outburst  don't have the energy to feel it anymore  i'm just tired ,n87tma

2204,I think I wanna stop working.,so a couple weeks back i made a rather cringey post about a dude i work with and me feeling like he s slowly becoming a drone  i deleted the post cause the first reply i got was kind of rude  and i kind of regretted saying as much as i did  but anyways after that post things with the guy improved a bit so i convinced myself  that maybe i just was imagining it  i even talked to some people who were mutual friends  or acquaintances with him  and like they didn t think that was happening    but i saw it and i pretty much heard it today  this older manager was like  you gotta stop being a young adult and be an adult    which i think in the right context is perhaps a good sentiment  but in this particular context it was like encouraging him to cut ties with his friends   and stop saying or doing  immature  rebellious things  and like stop being lenient with people he was in charge of     which all in all it s the just broader idea of all that that bothered me  and i was like  i don t wanna become like him  and i don t wanna see him become that    and we ll idk it got me thinking more on how just even the nice moments feel so dulled because i work now  and like even the nice stuff at work they don t feel so nice  like every nice thing said to me feels like manipulation at work  even if maybe it isn t  at least not always    and i realized that i m in school right now for computer science which is a great field  and like right now i m working a shitty low end job  with some great people    or well maybe i even deluded myself into thinking they were great  but idk i realized working got me in this stuck mindset and i started performing poor in college   and becoming more like the people i worked with and like work was becoming more of my life than my time off was   like it got so bad to s point where to some degree i crave work like i ll just think about work or people at work on my days off  and i d be chastising myself for my lack of work ethic or ducking up something or saying the wrong thing or whatever    and idk i think maybe i should still stick with college but like  i realized that even if i bounce back from college and get my degree i d still just be working a job where i m im following someone else s orders and being undermined  maybe to a lesser extent or in less shitty way or for different reasons  but it d probably happen and even if it doesn t that workforce mindset will continue to take hold of me and i don t want it  read that like jon snow from season 8 of got  sorry humor  but anyways i feel like my individuality has been stifled a bit  and i worry that i ll never gain what i lost back    this was a long ass post but just how do i become person who doesn t work  or at least a person who doesn t work for a corporation  i have a desire to work for myself  i m not sure if that s supported here  honestly though i just want a way to get money to live and buy the things i enjoy without slowly becoming a conforming drone,n8ak18

2248,Humans aren't smart enough to do the right thing,i've come to the conclusion that you can't actually convince a person who thinks spending working for 40 years is a good thing of reality  i think it's something that they already know  but refuse to acknowledge  kinda like death  i literally don't think it has anything to do with reason or logic  right or wrong  i literally think that the economic propaganda and peer pressure to take part in servitude is way too strong for any normal brain to avoid    i've just learned to accept that we live in a world of basically monkey's  you should never  ever expect good or smart from them  most of them think pieces of paper have value  i'm sorry but that less intelligent than many animals at least in one way  i guess my point is that i'm never ever going to try to do the right thing anymore because it's kicking sand at the waves  humans are not a good alien species  they're one that has to be told not to go to war with itself  if you really think a species of monkey's that have computers and still can't figure out that servitude is a bad thing  are ever going to actually successfully create a system that is fair and just  you're kidding yourself    i did that for 27 years  but i'm done lying to myself now  we're not going to to see the  revolution  in our lifetimes  and neither will anyone else in my opinion  we're way  way  way too stupid to ever do the right thing ,n716li

2257,Something interesting to think about.,something i found interesting to think about is if you have any family that lives away from you in a city a few hours away or in general just isn't that far from you but still enough to take some time to prepare a visit   let's say you visit these important family in your life twice every year  and let's say they're 65 and will live to an average of 85 to 90 years  that means you're only going to this family only 40 to 60 times before they pass away  is that number okay for you  and what's preventing you from visiting them  is it work  is it time taken up from work  is it stresses of missing days due to work  is it because you're only able to see them on your days off from work  are you okay only seeing them this little amount of times   i don't know how normal this is for others but it's just something i read  i for one don't have any family or a job so this doesn't apply to me  but i wonder how much it impacts any of you people ,n6r4vr

2263,Never trust a person who values money more than the people around them,i know i'm preaching to the choir but i think it's important anyways  if a person is actually so far gone that they're willing to put pieces of paper before humans  run  the sad thing is that this will be the majority of people  but in my experience it's always best to avoid them  if a humans actually thinks that paper has value  their intelligence isn't much higher than a handicapped person  and it is possible that they could be dangerous in my experience    figuring out that pieces of paper aren't worth giving up your life for isn't exactly a tough thing to figure out  so if you're facing someone who hasn't even gotten to that point  i think its fair to assume and expect about the same in terms of morality as a monkey  they might understand right from wrong to some degree  when it affects them  but not when it affects people outside of themselves  similar to an animal  i'd go as far as to say this animal like ability to be so self centered and unintelligent is the sole reason we as a species are still under system of servitude disguised as system of freedom    all you have to do to trick a human into thinking it's free is call the system is under free  reality has literally nothing to do with it  words don't even have definitions to most humans actually  at least when the word are inconvenient  like for instance the word servitude  that word seems to really upset people who claim to live in free countries  possibly to do with the fact that it's the truth ,n742zs

2286,Back at work in the office,this may end up being long and i'm on mobile so sorry for any formatting issues  after over a year of getting to work from home  we got told to come back into the office two weeks ago  they gave us two days notice and that was it    i've hated my job for a long time  i'm approaching 3 years as an administrative assistant at a computer networking company  the constant pressure  unrealistic expectations  mainly manual processes and toxic work culture is becoming unbearable  i thought i was miserable before  but now it's even worse that we're back at the office    i got used to being with my boyfriend and dog  and being able to go for walks during the day  i was able to get up and throw laundry in  or do the dishes  or prep for dinner  now all of that has been taken away  and it has completely destroyed my mental health  i have an hour commute total  which makes me not want to do anything when i get home  the house is a mess  my laundry is everywhere  and i'm so drained from the anxiety of being at the office that i've been coming home and sitting on the couch and doing nothing else for days  i've been trying to quit for awhile  but unfortunately employers will only hire you  the ones that will pay me enough to support myself anyway  if you have years of experience in the exact position they're looking for  and this is the only relevant work experience besides customer service that i have  so it's hard to get a job doing something else  so surprise surprise that i'm having trouble leaving  my position is very niche if my skills have to already exactly match what an employer is looking for  it's ridiculous  i could easily learn any administrative position with my experience  but no employer wants to hear that    i'm going back to school to work in healthcare because i can't work in an office like this any more  it's truly soul sucking  everyone acts like what we do is life or death and that everyone's lives need to revolve around this shitty company  and i just don't understand it  it's selling computer equipment  get a grip  i can't even take it seriously anymore    the unfortunate thing is i'll be starting from scratch  once i get all my certifications i still won't be making enough to support myself fully for years because i don't have the work experience for it  luckily i have a partner who can afford rent on his own so it's a less serious situation than other people have  but it's still messed up  i don't know where i was going with this and maybe it's just a long rant  but it's no wonder everyone is anxious and depressed of this is the shit we're all dealing with,n71q7q

2292,I don't know if I'll be alive next year because I don't want to sell my soul.,right now i'm able to live relatively freely since i get government assistance because i'm in my last year of uni  this gives me the freedom to spend my time doing what i actually enjoy like reading  meditating   making music https open spotify com album 3kyhx3swpjbcak2tofzfvj  and just doing nothing in general  i don't have a lot of money but i have enough just to get by and that's enough for me because i prefer being free over having money  which leads to the main point of this post  at the end of the year i'll be done with my course and the government assistance will stop which basically means that if i'm lucky i will get a job in the field that i'm studying  counselling and youthwork  which is preferable to any other job  to me  but unfortunately it is still work  if i'm unlucky i will have to get a shitty job that i will be doing purely for the money because i have no real interest in any other jobs  but i refuse to do this  so because i refuse  work a job i don't care for just so i can keep living  which mostly consists of work  when i run out of money i'm going stop eating and drinking which will eventually lead to my death  and i'm okay with this because i genuinely would rather be dead than waste my life doing things i don't care for just to make money  that's not life   i've thought a lot about this and i think if i have to i will go through with it  i've even been fasting on and off for a while to get my body used to the lack of food  i've also spent my life avoiding working shitty jobs just so i can afford food and shelter  so if i end up in a situation where i  have  to work a shitty job to afford shelter  food and water  i'm just going to stop eating and drinking  i won't have much of a choice anyway  so i can check myself out of this shitty game society has created and forces us to play  i'm aware that this all probably sounds crazy but it's very real to me  and i will go through with it if i have to because freedom is everything to me    amp x200b    gt   i made a decision  not to work  to live as a parasite  i never worked in my life  i never had a job  except for a year  in brasov  as a high school teacher  and it was a complete failure  i realized i could not practice a profession  i have to wander around in life  to avoid any responsibility  i have to do everything in order to save my freedom  freedom to not work in the proper sense of the world  all my life  i calculated how i can be free in a complete sense  life is only worth living if you are free  i don t want to be a slave in any way  this is the only absolute certainty that i ve had in life  i don t want to be subordinate  i can succumb to any humiliation  on the condition that i am free   -  emil cioran,n6v55b

2329,I'm thinking of quitting my current job to heal my depression and anxiety. How do I get the most out of the time I am not at work?,i am currently employed as a software developer  unfortunately  while i can tolerate it at first  i developed depression and anxiety   it has come to the point that i was thinking of dark thoughts so i am currently taking medication to help myself heal but i feel like i have to get a complete rest from work for several months in order to fully recover  so i am thinking of quitting   while i rest for several months  i am thinking of giving myself the attention i should have given myself but failed to because of depression or being too busy with work  for example    travelling to places   finally fixing my health issues  body weight  blood pressure  hygiene    exercise  because i totally lack it    socializing with people  making friends    making myself look good and fashionable   enjoying nature   video games  etc    learning art  music composition    playing music instruments like guitar   others  of course  i can't live without working at all  so after several months of recovery  i'll be looking for work again  hopefully more tolerable than my current  but that's for another topic   what other things can i do to maximize the recovery or improve myself  both mental and physical  during the period i am not working   i will be happy to get any suggestions   thank you very much ,n6yde0

2339,Blockchain the key to less work?,so much hype in the crypto world right now with dogecoin all over the meme world  and bitcoin and ethereum getting mainstream coverage  but if you look deeper at blockchain as a technology  and the advancement it represents toward personal agency  privacy  and transparency i think there are a lot of points that align with what i consider less work or anti work  this isn t necessarily an original take on the subject  but a few areas where there is alignment are below   1  integrity of network and distribution of power  currently all monetary transactions have to go through some sort of central database that clears a transaction  there is usually a fee to do so  and if there s not as they say  if you re not paying for it your the product  blockchain enables you to transact directly with another person  no middle man  no fee  anonymously  so no data leak etc  part of anti-work is cutting out the government and corporations wherever possible  they aren t incentivized to improve our working environments  because there is no monetary reason for them to do so  this represents a place where they can be cut out   2  security  cryptography is a must  there is no opting out  this affords confidentiality and anonymity in a transparent and authentic way  blockchain is public  so there is no hiding malfeasance  and therefore no social incentive to harm  this includes institutions  what s yours is yours  anti-work to me means cutting out the flab and excess  i sign a contract to perform whatever job  and you pay me what we agreed to  the rest is code   3  privacy  for similar reasons to above your data should be private to you  my job doesn t need to know all the details of my life to determine whether or not i m fit for a job  they certainly don t need to know my age  gender  and skin color  the black box of your personal identity can be owned by you in blockchain  and it should ring true that you are only required to share what actually qualifies you for that job   4  ownership rights  music  art  media   copyright etc  blockchain acts as a public registry of everything confidentially  artists can make the money they deserve without a middle man  and the rights to that work come with it  this is the concept of the nft  many people on this sub appear to be artists  or the like  this allows you to transfer ownership via smart contracts   5  inclusion  this creates a system of distributed capitalism where people are not left out  there are too many barriers to entry for entrepreneurs and even owning a bank account in some parts of the country  even as money has moved online the fees associated with transacting using apps etc  keeps people out  you can interact on blockchain with no drivers license or birth certificate  documents required to participate and are difficult or impossible to obtain in some areas   i think blockchain is the future and on top of everything i ve just listed above it favors automation and less work   if this interests you  i recommend you read blockchain revolution by tapscott  i ve summarized their ideas above  but they re eloquence is more attractive than mine  thanks for coming to my ted talk ,n6q4we

2342,Why I don't feel bad for businesses that can't find work,we've all heard about the worker shortage on the news and how business owners can't find work  but what about the other perspective   before covid  i made about 11 hr working at a restaurant  i would be your typical service industry worker in america  young and in college  i didn't receive any benefits  and rarely took days off  the working conditions were pretty bad and i sustained a decent amount of injuries from burns or heavy lifitng  as someone who had been told growing up that service industry jobs were easy jobs for losers that anyone could do  it wasn't really reality  the jobs i worked weren't difficult skill-wise but they put a major toll on my body and would tire me out by the time i got home  i feel like white-collar workers don't realize how difficult and energy-consuming regular restaurant work can be at times    once ui started  i stayed on it and started looking at improving other skills so i could make more money in a different industry    i don't feel bad for the bosses because they never really did anything to improve our condition  no one of my co-workers ever made over  15  even our cooks  the busboys and waiters would share the small number of tips they received which often would amount to under  11 hr which was less than what i was making  i was a dishwasher  and forget leisure time at work  as we rarely got breaks and our boomer bosses would ride us whenever we were on our cellphone    i know a lot of restaurant owners  and they look down on their employees  i remember some boomer restaurant owners calling most of their workers  losers  who can't get a real job because they'd rather smoke weed all day   now with the pandemic  those workers don't have to go into those soul-sucking jobs that disvalue them every day  the same bosses that used to degrade us and force us to work in terrible conditions  now can't find workers  my friends have told me that the working conditions during the pandemic have been terrible and many workers quit  it doesn't help that the types that go out to eat during the pandemic and usually the rude and entitled types of customers    the business owners ought to look within and stop blaming ui  while some might decide to stop working  it's emblematic of a larger problem that the industry is facing  when you pay low wages  offer substandard working conditions and no benefits people will not want to work for you  already  i'm planning on transitioning into food delivery which pays more and i don't have any bosses controlling my time and body  after ui  they will still struggle to find work  because they haven't addressed any of the problems in the industry  maybe business owners should meet their workers in the middle for once instead of crying for the government to give them more help  and hopefully  they will start to realize how important their workers are to the success of their business,n70nhf

2344,To the outside I look like a failure but really I refuse to work in unsafe conditions,i quit a lot of jobs because i value my health  to everyone around me they just think i  quit when things get hard  i mean yes  i am not perfect  but the real reason i quit is because if something doesn't check out logically from a health perspective  then fuck you  end of story   unfortunately that's like every fucking job    worked in a cabinet factory - the air is toxic and it's intensely fucking loud    worked climbing cell towers -  omg i freaking love climbing so much  i love it  i love it  i love it  i love it  but it's unsafe as fuuuuuck  engineers  never heard of her  also cell phone monopolies would rather their workers literally die than shut down the tower during repairs  and  shock  horror  lose cell service in order to  oh i don't know  not expose people to the highest possible emf  just silly things like that  you can't see emf so  it's okay   worked commercial shrimping - tried to rehabilitate herring that had got caught in the bottom dragging net as by catch  their swim bladders break because they are caught in the net and depressurized from the ascent  i'm literally crying right now  and the stereotype of most  esp white  fishers being disgustingly sexist has some weight behind it  nothing like a 60 year old man who has a daughter the same age as you on some stupid fucking power trip  oh and you get to destroy the earth  bonus  sexism and ecocide  faves   worked at a spa during the pandemic - quit because  pandemic  like seriously what the fuck  i needed money but i'm not trying to die  they had steam rooms open  hot tubs  saunas  nothing like cramming 20 people  recently flown into a tourist town  into a hot steamy room to share each others viruses with each other   what joy  of course i'm the bad guy and the paranoid one lol  ok  no you're right - wearing masks in the hot tub will solve everything  and yes  i should be the only one wearing super extra  ppe  because i'm so  concerned  about it  mhmm  makes sense    carpentry - i'm good at that  i wish i could just enjoy being good at something  but if you saw through wood all day  and i mean like literally being on a chop saw all day  you saw through all kinds of treated with formaldehyde and shit pressboards so you get to breathe that in all day  i wore a respirator  which is a  paranoid  move  but really it's a  hey look the air is full of tiny chemical particles move  oh and there's wildfires raging beside us  but we're building fucking condos instead of caring about the forest burning  because we need money to live    electrician - i quit because the union is in bed with the government  obviously  and perpetrating genocide by building a massive hydro dam  i'm not here for it  they care more about money than reality  and they loooooove green washing lng    dude every job  every job is fucked  and that's not even 1  of what other people in the world are going through  it's just that i've always considered myself such a failure for not sticking with things  well why the fuck would you stick with something like that  makes no sense  so if anyone out there struggles with the same thing  like yeah i know we all need to take personal responsibility for our actions  but i for one know that you're not crazy    maybe you're too legit to quit what's really important to you instead  we're not crazy for creating change even if it starts super small  or for being different from a lot of people who have been temporarily lulled into complacency  we're all complacent in our own ways anyway  constant vigilance   suddenly it makes sense why there are so many people suffering with diseases  do most people work  yeah  it's work related disease for the most part  that and eating chemical laden foods  poisoned water  from   work  fun times  no one is crazy for being against that  i know i'm not alone in feeling like a failure  we all just need to stop feeling like failures  and don't even think of blaming yourself for not figuring everything out and being perfect sooner  no one is perfect ,n70w29

What do you actually want out of life?,homelessness   van life   fire   me and my girlfriend are planning on just living in a van  we don t want much  we don t want these sports cars that so many people are running each other over in a corporate ladder to obtain  we don t want high rise apartments or  50 000 bottles of wine   we just want time with each other  time to enjoy nature  time to enjoy each other  we don t want to waste away our lives in a dreary diarrhea shit tornado called a  job  we may have to if our savings and investments aren t enough  but we re never putting ourselves through this 9-5 shit again  frugal living and part time jobs if anything   this has been said many times but look at the big picture  you re on this earth for a limited amount of time  you spend most of it doing dreary work 8  hours a week and that s time you never get back  nobody lies on their death bed wishing they worked more  most will wish they worked less  maybe some of you had an opportunity to get into a job you love  that s great  maybe your job actually has meaning to it too  that s also great    but for a lot of us  we re stuck here sending emails  filling out paperwork  washing cars  flipping burgers  just doing all these things that we don t care about  there s no meaning to it for us  it makes us feel empty  we lose all sense of control of our lives because we have to do this for our higher ups  we have to do that for our higher ups  we have to do their bidding at all times  we have to show up to a strict schedule and if we argue against it or question it we get metaphorically crucified   at the end of the day  look at what s making you truly unhappy  is it actually your job  is it actually your wife  think on it for days  weeks  months if you need to  but however long it takes  make sure you do what makes you truly happy and gives your life meaning  if you wanna go live off grid  fuck jobs  go live off grid  if you truly feel that you re unhappy in a relationship  calmly discuss it with your partner  but again  whatever you do  carefully consider your choices   for me  i don t want to do these  jobs  i want to direct reward work - i want to hunt  fish  etc  but i don t want to do today s version of work where you do someone else s bidding to then barely be able to get the means to receive your reward  i just want to live a simple  free life  i think this society is complete garbage  and i m not obligated to contribute to it just because my mother decided to pop me out of her body  that s just my opinion and my view  yours may be different  and that s fine   i m just here to try to open some eyes  life doesn t have to be completely bleak  a lot of other people out there are also opting for van life  the definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result  life is too short to subject ourselves to things that make us unhappy  if it isn t working for you  just cut it out of your life  even if that means cutting back  sometimes  giving yourself less can give you more in the long run ,n5ja4n

2450,I just have no motivation by Thursday,i'm exhausted  i don't even dislike my job that much  but by the end of the week i am usually beat  it's the kind of thing where my boss says  i don't micromanage  but really all that means is that he gives blanket statements and expects you to understand  we get 15 minutes a day to talk him  i was lucky this week he scheduled a meeting with a couple of us to talk about a project but he spent more than half the time on the phone with others and responding on teams  so now he gave us this project without any of the necessary tools to actually work on the project  without going into too much detail  we don't have fundamental programs on our computer but are expected to use syntax we have never used or been trained on to solve the problem  i know that a boss can't plan every step of the way  but it feels like most projects are like this  told to accomplish a task with no real knowledge or understanding of the circumstance     this pretty much envokes too moods from me  intense anxiety when i can't solve something and not giving a fuck once i settle down and start thinking the problem is bigger than me  there's a nice middle ground every once every 1-2 weeks where i feel like i know what's expected of me and it logically makes sense  but other than that  just not feeling great  i also have to interact with higher management and that always worries me  although much more of a minor issue  i don't make crazy money but i make enough  38k annual  idk i feel like the stuff that is expected of me with no training is just a bit too much  my boss always acts like he's open to listening but like i said  impossible to actually ever talk to him     i kind of just want to quit and say fuck it  but i know i can't really do that at this moment  also feel like all it jobs are going to be like this  kind of working in every department just trying to figure shit out  looking for a way out seems like a daunting task but maybe needs some thought  i can't keep doing this every week ,n6blig

2486,How I’ve dealt with a job putting off promised raises for two years.,first of all  throwaway for obvious reasons    so  i work for a local business and started in may of 2019  the initial help wanted ad i applied to promised 13  starting wage  i got the interview and was offered the job but for 10  when i asked about the 13  the owner told me  and this should have been a red flag  he lost most his staff and was hiring a bunch of people at once  and after 90 days when he figured out what roles people would fall into he d be giving raises based on that as well as additional raises every year of employment   well i didn t get that 90 day raise till about 150 days  and it still didn t put me to 13  but hey  i like the work so i figured i d stick around and see what a year brought since i consistently took on new tasks and did extra work  amp  was raised to believe bosses would notice that sort of thing  lol    year one comes to a close and oh no  we re holding off raises for a bit because covid just hit and the business is iffy  i shouldn t have accepted this excuse but i did  but with the caveat that i would be working one less day a week and a shorter schedule  4 days a week  28-30 hours  my two year is in about two weeks and i ve still not gotten that first year raise even though i handle shipping and see business is 100  good enough  they ve consistently asked when i could work full time again  every time i ve said  just as soon as we talk about those multiple raises  and i don t hear it again for weeks  it s a battle of wills  i want money and they want my labor but unfortunately for them i value my free time more than any cash amount    as much as the low wages suck  it s honestly real nice to have so much free time to enjoy my hobbies and have time with my daughter  and my overhead in bills is covered by freelancer web dev work  i m sure one day they ll put their foot down and demand i go back to full time  and in return they ll get a two hour notice  cheers y all,n5zrde

2489,So tired of being underpaid,i've been working a job teaching for a whole school year now  the first job i was offered in a year after my last let me go  just before covid  i'm a teacher  a janitor  and general handyman  making  10 an hour  when i've explained that this just isn't enough  after being so grateful to just have a job again  they said they couldn't give me a raise until next year and couldn't afford to give me more hours  i've was barely scraping  700 a month before finding a second job   my second job  a contract teaching position  pays  15 an hour  but i don't get 15 hours a week even  while the workplace environment is better  and i have more room to experiment and more money to use for materials  i don't have enough hours    i'm good at what i do  i'm an art teacher for both of my jobs  but i can also woodwork  fabricate  and enjoy going the extra mile for my students  i've asked for raises and been denied  and looked for better jobs but  15 is where it caps around here    i don't hate work  i enjoy seeing something come from nothing  i'm struggling though  and i've even applied for jobs out of state knowing they would take me away from everyone in my life  whatever the reason i'm not getting bites or finding  that job  it really doesn't matter inside anymore  i just want to quit and marry myself to my work again - no more 10 hour days  no more screaming kids and students that already look beaten to death by 14  and no more wishing i could get a raise    that seems so impossible  knowing what is coming  but finding a better job or just better pay seems impossible too  i want to quit the lower paying job and go back to doing what i love for me  and not because i desperately need paid ,n66v7j

2504,The story of me bailing in the middle job interview,just a little context  i already have a well paying job that i enjoy  and in my off time i do a lot of mountain biking  i noticed one day that my city employs trail stewards  spoke to one of them and it seemed like a pretty decent way to earn some cash on the side  they do essentially the same thing i already do for fun  with some extra digital paperwork for reporting things like trail maintenance  it s part time and at the time i also lived walking distance from the largest trail in the city  so i figured i might as well get paid if all they want me to do outside my routine is carry a phone and occasionally open an app to fill out a form   fast forward to the interview  i m immediately amused that the person interviewing looks like she has never seen a day of exercise in her life much less ride a bike  but i suppose that doesn t really matter  here s where they started losing me  1  i m not allowed to pick what trail i m assigned to  ok  not the biggest deal in the world  i enjoy and am familiar with all the trails they patrol  2  i have to attend a training class on how to use their iphone app  again  not a big deal  at the time i was working for apple and found it funny  3  i have to attend a bike safety class that includes intentionally falling  tucking  and rolling off a bike ok  not that crazy  i ve fallen off my bike plenty of times without seeing it coming 4  i have to have 4 days of open availability but i only get 12 hours scheduled and you don t get to set preferences that s when i have up trying to rationalize it and just said  alright  i don t think we have to talk about this anymore  you guys take it easy  and walked out   i just don t understand who that is meant for  it s clearly not meant to be someone s side gig unless they are working another part time job that allows for only 3 days of availability  then it s 12 hours  i kinda wonder what would happen if someone gets legit hurt during the safety course because they likely don t have health coverage anywhere else at that point  i deduced that it s meant for retirees or the most desperate people in the world  now when i see trail stewards out there i ask if anything has changed for the better over the last 5 years  and naturally it hasn t  i feel bad for each one of them   tl dr went to an interview to get paid for something i more or less already do daily  discovered the absolutely ridiculous work requirements  dipped ,n5o88t

2528,I actually really like working in a corporate environment,because of how fake everything is  the jobs  the culture  a lot of the companies' goals   most of the day consists of lying to make it seem like you actually did something or passing the blame if something went wrong  it sucks if the blame is passed in your direction  but then you can pass it on to someone else if you're lucky   i actually got my most prestigious job by lying  i lied on my resume  my portfolio  and in my job interview  i got to the job and really had no idea what i was doing  but i pretended i did and actually got some on-the-job learning experience that set me up down the line for other jobs  on that note  i'm pretty sure i blew a job opportunity recently because i was truthful  i had a little bit of experience in the position they needed  when i should've said it was a piece of cake and just learned on the job through doing it or examining other people   the other thing is that no one actually knows what anyone else in the company does for a job  in my case i was a designer  so my job was one where i had to create a product and have something physical for people to see as the result of my labor  but no one knew what my job entailed  that computer stuff looks so hard  i could never do that  so i could easily say a project would take 4 hours and then knock it out in 30 minutes    on my end  i had no idea what anyone did  most people just seemed to write emails  avoid phone calls  and attend meetings where nothing of note was accomplished  they all had job titles  but it was just a jumble of words that formed a sentence but had no real world meaning  it's also kind of interesting that these types of jobs pay more but entail the least amount of work   and the sad truth is a lot of employees don't even know what their companies do  they're just a group of people inside a building that does a set of tasks and somehow money comes in and they get paid  this is especially true if a company doesn't specifically produce a product   in the end  working in a corporate environment becomes like a game to see how much you can bullshit and still succeed  and you know most everyone else thinks it's bullshit  but it's also a game to get together and see who can out bullshit the others ,n4pvc0

2586,I am so over my job,dear antiwork         i have ptsd and work is hard in general  i need to have set guidelines and schedule flexibility  i work in retail         when i started  i took my position 5 years ago as a manager qs a favor to my favorite manager because they needed someone  my boss told me  run your area like you would your own business  so i did  my numbers were incredible  and my associates loved me  but i was slipping in and out of depressive episodes  my favorite manager had left and a new manager took her place       immediately  the new manager made it clear she did not like me  she became more demanding in my duties  but provided no proof that these things were expected of me  the next three years were torture  i was told to come in 6 days a week during our busy season and was not allowed to take vacation  my associates  who made 11 cents less per hour than i did  were allowed 5 weeks of vacation in a row   i was not in charge of scheduling         i requested my wedding day off 4 months in advance  a single day not during our busy season  and was scheduled and told to  just get it covered  i couldn't  so i was forced to call out and worry about losing my job on my wedding day         but the straw that is breaking the camels back is that i took a demotion to work on my mental health  i communicated this  i also knew that associates had more lenency in their vacation time  so i gladly took a full time position as an associate         when the company went through some changes  i was told my position would stay the same  then they told me i was the manager of my department again  they changed my position without informing me  or having me sign off  no pay raise either  and no dicussion    i am going insane  i went to legal advice to see if there is anything i could do and they told me to talk to hr  we don't have an onsite hr  it is all digital    fuck this shit,n45djg

2597,The boy who cried wolf,the rhetoric where i live right now is that the reaction to covid and the subsequent unemployment stimulus has dried up the market for low skill labor  places that have been open since before i was born are making massive changes to cope with the lessened workforce  the  now hiring  signs have gone up more in the past year than the past 15  years   i realize that doesn't account for inflation  but i still think that's pretty damn significant  these places have been min wage with some pepper for my entire life and they suddenly spiked up to 11 12 an hour  more than that  the now hiring signs actually represent an opening and not just a constant fishing expedition to ensure a backlog of candidates to fill a spot asap  with all that said  i honestly think these places are being genuine about being desperately understaffed     but hold on  they've been saying they're understaffed for my entire life  that's been the go-to explanation for responsibility creep  unreasonable hours  dishonest expectations  and most of the bullshit that comes with any job  cutting safety corners  short staffed  not honoring breaks  short staffed  skeleton crews have been the norm  and have stayed the norm despite god-knows how many people asking about jobs a day  i've heard that nearly daily from every job i've ever had  that we need more people but can't get them  and now that that's actually true  these same places that played these fucking games with us are crying whole ass tears that their permanent skeleton crew bluff got called and now they're on a desperation crew    covid has been the best thing that's ever happened to me  i say that with a lot of bitterness because it took a deadly pandemic to force anyone to do the bare fucking minimal to help the people who have been struggling for as long as i've been on this earth    i say we let them squirm  they've done it to us for decades  it's about time they know what it feels like ,n51wez

2635,My Gf expects me to stay at a bullshit job where i make $2 less than my last job,this is really just a rant on how i don't understand people    so i'm 21 years of age  i currently live with my gf  21  in her parents home  before i moved in to their home  i knew that it was mandatory to be on my job hunt  i knew that i needed to be working  i never just think not working is ever an okay thing to do  but the way our capitalist country is ran  the average working class are being taken advantage of and i oppose of the way they do things    i've had 4 jobs since i've been here  march 1st    walgreens  dollar general  a furniture place  and dirt cheap  yes  dirt cheap  walgreens was too much of a commute  let alone i don't have my own vehicle  dollar general only paid  8 and hour which is so unacceptable  the furniture place was alright but my checks would never even reach 200 a week  also they didn't treat me with the same respect bc of my age so it was a challenge dealing with that itself    now  i've been working since 16  started 12 hr shifts at 17  i know how to work  i'm not lazy or anything like that  i do want to mention that i also accepted a job that is actually something i could see myself doing for a while  with that being said  today i went in for my closing shift at dirt cheap  got there  they had me so busy work for 2 whole hours walking around picking up after people  not even doing my actual job  i was fed up  for 8 an hour  it wasn't worth it  so i surely called my gf to pick me up    she does so  but then i explain to her that i really don't think imma stay there especially that i accepted a new job that pays more  she just goes silent and say how i always leave my jobs and she's not gonna tell me anything bc all i'm gonna do is get upset and this that and the 3rd  i explained to her that those jobs are not worth my time  nor am i making a good buck there  i explain to her that it's not worth it    i had intentions on working dirt cheap and the new job with the moving company because we gotta get it out here somehow you know  but yeah she just gives me attitude and says she's just never going to understand    she doesn't even work  she stays home all day and helps her mom but like she doesn't have to deal with these companies that don't give a eff about the working class    it's just extremely frustrating and it's becoming a problem nearly every other day  it bothers me that she doesn't understand that i can't just settle with working  for  8 an hour  or continue working at a place where i basically am like a little slave boy    deadass  ive walked my bosses dog on the clock because he didn't want to go out in the heat himself  his dog    anyway i hope this was a good read for some at least  i would love to hear other thoughts  she's crazy for telling me settle with that  that's how they want us to be  i refuse to ,n54ef9

2659,Guys I might quit tomorrow..., apologies for how long this is   my job used to be pretty good  but in the past year and a half it has gotten a lot worse   office monkey type stuff  first they switched my very good boss with a new boss who sucks  they switched their groups for no good reason  probably some higher up thought it was a good idea to make it look like they were  doing something  i don't know  they also do random re-orgs for no reason about once a year or two  but i digress   with old boss  i had a good rapport  she was supportive  respectful of my time  and treated me like a valued  trusted employee  well all that is gone   anyway so they have had my group working at home for over a year now due to covid  occasionally we have to go into the office though  the telecommuting rules are draconian and we had to fill out and sign a huge long agreement  i think it ran to 28 pages of policies and stuff we had to fill out  including photos and or floor plan of our work area and so forth  it also states that they can come surprise visit us to inspect our setup etc  which i am super uncomfortable with  even if my place was tidy  spoiler  it is not  anyway so during the year they have not done that  but they made us come in for a meeting the other week  and made us update and sign our telecommuting agreements again  and told us that they were definitely going to be visiting our homes now  first time with advance notice  and after that  no notice  just whenever they want to spring it on us  and no indication of how often this can happen   so there is that  which may be reason enough to quit  idk  i feel like it kind of is  but also the job has gotten worse itself - more bullshit  assigning me more work than i have time for  and recently having to train someone to answer customer emails who does not have good professional-level writing skills  like how am i supposed to teach this person grammar rules at this point in her career  oof  a recipe for badness    and then the schedule shenanigans  making me work some partial-staff holidays without advanced notice  in previous years they gave us the lists of people who have to work for each of them for the whole year  in advance  so you could  you know  plan your off time or get a coworker to switch holidays with you or work in  your place  i sent a request to my boss to find out this list for the rest of the year  and her response was basically   no  we're not going to give that to you  great   and my motivation has just been gone for months now  i haven't been completing everything  being a bad worker  i know  i just took a week of vacation  and checked my email because i was worried the notice that they'd be inspecting my place would have been during the week i was off  i didn't see that  but my boss sent a meeting invite  for just me  on tuesday that just says  discussion  at hq  without further elaboration or explanation  great  so i figure written up at best  performance improvement plan  or fired  so i'm thinking of just quitting tomorrow  monday  to just get it over with  and not have a termination on my record   there is another thing - recently i have been thinking of quitting anyway  and moving back to another state to be near my family  my mom is pretty old and she's having increasingly severe health issues  and she gave up driving several months ago  so i could help her with that  and i may just use that as my excuse with nothing further when i explain why i'm quitting  seems a benign reason that they can't really argue with  but i don't know how they would react  i will see  i do have a significant financial cushion that would last until i could find another job  and i just could really use a big change in my life  i'm sick of this city and state  i've lived here half my life and my reasons for staying are ending  child moving out  friend moved away  etc  i've been at this job for over 13 years  and i am just so sick of the place   at any rate  if i decide not to quit monday and go to the meeting tuesday in the office  i think i am gonna bring all of my work equipment and keep it in my car  in case i need to turn it in if i'm fired quit  or bring it on monday if i tell my boss i'm quitting then   sorry this is so long  just want to explain how it is and some of the bullshit i have to deal with  i told friends   one of my doctors about the whole suprise home visit requirement thing  and my doc said  that's illegal  they can't do that  and i told him  they made us sign the agreement saying they could  and they've been doing it to the customer service reps for years now  my friends and family think it's unacceptable too  but anyway  yeah  about to pull the ripcord maybe  you can't fire me  i quit ,n3mygc

2690,Let’s discuss LinkedIn,sorry for the rant in advance   there exists a degree of insincerity in any social media platform  each serves as a means to showcase different aspects of yourself  facebook is what you may reveal to your family  instagram is what you may reveal to your friends  and linkedin is what you may reveal to potential employers  i find linkedin as a platform particular unsettling because it acts as the link between you and your means for survival  unless you are a fully devoted anarcho primitivist  employment serves as your only means for survival  pre modern conditions fostered the instincts that make it so there are no lengths to which we will not go to access the means of survival  so although the system has changed from risking your life for the hunt into dressing up your linkedin page  the instinct persists  the result is a culture obsessed with subservience to a provider  we are biologically wired to continually pursue our means for survival  and when that became synonymous with employment  we created a culture where professionalism is paramount  language is sanitized  and real human expression is squandered  to me  this is most easily observed on linkedin  not an ounce of my humanity is represented on my linkedin page  it s purpose is to seduce an employer into providing me with the means to life  i put serious effort into this page because it is my only way of satisfying my instinct to survive  it s an artificial knockoff of myself  contorted into a soulless servant thats fits perfectly into the desires of some corporate hack  linkedin offers a great view into our theatrical  fucked up reality ,n3rq0u

2761,I was fired from a job that drove me insane in less than 6 months,story time  last year i was laid off from a corporate job that was really boring but i actually enjoyed it because my co-workers and boss were supportive  covid of course tanked the company and they had to let people go  i had never been laid off or fired before  but for some reason i wasn't eligible for unemployment so i was in a panic and took the first job offered to me  it was more blue collar than i was used to  but it was in my field and paid just about the same so i went with it   let me tell you this - if you think corporate culture is too sanitary and pc  you'll be begging for it when you're in a less structured situation run by a high-strung cokehead  that's exactly what happened with me  sick of pointless meetings  try working in a place where there's almost no clear communication from up high and you'll either be yelled at for doing what he said with limited information or taking the lead and trying to solve a problem on your own  cringing at endless corporate training  how about not being trained at all  even though he knows you have no experience in this type of field  and then he flips out on you for not knowing anything and then refusing to train you  every situation was damned if you do  damned if you don't   the first month was actually pretty decent  but then something changed in my boss  i was eventually tasked with doing almost everything at the business on top of my regular work without being trained for any of it  because of this inexperience and the fact that i was drowning in work i'd make mistakes  but i'd never hear from him if i did a good job  i'd only hear from him if i screwed up  and boy did i hear from him  in fact  the only way i knew a project was going smoothly is if he didn't say anything  never heard a positive word about my work after that first month  his way of motivating me  telling me i'm overpaid and costing him money because of my wages and the mistakes i was making due to lack of proper leadership   at the 2 month mark i began having sleep issues  i've always been able to get a good 6-8 hours' sleep no matter how stressed i was  but this job put me on such edge that i would either fall asleep and then be woken up 2 hours later because of a work dream and not be able to fall back to sleep  or just not sleep at all the entire night even though i was absolutely exhausted  the latter happened at least twice a week  so i was a zombie  but the anxiety of the possibility of facing my boss's wrath made me on high alert and run on pure adrenaline - i actually drank less coffee than i had in years because i was naturally wired   i had no energy to do anything  i couldn't exercise  and i was eating like shit  work was so hectic that i hadn't had a lunch break in months  unless you count inhaling a protein bar at my desk while he stepped out for 2 seconds lunch  my commute was 90 minutes one way and i racked up an insane amount of miles on my new leased car  2 000 a month  i'd get home and just be grumpy and mean to my girlfriend and everyone i encountered  my job was one where i had to physically be there in able to perform it  but still i couldn't stop thinking about work once i got home  my christmas and new year's were ruined because the days leading up to those holidays was like a pressure cooker  the highlight being when my boss called a 16-year-old kid who worked with us an idiot to his face   one monday morning i woke up after not having slept the night before  dreading coming back to work after the weekend  i was physically shaking  i went to go walk my dog with my girlfriend and i just broke down crying  prior to this i had only cried a handful of times in the past decade  always relating to the death of a loved one  my girlfriend told me to take the day off  i texted my boss to tell him i wasn't coming in  first time i had ever take off work in 6 months  and he was none too pleased   the next day i drove 90 minutes to work  only to find my desk was cleared  my boss walks out  stops me  and hands me my paycheck  he tells me that last week a project i was a part of had gotten screwed up  something which could've been easily avoided had there been a chain of communication or quality control  he said i was costing him too much and he had to let me go  i kept things civil  but i walked out and never looked back   i've been unemployed for a few months now and i'm making just about as much on unemployment as i did while employed  my head was so fucked up from just 6 months at this job that i needed a good month to decompress and get a reality check  yes  my perspective of myself was so skewed from this den of negativity that i thought i was useless or retarded and would never amount to anything again  i had to re-connect with some friends and family and even past co-workers to be assured that i wasn't a complete fuck-up   i got some advice from a former co-worker when it came to job searching -  be picky  taking whatever job without doing the proper research lead me to this fiasco  so i decided to put myself out there as i am and see who comes  rather than me changing myself to please a potential employer  it's even better if i can get some referrals from people who work at places or know someone who does  as that will help me gauge what it's like there    this whole situation lead me to this subreddit  the job market was tough for millennials' quality of life since the 2000s  but covid has just kicked the bullshit up a notch  you now have to give it 300  instead of 200  since everyone's jobs are in jeopardy  and chances are a bunch of people in your team were laid off  so you now have to take on their work without a raise  or if your company made you take a pay cut  do it for even less money than usual  every job i've found on my search pays less than what i was making before and they expect more work  i remember my parents working 8 hours and coming home and watching tv and relaxing  but something tells me it'll be the norm for my peers' free time to be spent either doing stuff for work  or going back to school  or having a side hustle to make ends meet  and even when you do have free time  your phone could always ring with a work-related call because our pocket computers make it expected that we can be reached at any time   rant over ,n3zx4g

2840,The story of a quitter,i was heavily depressed  yet my parents were so obsessed with the idea of me getting a degree that they didn't want me to quit    amp x200b   i quit college  i found a job  people higher in the hierarchy shouted all the time  colleagues were all into jealousy  backstabbing and ridiculing eachother   i quit   i found a job with a great job description  it seemed kinda like a technical position  tons of problem solving  you know  great  i send my cv  i get the job  i get into the  office  it's a call center  the place was so filled with people that they seemed like a jar of sardines  being an inbound call center  i had to constantly answer phone calls  and since i'm heavily introverted i was going insane   i quit   then i tried a degree as a medical technician  knowing the interaction with people were supposed to be minimal and impersonal  doctors tried to exploit the shit out of the students and were super disrespectful  insulting and shouting was the norm  and the other students thought it was ok  doctors instulted and shouted at them and they just continued kissing their asses  they also were jealous backstabbers who ridiculed every mistake and reported everything to the bosses   i quit   then i tried working at an optician  since it was the only job i could find  i have to say the job was a little bit less stressful  but such a socially oriented job causes great stress to me in the long term  and my supervisor was the most bitter girl i've ever known  she would explain things one time very fast  and if i messed up she would get totally mad and shout  but she would also shout if i asked for further explanations  one day when i was having lunch and she didn't know i was already there i heard her telling another colleague that i forgot everything she explained  just because that day i made a mistake   i quit   at that point i was absolutely burned out  but pressure from my parents led me to get back to the first degree i tried  since i did all the exams of the first years and they were still valid for the university despite having quit  being burned out  i gave no exams  i got into therapy  i quit therapy  i did some exams   i quit therapy because according to me the therapist was just eager to find disorders in my head in order to give me lithium  i'm no way bipolar  for sure i changed lifestyle very often  but it was just in an attempt to find a way to become  normal  and just work  but i can't fucking fit in  i feel like on the job market everyone's a sociopath and the environment is so cruel   two years have passed since the burnout  i'm 25 years old  if a miracle happens and do everything perfectly i'll get a bachelor degree when i'm 26  but most likely i'll get the degree at 27  it's even more likely i'll never get the degree   right now i kinda got to the point in which i don't want to attempt to go back to the job market  hierarchy drives people insane  and i don't want to get into hell again  my mind wanders from place to place  sometimes i'm satisfied not giving a fuck about corporate life  enjoying a walk in nature or a cup of tea  sometimes i feel like i messed up  am a failure and realize i'm in a shameful position for all the people  and i feel the eyes on me and want to die   i don't give a fuck about richness  fame  girls  i just want to have a small house in a tiny village were i can have walks in nature on my own ,n2f3cg
