0,Complaints from a Walmart Cashier (rant),i m an 18 year old cashier who works at walmart  i m taking a year off between high school and college and was originally going to work this year  but after recently going full-time  i m having doubts  sorry if this comes off as entitled petty  but here are the things i m struggling with   1  walmart is a shit company  after learning more about their business practices  i m no longer naive to their horrible ideals and can t claim ignorance  working for this company makes me feel guilty as i am enabling and helping them   watch the documentary  the high cost of low price  on youtube   2  my fucking feet hurt  even with my  comfort mat  under my register it is painful  once i wore flat-soled shoes instead of tennis shoes and my feet hurt so bad that i had to buy a new pair of tennis shoes half way through my shift   3  baby boomers  i m tired of being screamed at over expired coupons  it shouldn t piss me off but when 5 customers in a row don t say  hello  or  thank you  back  i get a little irritable  it s like i m barely human   4  social anxiety  before i got this job  i rarely talked to anyone  i ve become more social and i m able to hold conversations now  so i m grateful i ve tried cashiering  but i m just an introverted person and it s exhausting to hold conversations all day   5  they won t let me take off the three days i want next week for a trip  this one is petty but it s inconvenient as i told them about it nearly two months ago and i spent money on my ticket  they usually let me have whatever day i want off but this time it s different  i guess   6  we re chronically understaffed  some days i m the only cashier with lines of 10  people while management dicks around and pretends not to see   7  i have to work holidays  maybe i m coming off as entitled but last year was the first year i ever had to miss thanksgiving with my family because of  brown thursday  we ate at 5  so i had 15 minutes to eat  and then went off for my shift at 5 30    8  stress  i know i have one of the easiest jobs out there  but i just can t take it  i m just bad at social interaction and i get stressed out by all the weird demands and complaints  especially after standing around for 8  hours   9  i miss being outside  my days off are spent recharging  i want to go on trips with my family  i will have to miss out on ours this year because they won t let me take it off  and i want to get back into the gym more often  i want some peace  and relaxation before i kick myself into college and a career   10  they re probably firing my favorite manager because  they can and it s convenient for them at this time  it s all bullshit  it s not my business to share so i won t give info   11  brian is a douchebag   reasons i want to keep my job   1  money  i want to be able to go to college  yesterday a very kind man came through my checkout and asked me what my plans were since i d just graduated  i told him i m taking the year off before school and he told me  the reason they pay you like this here is to encourage you to get a degree  and i just couldn t stop thinking about how ass-backwards and absolutely untrue that was  i am a human machine  i do nothing but monotonous  simple-minded scanning day in and day out  they pay me this way because i am the human version of a self-checkout machine   anyways  sorry for my rant  i m not having a good time ,chbws2

2,"Boss cut my hours in half and made promises she couldn't keep, keeps pushing off talking to me about it",i'm at a loss for what to do  i started working in a pr position about 3 months ago and my i'm fed up with my boss  in my interview she hired me to work a minimum of 20 hours a week  and said i could work as many extra hours as i wanted up to 40 a week  i was very excited to work that many hours and had big plans for what i was going to do for the company   since then she's cut my hours to 30 a week and then 20  despite my putting in massive amounts of work during that time  she cited lack of funds to pay me and said that she hired me to work 20 hours initially  i lost almost all of my motivation after this  all that hard work was rewarded with my hours and pay being chopped in half  i am now back to living in poverty after a few short weeks of making a livable income for the first time in my life    she promised my coworker a comission for any investment money she earned  but didn't give me the same deal  when i asked her about it  she said that my coworker was not receiving any comission money  i asked her if my coworker knew that she wasn't receiving comission  and she wouldn't answer the question   i had to promote our company at an event and my coworker got there over an hour late  my boss told us she wasn't coming at the last minute  my boss didn't reserve a table and i had to borrow a table and chairs from the venue  it was lucky they had extra supplies for us or we would have been fucked  i carried several boxes of heavy supplies in the 100 degree heat as a 120lb girl  hunted for a table and chairs  set up the entire booth and deconstructed it solo  and carried the supplies back to the car in the rain at the end of the day  my boss asked me to drive to the office and return the supplies today--we are under a severe thunderstorm warning and i told her there was no way i'd carry the supplies by myself in the pouring rain  she was clearly unhappy with this    i am looking for a new job but i have a disability where i can't stand for long periods of time  which limits my options  i had a meeting to talk with my boss today  but she cancelled on me and is flying out of the state tomorrow for 2 weeks  i have no idea where to go from here and i dread working for a company that doesn't respect me or my time  any advice for this situation ,cgzd74

7,Forced Overtime (The joy of cutting labor),i already feel like i m always at work  i do seven 8 hour days in a row and then get a few days off   recently someone at my company has figured out they can make spreadsheets look good by not hiring people and cutting labor   so for a few weeks everyone was getting forced into 16 hour shifts randomly and hitting around 64-72 hours a week   now i walk in and find out we have been scheduled 7 days in a row with no off days for the indefinite future   what is the motherfucking point of even being alive on a schedule like this  i guess i don t have that  protestant work ethic  or i am a bad worker bee   so now i am on permanent night shift and will not see my wife except for maybe a few minutes if she stays up late or i get up super early    what kills me is half the employees just smile and take it like good little worker bees   bigger checks   i guess i m just a lazy piece of shit ,chxpko

11,Long post ahead. Need serious advice.,hopefully this post doesn t get too long  but here it goes  i ll be transparent as possible  for the past 3 years i have done absolutely nothing  i was in a masters program and things kind of fell threw right at the end  and now 3 years have past of me leeching off my aunt and mother playing video games  sleeping  and staying inside    i am 27 now and for the past 3 months i have been moving forward quite a bit  i ve lost a lot of weight  got back into my masters program and will be able to finish it within 4 months    here s the fun part and why i am on this sub  i m completing an internship to finish my degree and i hate this shit more than i should  my drive is long  the pay sucks  and the work is all bullshit  but all things are pointing positive and i ve  technically haven t been in a better spot  and yes i understand that my options will be better once this shit is over with  but knowing that doesn t help me get through the day  so why the fuck am i so miserable  that shit doesn t make sense  everyone is telling me to get on medication and frankly i m against it since i already was on two pills for 7 months  i dropped them cold turkey when i got off my ass 3 months ago  i never thought the medicine helped personally and neither did my family  which is funny since they think it s a good idea again    no matter what happens  i m finishing this internship  but the question i want answered is if you guys think i should go back to living with my mom and leeching off of her  i get it  i m a lazy piece of shit  i think about this everyday and honestly this might be my true nature  and not just the typical lazy bullshit like everyone thinks they have  like  this is the i sat around for 3 years and it didn t bother me lazy  the truth is when i sat around for so long  i probably wasn t  happy  but i know damn well i wasn t unhappy either  and now  now i know i am unhappy    so yeah  i m going to have a ms soon  and it doesn t excite me  i don t feel motivated and i really don t give a shit  i was so excited to put everything back into place and full of energy  but now that i m doing this shit  fuck all of it  so yeah  if i have the opportunity to leech off my mom should i just do it  give me any kind of advice  please  i don t think i m suicidal  but the thought of driving off the road one day and trying to cripple myself does put a smile on my face and brightens my day ,cjd9nj
12,Just thought back to an amusing experience I had in my first job review.,i was 22 years old  a new engineer who graduated into the recession   i knew i was underpaid   they knew i was underpaid   but i only ever heard good things about my  performance   ugh  hate that word     it was the end of the fiscal year  raise time  and they gave us a self evaluation   which is a dumb idea out the gate   one of the questions was  how would you like to be rewarded for good work   i kind of blinked at the page   what the fuck  other than not sucking up 8  hours of my day   i wrote down  other than the traditional form of higher pay  not much else comes to mind   a few weeks later i get called to the hr office  like i'm getting called to principal in school   she goes over my pitiful raise  um salary adjustment  and goes through my review   she asks  what do you mean by 'traditional form of higher pay'   i had to look blankly at her   i honestly didn't know if she was fucking with me or not    a higher raise   more money   she still stared at me   what was i gonna say    this shit is boring and the more money you give me the more i can enjoy my shrinking non-work hours and the faster i can finally leave this institution of wage labor   i just stared her down until she said  ok  and i went back to my desk   are these people for fucking real   later  when i left  she asked me why i was going to a new job   i said it was because it was more interesting to me  more in a field i wanted to work in   she asks me why i took this first job then   i couldn't believe it    because we were in a fucking recession  and i applied to 80 jobs and you were one of the only 3 that got back to me   being a new graduate i couldn't exactly be picky   hr has to be some of the most indoctrinated and clueless ,cjklhw
13,Have you ever had a workplace try to force beliefs onto people or intimidate you into pretending to agree with them? How have you dealt with it?,i had a mandatory training that amounted to requirement to abide by strict and narrow beliefs  and worse than that  wanted us to push it on our clients who are often really vulnerable and in need of help with basic life activities  they don't need this wish-wash religious stuff pushed on them  i don't mind if other people believe this  i'm often the philosophical minority and am used to it  but it's amazing to me there are widespread  discrimination laws  in the united states  and i'm presuming many other countries  yet something like this continues to march on  i don't like to involve the law at all  it's not my values  but it is really telling if a company can get away with this in a world where people usually sue or quit over this  at first i thought i was alone in diverging from the narrow beliefs  but having looked back on it repeatedly and gotten support from a friend in the same industry  i now question how many people were also silent dissenters  only 6 out of the 40 people actually spoke when it was supposed to be  an open discussion  which was blatantly a lie ,ck50j0

15,The Orwellian Workplace,i've seen this complaint on here many times but i'm sure many people aren't aware to the extent that this tends to happen  i'd like to point out what exactly qualifies a workplace as  orwellian  and what you cab do about it    now  the actual practices of the orwellian workplace might seem  at first  like basic  integral parts of a safe work environment  but as with all things you experience in work  it's something that should be questioned   your general orwellian workplace involves a  lot  of monitoring  more than could ever be reasonably expected in your general workplace  while in retail your occasional camera may be used to record and retroactively watch employees in the case of a lawsuit or similar legal issue  an orwellian workplace  directly  and presently monitors your actions  ensuring you are not breaking any of the multitude rules of the workplace    i will give as an example two workplaces  one i previously experienced and another i am currently in    the first of these two was perhaps the greatest example of resource waste and complete employee mistrust  i worked for a security firm that had installed cameras across the facility for dual purposes  for the officers to monitor the site  and for headquarters to monitor the officers    you see  the company i worked for didn't trust the officers despite the fact that there had been no unattended or poorly-handled on-site incidents at that particular location  and when they learned officers were doing things other than staring at a monitor for 8 hours  they set up an out of state monitoring office with a second set of officers watching us for even the most minor infractions  and random inspections would see every aspect of our entire shift torn apart with a fine-tooth comb to catch us and write us up for something as sinful as taking a minute to respond to a text message  these offsite personnel were themselves monitored by a separate set of offsite personnel   you might be saying at this point that such a stringent oversight is necessary in the security industry and that so much shouldn't be classified as orwellian despite the obvious comparisons  and are simply safety measures    in which case  i offer you the second workplace    in this job i work for a junkyard  we have dozens of people scavenging up parts and it's my job to catalogue them and prepare them for sale  while we usually get in 10-20 of these parts a day  i have been able to finish my work within two or so hours  this leaves me with very very little to do and as a result  i find myself simply sitting there refreshing pages  recently  however  i was reprimanded for a  drop in work output  and after some poking around i learned how they believed this  they were not looking at the number of parts left to list  nor the number of parts listed  no  they were watching two factors  bathroom breaks and keystrokes   now  the issue of bathroom breaks is due to a medical problem  but the state of health in the workplace is another issue for another day  what i want to focus on is the keystrokes comment    this is a common tactic of companies  particularly in desk jobs  the question is not if the work is being done  or if it is being done well  the question is if we are  wasting their time  and breaking the unspoken law of workplaces  workers are assets  not people  and an asset not utilized to its full efficiency is useless  regardless of the health of the asset  and so they watch us  monitor us  and reprimand us on the basis that we are not to waste any of the time they they view as theirs  for this sin is cardinal amongst employers and bosses    so why am i telling all of this  just to complain about my own experiences  just to make a post begging for pity  no  my reasons are twofold    1  to help others understand what their bosses are no doubt doing to them at this very moment  no matter the industry and no matter the work   they are watching you  make no mistake  they may tell you this is because they are protecting themselves legally  but that is only what they say and they certainly believe you to be a danger to their fragile superiority  you may think u s law protects you  but you are wrong    2  to drive home the point that  this is not okay  it may not be illegal  but law is not the moral arbiter  to be treated like an automation  a robot at risk of going off programming at any time  is cruel and dehumanizing    so what can you do if this is happening to you   there are two things  but both are unfortunately long shots    1  join a union  especially if you're in retail  the iww can help you organize your workplace quickly and demand lighter monitoring before your employer can catch on  ultimately  all you'll need is for the rest of your coworkers to feel the same as you do  this is  however  dangerous  as many larger chains would rather close down than allow unionization  when doing so  use a fake name in correspondences  do not conduct business on company grounds  and make certain you choose your allies well  many other workers may be lying in wait to solidify a position by selling you out   2  stand firm  this works best if an employer relies on you or your position is difficult to fill  if they pull you aside to reprimand you for  wasting time  or for a low workload  be certain to remind them that they hired you to do a certain job  and that the job is getting done efficiently and effectively  most employers are well aware that workers are their base  and that important ones are vital  if you stand up to them  it's likely they won't push harder so long as everything they ask you to do is being done    remember  don't let the bosses win  workers are the backbone of their greed and they know it ,cjeal1

18,Is there a 'pro-' alternative to 'anti-work'?,first a disclaimer that seems to be mandatory on the internet nowadays to prevent people from commenting before reading  i'm not criticizing the idea of 'anti-work'  i share the sentiment  i'm just genuinely interested   that said  i was wondering  this subreddit is called 'antiwork' and i see a lot of 'anti-work' mentions  but it implies is criticism on something that already exists  and criticizing something is easy  'anti' generally also has a negative sound to it  i personally always prefer to present alternatives to something i'm criticizing   so my question is  is there a general consensus on what the alternative s  would be  is there a name for that  so i can read up on it and i could put in a more positive light by calling it 'pro-whatever' when talking to people that may be easily offended by opposing ideas ,cjf2tt

26,Interesting article on CNBC,cnbc  the fed is about to cut rates to protect the economy  even though most signs are strong  https www cnbc com 2019 07 26 fed-to-cut-rates-for-first-time-since-2008-jobs-data-should-be-strong html  strong economy should be in quotes  the economy is basically in the same shape it was in 2013 when former obama economic adviser larry summers said we were suffering from  secular stagnation  a term he recycled from the 1930s   unemployment is low  officially  but only because labor force participation fell after 2001 until 2009 and never recovered  wages have been stagnant by official reckoning since the 1970s and collapsing by the more accurate gold measure  income has been concentrated in the hands of the very wealthiest magnates of capital  growth has slowed to a negligible 2 percent per year  even with interest rates held near zero and massive deficit spending of a trillion dollars a year    if this is a strong economy  what does a weak one look like  and can the environment survive an economy that lives up to the cnbc hype  we have to begin now to drive the debate away from economic growth and toward less work  it is our only hope for the future ,ciy5od

28,Is it just me or is this kind of dystopian? “Nursing mothers can elect to take time to express breast milk during their breaks”,associates and applicant with accommodation needs related to lactation after childbirth  may request a reasonable workplace accommodation for their lactation need  the company will provide this break time for up to three years following the birth of a child  the company may also engage an associate in a cooperative dialogue to determine whether a reasonable lactation workplace accommodation is needed and addressing the difficulties that a requested lactation accommodation may pose   nursing mothers can elect to take time to express breast milk during their regularly schedule meal and rest breaks  of the break time cannot run concurrently with the meal and rest breaks already provided to the employee  the break time will be unpaid for nonexempt employees  there additional breaks are required  employees should work with their supervisor regarding schelling  a nonexempt employee can elect to work before or after her normal shift to make up the amount of time used during unpaid break time for expression of breast milk  so long as sees one he requested falls within the company's normal work hours  employees are required to provide reasonable notice to the company that they intend to take breaks for expressing breast milk upon returning to work  f  employees have the right to request a lactation room for purposes of expressing breast milk  the lactation room will be a sanitary place  other than a restroom  that is yielded from view  free from intrusion and in reasonable proximity to the employee s work area  the lactation room will include an electrical outlet  a chair  a surface on which to place a breast pump and other personal items and nearby access to running water  a refrigerator suitable for breast milk   storage will also be available in reasonable proximity to the employee's work area  a room identified for use as a lactation room may also be used for other purposes  however  during times when an employee is using the room as a lactation room  that will be its sole function  when two or more employees need to use the room for lactation purposes or in connection with other accommodations  they should work with their supervisor to schedule room usage comparatively and in a way that accommodate all affected employees  of providing the requested lactation room will place an undue hardship on the company s operations  the company will engage in good faith in a cooperative dialogue with the employee conceding the employee's accommodation needs  in the event this situation arises  please contact your manager and of department at the contact information below  ,ci9gp4

32,"idk what to title this as, it's just a vent i guess",i work for a factory  it's my first job since i graduated from high school  the job has made my already severe depression so much worse  i just got news that my favorite teacher passed away  and among other things that have happened in my life this month  it's been a tipping point  for my first 90 days  i can only miss one day  and i already had my one  which was for a different breakdown  once my parents head to bed  my friend is picking me up and letting me crash with her for a night  i know i'm going to get fired for this  but i think i'd rather be jobless than suicidal    i haven't been this miserable for years  i even relapsed after 2 years of being clean  i know i should just tell my dad  but last time i told him about the job making me feel this way  he just berated me  running away for a bit just seems like a better option right now  i'd go to a mental facility if i had insurance  but since i don't  this is what i perceive to be my best option  i'm gonna disappoint everyone  but i can't take this shit anymore  i've only been there for a month and i'm already this much of a mess  i'm just so lost ,cj4adn

34,Watching my work panic is hilarious,the turnover here is obscene and it s due in part to one of the managers being verbally abusive  it s also in part to the lack of benefits they give everyone who works here  no sick time  no pto  no raises  and the actual personal care aids  pcas  get it even worse making poverty wages    do the owners of the company care  nope  the owner came in last week to complain we weren t bringing in enough money  and to also use us as guinea pigs for a new business he s starting by making us do a group activity  for fun    so now the chickens have come home to roost  we ve lost so many people and we are having to train two new people this week  pretty sure one of them isn t going to last and i m not too sure about the other one   however  we ve had two more people resign last week and they ll have to be replaced and their replacements have to be trained up which is a long process  so that s four people they ll be training now   so management is shitting themselves  the abusive director is screaming at the head of the company  it s wild  meanwhile i m just sitting here watching this chaos unfold    it would all be avoided if the owner actually took care of the employees  but nope  he d rather go on expensive vacations and own a lot of lavish and expensive nonsense while his company crumbles ,cjd5n8
35,Just needed to vent..,i tried to move into my car with my boyfriend  we quit our jobs  had our backpacks and my dog  and hit the road  it was supposed to be beautiful  i exhausted the few hundreds i had saved  in about two weeks  we went to lots of places  and he left me on the coast  in a parking lot  with everything i own in the back  it was awful  i shamefully went back to my parents  had just enough money for gas and a pack of smokes to do so  with my dog   i'm trying to get back on my feet  but i feel so disgusted with jobs in general  the particular work i used to do not only requires all the usual extremely personal info  but also a tb test  they stick a needle in your arm  a physical  and fingerprinting background checks  they should be taking my fucking blood  too  it feels like  i want to move to the coast  i'm not far  about 3 and a half hours drive away  but for some reason i have no idea how to do so  i dont know where to start  i feel like i'm going to have to abandon most of my ideals  do i get a job there  and leave my dog here all week and sleep in my car  do i try to get a job here   not much  it's a small area  only part time fast paced slave driving work at best  and save up penny by penny   i guess i just needed to vent  it's hard to try to resume the travel tent life on my own  especially with my pup and with a broken heart  i dont want to slip through the cracks but i dont want to hate my life  i've done some side work since i've been here so i'm not a financial burden on my parents  but it's not enough to even save for a place  i defaulted on my student debt so my credit is fucked and i'll need to fix it before i can rent a place of my own again  i never realized growing up  how easy it is to fuck up your life so badly ,cjk4rp

43,How do you handle suicidal feelings as a wage laborer?,my husband hasn't been able to go back to work because of disability  but apparently the government doesn't consider him disabled enough to deserve ssi  i've been making sacrifice after sacrifice for my family but it's all coming out to nothing  i go to school full time  have two jobs and do all of the housework  i've been able to feed my family well but only because i eat nothing but rice and bread  i lost weight and my clothes stopped fitting me so i resorted to stealing t-shirts and jeans from goodwill because there was literally no money in my budget to buy clothes  i can't afford to be suicidal  which i am not right now  if that makes sense  because if i sought help they'd force me into a hospital against my will and charge me thousands and thousands of dollars  i have insurance but i can't afford the copays and deductibles to seek mental health treatment anyways  i stopped taking my medicine months ago because i couldn't afford it anymore  living in america right now just feels like being a feudal serf  you work your ass off day in and day out and all you get is more debt and more misery  if i had enough income to save money  i would save money to fly away from the united states into a country that cared about human dignity ,ck5rd1
44,Little steps for remembering to enjoy my life.,i've  thankfully  been a long-time lurker here and am glad to now join in the discussion  i don't want to lie to myself when it comes to my personal anti-work attitude  i am a lazy man who prefers to take interest in things without anything to do with money or gain beyond the ability to think about what i want to think about  i don't want to work  i would like to keep a garden and tend to that  just surviving should be all i have to do  and really when i think about it  it's all i want to do  the next step is to start feeling how i want to feel  and pursuing it   i work in the hospitality industry  been at it for about 7 months now  this is my 11th  job since 2012 when i graduated from community college  i ghost every employer because they don't own me and i don't owe them anything  i've made it clear by my actions and demeanor at this job that i want nothing to do with  work family  i really only respect the housekeeping women because they bust ass for no respect or wage  i do what i can to lighten the mood for them and encourage them when any of them speak amongst themselves about organizing to collectively not show up  they have been growing more and more disgruntled and i can only say to that   good   anyway  ballpark it at every couple of months when i will have this reoccurring  moment of clarity  when it completely shocks me -as if learning about it for the first time- that people slave it for 30  years  just isolate that without thinking of the decline in health  etc afterwords  30  years  and that out of all the possibilities for living we went ahead and played along with this demeaning and environmentally and mentally emotionally destructive game  it still is unbelievable to me   well  if you combine this state with being down the anthropocene   climate change rabbithole  you have where i am  and really  maybe i am right where i need to be  as in  why should i bother with this nonsense  and how have i forgotten that i am alive and living instead of droning around in habit   i feel ready to invite a little chaos into my life  in a healthy way  i started by ending my day friday with reading a book for the last two hours  i'm calling in sick tomorrow so i can meet up with a woman at the beach  and i'm gonna be riding bare minimum at this job until the wheels fall off  and after that  maybe i'll swing some contracting jobs painting or laboring  crash on a couch or two  maybe i'll take a greyhound again and hit it some place with just a backpack  i have a couple thousand dollars saved  that's more than enough for a while for me  and i don't see much point in having it to begin with  it's as pointless and destructive as the jobs and industries it creates   fuck work  and fuck forgetting to live ,ciouab
45,Is 6 weeks of paid vacation truly an outrageous request for a salaried employee in the U.S.?,healthcare aside  i wanted to talk about vacation culture in the u s  in the u s  there isn't a set of laws governing mandatory  paid  vacation unlike in several european countries  vacation packages vary per country in europe  4 weeks seems to be the average amount granted per person  note  this excludes paid sick time which varies  regardless of type of job career   some context  i work in a small office  12 people total  and am salary  exempt employee  this means i don't get overtime at all  even though i frequently work 45 hours per week  i work very hard and am profitable for the company  my boss occasionally scoffs when i leave right on time  even though i show up early   i know in the u s  i should be fortunate and grateful to have 2 weeks of paid vacation  including 1 week off during christmas end of the year  but i can't help but feel shafted as a human from getting a real break from corporate america  i even feel guilty when i speak to others about wanting more paid time off like its some kind of insane request  i know i probably shouldn't have spoken about antiwork in public or even with family  or so - lesson learned  i was planning to ask for a raise soon but ask for an increase in paid vacation time instead of a salary raise  to me  a 2  raise is almost equivalent to another week off  1 week  52 weeks  0 019  is 6 weeks of paid vacation an outrageous request for a salaried employee  i can't believe i only get 2 weeks out 52 weeks a year off  maybe i just need to move to europe or start my own company ,chvm85

47,Why are most people unaware?,could you recommend any interesting books or papers about why most people are unaware of the exploitation they are subjected to  i refer here mostly to developed countries  not people in africa or india living below the poverty line   what made me think about this  my employer  a very large one - few thousands employees  carries out a survey each year  a census  it's a public office so i guess they have to do it  you can view results more generally and by branch office once completed    it's anonymous    most of the results show people are content with their jobs  they are content with their manager  opportunities  conditions  they are happy  happy  happy  across 50 questions  i mean really shocking 70-80 percent happy   facts show people haven't had a real pay rise in many years with purchasing power rapidly decreasing  the work itself is utterly depressing working in cubicles-like desks  with very little to none daylight  no plants  strictly against the policy  recycled air  no intellectual challenge  no creativity whatsoever  i mean 0   i am not exaggerating  management is abusive  worst kind of low lives with low intelligence and excellent ass kissing abilities   why do the surveys show such a high percentage of content in an environment that is utterly soul crushing  there are few people around me who are aware what an absolute garbage the work is  but most seem genuinely content  when i think about the society in large  there seem to be too many people almost happy to be exploited or at least they find it completely normal spending your entire day 5 days per week in a basement like environment under neon lights  no windows or daylight anywhere near  doing the worst type of paper pushing jobs    i understand  you have to  i am in the same position  there's no one else to pay the bills  but i'm also certainly aware of how extremely dissatisfied i am in a soul crushing office job  i want to cry most days  i feel the best years of my life have gone to waste   so are people basically stupid sheep by nature  or am i being an arrogant prick for thinking that i am more aware compared to most people that a fundamental system change on a global scale is needed or i can't survive this for much longer  what am i missing    i often think that if the majority of people were like me  we would have had a revolution  redistribution of wealth and a new world order long time ago  we would be working 20 to 30 hours per week at most in meaningful jobs  all you need to say is no  that's enough ,chzodf

55,Living in a van,warning   absolutely no formatting  tldr  living in a van sounds good to me and you should probably check it out if it sounds good to you  i think living in a van would be incredibly freeing  you can go anywhere without being tethered to a house or apartment  you don't have to pay rent at all  if you get an electric van you barely have to pay for transport  with some optimization of the space  with a folding bed and stuff that can move out of the way  you can have a very compact little house with enough open area to move around in the privacy of your own van   you will still need a job  preferably one you can work online for  unless you have money saved up  but there isn't really much need to work a lot of hours unless you want extra money  because really the only expense is food  you don't have to pay any bills  all of the money you make is yours   it is good to have an emergency fund in case of break downs  or a medical emergency  just drive somewhere where you can get cheap healthcare i guess  with a pretty small investment of a couple thousand dollars  you can usually get vans pretty cheaply from people  if you are buying a cheap used van  have a mechanic take a look at it so you can fix it and find any problems before you go out and break down in the middle of nowhere or something  minus the cost of the van  you can make a van to live in for around 2000-4000 dollars  i don't really know  this is just a guess  van life is not for everyone  but if you don't want to work all day everyday just to be able to have a place to live and food to eat  and you don't mind being in a pretty small space  this is a good option ,cheyoo

59,‪i should honestly be paid extra to small talk with my coworkers if my boss wants to know about my day so bad she can pay me an extra $2/hr‬ for it,short list of topics my coworkers have forced onto me     if she should get her bridesmaid dress in sleeveless or one shoulder   how bad the new starbucks hire is    where she can get a pore sucking device for her face   pictures of her kid s ballet costume and how it s too itchy in the back but she can t do anything about it because the ballet teacher won t allow modifications because she s such a bitch and too controlling and definitely will be taking her kids to another dance school next year,cjv8h7
60,Nothing else to do at work (Temping &amp; working from home) but I still have two months left on my contract!,initially began in may to work alone on a manageable and simple project  it was supposed to be 3 months but my very kind and nice manager has extended it until oct    because i work alone on this non-urgent project  i m able to work from home  a week or two ago marks the end of any new updates to said project and now all up for testing and qa by my manager but she hasn t got to it yet    just came back from my long weekend away and the first day i was back  my manager was away  so basically i mucked around the whole day at my desk at home doing nothing at all or online shopping and random home errands    if she s away tomorrow should i just continue doing whatever  should i send her another email  there s literally nothing else to do for the project unless manager says so  so i have no idea what to do with my time at work  i ll still be logging the hours for sure  but still  never been in this type of work situation before  can anyone else share some insight    also  due to the high amount of downtime at work  i ve already developed a new skill  should i learn something else during company time ,ckh08o

68,Have any of you worked administrative assistant roles?,if so  how was it  i'm currently full-time in accounting and i was looking around for part-time office jobs to switch to  of course  part-time office jobs do not really exist    the only roles i found  as you'd imagine  are administrative assistant roles  we all know the stigma surrounding them - the  office bitch  the one who does the dirty work  kisses ass  answers phones  makes coffee  makes copies  etc   though this would be degrading and a  down-grade  from my current role  i'm considering the possibility of doing it part-time just for the time being so that i can work on personal projects for a little while  i have no time to do that with my full-time job  i also heard that on the bright side  bright side  lol  some admin assistants gain useful experience that can lead to more serious hr roles in the future  this would be useful in case my personal projects don't translate to sufficient  reliable income  i resent accounting and will need some kind of way out eventually  either way   any thoughts from former or current admin assistants office secretaries  i'm not seriously considering this route yet  but would appreciate some firsthand insight to determine whether its even viable ,cgvn8b

71,"In a society where all adventure has been destroyed, the only adventure left is to destroy that society",i think this is the aspect about adulthood under capitalism that i cannot even fathom  maybe because our lives have lost meaning  that intense fire burning we call passion    there's no place for exploration  for inner or outer discovery  there's no idea of embarking in a journey  no way that almost all of us can follow our passions  or no people to share any such experience with  there's no one coming up to you and asking you to follow them to the end of the world  unless there's some shitty hotel there  there's no respect for the human that doesn't comply with a broken system  there's no space for those of us that want their lives to be so much more than mere repetition  anxiety  fear  we aren't really free at all ,chbk9c
72,"Does anyone else feel like work is just ""every man for themselves""?",first time poster  i hope i am abiding by the appropriate rules for this sub  i wanted to share a story that happened a few years back when i was working at a restaurant      when i was 20  i worked as a hostess at a restaurant  during this time  my boyfriend passed away and it was very traumatizing  everyone in the restaurant knew about it  but still  i was never ever the type to call out and hated being perceived as lazy or unreliable  i now realize this mindset was pointless       during one of my shifts  i was beginning to emotionally crumble  i was working a double  dealing with inconsiderate customers  and was so close to just quitting on the spot  this was only a few days after my boyfriend passed away so i was incredibly emotional and obviously grieving  i contacted all of my other coworkers to see if they could cover my remaining shift and i explained my situation  none of them even responded  it's one thing if you don't want to cover my shift  after all  it's my responsibility  not yours  and to let me know  but to not even respond after i explain why  keep in mind  these are people i would occasionally spend time with outside of work and felt like i was at least kind of close to       i ended up having an emotional breakdown during my shift and walked out on the spot sobbing  i am not proud of my actions  but i could no longer keep up the  act  and knowing none of my coworkers gave a shit just sent me spiraling  especially because i covered for them a lot  even when they called out just to go to the beach       i told many people about this incident and none of them had kind things to say  some even blamed me for expecting my coworkers to care and cover my shift as its  not their responsibility  on one hand  i know they are right  but i still think it's sad  especially given the whole  family mentality  that companies try to spew onto their employees  it really made me realize that coworkers and management do not care about you at all and only pretend to be nice when it benefits them  at the end of the day  it's every man for themselves  does anyone else feel naive  for thinking it should only be right for your coworkers and management to care about you  it seems as if a lot of people consider this treatment  normal  and don't give it a second thought ,cha2jd

76,I've come to understand something about American capitalism by using social media.,when an american goes to work  he's working next to people who are there to survive  not to live independently in their own place  or save for something  or give their child a good future  but to just survive  and make sure their hand to mouth existence continues    i never used to understand this  in the rest of the g7  we joke around  we have our good days and bad days  but fundamentally  if you're fed up you can quit  go on welfare  and move into mom's basement or a friend's couch  all without having to worry about your healthcare or making student loan payments that your government gave you instead of just subsidizing your tuition directly with tax money    i've come to understand how and why so many american redditors hate work  it's not a game down there  it's real  they're playing for keeps in a game of 19th century capitalism  and the penalty for losing the game isn't a temporarily empty bank account  but destitution  loss of healthcare  and eventually  imprisonment ,ci882q
77,No motivation,recently i saw a post that reflected how even the most basic activities like taking a bath  cooking  etc  just change 180  when you are time-deprived by wage slavery  something that should be natural  like cooking a good meal  shaving  exercising becomes a time drain on your  in my case  two hours of actual free time  this makes any activity really hard to pull off  because it seems like the countdown to the next day or until monday gets shorter   the worst part is that these are things i really want to do  or that i need  like a good shave and haircut  but when friday arrives i just eat something and lie in my bed  incapable of any action  and saturday morning is spent sleeping  so then  at 2pm  when everything is closed  it's already midday  and things get harder  i could go for say a haircut on monday  but then my free time would feel even shorter  do you see the problem  it's ridiculous  maybe i'm just a neglectful person  lazy  lethargic  but all of this  countdown  thing never happened to me before work  maybe during school projects  but even so it was different  it was a responsibility and something i wanted to do   i have no motivation to engage in things because it seems to be a competition between relaxation  mental health and time in my head  my mind thinks about movement and going outside or doing chores as  losing time  that could be spent lying in bed  or watching movies all day  alienated from the world  the harsh world   sometimes i hate myself for this  i think i'm just a pathetic person that can't deal with anything while others can do a lot of things even when tired or stressed  or that i'm disfunctional in this modern world  and it really scares me  i'm not disciplined outside work  i'm surprised on how i can manage to wake up at 6 30am each day  but then on weekends i can't get myself to go for a walk in the mornings or cook healthy foods  i'm lucky to have a job and to live on my own  renting a room  when all my mind does is try to screw me up  i'm very anxious  i have a lot of nervous ticks  i have some episodes of depression here and there  why can't i function properly when i need it the most  don't get me started on creative activities  which are non-existent  buried in the sands of 40 hours workweeks and mental stress  it's like i'm a corpse  just existing and enjoying little things not to totally collapse  trying to remain positive and controlling my addictions  this is a live of constant struggle  nothing flows naturally  all my capabilities hidden  incapable of flourishing into the real world ,cifb76

82,Solutions in Late-stage Capitalism,someone in this sub used the phrase 'late-stage capitalism' and  while i've seen this term being used elsewhere  i think it's perfect  you don't even need a definition to understand what this means  just look around you   late-stage capitalism  without even looking up the term  describes to me the situation that we find ourselves in  rampant wealth inequality  sky-high asset prices and rents  flat or falling real wages  the financialization of business and creativity  e g  zero or below-zero interest rates in many regions  venture capitalists  private equity  passive exchange-traded fund-fueled asset bubbles  some of the lowest percentages of corporate profits going to workers since the early 20th century  longer work hours  more bullshit jobs  and on the more depressing end  opioid addictions  substance abusers  suicides  etc   i've contemplated suicide myself  even with a comfortable bs job of my own  i can afford to rent a room out with other people  and i have my basic essentials covered  however  i can't justify having a car on my income  i've never had a girlfriend  not enough money  declining ambition and disinterest in life  i used to love taking care of myself bodybuilding  now i have to force myself to eat right and exercise  and generally feeling trapped   this is no way to live  my happiest days are when i'm able to take time off from work  what do i do  i read interesting books  i write  i might take an online course  i love to research and learn things and develop new skills  i workout  i go for walks in nature  i eat healthy food  and i don't miss sitting under artificial lighting for all daylight hours  in a humid office  listening to the jarring sound of my boomer colleague smashing his keyboard like a typewriter for eight hours straight  sorry  while listening to my boss explain how intelligent he is   i fucking hate being alive at this point  even though i live very comfortably  i would still rather die than live like this for the next 20-40-60 years   the only solution i see then  among some other lower-probability options  is this  and please  while this might sound difficult  there must be  some  solution  or i'll lose all hope  i'm thinking  what if i muster the energy to learn a high-tech skill of some sort  classic entrepreneurship is not as richly rewarded in late-stage capitalism  the only ways i see of freeing oneself is  participate in corporatism private equity  gearing up existing assets or businesses  or learning a tech skill  coding  and generating a high income on a consulting basis   the latter seems most accessible to people like us  and with that high income  you can then live frugally while allocating almost all your earnings to dividend-yielding assets like real estate investment trusts  sure  you might need a couple of million  but if you work flat out on a high income and live frugally  it could be possible to achieve in a few years if it became your life's mission and purpose  afterwards  you could effectively say goodbye to any bs work   i'm hypothesizing here  i need a damn solution or i'll become another suicide case  right now though i have too much energy to kill myself ,cihlsk

88,i wanted to be an entrepreneur....,i got fired from the job i've been at for 5 years   i kind of took it for granted and was no selling and focused on my other hobbies much more  which cost a lot of money but didn't make me any money   when i got fired  i was convinced that i can just take my clients from that company to my own business   all of my clients love me after all   the thing is  finding a place to operate out of is extremely costly around here and i am flat out broke and trying to afford rent at the moment which makes me kind of regret not saving and spending money on my hobbies   not only that  but the company i was previously working for has a great location and of course much more money and my clients were just used to going there      i guess familiarity of the location  gt  familiarity of me  because none of them wanted to join up with me   i made a website  logo  and everything   i'm currently unemployed and thought i could grind it out and get on my entrepreneur shit  but at this rate i'm not gonna be able to afford my bedroom in the house i'm sharing with 4 other people   i did make lots of bad decisions in my lifetime  so i take complete fault    amp x200b   it isn't looking up and i've been a combination of motivated then days of incapacitating depression and laziness   it makes me question whether i'll even be able to run my own business if i'm already giving up   i am already looking for a job in the same field and this place wants me to work full time which will lead to me not being able to focus on my own business  not to mention the conflict of interest  but i fuckn need the money now for rent so i feel like i don't have a choice and should go for the security  it's a sales job   i fear i'll be working at this place forever from complacency or until i get fired like the last job and my side business will never grow        tldr  lost job  started my own business  am failing and struggling  looking for another job which will conflict with the growth of my business and i fear i'll be stuck in this same cycle forever with barely more than minimum wage and no benefits ,chky2f
89,Don't be afraid to speak your mind on here. How can you be for the abolition of work while also be for the micromanagement of what people say?,hello everyone on the antiwork subreddit  i know there are lots of leftists on here which is not my personal belief but that's okay  but please do not be afraid to actually speak your mind  i am so sick and tired of people changing how they talk or being scared of going against the grain     i was banned for a month  i forget for what  i think i called someone a leftist yuppie or something  but now im off of the ban but still not afraid to speak my mind  anti work thought can not be controlled  the moderators here are leftists and are not in favor of the true abolition of work  to abolish work  the state will also be abolished  they don't understand why they both go together  democracy is a form of government by the way    just like they banned me  if they had any real power in life  they probably don't  they would be the same people who would do write ups at work  manage the schedules  and manage the government extortion enforcement bureaus    i want discussion  but what i really want is people to be free and speak their mind  i was once a leftist and dealing with being politically correct is tiring and annoying    here goes hoping i don't get banned by the political police again    freedom forever ,chjis4

92,My employer is being acquired by a massive corporation. It's highly likely that I'm going to be let go once the deal is done. I have no idea what to do.,i'm new here  i'm gonna ramble a lil bit about what i'm going through - sorry if this isn't typical antiwork fare but i like the cut of y'alls jib   i've been working in the enterprise it field for the past 10 years  the last 3  years with a startup  as far as employers go  i have to admit this startup is pretty good  my director is very much a  life first  type of person and doesn't give folks a hard time for taking time off when they need it  late nights weekend work is usually made up for with time off  it's encouraged that folks seek out training opportunities and are given time for them  stuff like that  working for this startup has also presented me with travel opportunities and other perks that i ordinarily wouldn't have in my role  that said  if i've learned one thing in the past 10 years working in this field  it's that i am deeply unhappy and will not last doing this until retirement age  these feelings were exacerbated a couple of weeks ago when we arrived to work one morning to learn that the board had agreed to be acquired by one of the largest corporations in the industry  whom i have zero interest in working for  and of course now my work feels completely pointless because once the acquisition is done all the existing it systems are just going to be ripped out and replaced  which isn't very good for my day-to-day morale   these corporate acquisitions take a while to complete so i know things aren't going to change too drastically around here for at least a year  execs are saying the typical  we're going to try to find a place for everyone moving forward  bullshit  and that may be true for the engineers who design the products but it is a support group and it's very likely that most of our team will be let go  hr has already outlined how any current or future equity will be dealt with but that's all we have in writing so far  basically  on the date the acquisition is finalized  vested shares will be paid out for the agreed buyout price  and unvested shares will be paid out according to the employee's existing vesting schedule  meaning periodic payouts for the next x number of years  as for what kind of severance package  if any  could be expected beyond that  it's still entirely up in the air   i'm trying to look at this optimistically but there are so many variables  the way i see it  the best case scenario is that the severance package is good enough so i can use that   my equity to go back to school because i really need to change careers  i'm fortunate enough to have kept my debts under control and i'm still in my early 30s  not married no kids leaning on me  so this seems like it could be a real opportunity to find a new direction  at the same time  i really don't know what i would even study if i were to go back to school  since this announcement i just feel like i'm living on borrowed time  i'm resolved to save as much money as i can while it's still coming in  but everything after that is a giant question mark  i've never felt more expendable or uncertain about my future  has anyone else gone through this sort of thing or attempted a career change after working in one field for a decade  am i a spoiled d-bag who should check his privilege  any thoughts or advice would be very appreciated ,chraco

94,"Student loans payment just started today, my license got suspended, and they wonder why people are miserable",just paid  800 today  and will continue to do so each month  for many years  there's some things i can do to get my payment down to  400  then  it'll just take even longer  and i'll pay the government more interest so they can fund their wars and fund the rich fucks  and what gets me is that i got off 'easy' with the amount of student debt i have  i have less than many other people   as a bonus  i just found out my license was suspended  i had no idea for eight months  i never got mail  phone call  nothing  and yes  my info is updated  so now  i get to go through 8 layers of hell to fix it because it's a complicated situation due to involving two states  oh  and i also get to pay them lots of money for never telling me  so yay   the kicker is  i'm supposed to move back to my home state in two weeks  so if i can't get it handled through mail  then i get to pay thousands more for them to haul my car to my home state    and all this moving is for a new job  and thank god i will be making a livable wage and eventually able to pay all these things  but at my old current job  i would have been entirely fucked  i thank my lucky stars for this new job  and that's how they get you to be grateful of your new job and worship it  at my old job  my life would have taken an ugly turn  and it makes me think of all the people that didn't get that lucky job and ended up in similar situations  this life is just unnecessarily stressful  stupid  and at the end of the day  quite boring ,choipz
95,"I don't know what to put as a title, sorry.",hello  i'm new to this sub  been reading a lot about other people's hard times about working and receiving advice so i think i should do the same  just to seek some comfort from the stress i've been through recently  this is my first post being here   so if certain parts of my post are deemed immature  inconsiderate   offensive or just simply not suitable for this sub  please let me know and i will correct myself   i wanna ask you guys something  any of you who has experience of overthinking a lot  especially during work    i don't know whats gotten into me  but i keep having worries about things that i'm doing  worries like how will other coworkers look at me when i made a mistake  or how will the boss scold me for no doing things the way he does  no matter how much i try  i just can't shake away this fear of constant worry of judgement from others  now matter how confident i am in doing it  that had led me to quitting my second and last job  combine the fact that both of those jobs had me deal with shitty coworkers and bosses  it's just making me slowly losing my sanity   now i am currently unemployed  but my parents had been forcing me to go find a job  simply because i haven't finish my work study college  currently studying culinary arts  and those typical  this is how life works  you work or you die  reasons    it hurts to see all my interests are either useless or not profitable that i have to ditch them just to stay in this society  i wanted to write and animate  but years of studying other subjects and working had rendered my vocabulary and creativity deteriorating  i wanted find jobs related to the things i like such as light novel writer  or animator in the video game industry  but realized that they are all not that profitable  or just generally doesn't exist in my country  last time i know   japan publishers doesn't really accept light novel submissions from foreigners  let alone fan fictions from existing creations due to copyright  even if they do  considering my luck  i would rather use my scripts to set up a campfire to keep me warm if i ever get homeless    i regret for being smart when i was young  so smart that i actually though that i could be a good person with a bright future like all those adults told me  only to be trampled onto the ground by reality  i don't know what to do  spending every night thinking about what will i become if i continue this way  being myself instead of being a work slave like other people  i don't know where to seek advice until i stumble upon this sub  and now i'm typing this  so that i can at least make myself feel better from all these negative thoughts because i know that there are other people at the other side of the world like me  struggling   sorry about the long post  but thank you if you reached this far  to think that i am still be able to write a long paragraph like this after giving up on writing for so long really brings back the memories of young me dreaming about writing a novel and submitting it to be published  if only i can go back to that time when things are simpler  so i don't have to worry about everything from the present to the future ,ci1556
96,Medical field stories,i haven t personally worked in  but have heard the most horrific stories from the american  healthcare  field  doctors and nurses being forced to work 12-36 hour shifts on their feet  no breaks  have to go hundreds of thousands in debt and then work a multi year unpaid residency under abusive senior doctors or surgeons  then  when in practice  you basically have to pander to the pharmaceutical industry and over-prescribe and over-order testing because you get 15 mins with each patient    i ve heard countless terrible stories about gossip  workplace bullying and mobbing as well  it seems to be an industry that  particularly  caters to being an abusive workaholic sociopath  and has multiple types of hazing rituals for new professionals such as extreme work hours  near-slave labor during education  and more extreme workplace bullying  it seems worse than just the typical work culture issues we have here    and it seems even more scary that people s lives are literally in the hands of these workers  people s health is on the line  often urgently  concurrently as these workers are using work time to bully each other    has anyone else noticed this  i ve completely ruled out working in any kind of healthcare field because of how bad the stories i ve heard are  and it is just counter intuitive that society would allow such unhealthy conditions for our doctors  nurses and hospital workers ,ci1i6p
97,Vacations Don’t Fix the Problem,at my last job i met many people who worked the entire year for a 1-2 week vacation  they explained that it made it worth it and when they came back they felt refreshed and could continue on with the remainder of the year s work  i ve seen this type of thinking in a lot of jobs and it is so problematic    first  a vacation doesn t fix the system that is perpetually exploiting you and demanding more and more    second  this type of mentally is dangerous  for some it pacifies them  and they continue on for he one break they get a year    also  most people are checking e-mails and getting calls from their bosses while on vacation  i ve even seen some people who were just staying home get called in to work because the bosses knew they were still in town    i remember telling one coworker  who had been at the company for six years and had recently gotten her own office so she was extra pro company  about my dream of teaching english in thailand  and she said  why  you could just take a vacation there and still work here    and another reason it doesn t work is because most americans don t take their full vacations  i was withholding taking it cause i wanted to get the monetary equivalent when i left  and some bosses guilt their employees about leaving and it s never a good time    don t be pacified by 10 days off  can someone do the math and tell me what the percentage is for days off and worked  it can t even be more than 5 ,ch8fm7

107,I have a great opportunity and want to throw it the hell away.,bloody hell this got long quick  i spent a while writing it  i don't know if this is where it belongs  but it seemed the right place at the time  tldr  i have an interview coming up for a  good job  and i fucking hate myself for considering showing up for it  mostly because of the fact that the interview process reveals a lot about how the company doesn't genuinely value the time or talents of their applicants   i dropped out of graduate school recently  with six figures in debt  there just aren't any jobs that require a phd in my field that i would ever last in  my  work ethic   a phrase i've always found off-putting  fluctuates too much over the course of a year for me to credibly promise 30  years of loyal service without reverting back to the pathological lying i engaged in as a small child as as a desperate  failing  attempt to gain peer respect in a world i found  and still find  incomprehensible   i've applied to exactly one job so far  as i currently live in a city that doesn't have the size to maintain a huge corporate economy with jobs whose hr managers wouldn't be former business students who barely passed courses i once taught for a stipend roughly 70  below the median salary for someone my age  and who by that fact alone know that i don't have many talents that are really necessary in said jobs  i clicked  submit   how apropos  over a month ago  i aced the phone screening over two weeks ago and have an interview coming up this friday  i'm certain that i gained this interview thanks to the extraordinarily ambitious cover letter i included with my resume  my energetic go-getter demeanor during the phone screening  and the friendly  reminder  i sent the monday following the phone screen  featuring a reiteration of what i think i can contribute to the company   the in-person interview is a typical panel interview for an analyst position in middle management for a techy company with a few hundred employees  the first half will feature a presentation i'd put together over the next couple days  in which i'd outline my responses to a few questions they gave me regarding a data set of their customers and the services they've contracted from the company  the second half will feature  behavioral questions   describe a specific  actual situation at your past job where  lt lt challenging scenario gt gt  occurred  describe in detail how you responded to it  and describe what you learned   despite my graduate training in an academic field that is naturally cynical about agents' motivations  i totally overlooked the fact that i basically agreed to complete a spec assignment for the right to have them consider hiring me for pay  this is  in and of itself  not remarkable  as anybody who can read nonfiction and chooses to exercise that ability knows that the  unpaid internship   working for free for months  is becoming so normalized that it's no longer unheard of to hear of people paying for said unpaid internships  i've gone from feeling somewhat hopeful that i won't be homeless a month from now to feeling angry and bitter that i've agreed to a glorified american idol audition in which i'll be desperately attempting to impress strangers for really nothing more than a chance to not be homeless  i actually think i'd get the job if i put the requisite effort into it  i'm just sick of working for free just for a chance to not be garbage   i discovered this sub after seeing it linked in a post elsewhere  it's where i've belonged since my first day of working for free at the age of 6  don't give me any shit about how school isn't  working for free  but rather an  investment in one's self  -- i did just fine learning new skills before attending school  and beginning school was far more akin to driving a ferrari into a tar pit than the  journey of self-improvement  school is aggressively advertised as  looking back  even when i aspired to be rich  it was only insofar as i'd never have to do the song and dance again  and had nothing to do with a chance to own cool toys or live in a ridiculously large house or cover myself in finely woven  meticulously cut cloth   while the company i'll be interviewing at does something of value  at least if their backend infrastructure is as well-designed and maintained as their shiny client interfaces  which i'm sure it isn't  i can't help but feel like i'm  selling out  what's worse is that i can't complain about it to anyone i actually know  family and former classmates are either apathetic or downright antipathetic toward the disposable poor  and my low-income friends resent me for not being grateful for the opportunity  would i be good at it  yeah  i bet i'd be better at it than the hundred other applicants this company must have lined up to be taking so long and raising so many barriers  i'm just better trained than almost anybody else who would consider applying for it  and the phone screener implied as much with some of the questions  i asked for enough money to live well in this town  even after loan payments  so i'd be throwing away a lot of potential security if i canceled   yet my top  ambition   if you can call it that  in life has nothing to do with spending 9 hours a day in a building across town  analyzing the rate of return on sales agent expenditures  i'd much rather get on a bus down to mexico and get to a low-cost town where i could live cheaply enough not to worry about money  write niche rants like this  and in the meantime teach those who i rely on a few things about computer programming and applied statistics  or maybe teach their kids  i believe that the beauty of computers is that  employed in the right way  they could make work as we know it obsolete  or at least something that takes up little enough time that few resent it as i do now  instead they've somehow made opportunity even more scarce for those who can't keep up with them and increased the workload for those who can  it's perverse  and people like you called it years ago   i spent many a year of my adult life as a  libertarian  i still think i am one  but it doesn't mean to me what it did once  and certainly doesn't mean to me anymore what it means to other self-styled  libertarians  if there's anything november 2016 taught me  it's that a libertarian is more often than not somebody who wants the government to leave him alone but still wants the option to call the cops when someone inconveniences him  it's someone who spews bullshit about the  non-aggression principle  but will vote for the first pussy-grabbing sociopath who promises him a tax break that amounts to his cable bill  it's someone who talks trash about government public works projects and a bloated military-industrial complex  but still wants a 1000  mile scar to be built across the sonoran and chihuahuan deserts to protect us from people who probably wouldn't want to come here if the past century of foreign political intervention and domestic drug policy hadn't made a bad situation worse where they came from   i hate working  even for wealth  unless i can see the benefits accrue to those whose quality of life meaningfully depends on it  i hate myself for even considering another three days of working for free  even if it's for a chance to not be tossed in the garbage with 6 billion other people who would probably take my opportunity if they could  i hate myself for vocally supporting the amoral value system that makes irresponsible opportunism the only option for so many  i kinda hate my cat for being the one reason i don't want to be homeless  even if he's got kidney failure and will probably die if i'm gone for 10 hours a day since he'll only drink water when i'm home  i want to fucking die  and r depression is only going to put up with my shit for so much longer   i secretly hope that someone in hr or on the panel sees this and sends me an email saying i shouldn't bother showing up on friday  i want to send an email saying i won't  i've already written and proofread it  it's in my drafts folder   welp  that was quite a rambling rant  i've either found kindred spirits who will identify with it  or found a place where these thoughts will be downvoted into oblivion  but i had to post it somewhere or i'd never get any sleep  i probably won't anyway  but perhaps i'll get a few new friends out of it  good night  and good luck  i'm exhausted ,ck5gcn
108,My experience taking on the powers that be...Organizing my workplace,sorry if this is to long  tldr at bottom    i found this sub and have been lurking for a while now  so i wanted to share my story dealing with corporate power and the struggle to successfully organize a union in these tough times  i really feel the employers have everything going for them these days with technology and tracking software  as the pinned post here mentions     amp x200b    organizing my workplace       hi guys i want to share my story with you about the time i organized my hotel job  holiday inn express franchise  with a national business union  ufcw local  i was successful in getting the union certified however eventually due to heavy turnover  myself included  and a sale of the business to another owner  and brown nosing   the union was eventually decertified before ever signing a collective bargaining agreement   i live in ontario canada  it's been  just a little over 3 years since this took place  i was the night auditor for this hotel for 8 months when i began to organize my coworkers  it was a small shop  i organized my coworkers in housekeeping with the my front desk coworkers  there was about 29 people in the bargaining unit  the employer was heavily resistant to unionization and broke several laws  however they got off scot free as the labour laws in canada heavily favour capital and have very little teeth  ufcw also in my opinion kind of shit the bed  however i also was very naive and made plenty of mistakes myself and learned a lot from this experience which i will attempt to articulate in the following       the reason i began to organize my coworkers was due to heavy turnover  including coworkers being fired  the general manager also the owner of the franchise  began to give me trainees and giving me as little as 2 nights to train them on the job before leaving them alone for their own shift  it was ridiculous  and these people quit as they were ill prepared to be working alone and responsible for the hotel after 2 days on the job  this meant i was stuck working 6 nights a week   i began to resent my boss and sent him a fairly militant email  complaining to him how things were being run  he responded by offering me a supervisor position and a 50 cent raise  50 cents  i guess he thought i would just be excited at the prospect of supervisor i would be okay with 50 cents more for a huge responsibility and the privilege of working even closer with my boss that i hated  yet i did agree to become supervisor  and this is what put me in a great position to begin to organize my coworkers       however the plan to organize was still  just an impulsive decision on my part  i was feeling very suspicious of my bosses plan for me  and one morning when i got off work very frustrated i emailed the organizing department of ufcw and asked them for advice   a organizer got in touch with me shorty after and off we were  i had no idea what i was signing up for  i really thought that the union organizer would do the majority of the work  that was false  i 100  became the main organizer with little idea of what to do  i was just firing from the hip at this point forward  i should also mention now i have a alcohol problem and still do  so i was drunk a lot of the time  i'm not use at all to putting myself in the spotlight like i did here  and my social anxiety made for a ton of sleepless nights     i started small  brought two coworkers to the first meeting with the organizer and from there it snowballed  we had a majority of the cards signed within 2 weeks  i believe we went into the vote with 19 29 authorization cards signed  one of my favourite memories  being introduced by my manager in the break room as the new front office supervisor to my coworkers who i had just signed up for the union  it was awkward and fucking awesome at the same time  and by far the peak of the experience for me  a poor man like myself pulling the wool over the bosses eyes  i loved it  i forget exactly how many i got signed but it was almost all of them  my coworkers struggled to get people signed up so i took over and as a more senior employee who was being promoted to supervisor it was fairly easy for me to get people signed       i remember only two people that i asked  i didn't ask the obviously pro management employees  refusing to sign a union card for me  one of them snitched on me for sure fairly early on  ironically she was a very weak employee and likely would've been fired had not been for the union drive  once the employer found out about the union drive they quickly fired one of my coworkers and union supporter with made up bullshit reason  as a chilling effect  luckily it was too late by this point and we already had enough support for the vote  the union made an agreement with the employer to reinstate her before the vote  this is also where i made one of my first mistakes and i challenged the owner and management and became militant with them after this firing   this is while i was being  trained  by them for the supervisor position  so this screwed me up as they realized from there on i was pro union 100  and not one of them  pretty sure they knew this already anyways but this gave them the excuse to treat me badly  they gave me the silent treatment from this point forward  i suppose i became to arrogant and proud  and thought i had much more power than i did  i didn't really think about the fact that even once we won the vote we would have long drawn out negotiations and i would still have to work there  i was just so focused on winning the vote and thought the union would take it over from there  i was wrong     the day before the vote the organizer and i were guessing what we thought the vote would be and we thought it would be a lot closer than it turned out to be  the vote came and the union won it 20 yes to 3 nays  it was a great outcome and i was ecstatic  however it would all come crashing down fairly quickly after this  firstly the union was awesome during the union drive  my organizer replied to my questions fast and i felt i had a ton of support behind me in the ufcw  this quickly changed after we won and i felt ufcw left me to fend for myself against a very hostile employer  secondly the employer stopped giving a fuck and became extremely bitter  again partly my fault as i did antagonize the shit out of them once i realized i had the union  i would call in sick and force the owner to work overnights for instance as no one else would cover nights        was maybe three days after we won certification the first supporter quit after talking to management and being discouraged  than they began to fuck with more supporters hours and schedule  and they to quit  blaming the fact their  hands are tied by the union  or just straight up not giving a shit  i didn't know it at the time but they were going to sell the hotel anyways  i quickly realized their plan was to be huge ass holes to everyone except their allies and  force turnover and frustration among the bargaining unit  it worked and people were dropping like flies  the union seemed to care less and barely replied to my concerns if at all  i became suspicious of the union around this time and no longer felt their support like i did in the union drive  i'm a pretty sensitive person and it really hurt me and caused me great distress to see the people who supported me becoming stressed and quitting  i didn't help in this regard as i myself was very stressed and probably caused them to become even more stressed  in short i was overwhelmed and drinking to heavily  and just not being a very good leader     the nail in the coffin for me was when a coworker whom i never met before came back from maternity leave and was clearly out to get me  she of course supported the union while on maternity leave but than sought to capitalize once she returned  i don't know if she was trained by the employer to be the perfect brown nose worker or if they just lucked out in having her in their wings  she made my life very difficult and was getting the supervisor position that was originally offered to me  the first day i met her was at our very first union meeting with our new union rep  she was conveniently recalled back from maternity leave 3 weeks early and showed up and sat with management  technically supervisors  as the employer included them in the bargaining unit and the union allowed it to my dismay   at the union meeting she was clearly very hostile towards me  the union rep noticed this as well but just brushed me off  i was not a big fan of our union rep and the original organizer i felt abandoned by  once the new coworker came back she began to belittle me and suck up to management causing me great distress  they treated her awesome and would leave emails for me to read all about how much they were getting along  all this while i was losing my own support and drinking heavily  i still feel immense shame to this day for letting them push me out and win  my mental health was rapidly deteriorating and i was becoming very paranoid believing i was hacked and being watched  which i probably was but most people thought i was just being crazy   this furthered managements agenda and made me look weak and deluded  i began to look for a way out       this is when the ufcw did do some great work for me and made an agreement with the employer to allow me to quit and collect ei employment insurance  i would also receive a reference letter from them  so i did quit  it was before any bargaining ever took place  i still feel great regret to this day as i wanted to help bargain for a good contract and knew when i left that the union was pretty much done without me  no other supporters were really stepping up to take the mantel from me  as they were all to timid and scared  i probably didn't  help by being the poster child to how you get treated by management if you support the union  i was the 10th person to quit and this was 3 months after union was certified  9 of these workers signed union cards       my brown nose  coworker who came back from maternity leave would go on to become the supervisor and eventually would be the one who decertified the union a little over a year after it was certified  the original owner sold the hotel 5 months after i left which i am sure was apart of their long term plan to ensure the union would be busted  the union did have success winning the first decertification application put forward by the employer  the labour board weakly ruled the employer violated the labour relations act but basically faced no consequence for this  i will link the ruling to this in case anyone is interested in reading it  this is the ruling the union  won  however shortly after this ruling they were decertified anyways  all the events in the ruling regard just what the new owners did and didn't include any of the events that i faced from the original owner  so i had no part in it as i quit by that point  this is very long i  apologize  i feel like i'm even missing more information but i could go on and on and  on  i'm not the best storyteller             here's the link  long read    https www canlii org en on onlrb doc 2018 2018canlii11112

139,A rant about work and my guilt and life and stuff,this summer  i have been working a decent amount  it is not as much as some people  of course  but it is more than i ve consistently done in the past  personally i have found this to be more and more difficult as time went on  in the beginning  i was working  40 hours a week  sometimes over  but this was eventually reduced to 30 for a bit  as of writing this  though  i have put my two weeks in  and am working 40 hours for these last two once again  once again  many people have worked much more for much longer  and i commend them for being able to do so  i  however  have struggled in this position  and have also struggled to elaborate why  to justify my  need  to work less even though others work so much more than this  in writing this i hope to both figure out for myself what the issue is  potentially giving me the ability then to explain it to others    the work itself is not bad  sometimes  even  when i m in the zone and listening to some good music  the time passes by fairly quickly  the ambivalence or enjoyment of these times  however does not subtract from the time itself or the energy it takes from me  compared to last summer  things have felt different  back then  my life outside work felt less affected and still existed as the  focus  of my life at the time  i would see friends  play games  do housework  and  centrally to my recent introspection  work on music  in a way  working on music in this time felt like my  real  job  the wage work was just an outside activity through which i could earn some money to prepare for the school year ahead  i spent long hours composing  recording  and producing  the goal of this  work  being the creation of albums and the honing of my craft and passion overall  it went along very well  though i was tired sometimes i was able to push through and create many things that i am proud of to this day  so why  then  am i so much more tired today    first  let me explain how things are different  these days i seem to have lost the motivation to work on music  it may not even be motivation  as i have spent a lot of time on my computer  on my gameboy  and at the piano trying my best to compose and develop ideas  this time spent  however  has generally born little fruit  i end up frustrated with myself and even more tired than before  eventually giving up for the day because i know trying harder would only tire me out more  this frustration has bled into other things  and  though i try to keep a positive attitude about it all  it proves difficult    i have talked with my family and friends about this  and have not found any decisive conclusions for the sources of these feelings and issues  but i will try my best to explain my  working theories  i recently looked back at my scheduled hours from last summer and found that i worked an average of 23 hours per week  adding a new variable to the mix  this leads me to believe that the extra time this summer is part of what has weighed on me  every day i feel the tiredness  and i know that it comes from all the time spent at work  it is not even strenuous activity  but still has this sort of effect on me  and this is what i cannot pinpoint the exact reason for  as i said before  sometimes i can find myself enjoying what i do at work  i do not think the work itself is much of the issue  though i have complained about it a lot in some sort of attempt to feel better  which hasn t worked very well  instead  i think it is the sheer time  i do not believe i am cut out for working 40 hours a week  some people may say i m not trying hard enough or that i am entitled  i don t believe that  as i would be fine with and earning less  money is not the issue  i only know that  when i have worked this much  i have struggled  i am weaker than those who tell me  everyone does it  i am weaker than those around me  i see these things  but i do not know if i care  i am weak   there is a general societal expectation that people will work like this for their whole lives  i don t want to do this  to deal with that  it drains me and prevents me from doing the things i love  i don t know if this is the case for others  but it is taking up so much of my life  though both the time itself and then the energy removed from the time outside  i know that i must work  but if it must be like this i would rather not  i don t know what to say beyond that  if it is  selfish  or  entitled  of me to want to be happy doing the thing i love  then sue me  call me those things  i don t care  because i know inside that that is not what it is  i am willing to work  but i need something outside to live for and to cope with it all  music has always been my refuge  and in taking away my ability to go that place  these  standard  work weeks are something i do not want to live with in the future  for the sake of my mental and spiritual health  this has been a rant that sort of moved away from its goal  but hopefully it can help others to understand what i m feeling  i know it helped me understand it a bit better  so that is what matters ,cehkd6

182,Working as an intern at a corporation this summer. Kinda bullshit that people willingly work for these fuckers,as if that wasn't obvious enough  it's very sad that an internet forum is the only place where i can share this information because the people in the bible belt suck ass   just got out of an 90 minute seminar filled with boomer humor  elitism  and attempts at making sure the bottom line isn't being explicitly discussed  this was done by giving a disingenuous explanation about how you need to make sure you care about the customer and form a genuine connection  because you are being completely sincere  made me question my existence thinking about how people go to work at this company  day in and day out  just to ensure that their boss grows exponentially more rich  i couldn't help thinking about how we didn't start this way as a species  but now we work bullshit jobs until we die because everything costs money  worst part of it all  in the bathroom afterwards  i heard some guys talking about how glad they are it's almost the weekend and how much they could use a break  think about that  these people go through the same motions for 50  years while admitting they hate what they're doing  once the weekend ends  without fail  they're back to hating their life 8-5  monday-friday   i honestly would not care nearly as much if i was working a job that was meaningful and contributing to the greater good of society  selling people overpriced shit is not that   now i am not sure where i am going to work after i graduate college because the thought of enduring a corporate lifestyle makes me lose the will to live  but i can't live off minimum wage so i'll probably think about moving to an actual first-world country that allows its citizens to get healthcare and housing without going broke   bold claim  but people who say working is their purpose in life are in denial  i really believe the only reason anyone would believe that is because they have done their job for so long that they cannot conceive of a reality where that sort of lifestyle doesn't exist  go ask a kid if they want to do something they hate for the rest of their life    tl dr fuck corporations  fuck complacency and fuck the people who allow this bullshit to continue,cf24ff

216,Most employers discriminate on disability despite claiming not to,the main reason i m antiwork is because of the way that employers  especially office jobs  purposely make working there incompatible with actual disability even ones supposedly protected by ada  it would be actually pretty easy to accommodate those of us with serious  trauma and chronic illness but they just won t  i have had ptsd and an autoimmune condition for all of my working life  it used to be extreme but now it s just kind of vaguely and chronically debilitating without accommodation in the workplace   dealing with ptsd has been years of slow healing and i m still working on it  i don t need advice as it s not an overnight process and i m already doing what helps  the main thing is i can t sleep right  and my body becomes physically ill under too much ongoing stress which causes autoimmune and cfs symptoms     i simply cannot work a job without  significant  disability accommodation  for me this is later start time  flex hours  minimizing interruption  listen to music at work  work from home option  days off spaced apart instead of two in a row  and an abuse free and emotionally healthy work environment    i filed a disability accommodation at my last job for an as-needed late start with flex or at home makeup hours due to ptsd related insomnia  and my last job freaking denied it because  our hours of operation are 9-5 30  they said if i missed any time i had to use pto to cover the gap  of course i ran out of the years  pto in 4 months  and then i needed more time off due to accumulated debilitation  i had a crying breakdown at work where i told my bosses i needed either to quit or take a medical leave and they told me they were accepting my verbal resignation  my medical leave was denied  i wasn t fmla eligible    most of my work was non urgent reconciliation of accounts and files as well as replying to emails from other departments and arranging  enrolling new accounts into the system  and researching queries into databases and files  what is so urgent that it can t be done at 11am rather than 9am  i mostly serviced internal departments  my own coworkers want me to show up on 5 hours of sleep with a bad flareup  my actual work rarely received negative reviews   the sleep debt that accumulates doing first shift 5 day week office work is unbearable for my body  the typical handful of office bullies that are in every office also tend to target me  slowly wear me down and negatively affect me  i just can t be around environments that allow bullies to run rampant after so much past emotional abuse    work environments are also often inherently triggering to people with psychological trauma and it s debilitating  yelling  fake urgency about bullshit  backstabbing  gossip  zero schedule flexibility - unable to nap  visit therapists  or cook during the day  forbidden to turn off work email and work phone to de-stress during a flareup and just clock back in when i m ready to finish my 8 hours  it has to be all 8 hours at once  why   employers do discriminate on disability  especially mental health and chronic illness  they really do  unwoke people will say  just file an accommodation and sue them if they don t uphold the ada  we shouldn t have to threaten them and pay for legal action to sleep in sometimes and take breaks from office work as needed  or to have bullies dealt with  also with what money   i ve never worked anywhere that actually made it possible for me to really stay and thrive  unwoke people also say  just apply for a different job  which job  most offices i ve been in were actively aggravating and unaccomodating to chronic disability  unwoke people also don t recognize the degree to which employers will subtly retaliate on people by finding  business reasons  to try and get you to leave because they see a serious disability with a need to change the entire work culture to accomodate as a legal liability threat  and hr exists to flush people who are legal liability threats even if you have zero intention of suing the company and are just asking for it to be possible to work your job without damaging your health more than it already is    it s actually the entire work culture that is inaccessible for those of us with chronic mental and physical handicaps no matter how stellar our actual work abilities are  in my experience almost every work environment i ve been in protects office bullies and demands that the seat be warm daily 9-5 30pm or else you re never getting ahead  i can t do that  i hate the work culture  anyone else ,cea91c

227,It's depressing how much people want others to suffer.,people absolutely hate having it suggested that things could be better  they've been exploited and overworked for so long and convinced themselves that the pittance they've been given is what they deserve  don't tell them they deserve more though  don't try to improve the situation for them  they tell you you're lazy  you're entitled and you want everything handed to you  no you're not  you're just clever enough to realise your own worth and you're ballsy enough to call out the status quo for it's shit     these people are so bitter at their situation that they lash out at the imagined enemy  the immigrant or the 'lazy millenials'  they've been conditioned to regard wealth and possesions as signs of virtue  they've been sold a lie of hedonistic pleasure  that greed and accumulation of wealth is all that matters in life and they hate seeing the truth because how can you come to terms with all your life being a lie    remember your life has value beyond your job  you do not deserve less for having a low status job  you're not a working machine  you're a human and you deserve to live a secure and fulfilling life no matter what you do ,cdz6cl

231,I got my coworker a raise by arguing with my boss about wages. In front of everyone.,i was talking to a coworker about over time  she said how she liked it because of how much she got paid  then asked her wait  how much do you get paid  i make x amount     amp x200b   to which she looked irritated and said   really  i make  less than me  amount    amp x200b   and i said   man that's some bullshit  store down the corner is hiring for more than i make  how long have you been here    amp x200b   i found out literally twice as long as i have    amp x200b   then i turned to another co worker as boss was walking past   how much do you make    amp x200b   he said same amount as first co worker even though he been there longer than me    amp x200b   and then my boss went on about how we don't talk about stuff like that and how it's not appropriate    amp x200b   i replied how there is a law saying that i absolutely can talk about this in front of everyone    amp x200b   he got really mad and told me to show him the law  so i quick looked it up  it's the national relation labor act  it forbids employers from punishing employees for talking about their salaries  employees are absolutely allowed to talk about their wages anywhere even on the clock during work     amp x200b   so he looked it over and said i was right but why would i want to do that as it would cause negative emotions amongst the workplace  i wasn't very well prepared to defend my stance so he was winning the debate  and i say debate because he was very civil with me and let me speak    amp x200b   basically my defense was that employers should pay fair wages in the first place and be loyal to their employees    amp x200b   his was that if people know others wages then they'll be upset and leave    amp x200b    we  know that employers should just pay their employees for wages if they don't want them to leave    amp x200b   but i couldn't articulate that very well    amp x200b   and then i had to go back to my work so our debate was cut in half  by the way  all my coworkers around us were clearly uncomfortable since people generally don't talk back to their bosses about wages  but part of the law is if i'm punished for it then i can take their asses to court  so i was honestly hoping they would try some shit    amp x200b   i guess what i said to him stuck with him because like an hour later my co worker comes up to me all happy and said   thank you so much for earlier    amp x200b    what about causing a scene    amp x200b    yeah  i just got a raise    amp x200b   ya'll  she now makes as much as me  i'm so fucking happy  now the other co worker heard this and said he's gonna go ask for a raise  it literally pays to know your employee rights    amp x200b   it's such bullshit that there had to be law passed saying you can talk about this stuff  why can't i  why is it such an issue when everyone knows how much i make  oh  that's right  cause then they'll get mad at their employers and demand a fair wage ,cdpfxt
232,Not only do you have to work. Most of us can't even really choose what dream job we want.,the jobs have bullshit requirements  nepotism and more going on that rigs the system for an average joe  some people have to hustle  do unpaid internships and lick the boots of another person just to get their foot in the door for a  chance   not guaranteed  opportunity at working at a company that will gladly abandon them without notice     look at the game development industry  look at the applications  you need 5-10  years of experience  and the experience required is so disgustingly specific  that unless you luck out straight out of grad school i don't know how you can get in     i know someone who has shipped over 8 games  2 were a huge success  and he told me that game companies won't hire him because they are looking for someone who has experience working in an aaa company   running his own business  and shipping games on his own is not the same experience as working in a big aaa company   like seriously  what the fuck is he supposed to do ,cej0j5
233,Going nuts telling myself it's ok to call out sick.,i've been out of the office with norovirus the last two days  and seem to be done with the  vomiting uncontrollably  phase  all i've been able to think about today is  i hope i stop feeling weak and dizzy so i can make it in to work tomorrow  but the more often that thought crosses my mind  the crazier it feels  the craziest part is  i'm so concerned i'll get in trouble for reading three days off while i have a stomach virus  three days  my coworker found out today she has a partially collapsed lung  and she had been coming in for a week and  waiting it out  our workplace doesn't treat us as poorly as others  but we don't even get sick days  how crazy do we have to be to feel this amount of loyalty to our office   i can't tell how much of this is fever and how much of this is reality being awful  but the degree with which we disregard our own well being for work is insane ,ceo4wa

235,Taking a sick leave makes me more sick afterwards,if i don't feel well and want to take a day off  i am not allowed to text or email  rather give a call to my manager citing the reason why i am not coming  so just the thought of talking to my boss early in the morning and providing an explanation makes my stomach churn   then i have to make sure i log out of all apps such as outlook   skype and office one notes to take a mental break on my official day off which steals about ten minutes of my time  however if i haven't written an out of office   there are always a couple of assholes who cannot tolerate seeing my status as offline and after a couple of reminder emails will definitely call me on my mobile  imagine having to hear the same shit while recovering from a bad day   by afternoon my day has already felt like a waste and i dread about the emails i have missed and work being piled up   i am sure no matter what  that work won't get transferred to anyone else no matter how urgent it is and will be picked up by me and only me   and if i take the next day off as well  that will be the beginning of a big showdown with my boss and immediately serve as an entry in my apr  with the horribly inefficient way the department is being run they cannot afford to lose their overworked resources and even a day or two away is counted as a criminal offence   as tom smykowski said in office space  there are people in this world who don't have to put up with this shit ,cfayb0
236,Day 3. Still No Schedule., i  reached out for three weeks to get a shyte  entry level-management job working for minimum wage so that i could pay a little bit of my debt off before i check out for basic training in the next few months  but all it's been is phone tag and broken promises  thus far  like  ok  for example  i was told monday that i would have my schedule on tuesday  because our gm said there was something wrong our systems that caused my name to not show up when schedules were being made  unlikely  but whatever  but i'd have to call back in the morning since the gm had already taken the night off  tuesday morning called  our one douchey coworker answered and told me the gm was elsewhere but would call me back  apparently  he never did  or the gm never cared to take 5 fucking minutes to call me back  fucking  4 hours later  i called again  gm told me that they'd have my hours ready shortly and would call me back  they never called back  so now i don't know when i'm working  and am heading out to funeral in a few hours not knowing when if they're going to call me back  i'm exhausted already from finding this job  and even though i'm not staying here forever  i don't want to go looking for another  even though  something tells me i'm going to have to yet again find another job  i mean  it's simple  right  what i want to do is simple  get this damn job underway so i can have some spending money  and show my recruiter that i'm not trying to get in the military to dodge my debts  that's it  that's all  that's the only thing i want to do  why the hell can i not just  get that  why do people have to make it so fucking hard ,cerr28

243,What boomers really mean when they say do what you love.,i have considered leaving my job for something more related to my hobbies  it's entirely possible  but really there's a reason most don't talk about it though it's been mentioned here a few times  1  it has to be something you're practically in love with  not just a pass time  because spending eight hours a day several days a week doing anything becomes your whole life  even when not physically there  people ask about work  most of the people you talk too come from work  sometimes you even dream about work  if it's something you like doing  you better really like doing it  alternatively you could hate what you do but just get paid really well or do practically nothing  but for the first world those are options anyway  really the only difference between us and a peasant is while the third world farmer has to choose total poverty of commitment  while we often lack commitment  gee what a shocker  we do have the option of just not doing anything for the most part and living off the scraps  some of us more than others ofcourse as all things considered  america is basically a third world country larping as a first world when you look at say sweden or norway    2  as said if you don't absolutely love this thing there's no way dealing with shit head bosses  being tired all the time  and doing the same routine every day forever is going to make you wanna kill yourself any less  the only thing that will happen is eventually you'll feel bad because not only was this not quite the passion you thought it was  but people will criticize you for somehow being ungrateful that you're living out  your dream job  and you're in the same predicament you were before  as so many in game design experience  because when people think game design they think inventing the new super mario world  not writing seven hundred lines of code for the next fortnite update on a deadline which amounts to little more than some money in your name and being able to say on your resume you worked on fortnite  maybe you can do a floss dance for big money gaming tech and then get treated like shit at blizzard or something   look at the way they treat their consumers  that's only a fraction of how they're obviously going to treat you working for them  if the customer is just a clown to be parted with their money then banned or ignored  you're outright a slave to be abused and tormented to extract as much benefit as possible  i don't give a fuck how many monsters you drink  you're not gamer enough to love that life    3  the same issues will happen no matter where you work because it's not a personal problem it's a systemic one  the same way i say all mods are evil  all mods should be shot  isn't a testament to reddit itself but mods in general and despite their pissing and moaning about mu'h violent content moderators aren't a protected class but i am and they still harass me  you will experience the same sorts of evil working for the 4chan or twitter equivalent in wagie cagie   sure there might be some variety here and there of how you're mistreated  and certainly they'll draw from different pages of their big book of bullshit reasons  but ultimately it amounts to pretty much the same thing  boss is a twat  doesn't pay attention to the real problems making these projects and expectations implode  co-workers are all either completely numb and just don't do their job right on purpose  or are so impassioned with making a name for themselves will act like they're in a fucking gangster movie just to be supervisor  you get all sorts  but really does it matter if there's cultural  racial  and gender diversity when it all amounts too  i really don't wanna see or interact with any of these people   you'll probably need to find one you like though  you don't wanna be the 40 something single guy or girl whose entire life revolves around cats and this shit job  because as much as employers say they don't wanna drama in the work place  unless they're gonna arrange you a marriage like some arab prince  giving the vast majority of your life is spent at this specific location with these specific people  you better find someone to breed with or you won't be breeding at all  thus only making the experience more unbearable and grueling  cause i dont know about you  but i wasn't born on this earth just to die alone     so what im trying to get at is don't expect  doing what you love  to change anything if that work is tied in any way to capitalism  which it will be  we live in a society ,cgncep
244,What a wretched state of things,i'm currently at  the lobby area of my dispensary and two of the regulars who work at nearby burger king are complaining  quite rightfully from the sounds of it  about having to panhandle just to afford work clothes since even working 80  hrs a week they don't have enough to cover basic necessities  as well as the fact that their boss is evidently stealing from their paychecks and not giving them their earned overtime  i'm infuriated for them at the inhumanity of such a situation and knowing it isn't even uncommon in the richest country on earth is a fucking travesty  i'm not doing great myself and i can't offer much help other than condolences but godsdamnit if it doesn't make me sick with fury ,cg4u6x

248,What is the point of staff events? Specifically parties.,parties are meant for fun but staff parties carry this weight that i think nothing else has  they aren't mandatory but there is this pressure to attend or else you are labeled as not being a team player  you can't get too drunk or roudy because it's still a work environment  you can't be yourself and you cant have too much fun or too little fun    sometimes i'd rather have my head in a vice than navigate the work environment of backstabbing colleges  lame parties and snide but polite comments ,cffiqm

261,My neighbour shamed me for being unemployed,i posted about it on another sub last week   https old reddit com r narcsinthewild comments c5jfej ive got a new neighbour story     gt update on the neighbour i described here    gt https old reddit com r narcsinthewild comments c3w638 im not sure if my neighbour is a narc or what but    gt earlier tonight we had another balcony chat    gt unusually for him  he asked how things are going with me  particularly my job search  i'm currently unemployed and having a tough time finding something in my field  i told him about a couple prospects and then we moved on to other topics    gt then he comes back to it  and starts by saying sort of laughingly  it's funny  since i've known you i've had so many jobs  i keep getting hired   he's a part-time dishwasher in a restaurant  i didn't like the direction it was taking so i started asking him about his current job    gt he circled back and said  i just worry about you  i worry that you'll run out of money and get evicted  not what we'd be able to help you with money    gt i said  i'm tired  so i'm going to bed  talk to you next time    gt he was absolutely having a go at me and he can fuck right off with that   it's still bothering me a bit   it's creepy when someone goes out of their way to hurt you   i haven't had any contact with him since   i'm posting here because another angle on it is our toxic culture of work   that's how you get people who believe even having one of the shittiest jobs around makes you superior to someone who has no job   it's also how you get people who are so insecure that they need to punch  down   this guy probably bullies the immigrant dishwashers at his job and similar   so in addition to the toxicity of having to do jobs that are largely pointless to begin with  we also have to contend with petty status games   no wonder so many of us have depression and anxiety and self-medicate with various substances ,c8oy9c

302,"On fire ""drills"" and one whole hour of sweet, sweet silence: a call center story",i might have a 6-figure paying role and a fancy   yet meaningless  title in a big-tech giant now  but once upon a time i worked in a call center   i moved here with a useless degree and no real relevant work experience  years ago  when i first started in it  i got an entry-level job in a call center for an internet service provider  it was the easiest gig to get  probably due to the scary-high turnover rate these places have    a friend warned me   call centers are only one rank above living on centrelink  my country's unemployment payments - the lowest of the low  she said her call center was full of people shooting heroin on lunch breaks  and then selling cable tv plans on the phone to elderly people who couldn't figure out how to order them through a browser  but i tried everything  7eleven cashier  supermarket jobs  admin  receptionist - but that's the only job i could get   back then i had hope though  i got lucky and managed to climb up the ranks of the technical ladder on the very last chance to do so  a couple of months after  i got promoted  the entire call center got offshored to a cheaper third-world country  the vague hope that if i survive this  i'd have a career in it - that's what kept me going        if there's anything call center people love is fire drills  fire drills are great  because they get your to leave your seat and not take calls  for about an hour  till the building is evacuated in an organized fashion  health and safety regulations compelled us to do them regularly  and it was never made public  in advance  so it was a pleasant surprise  an entire hour of freedom    whenever there isn't a fire drill  you're supposed to be on the phone  there are always calls coming in and there is 0 downtime  the  break  you get between calls was 60 seconds  so you were supposed to document the call on the company's systems during  when you were supposed to listen to the customer  they meter the exact amount of time you spend on the phone  and if you idle for more than 10  of the time  a  performance improvement plan   pip  is quick to come  so yeah  a gulag  only with phones except hoes    there was a lunch break and two 10 minute break  but they were booked for exact times  if you got stuck on a call with a demanding customer  and couldn't get off - you'd miss your break  and you wouldn't get another one  my workaround was to get the customer to hold the line while i  go consult with an expert  or  test their password on our test-bench  - but in reality i'd make coffee or go to the bathroom  with them waiting on the phone   we did all kinds of stuff like that to survive  one time  out of stress  i deleted a feedback survey off the customer's inbox  knowing he was upset and is likely to 'ding' me with a 1 10 score   i never got caught  but i would have been fired instantly if they did  the guy who sat next to me got fired for making outbound calls to his mobile phone  so his corporate phone would be busy and customer calls won't flow in  he just sat there  taking long breaks like that  in utter  blissful silence      at some point  myself and a few colleagues noticed that the frequency of these fire drills has increased  the alarm was sound and we had to leave the building twice in one week  this gave us some time to stand and chat in the company's parking lot  we asked around  and were told the truth  these weren't drills   the alarm was really triggered by the smoke detectors  yet  no smoke was ever seen  and the building was not at all on fire  nobody was sure as to why it was happening  the company had to pay a heavy fine for a false callout to the fire department every time this happened     these false fire alarm events turned into mini company-picnics  the entire hour was marked as an  exception  in our calendars  so it won't affect our metrics  we got to sit on the lawn across the street  talk to our coworkers  get to know them  have a proper  relaxed snack  in order for the phones to be always manned  they had our breaks booked on different times  so we rarely got to sit and talk to one another      one day  the cause for the fire alarms was revealed  someone from the other team  a call center agent like me  found a smoke detector in a hidden spot where the security cameras did not reach  and lit a cigarette next to it  to trigger the alarm  he wasn't even a smoker  he bought this little freedom-kit  a pack of cigs and a lighter  for the sole purpose of stealing one-hour of sweet  sweet silence   he got fired  of course    these blessed fire  drills  stopped altogether  unfortunately   i met him on the train a few weeks later  and dared to ask   hey man  what were you thinking   he shrugged casually  and said a sentence that goes with me to this day   when you're in a call center  you'd rather go clean the toilets than take another single call   i think i get it now  in a way  at least the person cleaning the toilets is making a visible  small-yet-meaningful contribution to society  whereas call center work is a complete waste of time for everyone involved  a display of fake-niceties and customer  care   i don't know where he is now  i hope for him that he's unemployed ,cc3omc

328,Modern day jobs = slavery,our society forces people to exchange time labor for income  this is even lauded as good  consider  an honest day's work for an honest wage  also consider  that people take huge amounts of pride in what they do  and this typically comprises a major element of a person's identity  notice how if someone has a high paying job  they brag about their title or circumstances  the opposite is also true  someone is ashamed often to admit that they work in a low skill position     amp x200b   we use the income we obtain from selling our time labor in order to obtain necessities for existence  this is often framed as  freedom  meaning you choose what you eat or where you live  the opposite is actually true  if you choose not to go to work  you cannot obtain the resources you need by proxy  because you lose your income  this assumes you are not passively generating income and you don't have a huge pile of cash or something     amp x200b   slavery is when you are forced to do something against your will and you are punished when you opt out of doing whatever it is  the punishment in this case comes from losing access to resources  a couple of ways to push back on this is to argue that if someone enjoys their job  they cannot be a slave because they are not doing anything against their will  there are probably instances where that is true  however  the fact that before any other consideration is engaged in  you must calculate income due to resource necessity  is delimiting to freedom  so when someone chooses to become a lawyer because of the income they can earn  they are by definition  exchanging their freedom for income  maybe they really wanted to spend their life researching something  but because of the way our economic system prioritizes certain activity through compensation variation  causes them to do something all other things being equal  they may not have done    amp x200b   of course this brings up the question of how would people gain resources otherwise  is this not the best set of circumstances that we currently know of  this is a good question  and i will not go in to it in this post  because that brings up many different subjects    amp x200b   tl dr  1  labor time is exchanged for money 2  money is required to obtain resources 3  unless you just want to die  you are driven to obtain resources 4  choosing not to exchange your labor time for money results in punishment  by not having access to resources 5  being punished for not doing something you do not want to do is a form of coercion 6  being coerced to work is no different than slavery 7  therefore  work   slavery,cb4r4a

330,Money and/or a career is required to be part of society,you're either born into money or you work your ass off for it  that's the story we've all been told  there is another option that many people don't like to mention though  for fear of hurting your friends and loved ones  and that is to remove yourself from the equation  i've worked the last 7 years in software development  building a little career for myself  i have a wife  a dog  and the makings of what looks like a 'happy' life  but i've recently found myself unemployed as of this march  since that time i have searched and literally chased after the jobs i thought i could excel at  for companies that i admired and knew my skills would be useful with  i must have went wrong somewhere because those last 7 years have meant nothing in the eyes of the people who glanced over my resume  i've experienced rejection after rejection from the lowest it work i could find  to the most suitable job for my skills  i'm a polyglot  and although not the absolute best at one language  i'm full stack and i certainly know well more than one and have a specialty for 3d graphics  none of this matters though      i've come to accept this reality  and recently began applying for unskilled labor  retail  and food positions  those positions scoff at my career resume because i must be overqualified right  i'm the only one showing up to these interviews in a three-piece suit  i have had managers say to my face that they won't hire me because they already assume i won't take their job seriously if i'm getting paid  10 hour  i try my best to wear a happy face and let them know i'm ok with minimum wage  it's all i can get right now  at this point i'm finding it hard to care about living  my wife hates me for losing my job  my parents think i'm lazy  just hit the bricks  it's time to man up  my friends will think i'm a loser once they know i'm working in these kind of jobs after being a software developer for 7 years  where did my worth go      the only thing i have left is my self-worth  i know i'm good  i know what i deserve  but that doesn't get you where you want to be - am i a victim of circumstance  i don't worry anymore because i know there is another option i haven't been considering  remove myself from the equation  when society doesn't want you  you don't have to be apart of it  you can remove yourself from living in this morbid reality       thanks for reading and if you're like me  just know that suicide is always an option no matter how bad things get  your life shouldn't be subjected to depression like this  and when people in your life  and random strangers  try to convince you not to kill yourself  then remember that you are living for you and that your pain is meaningful- people trying to convince you otherwise are trying to continue that pain      the only thing i've worried about today is who i will let take care of my dog after i'm gone and it hurts me to know he will miss me  it just doesn't outweigh the pain i already feel for myself  i've contemplated a myriad of ways to commit suicide and decided upon a painless one  albeit gruesome  death by train  laying your neck over a track at night  let it ride over you  it will be instant and painless  i'm not sorry for whoever witnesses it or has to clean it up because this is the morbid reality we live in and it's time to accept it ,c8fttm

360,in favor of walking off the job,if you have a job that abuses you  that you plan to quit anyways and you already have another lined up or don t care about the reference  when you re ready  why not just walk off the job  i dealt with pretty severe workplace bullying on two different jobs and trust me i did everything i knew how to  to fight it  stop it  document it and all that  but when my health got too poor as a result of the bullying i simply packed up my personal belongings  turned in my badge quietly to the facilities guy with no warning and walked off the job and never returned  i did send email to the hr letting them know that for health reasons caused by a hostile work environment i was resigning effective immediately and that i was  sorry for any inconvenience but had no other choice  from a health standpoint this was true  recognize that the power to walk away at any time is the only real power you have as an employee if you can t afford a lawyer    the real power move is to have absenteeism issues on purpose for health reasons  anytime you feel too poorly to go due to the abusive environment  just don t go  until they fire you for maximum damage to their productivity while you continue to get maximum pay  also if you get fired  you can apply for unemployment benefits whereas if you resign  i don t think you can qualify    fuck abusive employers who allow employees to be bullied  i like to shaft them best i can by leaving them unprepared for an entire workload suddenly going undone  with nobody to cover it  if i can  it typically also gives them an attitude adjustment when they realize that i was quietly doing decent work and keeping things running without recognition and because of that i ve not had my references ever be affected    i ve never had any issues getting another job because of this either  it happens more than you think and i think walk-offs from abusive jobs should happen as much as possible in fact  we should all walk off abusive jobs with no notice  it apparently costs thousands mimimim to recruit  hire and train a new employee for many companies  just repeatedly hit that company s bottom line as hard as you can  until they go under or stop being abusive ,c9rwr5
361,How do I get out of a group work outing? Advice Needed!,hi all  two times a year  my smallish company that i work for hosts a company wide  outing  - outside of work hours  one being a christmas party and the other is a sporting event at a nearby stadium in mid-summer  i don't mind going to the christmas party because it's free food  we get a bonus  and we get to bring a plus one   the invitation to this summer's outing has been posted and we are allowed a plus one  but i really don't want to go  personally  i like to use my free-time by myself or with my husband and animals at home  i don't casually drink  and i don't like being forced to mingle when i could be home reading a book or taking my dog for a walk  the event is during the work week in the evening  i normally go to bed about two hours after the event starts because i like to get up early to have a peaceful morning  i technically have to rsvp to this outing  so it's not like the company would be out of money if i just didn't rsvp  but i need an excuse to decline    does anybody have any ideas ,capyd3

372,Take it back,  can't believe this needs to be said  but the rich are not doing you a service by employing you  they require you  everything they have is contingent on the fact that you work for them and do what they say  without you  the rich have literally nothing  workers have power over the entire economy   it is actually workers doing a major service to their employers by not unionizing and  not starting a revolution  since literally the only thing workers need to do to grind the entire economy to a halt is put their hands behind their back and stop working  that is it  workers could crash the entire machine in one moment if they wanted   stop calling them  job creator  they aren't  they literally require you  but you dont require them  you are wealth creator  and you have the power to take it back whenever you want  you just have to organize  ,cckn7s

377,"[Rant] You know those comments here that recommend on the Fi/RE movement, as an escape route from the hell that is full-time work? Here is what they're neglecting to tell you", i am not an expert  i'm the exact opposite  actually  please don't rely on this and go see a professional before making any decisions   whenever someone starts a thread here and shares the frustrations of the modern imprisonment system called  work  there's usually at least 1 comment that says  look into the fi re movement    well  i finally did    i had to  my savings started amounting to a decent enough amount of money  so that i had to start thinking about it  i'm not a big spender type - just minor conveniences here and there  to take solace in the fact i'm wasting my life away in a boring office role    i've been saving  50  of my take-home pay easily  and the interest i get for a savings account at the bank is pathetic - about 1  less than the rise in the cost of life  a financial advisor warned me that by letting the money just sit there  it effectively depreciates as cost of life grows  to put it simply  i'm losing money by stalling    the idea of fi re is that every dollar you don't-spend matters  thanks to compound interest  there are compound interest calculators online  that show you  for example  that  10 000 today  with a standard interest of 5  would equate to  16 500 in a decade  some investors can supposedly get more than the basic  5-6  if they play their cards right  perform research etc    but where does the 5 -or-higher interest come from exactly    your bank is not likely to pay you that much for your savings account  here  the larger baks pay a lot less   some smaller banks i found  which may be somewhat risky  pay as much as  3 5  which is also somewhat low  and perhaps a bit riskier - i've seen one bank collapse in my days as a teenager   then  what is considered a 'safe investment'  which also pays the a significant enough interest to allow one to dream of early retirement      the answer most fi re types quote is  etfs   i'm not an expert  but from what i read - an exchange-traded fund  etf  is an investment fund  traded on stock exchanges  much like stocks  instead of picking a stock one by one  investors can pick a fund that tracks multiple companies at once  the popular ones  which are considered  safe   and often have lower management fees  track the performance of financial market indexes  you don't have to be an expert  and you don't have to hire professionals to manage your investments  which would offset all the profit if you're just an average joe with a few grands   here in australia  there are a few that track the top 200-300 asx  australian stock exchange  companies  investors that rather put their money in the global market often choose etfs that track standard  amp  poor's index  s amp p 500    those are just two examples  and there are many other options out there - but those are very common suggestions to people who have no financial background  can't manage the money by themselves  are risk averse etc   and the problem    once you check which companies those funds track exactly  you see what exactly you're investing in  from my perspective  they're the axis of evil  you're essentially betting on companies that do bad things   here are some examples from the list of companies in the s amp p 500 index   1   accenture   - an it company that hires bad-yet-cheap software developers in countries like india  as contractors  which in turn allows other companies to offshore their it services and fire staff  i've seen that before  2   activision blizzard   - we've had a few links on this sub around their latest shenanigans  around christmas  they fired 800 employees  to make up for its losses - while their ceo was paid 28 million for his supposedly-stellar performance  3   alphabet class a and c   - those are the guys that gather obscene amount of information on us all  track our every online move  in order to brainwash us with ads and perpetuate consumerism   4   amazon   - their founder is the richest man on the planet  yet bernie sanders had to win a long battle in order to convince him to pay his warehouse staff  15 an hour  in u k  an investigative journalist revealed that picker-packers in amazon warehouses  whose every move are under constant surveillance lest they slack a little on the clock  pee in bottles to save time and keep their metrics up  5   apple   - produces iphones in foxconn factories in china  where staff are paid very little and have a high suicide rate    that's just the letter a  the list is full of corporations that are famous for doing  nasty things for profit   here are some more examples  after i scrolled down the whole thing      phrama companies  that pushed opioids and hid the fact they're addictive from the public     oil companies  i spotted multiple fossil fuel names     health care  providers in u s  who lobby hard against public health care  inflate the cost of health services and fight every patient's claim    some of the  banks and financial institutes  that caused the gfc are in the list  the guys who got bailed out by the u s  government  then took the bailout money and paid huge bonuses to their execs       let's assume you're just about the money  and don't have a conscience  not judging   you have to do what you can to survive in a capitalist economy  and you can't afford to reject the safest path to early retirement   but whose to say these companies are going to not just last  but grow  in 10  20  30 years  especially the petroleum names in the list  whose to say the banking system and the u s  health care system will be the same by then    i almost hope it won't   in order to be optimistic about the success of your investment  you have to be quite pessimistic about the direction that the world is heading to  and assume that our society won't improve  that we won't kick the bad  destructive habit of fossil fuel  even amazon's bezos recently held a presentation about manning mars  since he thinks we'll consume the resources here eventually  because we don't want to turn to  rationing   his bleak interpretation on the degrowth movement  perhaps   there are some alternatives  and you can probably build an  ethical  investment portfolio and choose less-horrible companies or indexes etc  the management fee will be far higher  and it's considered a less-safe path  most investors don't  i see the same 3-letter acronyms on fi re forums  the same funds people discuss    and they're all cancer  lucrative cancer  at least for the time being       i'm still doing it  don't get me wrong  billy corgan said   despite of my rage  i am still just a rat in a cage  if that's my ticket out of work  i can't afford to be ethical    i would have bought real estate instead  but i don't have enough money to buy a tiny studio within less than an hour of my workplace  one of the axis-of-evil companies in the s amp p 500 index  btw  i don't think i never will  lest i sink in debt and work for 30 years  and the majority of the population here earns less than me   i guess i'm just venting here  but the next time someone posts that if you skip that one cappuccino or spotify subscription  i'd be able to retire early - please be aware that they're not telling you the whole story  they're not telling you that you'd have to embrace a sickly capitalistic system  and hope for the best     tl dr - the fi re movement's promise relies on the success of the least ethical companies in the world ,c7qkjw
