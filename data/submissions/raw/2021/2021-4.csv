4,Am I wrong?,"Am I wrong for wanting a more fair work/life balance? Am I wrong for wanting to contribute to society only if I get treated fairly in the process and get paid enough money to pay my bills? Am I wrong for not wanting to live in stress my whole goddamn life working my bones to the grave while not enjoying my life because it's all consumed by work? Am I wrong for fearing that my entire life will be revolved around trying to compete in this rat race just to literally have BASIC HUMAN NEEDS SUCH AS SHELTER, FOOD, WATER ETC. 

Am I wrong for thinking that jobs need to be kinder and more empathetic to employees who work minimum wage? Am I wrong for wanting people to live stress-free and happy? Am I wrong for thinking that people deserve to get paid enough to pay their bills?

Why the actual fuck does any of this need to be a debate? No wonder why depression and suicide rates are going up. People telling me that I am wrong for questioning the system that we're dealt. I am willing to work, I am willing to CONTRIBUTE to society. As long as we're all treated equally and fairly.

The thing is, i'd be willing to meet halfway with the people who disagree with me. This world does need workers, but jesus christ stop twisting everything I say out of context. It's okay to work as long as the ""work"" isn't the only thing we have to literally survive on the planet. 

Let's say that someone loses their job, or your business fails, leaving you bankrupt and homeless. So now you have no shelter, food or water. So what the fuck? You did everything right but now you have nothing and could possibly starve to death. 

Or let's say someone with mental illness is struggling and can't keep a job. So now that person has the stress of needing to keep a job and maintain a positive mindset through it or else they'd lose it. Which leads them to instability. 

This is what I'm talking about.

I just want some changes to the work system. We shouldn't have to work to live. Anything else would literally be society saying ""Oh you're not doing this, ok you die then."" But no people always twist what I say and be like ""you're entitled and lazy"" or some crap. I even try to be respectful but some people on here just insult me or call me a baby or something.

What do people do with that hour?? Luckily I have a job where I can eat whenever I want. I was annoyed one day at work from dealing with all the customers, so I decided to eat. As I began to eat, I get a customer asking me to do something for them. I made them wait 20 minutes for me to finish my food. 

What does everyone else on slow days do?? Like some days for me, I do not see a paying customer for days on end. So I just read, watch YouTube/Netflix, sleep, play games, do homework.

41,I don't consider non-workers to be fundamentally driven by laziness in the modern era,"It's true that work is great if it has purpose and contributes to society, the problem is that these days the workers are exploited whilst billionaires siphon up the funds and people are obliged to take menial jobs that are basically useless other than to funnel money up to these exploitative billionaires. Even jobs that ARE valid and honourable like being a doctor or carpenter are cheapened by how many people make money off of bullshit. 

Additionally, if somebody is miserable or suffering from something, you can call them lazy for not working if you wish, but the truth is in many instances they're borderline suicidal and not necessarily thinking about whether or not they contribute to society, which would be an undue demand upon an already vulnerable mind. I saw a picture of a young Guy who had hung himself because he was unable to find a job. It's pretty sick to imagine people calling him a 'dosser' prior to his death, but that's the mentality some people seem to roll with. 

I can understand the validity of honest work but I can also understand alienation to the point where honest work seems unfairly futile. The system is fucked - work isn't the problem, work is fantastic and life-affirming when it's worthwhile, but the jobs themselves definitely are not. I am more sympathetic to people who are on benefits because of this BUT I think they should all aim to find a genuine, fulfilling job and do their best to try to find it. 

People will call this left-wing and maybe it technically is but to me it just seems like basic common sense and an understanding and respect of human psychology.

In school, you learn the minimum to get by and spend most of your time outside of school working on your one sport.  You become the best you can at that sport by having people encourage you and help you along the way.

Through high school and college you continue to take basic classes while practicing your sport and busting your butt to do the best you can.

Outside of college you perform and train to be the best you can for about 10-15 years.  And then in your early to mid 30s you are able to retire.

I absolutely hate it's just considered normal now to go to school for 16ish years, then work for 40+ years.  Work steals the best years of your life, and also the best hours of those years.

55,I need to get into the mentality that it's okay to leave my job,"I've been at the job for nearly three years, however two of those years were broken due to working on a Master's Degree. Since finishing I've been working with the company for a year straight now. 

The company has changed a lot since I started. Plus in the last year I'm working for a different department with a completely different management. I don't have a lot of experience in the field outside of this company so I wasn't sure about general pay and work etc. I get $15 per hour in a junior civil engineer consultant role with a Master's degree, the pay is also salary so no OT is paid. 

In the last year I've notice more and more of my co-workers hand in their notice. It's getting to the stage where I'm almost getting weekly emails about someone leaving. A project manager that I got along with rang me a while back saying they're going to leave soon and said that a few others are too. He told me he called to properly say goodbye and didn't want to do that through an email since we always got along but it did feel like they were warning me that things might get rough since more were leaving. 

The reason why I initially started looking elsewhere was simply down to the fact I didn't enjoy the work at all. During the search I realised that I wasn't being paid very well for my job (even as a junior) and could do better elsewhere too. Another issue I've been having is that since the workload has grown exponentially, I've been given work completely out of my depth with no help at all. I've been told by co-workers that the work I have is senior level and it's also not in the same field of work as my educational background. 

When I asked for any help or advice I was told to look up the legal standards and read previous projects to get an idea. Everything was foreign to me so I struggled but somehow I am managing to get through the work. My mental health took a toll with the amount of work I needed to keep up with and everytime I asked for help from my supervisor my messages were either ignored or I was told to ask someone else. Usually I was told to ask a co-worker who is still learning English and struggles to explain things simply for help. 

After a short search a few companies reached out to me offering to talk about where I want to go with my career. One place is even offering me a 30% wage rise and a good few other perks. I'm very close to taking on an offer but now I'm sitting here feeling bad for me team. They're struggling to meet deadlines and things are getting worse as others are leaving. I don't want to screw over my team anymore and cause them extra stress. Many of us are already pulling weekends to make deadlines.",False,n1eo55,BeGhostHunting,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n1eo55/i_need_to_get_into_the_mentality_that_its_okay_to/,4,1

64,"IN DESPERATE NEED OF ADVICE: my boss is terrible and management is doing nothing. people are quitting, responsibilities are falling on ME (17f) and i can’t quit","hi! i would like to quickly preface this by saying thank you for reading this and offering up your time to try to see if you can help me. i’m going to cross post this to other sub reddits because honestly i need all the advice i can get. thank you :,)

so a little back story: 
during 2019-2020 i had extreme anger issues. i have a plethora of other mental illness but this caused me to behave very unseemly to my peers for attention. it is an embarrassing part of my life. late 2020 i got charges filed against me, i’m guilty of the charges and my parents (besides freaking out) hired a lawyer. this subsequently lead to me getting a job to help pay my parents back, which is something i want to do regardless. my dad has a friend who opened a new pizza place and got me a job. 

for the most part, i liked my job. i learned a lot and enjoy most aspects of it. i like all my co workers and got my friend hired. it was pretty great... at first. as time went on though, seemingly resolvable issues became bigger and bigger deals, and i soon figured out it was my general manger to blame. the schedule was never made on time, it was always last minute making it hard to plan for my week. nothing ever gets done, she jumps from task to task and never finishes anything. her assistant, one of my favorite coworkers, did all her work for months on top of her own job. and once she realized my boss was using her, she quit. im proud of her though, i’m glad she’s getting a job with the treatment she deserves. it’s just stressful as fuck because i was trained like a couple times and then just had to jump in and do it. i’m picking up the slack of people who are picking up my bosses! and i’m not even that good at my job either so i definitely shouldn’t be picking up peoples slack. it’s just too much, and because of my ✨mental illness✨ this makes me so anxious and stressed out. i have tennis now everyday, i can’t come to work four days a week anymore. i’m going to request to only work saturday and sunday, but my friend who i got hired just quit (also because of my boss) and i know i’m also going to have to pick up his slack. 

no one likes her, every time she isn’t there (and even when she it) people shit talk her!! like they just openly don’t like her. and it’s not just because she’s the manager she just never gets work done and blames it on everyone else. she never takes responsibility for her actions and blames others for stuff she does!! it drives me crazy i can’t fathom why she still has this job!

two of my coworkers have talked some higher up that is at the store sometimes but that’s about it...it definitely didn’t help anything or benefit us in any way. i don’t know what to do. my dad told me i had to have a job and i feel very obligated not to quit. i also don’t think he would be happy about me quitting. i do get a lot of tips which is nice, but besides that i’m not in love with my job.

I'm saying that our only tools against it (going on strike, revolution, etc) will be completely useless when the rich don't need anyone anymore. They will have a self sustaining power that needs no one to fuel it and from that point on it will be literally and physically impossible to change anything about it.

goodness Want to Feel Like You're Back
in the Office? Must Right These Candles!

A design agency based in New Work, United States,
has drafted a new line of scented candles that,
instead of evoking flora and pretty smells, conjure a
place reminiscence of their consumers’ pre-anaemic
life: the office!

“Is scented-candle makers, they naturally want to
make things smell good and had some concerns with
what we were trying to achieve with the scent,” says
Chipault Gerard, creative director at R/of and co-
creator of Au d’Office, who first gave out those
candles as a goodby gift for colleagues. “For us, it
was less about creating perfume perfect scent and
more about combining some of the scent to conjure
a specific memory.”

69,"The Rich's ""lifestyle"" portion of wealth accumulation is a red herring.","Yesterday I made a comment about my boss who is on the lowest, lowest end of what can be called ""The Rich"", which for me is around a net worth of about $10M. I shared that the working class thinks that life is more like what they know: payday loans, rent-to-owns, vape shops and people spinning signs on the corner.

I shared about my boss's (and his wife) 18,000 sq ft home (with the theater room, basketball court, home gym, theater room and other amenities you'd expect with such a home). His four nice to luxury vehicles (no super cars).His expensive and nice coach motorhome and one of the nicest freshwater boats you can buy (cost more than my house).

And remember, he's just barely at the stage you can call ""The Rich"". He's in the low double digit millions rich.

None of that is new information to you.

Here's the new perspective.

The houses only get so big. And at that point, you can no longer see the abundance. You need to imagine an imaginary column of wealth that is accumulating with zero material representation.

Your community looks around and says - the rich houses aren't growing. They're just there. And there are so many more regular folks. We can't go after the rich, we have to find a way to fend for ourselves.

After all, their homes in these fancy areas are big, but they aren't expanding.

Well yeah, because there's only so much milk the rich can drink, and so ridiculous a house can be.

After they have the nice house - all the rest of the wealth you never see.

You just see one rich house, and many many many apartments and homes. And there's only so much flaunting.

The wealth is invisible to the communities.

So when I made a comment about how many boss has such nice stuff - it's not the nice stuff that I should really be pointing out to you.

It's that from this point forward, his accumulation of wealth will be beyond your ability to perceive. Forever. It will now just be an abstract number to you, and you will not see it as real.

The absolute insane amount of wealth in this country is NOT VISIBLE TO YOU, not from even from a spy satellite.

It's in investments and ownership and bank accounts and you're not going to get triggered against it, because we focus so much on what our eyes can see.

Every future dollar my boss earns will not have to go to any of the luxuries because he's got them all.

And now we'll see how the lifestyle of The Rich is actually just a starting place - and that the real wealth comes AFTER those expenses are done.

Now the real accumulation of wealth begins.",False,n22ghw,RelevantStudioC,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n22ghw/the_richs_lifestyle_portion_of_wealth/,4,1

95,What the older generations don’t understand about millennials,"When the previous generations (especially the boomer generation) worked, their money went much, much farther. This isn’t a secret, it’s been well establish and is well known. Their work earned them a house, a car, a family, a retirement, and maybe some toys and even a second house. As buying power went down, the reward became lesser but the sense of achievement lingered. A house of your own is a house of your own, a thing to be proud of and enjoy. Which brings me to abysmal now. We don’t work for brighter future potentials anymore.  We don’t work for substantial reward. We work to perpetuate our current existence.  We’ve been priced out of a simple life. We work to perpetuate working.

Now that I'm in between jobs, I can see my therapist more easily, take my cat to the vet, and probably do a bunch of other things (like just stuff around the house I neglected or put off until the weekend but still completely neglected because 2 days isn't enough to recover) that I couldn't because 11 hours of my day were sucked up by getting to and from and working at a job. I would just come home exhausted, mostly mentally from the workplace. I found it was rather toxic and demeaning and frankly kind of unprofessional. The one nice thing was the hour for lunch (30 minutes at my previous place), but I'd rather spend my time at home or with people I like than at work.

I'll spend some time unemployed keeping expenses at a minimum but also enjoying myself becauseI do have some savings to live on (I am rather lucky in that regard), and maybe I'll work at getting some extra credentials and letters at the end of my name to get the job I want rather than the one that will take me because they're kind of desperate.

97,Quitting Via 8'x2' Banner: What Should It Say??,"This is a long story:
Started my job in 2018 as an accounting manager for an organization that does 200 mil in revenue, but only has an accounting team of 6 because the benefits and pay were amazing. I was younger than the children of the people I manage which made for an awkward/hard time to start because the group I was walking in to had all been working with each other for decades and they do not like change. Everything was fine, usual manageable office politics.

Then my husband lost his job.

Then the pandemic hit.

Then my husband suddenly lost the ability to walk (MS attack- was put on chemo-like treatments that wipe his immune system and cost 200k/year).

I was sent home for wearing a mask into the office and involuntarily put on leave that ate up all my sick and vacation time I had saved up while they decided what to do with me because the governor of my state started to shut things down. (including offices)

They decided the HR and accounting teams were ""essential workers"" (we are not and can do 99% of our jobs from home besides mail scanning and check printing). So after my leave was over they said come back into the office or quit.

Had no other option, needed the health insurance. 

When I returned everyone suddenly hated me, ignored me despite being their boss, were mean, snide comments and low key insults galore.

My boss had used that time to scape goat me into the bad guy so everyone wouldn't be mad at her for making them continue to come into the office (still sans masks).

One of my employees travels for Christmas, his wife tests positive for COVID-19 upon return, which has a 20% chance of killing my husband. The HR manager takes his premature negative test the day they returned and says that he is clear to come back into the office Monday. Thankfully he wakes up with a sniffle and gets another test. This time positive. I find out this happened the following Wednesday, and they wouldn't have told me of the risk had he actually come in.

Showed up, worked overtime (unpaid, I'm salaried), really tried to turn things around and play politics and be super nice and helpful to everyone.

Get payroll to review 7 months later. Guess who got bonuses: everyone in the department except for me. Guess who got raises: everyone in the department besides me.

Spend 5 months finding a better job. Now I am starting a business with a former professor and will be able to work from home.

Now comes the good part: 

I had to wait until this next Monday to quit to not have a gap in insurance coverage. So I did not give my two weeks because I wasn't willing to risk them firing me on the spot (at-will employment state). 

I have always wanted an EPIC quitting story. I have landed on having an 8 foot by 2 foot banner made which is less than a hundred bucks and I have a change jar for only stupid/fun shit that will cover the cost. 

WHAT SHOULD IT SAY???? I wanted it to serve as my resignation letter and I'm not going to need a reference from this place, that bridge had been burned months ago.

Tldr: treated like crap, COVID-19 office outbreak could have killed my husband, what should I put on the 8 foot banner I plan to have made to announce me quitting?

98,A Personal Story: The 30 Year Crisis,"&amp;#x200B;

The average human being lives to be 79 years old in the United States of America. I am a 30-year-old male. The average male human being lives to be 76 years old in the United States, and the average female gets an extra five years at 81 years old.  I do not want to work a job for thirty years and retire at the ripe age of 60. I want to retire by the time I am 40 years old and live on the rest of my life doing what makes me happy. 

After I completed my research essay on the future of cryptocurrency, I asked myself why I was so interested in this subject. The answer came down to my mortality. I know I have a limited amount of time on Earth, and I do not want to waste a second of it. I constantly remind myself of my own pending death as a way of motivation. I have friends that ignore their mortality and ignore the statistics on health and disease. Their approach reminds me of an “ignorance is bliss approach.”  

I have a tattoo scheduled next week to get the words “memento mori” on my chest. Memento mori is Latin for “Remember you must die.” The phrase, memento mori, the usage of this phrase was traced back to the ancient Rome time period where slaves would whisper this phrase to one another to uplift spirits due to the back living conditions and the continual reign of the current generals enslaving them.   

I want to make every hour of everyday count for something because I do not have an unlimited supply of life hours. I did some deep reflection into my life path and have concluded that I do not want to work until I am 65 years old to “retire.” If I stay at my current employer, I can cut that figure from 65 to possibly 57 years old. I do not want to retire at 57. There are several issues with retiring at 57 years old.  The number one issue is I will be fifty-seven years old. At 57 who is to know the condition of my health, mobility, and current risks of disease and cancer at that age. I do not want to take that risk to begin “living in retirement” at that age. The second issue is that the average lifespan after retirement from the stress-ridden job that I am at now is 6 months of life after retirement. This is sad because many correction officers work their whole life looking towards retirement, however, they forget to take care of their health and stress levels along this journey. Hypertension is a silent killer because an individual can look and feel completely normal and never know they have a ticking bomb inside of their chest that is fueled by stress. Working in a prison where you are constantly monitoring human beings that have committed felonious crimes can be stressful. Especially considering these human beings tend to not be the best at following rules or getting along with one another.  

I have worked as a city police officer, a deputy, a correction officer, waiter, home improvement sales and more. I have concluded that all jobs get boring to me. This is an opinion of course. However, I have identified that working a typical job does not make me happy. My personal identified “meaning of life” has always been “stay as happy as long and as often as possible.” To achieve this, I want to retire by the age of 40 years old. Let me rephrase that sentence to be more accurate. I want to be done working full time by the time I am 40 years old. I want to achieve a mass of wealth which I have calculated to be 9 million dollars so I can do this. If this comes to be not possible by the 40-year-old date, then I will have created a few streams of passive income by this date and work part time. The goal is to do what makes me happy. What makes me happy is running, exercising, doing “new things”, meeting new people, competing, and traveling.  

The reason I am so attracted to the New York Stock Exchange and the cryptocurrency market is for the possibilities of one dollar becoming ten dollars. I understand the more you invest is the more you can make (or lose). I am now thirty years old, and I am facing the barrel of thirty more years of work if I think like a typical American. I do not have children nor a mortgage. I have flexibility in the way I can live my life and manage my meager income. I will never accumulate 9 million dollars by working in a prison setting or any other typical job by the time I am 40 years old. The key to an early “retirement” is to invest my money into smart investments. I have a buddy named “Robert” who has made $165,000 in the last four months by investing some of the money he makes at $25.00 an hour into the cryptocurrency market. It would have taken me 3 years of working full time in the same job as Robert to accumulate those funds. That means 3 years of working and not spending a penny! Robert did not work overtime and sacrifice his free-time and every waking moment by trading 60-minute intervals of his life into United States dollars. The most valuable thing I have is time. I do not want to continue to trade my time for paper money. There are too many things on this Earth that I want to see and that I want to do. Every minute counts.  

The cryptocurrency market is an investment that comes with risk just like any other investment. This paper served as an insight into how I think about my life, and why I am attracted to investing my money into the cryptocurrency market and stock market. This paper is not intended as investment advice, rather it serves as a person sharing their strategy on squeezing as much juice out of life as possible. Thank you for reading this narrative.

100,Economic impact of a pandemic,"Before the plague, rising population had kept wages low and rents and prices high, an economic reality advantageous to the lord in dealing with the peasant and inclining many a peasant to cleave to demeaning yet secure dependent tenure.

As the Black Death swung the balance in the peasant’s favor, the literate elite bemoaned a disintegrating social and economic order. William of Dene, John Langland, John Gower, and others polemically evoked nostalgia for the peasant who knew his place, worked hard, demanded little, and squelched pride while they condemned their present in which land lay unplowed and only an immediate pang of hunger goaded a lazy, disrespectful, grasping peasant to do a moment’s desultory work (Hatcher, 1994).

Moralizing exaggeration aside, the rural worker indeed demanded and received higher payments in cash (nominal wages) in the plague’s aftermath. Wages in England rose from twelve to twenty—eight percent from the 1340s to the 1350s and twenty to forty percent from the 1340s to the 1360s.

I got into the building and the boss of this 3 people design studio sat at his desk having a major power trip. Hands clasped together he let me sit an awkwardly long time as he stared into my face before he spoke to me. He asked me “what can you bring to my studio?” amongst other questions. I was very nervous but I did my damn best.

They didn’t get back to me for months, I was devastated and had to pick myself back up to contact other jobs. By miracle I got a job in a big company which paid almost double with a huge workforce that would shit on the little studio!

Months later I receive a reply from the shot studio, it said “We regret to inform you we won’t be contacting you further regarding the position as we feel your lack of experience doesn’t match with the profile we are looking for.”

I ignored it and carried on with my day.

A week later I got another mail from them, it read. “We would like to invite you to another interview, our candidate has declined the position and we are once again looking for someone to fill it.”

I replied to this mail, with the most satisfying but professional reply ever. I subtly stated that I’m not interested as I am now employed in a much bigger and better company.

The sales director then responded by apologising to *me*. I didn't even make the complaint. Turns out sales director was aware of loads of times his sales team have treated me like a pos. 

I had actually previously escalated one of the sales bad behaviour to my manager before. He bit my head off.

133,What am I doing wrong?,"I honestly don't know what I could be doing that would get me a decent paying job that I don't hate... 

Graduated from university with a degree in Math/CS, did a couple internships during to get some experience and secured a decent enough job right after school. Only problem was, it was medium sized tech company with super old software and micro managed team structure. First four months were good. I was a bright eyed individual, wanting to learn and interact. Stupid of me, I know. Now that I think about it, I shouldn't have done that. They started giving me projects that were too complex (I could do them but my work load got worse as time progressed compared to the people who had joined alongside me)

6 months in, I knew I had to get out. I hated the commute (3 hours round trip), often had to do overtime, office politics was awful (I was naive to think everyone had good intentions three years ago) and job itself was shite. Atleast pay was good enough. I quit after a few months. 

Ended up taking some time off and then got back to job searching. Couldn't find any well paying contract jobs much less permanent ones so took one low paying one (a little over minimum) to get some experience and not sit idle. Because of covid, I stayed longer than I planned to but I've been searching since months and nothing. 

I have a bunch of technical skills in addition to work experience as well as good companies on my resume. Have tried recruiters, linkedin (reference, cold message everything other than posting ""I'm looking for a job"") and mass applying but nothing. One of the things I've noticed is that even if I do get an interview, it often feels like they're treating me like a kid. Same thing with this job and the prev one. One of my ex managers once told me during performance review, ""you're getting a raise even though you're still a baby (chuckles)"" 😒

185,Middle of nowhere corn fed girlfriend regurgitates her boomer grandpa’s systemic wage slave ideologies to hit me below the belt while the man is already winning this boxing match.,"Context: born peasant anti worker who still fucking works but does borrow money a lot recently abruptly loses EDD and isn’t able to pay back live in “doesn’t need to work” gf of four years $1373 bones as planned for upcoming may rent. Gf looking at account from bed this morning believes that I owe her another $650 which anti worker is certain he does not. Carnage erupts...


Her: you called me a stupid bitch multiple times and are disrespectful to me after I spot you money I really don’t need to but only do out of the kindness of my heart...that’s why I broke up with you today. 


Me: yes, because you interrupted my work claiming I owed you $650 more than you originally thought. When I asked you to give me a few minutes to check my payment history you started getting extremely upset, crying, and calling me a freaking con man. I took the time to find the discrepancies between our accounts and clearly proved that the missing $650 (and then some!) had been paid to you. I even noticed things you added to my tab without me knowing. I noticed some increments I paid back not deducted from the total. Essentially I realized you were gaining interest on my debts without my knowledge or consent. The “nice little things” you do even out this way on paper. All you do is spot me money. You don’t fucking PAY for shit. After I asked that I be forgiven for these false accusations and we move on with the day you proceeded to BREAK UP with me and tell me I shouldn’t need any help at 30 after I lost a substantial income and momentum to a global pandemic that you have been receiving unemployment on for an entire year after working for your first service job for FOUR MONTHS in the FOUR YEARS we have been seeing each other while I have washed dogs and done work I never thought I would have to do again for a wage that makes me want to jump off a very high building and splatter into oblivion. So yeah!! You’re coming off as a bitch to me right now babe!!!!! IM SORRY BUT MY VALUES OF RESPECT ARE NOT DEFINED BY WHAT MONETARY AMOUNT I OWE YOU OR ANY MONETARY VALUE I COULD GIVE OR RECEIVE. Accusing me of owing you money I don’t then flipping my life upside down because you’re salty is quite disrespectful! Maybe you should’ve told me you don’t want to be with me while you were on vacation with friends last week? AlI heard was how much you loved me and looked forward to being back home. But then I lost my EDD this week and wasn’t able to pay you directly when you thought I would. Where do I sign up to be asexual!?!? Fuck money, fuck working just to survive, fuck societies expectations of me, fuck trying to maintain relationships with people who value money. So far I have worked really hard just to not achieve my dreams or be appreciated by anyone in my life because I don’t have money to offer. I really chalk it up to being born into absolutely nothing with parents that never really gave a fuck about my life’s trajectory.

190,"Pay rises ""unlikely"" this year where I work","My supervisor has said that it's not likely that we will get a pay rise this year, ""because of the pandemic"". Meanwhile, my council tax has gone up 4%, food costs are rising especially stuff we import from the EU (thanks, Brexit), my car and home insurance has gone up, fuel costs are going up again, and my partner's health means he needs to cut his hours, so his income is going down soon.

I've got a detailed budget spreadsheet that calculates income and expenses, and the money left over each month column has dwindled into double figures now. When my partner's hours change, that number's going to go into the negatives. We've got a little in savings, but not enough to sustain us indefinitely, and if something expensive needs replacing or fixing, it'll wipe us out.

I don't know what to do. I'm finding it hard to focus. It's affecting my sleep. I keep telling my partner ""we'll manage"" but I don't know how. I've been planning on sorting all my old pokemon cards from when I was a kid to sell them on ebay, but the effort necessary to do that is beyond me. Hell I can barely summon the energy to feed myself at the moment, and without my partner I'd be eating cereal for every meal.

I hate this system. I hate that I have to stress and go without sleep and wonder where I can find a little extra cash just to survive. I hate that having a job comes at the expense of my mental health because it's not enough to live on. I hate that the government has decided my partner isn't entitled to benefits even though his illness is permanent and caused him to need to take a whole year off work and halve his hours when he returned and then cut them again after next payday, but it doesn't ""affect his day to day life"" enough for them to actually help him.",False,n11xt4,chilari,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n11xt4/pay_rises_unlikely_this_year_where_i_work/,6,1

193,Is a change coming?,"I have always despised how we have to give up so much of our lives for a corporation that doesn't care about us. But for some reason, I've recently felt like a change is coming, and that corporations can no longer conduct business the way they have been.

Nowadays (in America at least), there have been numerous issues when it comes to employment. 15 dollar minimum wage was recently passed. Companies are struggling with what they call a ""labor shortage."" Many people, due to the recent quarantine, have found the time to pursue their own interests and are much happier with their lives. I continue to hear stories from blue collar workers about the frustration they are feeling with the expectations put on them throughout the pandemic. All of this gives me some hope that the current capitalist system is breaking.

Companies are now inflicting extra burdens on their employees to make up for the lost revenue from covid. I myself have worked for the same company for 5 years, with promotions in title, but no raise in my pay. I still only get 2 weeks of vacation time per year (no sick days either). These workload burdens are now far more visible with the strain we've all had to endure. And people are definitely on edge due to these expectations. I feel like the dam is about to break. Too many people are overworked and underappreciated, and have the wherewithal to actually see it now that enough of us have been crushed and stepped on by our employers.

Does anyone else feel a change in the winds, or am I being naively optimistic?  People seem to be cracking, and these companies are going to have to deal with it one way or another.",False,n0rh8a,InDoubtWeTrust,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n0rh8a/is_a_change_coming/,20,1

200,Middle Management Destroyed my outlook,"Full disclosure for this throwaway account, I make good money at a growing company. By all outward measures my career is going great and I'm ahead of the curve. In retrospect this is what I've been working for. It's not that I don't sympathize with this subreddit but I can say I've always ""drank the kool-aid"" at work. Lean certifications? I have them. Management seminars/trainings? Attended them. Patrick Lencioni books? Read them. I have to say though that taking a risk and moving across the country for a job was a massive fucking mistake. I work in biotech and have always had a passion for what I do. Starting out as a low level manufacturing technician I've always told myself that no matter how much my day sucks at least at the other end of it was a person who might be cancer free, or have their sight restored, or some other amazing feat of medical science. I still believe that, because it is true, but fuck middle management and it's bloated, bullshit effect on prices and my staff.

In spite of the ""mission"", I fucking hate my companies leadership. During my time in my current role I have kept tabs on how much product we've produced and tried to focus my team on how many lives they possibly have saved, whereas finance and the CEO only want to talk about how much goddamn money we make per week/month/quarter/year. I knowingly pushed my team to work 7 days a week with only 5 day a week staffing for literally months to meet demands for a critical project. I don't regret it, because I know it saved lives. But goddamn would it be nice to have my team recognized beyond some extra money and a weak ""thank you"" for the fact that we made revenue for the quarter. Or alternatively, you know, authorize the correct fucking head count. Stop asking for what can be made with X number of headcount then expect 50% more than that. The game is fucking retarded. 

I was brought in partly because I know ""how to handle millennials"" but I am a fucking millennial. If there's one thing I know is that I'm telling the truth when I say what it's going to take to do a task. There's no fluff. I know my generations work ethic and what we can do. My team hasn't ever wavered from what I would expect. But the asshats above me think I'm padding the numbers and only provide a fraction of the ask then flip their shit when things don't go how they expect. For me, I keep calm and explain why they fucked up, but for my team it's hell. They want to do the right thing and take it personally when we don't stay on track with projections because they know that a batch lost/delayed is a treatment lost/delayed. In other words they fucking care about the right things.

I realize I'm fortunate to be where I am and I feel like a prick when I ask people for more when I know they're giving all they can. The stress of getting fucking chewed out every day about it makes me physically ill even before I get out of bed. The whole goddamn system is fucked and it only serves to leverage people's good will and ""mission"" oriented work ethic to enrich dirt-bag investors looking for a buyout. At the end of the day though, let's be real, I've been bought. My family will be well off assuming I can continue pushing people to do more with less. I hate myself for having the ability to do that even though, after you factor out cost, it's for a good cause.

Roast me if you want, I'm part of the problem. The choice is between my kids and you though, and I'll chose my kids every time. I hate myself for making healthcare more expensive but if that means my kids don't have to take on debt like I did I'll do that for them. This whole system is a zero sum game and I guess I'm winning despite wanting to literally vomit every day. I won't make myself a martyr and put in jeopardy my kids future. I'll keep cracking the whip and manipulating people into working more.

I gave up on my dreams to do soul crushing work for long hours I had to smoke or drink myself into oblivion but two weeks ago I quit using substances to avoid my pain I didn’t want to become an addict I didn’t want another chain holding me down. Since then all I have felt is the pain of the uncensored realization that I am lost. I have no real prospects, I’ve been trying to find a new job that pays me enough to live in my high COL area basically since I first started this job 3 years ago.

When asked why I cannot get more they blame costs and even mentioning seeing me on my phone during work hours even though I have valid work reasons to use my phone at work.

Why is it that the bottom line of your company can be scraped and scrounged and underpaid while the higher ups are paid well, the building is well maintained and rent is always paid up? Why is a business allowed to even exist before properly allocating an above-minimum wage to their employees? Why is minimum wage considered a high bar? Why should you be allowed to start a business if you can’t be bothered to consider paying your employees more than the literal bottom-of-the-barrel dollars that are leftover after everything else?

215,PSA: You don't have to be anti-capitalist to be anti-work,"We all know that capitalism is leading to more automation. This is good because it means humanity will one day be free from work. When this happens, we will have achieved Post-scarcity. We all agree this is where we're heading.

But when everything is automated and no one has jobs, how will people buy things? This is where we start disagreeing.

There's various schools of thought, but I'd like to explain how capitalists view post scarcity:

When adjusted for inflation, the cost of almost everything is decreasing over time thanks to market competition and more automation. As the cost to produce a good or service approaches 0, so does the price. And when the price of a product is 0, you won't need money to buy it. That product will then be ""post-scarce"". At this point, does it matter if the factory that produced this good for free is privately owned? Post-scarcity-capitalists argue that if capitalism can achieve post-scarcity, capitalism can maintain post scarcity.

That's the essence of post-scarcity capitalism. There's a lot more to it than that to cover the various edges cases such as how property taxes prevent a good or service from reach a 0 cost of production, but this is just a summary.",False,n0lbik,CommunismDoesntWork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n0lbik/psa_you_dont_have_to_be_anticapitalist_to_be/,24,1

223,Seeking Participants for a study on working-class people with advanced degrees.,"I am a doctoral candidate in the Communication Studies Department at Southern Illinois University Carbondale (SIUC).

I’m currently doing a study that has been approved by the Institutional Review Board at SIUC about working- and lower-middle-class academics who earned advanced degrees, and now work in the service industry or as adjunct instructors / non-tenure track faculty. The title of my project is, “Working-Class Academics and the Changing Financial Landscape of Higher Education.”

I am interested in interviewing people over the age of 19 who have an advanced degree (Master’s or PhD) in the humanities or liberal arts (broadly), who define themselves as having come from a working- or lower-middle-class background, and who now work either in the service industry or as adjunct instructors/non-tenure track faculty. For the purpose of this study, “working-class” is broadly defined as one who has to work for wages, and did not inherit wealth, and “lower-middle-class” broadly means the lower end of the average wages – based on family size, region, marital status, and cost of living at the time of consideration. Note that within these purposefully broad definitions, many income brackets could be considered “working-class” or “lower-middle-class.” If you are interested in learning more about the study, and possibly being interviewed, please send me a direct message here, or email me at ClassStudy@siu.edu. I would be happy to send you a more detailed description of the study, along with the details of an interview. Requesting more information is *not* giving your consent to participate.

Additionally, if you know someone else who might be interested in participating in this study, please pass this along to them and let them know to reach out to me as well at ClassStudy@siu.edu

When I got there things were really fine and it was possible to achieve the target, but now, they've started to hire a lot of new people and it is getting harder and harder. The work volume is the same, but we're like 30% more people in the company and it is really really harder to achieve the target. People have started to talk to each other and complain. The problem is that if you do not achieve it you will be penalised and they will cut your money. Whenever we bring this up with our manager, he just says that we should work harder, but that is not the solution, the problem is that they want more and more and their target is astronomical. I need to also add that we don't even have a salary, if you do not sell anything, even if you achieve the number of clients, you do not get anything from them. What do you think about this?

However, the boss expects us to take on so many projects that I, along with my colleagues simply don’t have the time to do any of it properly. I actually like doing a lot of my job, but the overloading leaves me with no other option than to half-ass as much as I can get away with just so I can complete what I’m asked to do.
I’m not quite happy with the quality of my work, but there’s nothing I could do about it. 

The boss also randomly adjusts my work schedule so that the time I get off work is often less than 12 hours till when I have to work again. 
I haven’t taken a vacation/sick day in months, and is on the verge of a burnout.

I'm being made to go through a credit check, which, possibly due to having been laid off with 3 days notice last year and trying to FEED MYSELF on minimum wage since then, came back poorly. So now, I get strung along waiting to see if some bureaucrat somewhere will dain to approve me for the job I have already applied, interviewed for, and been offered.

 I'm sure if their lawyers allowed them to say why, they would spout some horseshit about the credit check proving financial responsibility and try and tie that in with the fact that I would be dealing with confidential information (which I already do in my current position). My response to that, is since when does somebody's credit score reflect their morals or likelihood to do something illegal, like embezzle or steal? 

My credit score would be a whole lot better if I'd been shoplifting groceries, or made money by cooking meth. 

I really want to string them along, call in sick for my first week, then ghost them but this offer is the best option I have as my current contract is ending.

255,"I got into journalism because I thought a whole bunch of people should hear my opinions, and now I'm afraid to express them, lest they stop me from getting a job","It was spring 1998, and I was rather sick of how the media were portraying affirmative action. Not in the direction I now view it, and that remains the most execrable 50 inches I've written.

I branched out into page design and copyediting very quickly at my college paper. While getting one's opinion printed 15,000 times was fun (I remained a columnist as I went from designer to opinion editor to managing editor), framing societal discussion, through heds, story selection and placement, quickly became more appealing.

I was a computer science major at the time, but it was two days into training on newspaper design that I realized I didn't want to go there. Sure, one can change the world with the right few lines of code, but it was more efficient in the '90s to go the route of changing the system from within.

It likely didn't hurt that I was fucking my editor within a week. (Those clichés? Yeah ... they're there for a reason.)

I have zero net worth as a result of that single decision. Layoffs were frequent, and I was too naïve to see that this was an accelerating trend, not something that was going to go away. I was young and believed my calling would always be there for me.

If you've read my prior posts, you know that I finally achieved some semblance of stability, at the expense of being forced up the corporate ladder.

*If you take nothing else away from this, remember: Most of the people trying to change the world in journalism are the ones at the ground level. Some mean well and get fucked.*

The titular issue I now find myself in is the exact set of skills and characteristics that allowed me to start a career sans degree 20 years ago, with more than a few awards, now holds me back. Truth. Idealism. Looking out for that one person ill-treated by authorities. I never changed politics on the state level or higher, but I did change parking regulations at my university (and a few other things, but this isn't a humble-brag post).

Management doesn't that 20 years in. Hell ... they didn't even like my automation work because it rocked the system.

About which: The system is designed to reward conformity, which is why you see so many journalists end up in PR or working for officials. We're told to pay our dues with a later payout expectation, when some of us actually got into the field to effect positive change.

In 2003, some 18 months into my professional career (it's good to have a former senator own your paper in some cases), I had the opportunity to spend an evening on the desk at *The Washington Post*. I don't recall whether it was before or after changing A1 (I suspect ""before"") that I was talking with the AME/News and asked him if he missed just being a copyed.

261,1st time in 6 years where I felt like crying from work,"I work in a dangerous high stress profession, and since the pandemic began for some reason productivity has increased at least 10 fold. We went from five 8hour days to five 12-15 hour days. Everyone I work with is feeling similar stress. But at least had the weekends to look forward to. 

 Well today while we were working, our first line supervisor came and told us that everyone had to come in and work on the weekend. We all objected for different reasons. But the consensus was that, when we take our vacations we have to give a certain amount of time in advance, how is it they have the authority to make something mandatory with such short notice. Most of the guys I work with have kids and have struggled during the pandemic with school and daycare due to stay at home orders. Not to mention now people have to reschedule appointments and miss events they planned. Our 1st line supervisor explained that this order came from the superintendent, and because no one is volunteering for weekend overtime everyone has to come in.. Mind you our superintendent, works from home along with the rest of our upper management.

Hearing this news broke me, despite our protests he said those with children ""need to make arrangements, not showing up won't be tolerated"". 

Never in my life have I felt this defeated from the workplace. I had to walk away to not snap on the 1st line supervisor. It's like they forgot about the 60 hour work weeks we've been doing for the past year.

 I'd quit, but unfortunately I need this job. It pays well and I have 3 kids I have to provide for, so like many others we have to suck it up and just deal with it.

263,What's the point of living to work?,"&amp;#x200B;

Why am I alive? This thought tends to race through my head as I drive home from my new job nightly. I work my ass off for maybe 70-80 bucks so I can pay bills, eat food, sleep and then repeat it. I get no meaning out of my job, and even when I was working Jobs in my field I still felt entirely disconnected. So, why am I alive? The joy of life has run out. There is nothing I want to do, nothing excites me, and as I approach 30 I realize my goals/dreams where all fantasy. It seems the purpose of my existence is to work and nothing else. 

I try to explain my hatred for working like this with my coworkers but they don't understand. They are happy working for new unaffordable cars and potential houses and stuff. None of that excites me. A new car only perpetuates the lifestyle of debt and servitude. A new house would force me to live in a city I'm not even committed to. They become almost hostile when I explain how I feel trapped in the working class. ""That's just life, deal with it"" they usually say. But why? Why can't we all imagine a better system? is it so hard? I read once that It's easier to imagine the end of the world than it is the end of capitalism. Through talking to my coworkers I guess that's even more true than I realized. 

TLDR: I just don't understand what this is all for? I feel stuck working just to sustain working.",False,n0j91x,Ghostlyhero7,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n0j91x/whats_the_point_of_living_to_work/,22,1

266,“Nobody wants to work for our company because salaries in other companies are too high!” - Sh*tty Australian Recruiter,"oh + Edited - ©
2 offers declined, 3 final interviews canceled - since Monday!

I've recruited in this market for a very long time (yes, I'm an
old) but | have NEVER experienced candidates being offered
$ask-$ask above market rate for the SAME role. That do we
need to ask ourselves before we move for money?

1) Why is the company offering outrageous salaries? To they
struggle to recruit/retain people and if so, why?

2) That about current employees; Will their salaries move in
line with these new fires, if not how will companies deal with
the aftermath when this information gets out (believe me, it
will)

3) That about future recruitment? Surely this type of budget
will not be sustainable and then workloads increase due to not
being able to find staff for the proper budget - the person
with the high salary will have to take on this extra work!!

4) Will you price yourself out of the market? When the market
calms down and you want to leave that juice paying role, what
other companies can offer that salary - probably at a level you
are not qualified for !

Anyway, want over!! Of you want to work for a company that
prices itself on putting employees first, has a superb client
base, career progression and more importantly has fun, then

Millennials are so entitled”

Actually, the ‘you're welcome’/no problem’ issue is simply a linguistic
misunderstanding. Older pp tend to say you're welcome, younger pp tend to
May no problem. His is because for older people the act of helping or assisting
someone is seen as a task that is not expected of them, but is them doing
extra, so it’s saying I accept your thanks because | know I deserve it’

‘To problem’, however, is used because younger people feel not only that
helping or assisting someone is a given and expected, but also that it should
be stressed that you're need for help was no burden to them (even if it was),

Basically, older people think help is a gift you give, younger people think help is
an expectation required of them.

271,Tired of the Anxiety and Just Not Knowing,"I am working IT 18/hour at a primarily family run business. I got this job just a little over 5 months ago and it's been a central point of my anxiety since. Day one they didn't have my WFH set up and my boss had forgotten it was my first day. Hiring process is a shit show, watch a bunch of videos but they don't really have too much in mind for me. Slowly my boss gives me a few pretty meaningless easy tasks and some daily stuff. During this time Ive been mentioning to him that I feel like I'm struggling to understand a lot of things about the business but that just makes him insist that I need to work more and get familiarity, fair enough.


What he really meant was, ""I'm going to give you work that is going to be challenging and I will not be around very much, if at all to help, you should be asking your coworkers and if they don't know or can't help you're shit out of luck"". I mean it's not an unusual approach but man I feel so stuck. The most recent thing that got me fed up is a managerial report. It started off with me just clicking the button and emailing the report, but at one point it stopped reporting correctly. I've been sending this report to the president of another location so he calls me up and starts talking about the report and of course I have no clue what he's even talking about. This goes on for a few minutes I apologize a few hundred times and go on with my day. My boss ends up ""helping"" me fix the report (tell me what to type with minimal explanation).


Since then that report has gone to shit, I feel like the manager is just looking for little inaccuracies to make me stress, but I also doubt he has the time for that. So a few times a week he will say something is up with the report that needs fixing then once that is fixed, it's another thing. They are typically small issues, but I have so little understanding that it takes me atleast an hour each time. And then that just makes me feel guilty, that it's taking me so much time. So I'll spend the majority of my day just panicking more or less. 



At this point I don't know what to do. I wish I could tell my boss to fuck off and collect unemployment for a month or two to find something else but it's looking increasingly unlikely. I don't know what I want to do, I want to think I still enjoy technology, but it's really not enjoyable to be pushed my businessmen who I know don't care about me.  Every week I just try to get through the week so my anxiety will calm down and I can have an appetite again. I really just need a hug, it doesn't even make me feel any better than a lot of IT professionals struggle with this, just makes me feel like doomed to live the rest of my life like this unless I switch fields.",False,mzyazn,zRandomGuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mzyazn/tired_of_the_anxiety_and_just_not_knowing/,0,1
272,Am I wrong for wanting an alternative?,"I am halfway through my yearly internship for a public office. I have no holidays or sick days and I have never missed a day so far because I would have to work an extra day to get those hours back. My paycheck is 400 bucks per month but I get paid only once every 3 months so technically it's 1200 bucks and they technically still haven't payed me one extra month of work I did. My job is boring and stupid, I have been asked to do pointless stuff such as cleaning up my boss' desk or reorganizing all of his cables but most of the time I'm revising useless files on Excel or organizing Zoom meetings. I am not allowed to complain about how much I hate this because my family keeps yelling at me I should be thankful for the opportunity or better yet, ""be happy I get payed to do nothing"". 

What I want to do with my life is be a freelance illustrator like my ex art academy friends are doing, making a living as independent individuals and pursuing their passion. It works for them, but not for me, because according to my family I cannot do as I please. They treat me as if I was a kid or something, not a man in his late 20s.

This video made me sick for the fact that some people said they’re hard workers and just never deserve to be fired. They’re probably right, but just to see how much people put into a job that won’t do much for them, is sad. Then, older people say they’ve been at their company for 18 years or more and got fired in a heartbeat. Another person being denied a LOA for their dying mom. Jobs and employers don’t care about you. They really need you and then act like they don’t. It’s disgusting how our system works sometimes. 

After being in this subreddit, I’ve been more aware of why I had this constant feeling of never being a good member of society because I felt like I never wanted to work. Work has caused me years of anxiety in all different careers and I felt like I constantly put my sanity and care into my jobs instead of into me.

276,The perpetual discomfort zone,"How did entire generations of people get indoctrinated with the idea that when they feel comfortable, something is wrong, and that only when they are making a proactive choice to be uncomfortable is everything ok?

I mean, I know... it's a rhetorical question. But it's also a question I feel like screaming from the rooftops.

Feeling comfortable is the best thing in the world. Robbing people of one of life's few pleasures by telling them they should be fearful if they dare to enjoy a moment of non-pain is gaslighting on an unprecedented scale. ""Oh, but if you rest for a moment, little Johnny next door might get ahead"" goes the message, because *obviously* everyone is in perpetual competition, there is no one you can trust not to stab you in the back and solidarity is not only a thing of the past but the loser in the battle against capitalist success at any cost and history has already been rewritten to pretend it never existed.

What are we doing? What will it take for us to realize that when we get out there and grind ourselves into early retirement due to sickness in our 40s to turn little Johnny's unwise decision to have rest and recreation into our own career victory, we are simultaneously doing the exact same thing to ourselves - because when we do it, he starts doing it... when he starts doing it, we do it harder... when we're both doing it, the idea catches on and soon the world is doing it, and no nobody can rest even if they want to.

We're doing it to ourselves.

Stop.

""Who moved my cheese""-style ""you shouldn't expect shit to stay the same""-cum-""you shouldn't expect a company not to try and fuck with a deal you've already agreed""-cum-""when shit doesn't stay the same it's on you to tap your own resources to adapt to it"" is the training department's (remember those?) way of externalizing the costs of marketplace agility onto its own employees. The same way unpaid internships are about externalizing the costs of training new hires and young apprentice intake rather than investing in staff, because that way you can ax them when they start to get a bit old and start to break after the years you've overworked them without losing the investment you now didn't make in the first place.

And if any of them are bold enough to leave because of your inferior working conditions, your investment doesn't walk out the door with them because you conned them into funding the education they needed to do the skilled work you depend on all by themselves. Congratulations, you have now eliminated the business costs (and consequences) of overworking staff with zero regard for health and safety, and of treating them like shit along the way.

282,Anxiety,"I'm laying here in the middle of the night, my heart is pounding because I have work tomorrow. I know I need to sleep now to get up early but it's like a cycle... I keep thinking about it which doesn't let me sleep, which in turn makes me more anxious cause I'll be late for work... I try to distract myself but that's no good either, cause distracting myself for one hour becomes two and three hours just trying to lie to myself and extending the time I have before work and then I'm back at square one cause I'm anxious that I won't get enough sleep.

I hate my job, and I can't say this out loud, cause I know everyone's reply.. ""you're working in a great company.. you have a great salary.. jobs are hard to find now.. you should be grateful... you have a family to look after..."". I literally feel like I'm suffocating. 

I'm just so done with the corporate politics.. I'm so done of acting like I care about team building meetings and trainings. I hate that my manager makes people work so late and then just doesn't use what he asked for. 

I hate that I'm a mechanical engineer, that applied for a analyst job and now working in HR. God I fucking hate HR. And now I've spent so long doing this job and now I don't even think I can do anything else. I don't know what to do, and I don't know how I'll keep doing this for the rest of my life.

I can't take my leaves because I have so much shit that I'm responsible for cause everyone just dumps everything on me for some reason. I'm not saying I'm good, I'm saying I'm just easy to push around. I don't know when to say no because I can't handle confrontations, I literally cried in my car because of one. 

I went to a psychiatrist and a psychologist multiple times. Meds never helped, talking did nothing cause they never gave me a solution, just the usual bullshit of you having to give yourself the solution. If I knew the solution I would have been able to solve it a while ago.

291,How do you work under a completely insecure and incompetent supervisor?,"  I recently got a relevant gig to my studies and field. Its a public sector job and its riddled with bureaucracy, chain of command regulations, and incompetence. So many workers here have barely any clue what the job actually entails and are just trying to ""get to another day"", collect a paycheck / pension, and stay low in the trenches.   
  

So here i am, a bright shiny new hire thats not even a full month in, just doing my work, and already the shenanigans are starting to come my way. A little background, I was never a overachiever by any standards, but in regards to my work im really tight-waddy and i always try to put forth my best professional work. Apparently im learning the ins-and-outs of the system ""too fast"" as my instructor ( a different one is assigned to every new hire) was saying im outperforming all the other new hires. In the beginning, praise was heaped upon me ( ""wow youre done already? it took me a month to figure out that form"" etc.) to getting chewed out for missing even a period or comma on my reports. Understandably, it might just be rising expectations for me, but i honestly dont think its as simple as that. 

As we all grow up and work, we learn to not take things too personally in a office setting so i just acknowledge the mistake, correct it, and try to move on. However the supervisor above my instructor wasnt having it, they'd drill on the tiny mistake and make a mountain out of it, putting pressure on both me and the instructor. Eventually, even the instructor is now distancing from me as if i was radioactive since apparently i bring out the supervisors ire. I dont exactly blame him, but i see the writing on the wall already. If i throttle back my performance, it would give the higher-ups the ammo they'd need to discipline me, but if i continue on ill be stepping on more toes. I dont want to have to quit a job that took me so long to find, especially during these times, but Itd be a lie to say i wasnt gunning for a promotion or a higher position. I know i could outperform most of my peers and superiors, but im not a show-off about it, and mostly keep to myself.

I'm not a capitalist and I'm not a communist or a boomer before you start with the names. 

 At the end of the day, not everyone is capable or willing to put in the work to be an independent worker, someone who works for themselves, someone who creates an ethical business model. 

 I've worked with NPCs and real low IQ dummies who are quite content of doing a shitty repetitive boring jobs because they're good at it, get paid and gives them purpose. They can't do much else and nobodies going to pay you to sit around drinking.  I don't knock these people, I envy them in a way.

 Go through each and every question and give me an answer for each of the next few questions. The reason I ask these is because I know what the majority of you will answer and I don't believe majority are worth your salt. 

Why don't you want to work?

Why don't you get a better job?

Why don't you work for yourself?

Why don't you set up your own independent business?

Is money the main motivator?

If everyone was on universal benefits of your job title, what job would you do, regardless of experience you currently have?

What is stopping you from pursuing this in real life?

Would you pay someone to carry out this work if you had to hire someone in real life?

How much would you pay?

Would you be willing to sacrifice money for your dream job?

Would you live a low consumption lifestyle in order to facilitate independent living? 

Would you homestead and live off grid?

Would you buy the cheap t shirt for 10 dollars or the 20 dollar ethical t shirt?

Do you buy all ethical products?

Do you check if your products are ethical?

What would you do if you were middle-class? How would you cope being 
bourgeoisie?",False,n0iem2,socnatlib,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n0iem2/i_have_some_questions_and_answers_truthfully/,36,1

I've been depressed since i was at least 15 years old, and it has really gotten worse lately I really am extremely suicidal and doing very bad but everything my mom cares about is that I either find studies I wanna do or a job. I cant do any of that, I just am currently way too weak and I'd like to just. take time. for myself.

I’ve been working through a major life for the last few weeks (breaking up with a life partner - together 12 years and living together 5 of those).  On top of the personal stress of breaking up and moving during covid, my performance at work has been poor.  Despite repeated attempts to correct bad behaviors with the support of my company and manager, My performance has not improved and I am experiencing nearly daily mental breakdowns and anxiety/panic attacks.  I am also not able to sleep for more than 3-4 fitful hours a night.  At this stage I strongly believe quitting will be to the benefit of everyone.  I won’t experience the intense stress and anxiety just the thought of logging on to my work station brings and my company can get someone in to do my role with more consistency and success than I.

319,I made a list of Antiwork Tips &amp; Tricks based on my most miserable days of work. Hope it helps make your days better :),"**long post but I appreciate those who read :)**

**Core Belief** - You are ALWAYS expendable in a job. As soon as you inconvenience the smoothness of the capitalist money machine, you’ll be replaced. Always remember this when making any decision regarding work, and consider the worth of the choice. 

**Golden Rule** - This has been mentioned a lot, but I’ll still repeat it. Do the bare minimum for the longest amount of time that is acceptable to keep you earning your paychecks, while trying not to screw over your coworkers. Don’t push it to the point you’re fired, but don’t be afraid to try it out to make your workdays more bearable. After all, a “job” is just a middle man between your work and your reward. A middle man that screws you over. You never see the true fruits of your labor because it all goes to the rich and they throw the apple cores, banana peels, etc. back to you.

**Tips &amp; Tricks**

These are just things that I’ve noticed throughout some of my working days that have helped me survive mentally, it’s not to make you LIKE work, it’s made to help relieve the soul crushing stress of it. What has worked for me may not work for you, and vice versa. This is intended to help get you through your working days until you’re ready to start living off grid, or whatever ways you intend on living as far away from the system as possible.

**#1**: ALWAYS* stimulate your mind before work, or even during the first 30 minutes of your shift if you have a job where you don’t get screamed at for pulling out your phone. This means skipping out on that 5-10 minute morning stress fap. Try not to do the same exact things during your morning routine. Instead, try spending 5-10 minutes learning about something new. Basically, introduce yourself to something that you can think about for the rest of the day. This could be literally anything. Learn about investing. Learn about subjects you were always interested in as a kid. It could even be related to video games; think about strategies you can use to beat that boss you’re still stuck on because it keeps dealing 1000 damage to you near the end of the battle.

**#2**: This coincides with #1. Never focus fully on the work at your job. This is something I’ve been doing even back when I worked at fast food. I would always be focusing on personal things. “How am I going to beat Yukiko’s boss fight later tonight?” “What should be the next special thing I do for my girlfriend?” “I wonder how much extra money I should save for the modifications on our camper van.” Always keep positive, thought provoking ideas running through your head at every point possible, especially during the brain dead rush hours. It keeps my brain more focused on the good things outside of my job. Even though I have severe depression and have been through some of the worst shit imaginable as a kid (child abuse, molested, bullying for years, etc.), there’s things I’ve learned to see positively outside of work. I know firsthand it’s possible to be negative your whole life, hating the planet and everything on it, and still learn to see the positives and mature mentally. 

**#3**: *Always* prioritize personal things while at work at any point possible in a manner that doesn’t put you at risk of being fired. You know where this post you’re reading is being made? A car wash. I’m clocked in, prioritizing writing this list over my work while listening to Persona music. I have 4 cars waiting outside. I don’t care. Unless they’re customer cars, in which case I work a little faster because I don’t want to inconvenience them. You know what else I’ve done? Spent 30 whole minutes doing research on things I was thinking of investing in while clocked in. Ate my lunch while clocked in. Made most of my antiwork posts while clocked in. Fuck, I played Skyrim so long on my switch one day that I went from level 10 to level 17 uninterrupted while clocked in. Played Smash Bros with some childhood friends while clocked in. Fuck, I’ll even admit I masturbated in the bathroom (cleaned up of course) while clocked in one day because I finished my book and was bored.

**#4**: Say “no” more often. “Hey Jim, can you come in today?” “no. But thanks for offering”. The second part is obviously fake, but if you have an off day, just say no. You don’t have to explain yourself. You were scheduled for an off day. Fuck them. Enjoy your humanity and your free time. 

**#5**: Try to make your call ins before or after an off day, and do it when you can *afford* it. If you did it every time you simply *wanted* to, you’d be doing it every week and get fired. Having multiple days off back to back is fucking euphoric. In the case of people like me, you’d be getting 3 off days back to back. The best excuse I’ve been able to find for calling in so far has been bad diarrhea. Example: “Hey, I’m not going to be able to make it in today, I woke up with really bad diarrhea and I’ve been stuck on the toilet for 30 minutes this morning.” You might also want to add that you’re feeling feverish. 

**#6**: For every minute you spend *actually* using the bathroom, spend an additional minute using your phone. If someone comes into the bathroom and actually needs to use it (if you have limited stalls), of course be polite and get out. But otherwise, enjoy the extra few moments of taking back your time. 

**#7**: This is specifically for fast food jobs, and it’s limited to the devices you have. In most of them, they typically force you to use headsets. Mandatory for the drive through cashiers, and it’s like 50/50 mandatory for the food workers. If you’re a food worker, what I personally did at my fast food jobs is go to the bathroom shortly after putting on a headset, hang it around my neck as I’m walking to the bathroom, and then slipping in an AirPod before I go back to work and turning on shuffle music with the headset at low volume and covering the AirPod. It’s risky depending on your location and the behavior of the management there, so this is one that I’m not *telling* you to start doing. It’s an idea I’m offering, and it’s up to you to decide if the risk would be worth it and if you want to do it or not. An earbud obviously wouldn’t work - the wire would give it away, so you’d need any kind of wireless earbud. 

**#8**: Take antiwork breaks. Come to this Reddit and just vent about things and rant about your job. For me, it helps me a lot mentally and improves my mood the rest of the day. I do it all the time while clocked in. Literally earning money while shit talking your job.

**#9**: This is for outside of work, your “free time” as they call it, even though you don’t get much of it. It can get really hard to actually enjoy your literal human existence when you’re slaving away 40+ hours a week, and can even make you anhedonic. Anhedonia was another factor that lead to my first suicide attempt, and I suffered from it for a long time, but I eventually started learning how to combat it after recovering.

**a**: Sounds cliche, but try new things and find new hobbies. This is coming from a person who was starting to believe the whole world was meaningless. There really is something out there for everyone. For me, I started finding a huge interest in learning how to cook, trying new recipes, and trying new food or new variations on old foods almost all the time. Also, reading.

**b**: If the things you’re doing are starting to seem boring, or you feel yourself losing interest, move to something new. Sometimes I’ll be at my house playing a game and find myself thinking that I’m only playing it to pass the time. When this happens, I save and close it and move to another game. I do this to try to find the right game for my current mood where I can get invested in the story, atmosphere, character development, etc, and am fully enjoying it rather than to just “fill the void”. Sometimes, I can’t find the right game, or none of my games sound good at the moment. What I do then is turn off my console/PC, and go for a bike ride or drive around and relax listening to music (if I have extra gas money), then come home and cook something. 

Aaaaand that’s it for now. If I think of more I’ll add it in the comments. Thanks for reading. Remember, think of the future. Think of the returns on your investments. Think of the days you’ll be ready to go off-grid. For those that don’t want to resort to off-grid, think of the days ahead when enough of us wake up and revolt worldwide for better conditions and compensation for workers. We are the lifeblood of these companies after all.",False,n0ime7,Fetrospec,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n0ime7/i_made_a_list_of_antiwork_tips_tricks_based_on_my/,22,1

I understand that. I really do. I try my hardest to stay busy outside of working hours and keep interested in my passions, as well as stay in touch with family and friends. I even started playing basketball again.

349,Performance Review Knocked Some Sense Into Me,"I've been browsing this sub for a while and always agreed with the general sentiment. Admittedly I was thinking all this while still saying 'I love my job'. Well, after my most recent performance review at work, I realized it's all a fuckin scam.

\--

Had a normal performance review with HR. Honestly, I am doing excellent in this position. I am literally the only person in my role. I am highly educated, experienced, and have glowing reviews from upper management. This is also a well established NGO with good income. So, ofc, I want to get a raise to match my output. 

During the meeting management straight up said 'there is no monetary raise for this position' when I asked about career progression. Keep in mind we live in a high COL area and I'm already making below the current minimum average for my city in my particular field too. 

I was then ALSO told, 'this role is one of the only full time positions in the company' and 'so many other part time employees would kill to have a full time role like yours\*'.

\*To be clear, in my country full time positions are **legally mandated** in which the company must pay an employee's healthcare, pension, and unemployment. It is also a bit difficult to fire a full time person. Part time workers must enroll in national healthcare/pension and pay out of pocket. However, full time positions are the norm even in NGOs. 

Then to make it super obvious that I am valued, when I asked about HR providing me goals to bEtTeR ComMit tO thE COmPAny, they said 'we would like you to create brand guidelines for the entire company to make us more cohesive'. This was then quickly followed by, 'for example, if someone were to step into your role how would they get started'.

So essentially, I'm lucky to have a full time position because if they *legally could* they wouldn't give a fuck about me and easily replace me with a starving part time worker.

Ever since that review I've been putting in the same amount of effort that they pay me for. Fuck all yall.",False,n0nxim,Intelligent_Idea3197,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n0nxim/performance_review_knocked_some_sense_into_me/,9,6

351,Can bosses and coworkers gaslight you?,"Not a rhetorical question, I genuinely don't know. I worked for a local restaurant during the pandemic and at first it seemed great. They projected that the staff was a family and since we only had seven workers it seemed cool, especially because my boss would work along side me during my shifts. 

But as things went on the staff got bigger and somehow no work was getting done. I was a cook, but I was also a server and bagger, and a dish washer and deep cleaner. The worst was that I would come in three hours early just to get a head start on my prep, I either had to come in early or leave late because my boss complained that I wasn't doing my job. They said I had an attitude problem and my boss cut an entire work day out of my schedule, cutting my already minimum wage pay in half because I would miss the day I worked the most hours.

My last there I had a 1 on 1 with my boss and he said that my assistant manger, who also was a cookb and a friend from high school, could do all this easily and that he didn't understand my problem. He said he cut my hours for my mental health and that I seemed different from when I joined the ""team"". A coworker said similar things when I tried discussing it with him during closing and he said that I was just imagining the issues. 

I am nothing familiar with the term gaslighting or any form of manipulation, intentional or not, but I know when I put my two weeks in for this job I felt terrible. I would wake up dreading my day to come, think terrible thoughts all shift long, and fight the urge to cry on the way home; but I still felt like I let down my coworkers and boss because I thought we were all friends. I put my two weeks in on the first day of my shift and was told I may lose a day or two in the coming weeks to train another person, but after that week I was removed from schedule. 

I just found this thread and it validated the thought that is haunting me right now: Is it supposed to be this hard? Am just a lazy, arrogant",False,n0qd4z,InfamousJake27,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n0qd4z/can_bosses_and_coworkers_gaslight_you/,5,1

357,I consistently feel guilty about leaving at 5pm with WFH,"I feel like I have an issue where I genuinely care too much about my job despite being provided with evidence that I am highly replaceable. This doesn't necessarily mean that I'm out here busting my ass at work, but does make me feel some level of anxiety for not working as hard as I possibly can.


I've always been work from home at this job. Got hired during pandemic and they haven't mentioned going back for my team yet. When I was hired, I was told that I work ""like 8-5"". There's an hour lunch in there (which I typically send stressing if someone is trying to reach me). Now I work from home so I really haven't talked to many of my coworkers extensively. The main person I've talked to is an older woman, Jan. Jans worked here for 20 years and worked from home before pandemic because of family illness. She's also the only other hourly employee that I'm aware of at my level. Now she takes naps on her lunch and then just worked until she's tired and I'm starting to feel like the same is expected of me. No one ourwordly says it, but I kind of always feel like more can be done and my employer won't be satisfied until everything is done which is unachievable goal for multiple reasons.



Really not sure how to sit with this because I don't want to be working until 7 or 8 every night, but also I want to not feel useless at work because I feel like long term that will lead to more fulfillment than doing the minimum. It feels like there is no compassion, no one wants to hear if I'm having a rough time recently they just want more work done. I've thought about just shifting my mindset to completely on the grind during the week and not even attempt to enjoy myself, but that really doesn't feel like a way I want to live, although possible.",False,n0naqz,zRandomGuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n0naqz/i_consistently_feel_guilty_about_leaving_at_5pm/,6,1
358,Our secret weapon is you!,"So I’m a GM and yesterday I was on a regional conference call with dozens of other GMs our bosses boss was talking. “Now we know there’s a staff shortage nationwide- we have this specialist (we paid lots of money) to tell us how to retain new hires! Our special secret is you. Remember people don’t quit jobs, they quit bosses!”

Corporate: “Running on a skeleton crew this year made us realize? Your labor costs can be cut in half. You can do the job with half the employees. Pay them pennies. They like it. Work them to death. Maybe your environment isn’t fun enough? Let’s buy your staff appreciation baskets. How about $5 hot and ready pizza once a month? Yeah! Good idea. Poor people love cheap ass pizza.  No.. no.. keep them at minimum wages. That one employee can do the job it used to take three employees! Why did they quit?.... It’s your fault as GM for staff shortages. People don’t quit jobs, they quit bosses! You now have to work the floor and do your GM duties. You’re salary. You can work 80 hours a week and get paid for 40- you don’t need a day off. Work/ life balance is key. We give you two weeks PTO. Wait you want to use your PTO? We don’t have anyone to cover your time off. Sorry. You used to have an AGM, but you did such a great job we fired all of them and now the GM is also AGM. Congratulations on a job well done! Sorry no 401k matching anymore we’re in a pandemic. Our profits have been mind blowing. Third party and mobile orders are up 300%. No ones coming in your restaurant what are you doing all day? It’s not safe to be in the building alone. You need to come in early and leave late to make sure we’re EcoSure ready to pass. Oh and if we want to we can easily replace you at any time for someone willing to take less pay!

371,I’ve lost my faith in humanity.,"Everyone is so worked focussed, and I really can’t see the reason, why that is. Yesterday I watched a documentary and the topic was China in general the evolution and new technology.

I scrolled through the comments, and many people wrote, wow how work focussed they are amazing. And they all seemed to love the way, they are working more than the average guy in european countries for example 9 hours.

I don’t know, it’s just weird. Everybody keeps telling me, look for a job that you’ll love and you wouldn’t have to work your life anymore. 

Literally I have really nothing, where I would say: “Oh yeah, that’s sooo good I love it and I would do it for 60 years of my fucking life just to survive”, no. The other issue is, that you can’t really look for a job that you would like, because somewhere you have to live, I mean move to another place every year wtf? Or even move one time, but you can’t be 100% certain, that you really wanna work there your whole life.

It’s just so fucked up. And then imagine, there are people which do nearly nothing in the day and they don’t have to worry about anything. Why was I born in those times or why do I even exist?

I’m starting to hate life, so I mean I can say I really never enjoyed life, but I hate it more and more, because we live in the 21. Century, and what we have archived?

373,Getting hit by a car was the best thing to happen to me in recent times.,"I work 10 hour days in a 5x5 cubicle at a job with bosses who don't respect me and customers who must make it their days goal to see me break down. Where i work there's an employee parking garage across the street from the building. I was running late for work and was rushing to clock in on time (cause you know I totally control traffic) and was crossing the crosswalk when a car didn't make a full stop and struck me.

This hellscape of a job must have screwed with my head cause I stood up and brush myself off and when the guy who hit me stopped to see if I was okay I said ""Sorry, I gotta clock in!"" Luckily someone else who was also running late saw this and was able to tell me boss (because you just KNOW that it still would've been an unexcused lateness otherwise).

I went to a private care place so they could refer me to the ER. If I went to the ER first without going to my insurance's preferred healthcare place first, they wouldn't have covered it. Luckily I'm fine, just bruised up.

But I got some days off work and let me just tell you guys... its amazing how much better my mental health has been the past couple days. Not having to worry about the overly high standards my bosses put on me, not having to about customers screaming at my face, not having to worry about the commute, getting to catch up on some shows I wanted to watch, getting to make a home cooked meal...

378,Being abused at work,"TW: antisemitism, neo-nazis, abuse. Let me know if there’s anything else I missed

I don’t even know where to start. 

I’m 26 and a public librarian. I have a Master’s in Library and Information Science, with a concentration in archives. I graduated from my Master program in December and was hired full-time with benefits as a Library Assistant, a paraprofessional role which doesn’t even requite a Master’s degree, in early March. It’s a 30 mile commute on a busy interstate, 60 miles in aggregate every day. This job pays poverty wages, but I’m lucky that I got this job at all, especially a full-time one with benefits.

My manager is functionally illiterate and is a neo-Nazi. She sobbed and threw a hissy fit when I was hired because she didn’t want to work with a lesbian Jew. She had a literal tantrum in the library, sobbing hysterically and rolling on the floor. Still, despite this, the supervisors STILL put me under her. From the first moment I started this fucking job, this woman has been peddling her alt-right ideals, trying to force me to read Mein Kampf not once but TWICE because I’m “Jewish and will understand.” She has also told me how she wants a Turning Point USA chapter in the library and how George Floyd died of a meth overdose. This was all in my first HOUR of employment, by the way.

Then, the abuse got worse.

She would trap me and continue pushing her alt-right beliefs down my fucking throat, trying to force me to comply. She told me how she wants to “take down” our branch manager, a Black woman. She used me as her therapist and told me every single triggering detail about her life. Like, I asked her a week after I started work how her weekend was and her response was to tell me about this duper triggering thing which happened to her, no provocation whatsoever. When my jaw fell open, she CONTINUED and gave me explicit details as to this event.

This all culminated in her forcing me at work to read this batshit fucking “diary”/novel she’s been writing about how Jesus and the archangels love her and all want to fuck her and she is G-d’s special child and has been put on this earth to root out demons, aka anyone who disagrees with her. It’s also all about her divorce and how she abused her husband and how his mental illness is “demonic.” She stands over me as I am forced to read this at work or else she’ll give me a bad review.

I am at my wit’s end!

Finally, with support from a coworker/friend, I reported what was happening to admin. They said that they’ve wanted my manager gone for a long time since she is terrible at her job and cannot spell or write—and she’s the HEAD OF THE CHILDREN’S DEPARTMENT. They told me that they wanted ME to become manager, flat out.

Anyway.

Since we’re county employees, this had to go to HR. They tried to rework the schedule so I wouldn’t be near this white supremacist, but before I submitted my report I had to be. On our last day together, she tried to force me to look up Christian lit for this man who refused to wear a mask in the library (she also refuses to wear a mask), even though the desk where I was working does NOT do reference at all. She wants to convert me.

Anyway, HR refused to fire her since, of course, this woman’s family has millions and their own private jet. Though this woman can barely fucking write at all, she had her sister, a lawyer, write her rebuttal for her for HR and because this is a conservative as fuck county, they were sympathetic to my manager. We had a fucking LGBTQ+ bulletin up in the library and one person complained so the county commissioner threatened to fire the entire library unless we took it down. But this woman trapping a Jew in her office and demanding that she reads Mein Kampf? That’s fine!

My manager was demoted and moved to another library in the county, but she’s still there and I’ll still have to see her.

The branch manager now loves me and tells me that she still wants me to be manager, but it the optics don’t “look good” and my former manager may fucking lose it if she finds out. 

I’ve only been at this job a month btw :)

Anyway, my local county suddenly has 34 vacancies in its library due to bad management but it pays DOUBLE what I’m making right now and I need to get out of here. I’d be going from one abusive s(h)ituation to another, though. But, I can’t leave because then I forfeit health insurance and my income. I wish I could be unemployed right now and just take time before a new job but I can’t. I can’t. I also may still become the manager. I have no fucking idea.

Oh, and the best part? The library is about to open FULL TIME again even though the only people who come in are antimaskers for the most part. The county just doesn’t want us to stay home and be safe.

My mental health is so shot. This has been literally a traumatizing experience for me. I was already anti-work but I felt so lucky to have found a job in my field and I do love my job and my coworkers so, so much. Genuinely. But, I can’t even leave for my own mental health. I have to MAYBE find another job to get out of here, and the only viable jobs right now are ones that also have horrendous management.

I just want out. I want to feel safe. Even with my former manager no longer at our library, having her still in the system makes me frightened beyond measure. I’m an out lesbian too and I live with my partner of many years, who is masculine. I’m very petite and feminine. I’m frightened for my girlfriend’s safety, too. This is so intense that I even had to take my address off of official work documents so my manager wouldn’t find them and sic some sort of alt right group on us.

I hate this. I just want out. But leaving means no health insurance during a pandemic. Leaving means no income. Fuck!",False,mzreur,elanarana,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mzreur/being_abused_at_work/,19,1
379,I just promoted myself to manager,"Long story short, I work in IT (cloud) for my local governement. Recently my very competent boss left and to replace her they hired this women who's really nice but completely clueless. She has no idea what we're even doing, I shit you not. In fact, she doesn't even know why she's here herself. So I get this meeting with her and she pretty much ask me what are my responsibilities and what I do here. I seize the opportunity and tell her that I'm pretty much the manager, adding that she can come to me when she has questions and I'll show her what to do. She was pleased with that response and thanked me, after which I gave her a project to work on for now. Told the rest of the team I'm now the new head by interim. Now, only thing left was to make it official, so I get an invite to the management meeting using my contact and just add it to my team's calendar. I show up and the director above (who hired this women) looks puzzled, he ask me why I'm here and where's Karen (not her real name).

380,"I’m being “let go” for not making enough calls, even though I hit 337% of my sales target","**How does that make any sense?**

I’m really frustrated right now and have pretty much lost faith in all big corporation and sales type jobs. 

I work in sales and I was put on a PIP (performance improvement plan) 3 months ago because I took a lot of PTO which ended up affecting my 3 month rolling avg in sales - *which I think is totally absurd how they are holding me accountable for work I didn’t do while I was on vacation* - but anyways 3 months have passed and I have more than tripled my sales target that they had set for me.

Now, they are looking at letting me go because I didn’t make enough calls... how does that make any sense? I’m being punished for having a high close rate and making the company way more money than I was tasked with.

What it really boils down to is in their eyes, I’m so efficient and good at what I do that they expect me to perform at that pace and have a much higher workload during my 40 hours/week, thus making them even more money. If I can triple the output of someone else’s 40 hour week in just 20, why would I want to keep overworking myself? I mean, part of my success strategy is taking it easy and keeping my work flow very stress free and they are basically saying F that and hitting me with a metaphorical whip of **“WORK HARDER!!! MAKE US MORE MONEY YOU FOOL!!!”**

I’m seriously fed up with how companies have treated me in the past and every day I’m one step closer towards just giving up and working as a gardener or something.

426,Book that fosters a one-world system built on a mutualized law and tax discrimination based on natal astrological factors. The lazy don't have to work if their Mars position warrants it.," **In the book, ""Ares Le Mandat"" every human is relegated to the influence of the planet Mars. (Mars is said to influence low grey matter volume distribution in the brain) This influence manifests differently amongst the human population. Mars influences some to be antagonistic to different groups, others to be antagonistic to different individuals. It influences some to be antagonistic to change and others to stagnancy. It's all laid out in 6 different categories and allows for a wider perspective of the human condition, thus opening the door to understanding and improvisation. This construct allows the individual to navigate through life accordingly, adjusting his own behavior to the situation he faces.... catering to the human archetypes in his space according to the Mars number they wear.** **The construct is called ""Mars 360""**

**Mars 360 is a formulated and hypothesized global social accord ideally operable under the same principle as the Paris Climate Accord, which attempts to integrate all nations into a common cause without undermining national sovereignty. The Mars effect on human behavior inclines each individual toward certain predispositions that lend itself to fundamental outlooks which carries with it... a high degree of inflexibility. This inflexibility plays itself out in various political and social stances like socialism, pacifism, capitalism, liberalism, conservatism, libertarianism, etc, but is actually the result of Mars's permanent influence on the human brain. This gives rise to the idea that while certain stances are different in external display, they are at the same time fundamentally backed by the same source(to varying degrees of course)....which is Mars.**

**Because of this, discrimination based on Mars factors can be applied to law and taxes in such a way that no one would object. Those born under a Mars position that affects the person to display more capitalist tendencies would be given more leniency on taxes. Those born under a Mars position that causes restlessness tendencies would be given less restriction on travel. Those born under a Mars position that causes some laziness tendencies would be less required to work. Etc etc. Leniency is tailor-made to the person. Freedom of speech would only apply to those whose Mars position would warrant it.**

**This system unites the world essentially by building connections based on a number. Under Mars 360, a person is either(because of Mars's influence in their astrological natal chart)**

1. **a Mars-1 which describes someone who is poor in face to face communication and charity(conservative)**
2. **a Mars-2 which describes someone who is poor in mood, listening, relationships etc.(conservative/leftist)**
3. **a Mars-3 which describes someone who is poor in bodily maintenance and being still(Libertarian/Leftist)**
4. **a Mars-4 which describes someone who is poor in indirect speech and discipline(Conservative nationalist)**
5. **a Mars-5 which describes someone who is poor in work habits/lifestyle/dealing with authority(communist)**
6. **a Mars-6 which describes someone who is poor in maintaining personal appearance and facial regulation(liberal)**

**Lets say a person in China wears ""3"" signifying a Mars-3, and a person in Australia also wears a ""3"", then those two are connected via personal characteristic regardless of the other factors which separate them like race, nationality, religion, etc. This keeps the archetypes in the same framework. An example of why this is necessary can be found by simply looking at the political situation in the US. You have instances where the archetypes of different racial/nationality/ethnic/creed but same Mars influence are inadvertently working against each other instead of together. Mars 360 fixes this conundrum.**

**The author uses an ancient method to claim credibility for this outlook of Mars influence.** **Since the author of the book ""Ares Le Mandat"" lacks credentials or pedigree as a non-fiction writer, he is able to solidify his Mars hypothesis by being able to successfully detect the escalation of rocket fire from Gaza into Israel relative to the rest of the year. This is done in Chapter 52, which contains the prediction results and stats for the year 2020 as it was done in real time. It also contains the future dates of expected rocket fire escalation from Gaza into Israel. The escalation was tied to the position of the planet Mars in relation to the lunar node. Since Mars is described throughout the book as having an influence on human life on earth, the author is able to gain credibility the ancient way--prophecy and by demonstrating in real time how observing Mars can forecast escalation events in Israel. At the moment rockets are being fired into Israel under the same astrological configuration used to to predict the 2020 rocket fire escalation period--that is Mars being within 30 degrees of the lunar node.**

427,Workers on the Pyramids,"Sometimes I think of the Egyptian pyramid building or the Great Wall building, and how all those slaves and workers became cogs and ants - all the people who could have made music or written philosophy or enjoyed life became just people who lifted heavy objects and worked to build something in which they had no stake. And I think of what I know now - these ways to create PPT presentations or work computer software or know to press X to get Y. How I can work steadily for 5 hours but the remaining 3 are often there because we're supposed to work 8 hours. And then breathe at the end of the day and maybe have enough time to come back to myself and what I am and dreamed - trying to remember that time when I used to write poetry or create fiction.

432,We live in an era of absurd ambitions,"I’ve been reading *A Job to Love* to figure out what I’m going to do with my life. No answers, but the book does make an excellent point that stuck with me—our modern expectations of success are historically, weirdly inaccurate.  To quote:

""Modernity never ceases to emphasize that success could, somehow, one day be ours.  Yet there is unwitting, exhausting cruelty in this narrative…the data is clear that only a very few of us will succeed. And yet, despite all the evidence…\[modernity\] has made the ideal the norm and internalized the burdens of failure.""

Those who work in predictions have a rule for guessing outcomes:  the first step is to get a baseline range of results based on similar cases.  The baseline for estimating the likelihood of success, for most of us, comes from media that only shows us success stories (as opposed to, as the book points out, Greek tragedies from eras past).

I did virtually nothing on my vacation because I spent those precious two weeks off resting. I’m on day 6 and my body is in so much pain, I can’t even stand up straight. On top of that, I was also told I had to attend a leadership meeting in the district to discuss culture and personal development... right after I got back from a mental health leave.

445,Work Turns Your Virtues Against You,"You want to be useful. A contributing member of society! To give back, and quiet the shame of idleness that's been instilled so deep in your being you think you were born with it. So you work, any work, no matter how underpaid, degrading, dangerous. Often the works ""contribution to society"" is dubious at best. In many cases it's utterly pointless. Sometimes it's harmful, to you and to society at large. But you need it, for your survival and to avoid the scorn of a society that can't see any other way.

So you keep working

Even if the work itself is useless, of no purpose, you want to help people. You're hard-wired as a human to serve the good of the tribe--but the tribe no longer exists. Your inherent altruism leads you to aid your coworkers wherever you can, sacrificing time on your own work, leaving you to put in extra hours. The company lauds your team spirit, but the celebration stops there. Why go further? They have hijacked your solidarity, corrupted it into more work for the same pay. The pay you still need, no matter that you are now working even more time for it.

Just a little longer, and maybe it will get better.

You can't do it anymore. You've burned at both ends, the wick is ashes. There's no midnight oil left. BU if you leave, all your drudgery left undone must be divvied up. The ""many hats"" you wear will be slapped on other heads, already as overburdened as you are now. The idea of a job undone gnaws at you. The stigma of quitting dredges up shame from your deeps. Foisting your hardships onto others feels unethical, immoral, maybe a little evil.

You stay.

Restructing. Redundancy. Lay-off. RIF. All the pretty words to dress up shoving you a notch closer to destitution. They're thankful for your contributions, but not that thankful. You sacrificed time, health, wealth, life, but they will not offer up even one for you. ""They"" cannot, because they're the same as you. Animate puppets of a force without conscience or feeling that can only eat and grow endlessly or die trying. From the beginning, what they gave you was grudging.

471,The story of John Henry has become capitalist propaganda and kind of racist but we can save it,"Now I know the origins of this story comes from the actual workers on the rail road and it has been used as communist propaganda to glorify the time before industrialization. I get that, I did my research before posting. But now, in the modern context the classical story of John Henry has some serious problems with it. In the end it's the story of a big strong black man who is really good at manual labor and wants to do a dangerous, back breaking work for white people and died fighting to keep performing this godawful job once a safer and more efficient way to do this job was invented. Again, I understand that when it was first created it was essentially a protest against these terrible working conditions and how once the workers were no longer needed they were tossed aside. But now it has been fully consumed by the capitalist system and remade to fit their needs.

However, I don't think John Henry should just be abandoned, but it needs to be reworked as it have multiple times in the past in order to fit the needs of the present. Instead of being proud of his work Henry should hate it and resent that he and his fellow workers have to do it, often under threats of violence. So in response Henry designs the steam drill in order to reduce the amount of work people have to do, but he realizes that he can't just give the company he works for this invention because they will just abandonee his fellow workers to poverty. But while Henry tries to figure out a plan to make sure his invention actually improves the lives of workers, a class traitor steals his design and sells it to the company with no strings attached. Seeing this and hoping to save the lively hoods of his fellow workers, Henry challenges the class traitor to the famous contest, only this time Henry deliberately causes a cave-in in order to destroy his drill. 

So what do you think? Do I have point? Or am I full of shit? Should the story of John Henry be changed? And if so how do you think it should be changed?",False,mz6mif,Revolutionary9999,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mz6mif/the_story_of_john_henry_has_become_capitalist/,12,1

475,The most absurd and outrageous interview question of the modern age: Employer “Why did you quit your job without having another job to go to?”,"*WARNING RANT AHEAD*

Just this question alone....ARGGHHH!! I get so angry even thinking about it, there’s just so much wrong with it!! I get fired up when I think about the time I was asked it. It was 2017 (from the UK here) and I quit my previous dead end psychotic abusive retail job (specsavers in case you guys wondered) where there were 8 managers for one tiny optical shop and every second of your day was monitored and accounted for (yeah you could see what would happen there). It was just an utter hell, I was borderline alcoholic and addicted to drugs just to cope with it and make myself be able to wake up for another day in the hellhole and I would rather be dead than endure that again and that’s no joke. 

Anyhow kind of ranting, so in desperation to get others off my back (it had been less than 24 hours since I quit and some family members were already grilling me about getting back into another shitty retail or service sector job without even asking if I was ok) so I went back out there already still in an utter mess both physically and mentally. I applied in desperation to a pawn shop style electronics chain store called cex here in the UK.

Got a job interview, the store manager and some some stuck up kid much younger than me claiming to be some master mind sat me down (I wanted to leave already because of this guy let alone the bully vibe the store manager already reeked of but I just went with it) so below and behold it was your typical retail interview and I just let it run by not really caring much at all getting asked stupid questions like “what’s the latest this that and the other” over 10 times. 

Then it drops. That bombshell question. “Why did you quit your previous job without having another to go to?” I just sat there for a moment and then well...I lost it. 

I let out a massive scream and shouted so angrily at the store manager swearing and everything (unprofessional I know but I was already at breaking point) I basically said something along the lines of “I was mentally abused and bullied by higher ups like you and had my mental and physical health damaged from this job and you seriously have the nerve to demand why I didn’t want to go straight into another job?” The kid tried intervening but soon backed down and I just stormed out. 

It all worked out for me in the end because my uncle took me in and let me rest it out for a while before I got back on the horse and things are back on track in life again but this experience is just something I needed to get off my chest.

480,Social inequalities are a product of Capitalism,"The concept of poverty is constantly emphasized through quantitative rather than qualitative data. For example, the amount of material goods a person owns, or their annual income. It was only with the advent of the modern era that poverty was now seen as a quantitatively defined element on the basis of a monetary income threshold. Until recently, poverty was seen in a much more subjective or relative way.

My boss has the tendency to publicly announce my mistakes to everyone in the room but casually disregard his own mistakes or unpreparedness.

Almost everyone in the office knows the type of front he is portraying. 

The turnover rate in my office is immense. Most employees do not last more than a year with him. I'm almost certain he has narcissism on some level. Today, I passed around a card with horses on them and wrote instructions to not write on the horse on the bottom left corner. When the card passed on to my boss, he added his signature to the horse on the bottom left corner despite there being other places to write his name on the card. 

I'm really hoping that I get a scholarship to study in Europe because that will be my ticket to leave this office. He never takes responsibility that his behavior may be the reason why the office atmosphere is thick like pudding. He will find whatever other excuse as to why an employee leaves by choice. He does not like seeing other people happy when he is serious or sad.

Whether for a religious or secular goal,
suffering is thought to constitute a

endure through work before they can

worthless before the eyes of

theological basis - where suffering is
thought to be not only meaningful, but in

without suffering is seen as frivolous and
meaningless. His position must be
rejected as a holder from a now-

drive to make suffering meaningful may
have had some functional logic in times

were necessary features of existence.
But we should reject this logic today and

496,FastFood/Restaurants fail to retain workers...Boomers most affected/“Biden to Blame” (Rant),"    *TLDR at the end*

So most people here may be aware that fast food places and restaurants are failing to hire and keep workers...it’s so bad, businesses have been temporarily shutting down and the local Panda Express we just got can not open because no one wants to work for them lol...I saw this coming and me and my inner circle have been talking about this happening for months before news broke. How did we know about this months ahead; simple! I work in the gig industry so I’m always browsing subs from fast food places and restaurants where I deliver food from and you can really see how employees have felt about their work places during Covid..also help wanted signs everywhere at this point

    So what’s going on? Recently, many news outlets have been reporting on this issue and let’s just say, many older folks have gave their input on this situation. Now tell me, how do you tell me you’re American without saying you are? Oh I know! Go on a Facebook rant about how you can’t get your Big Mac and fries now because millennials don’t want to work fast food anymore. No seriously! Hundreds of Facebook comments I’ve been reading from boomers calling us “entitled, lazy, no good generation” all because we don’t want to work fast food. And as I was telling my friend months ago, “look bro, society needs us lower class workers. You know they can’t survive without fast food, groceries, food delivery, etc. Remember the garbage men protests of yesteryear?” And now we are seeing fed up boomers who are mad because we don’t want these jobs anymore because they can’t get their whopper while yelling at the employees for taking too long.

    So who’s to blame? I’ve had the answer to this for months as I saw this coming, but apparently folks, Biden is to blame. Oh yeah, you heard me right. I’m not even a guy that’s into politics and I can tell you how bullshit this is from a galaxy away. All of these comments I’ve seen blaming Biden for extending unemployment which is “why people don’t want to work fast food anymore.” I don’t doubt that people are misusing unemployment, but the rise of people quitting fast food jobs has been rapidly rising over the pandemic. So this was inevitable and to come and restaurants were having issues to keep workers months ago, even before Biden...
Oh yes, blame it on politics for the reason why people don’t want to work fast food anymore.

    
    Here’s what’s really going on. I’ve gone through sub Reddit after sub Reddit of retail stores and restaurants over the past couple of months due to the gig work I do. I always like to see the employee side of things when it comes to the businesses I deliver from to see how I can understand them better and to make my job easier with them...and I’ve come to a conclusion...You all know the answer to fuck it-
*Corporations are to blame.* Yeah we all saw this coming, but surely it can’t be that bad, right? Well, reading employee stories over the pandemic have made me realize something, that employees have been treated like garbage beings over the pandemic and I’ll explain 

   The pandemic was the catalyst in the relationship between corporations and workers. We all know that before the pandemic, these places treated their workers like shit here in America, but the corporations under the pandemic made people get treated like the scum of the earth and opened the eyes for many many people...

    It all started at the beginning of the pandemic, fast food sales doubled and tripled as many people were now ordering online due to the pandemic. What happens when sales double and triple? That must mean that work load doubles and triples too! With all of this new found pressure being put onto fast food workers, while they are understaffed, workers were given too much work with not enough workers....many of whom had to deal with managers yelling at them for not being able to complete impossible rates and customers being angry too. Do you really expect 3 chipotle workers to make 100 items in less than 10 minutes (not even a joke r/Chipotle subreddit confirms)?

   Next came the “Covid pay” fiasco. Many restaurants at first refused to up pay on employees making $7.25 during the pandemic (even when profits soared through to the moon).  As a worker, hearing that you got to work in a business that’s thriving due to a pandemic, and making you do mandatory overtime and not making more, you’re gonna feel like shit bro. Not only as a worker do you have to deal with a pandemic and transmission of the virus due to contact in drive thru with thousands of customers, but your job calls you a “essential hero” but won’t pay you like one....plus too much mandatory overtime for $7.25? Hell no! When these places finally upped pay, it still wasn’t enough

   After the Covid pay issue, managers had gone to the next level of bullshittery. Suddenly, Covid was striking many fast food employees across the country...one by one by one...So what are you supposed to do about this considering your whole kitchen crew are potentially infected? Force your workers to come in...Yes you heard me. Many and I mean many managers verbally threatened their employees if they didn’t come in if they had Covid. Their reasoning was “unless you feel sick or show symptoms, you gotta come in cause we’re understaffed.” That’s how you know you’re really American lol. Oh, your mother you live with got Covid? Too bad, your manager told you that if you quarantine you’re fired. Go ahead and search Reddit and see how many stories you come across like this

   Workers by this point are fed up, but it can’t get worse, can it? Oh yea we can! The next issue is regarding “essential employee” or as I call it, “the most americanest lie established.” Imagine, you work at a ice cream shop at the beginning of the pandemic and you don’t close down...Apparently you’re “an essential worker.” Ice cream tho? Ice cream isn’t essential for survival and apparently many places of business like GameStop came up with bullshit reasons for why they are essential. Don’t get me started on the fact that the mattress job I used to work at during the pandemic, forged a Tennessee official signature, just to lie to the government about being “essential” so they wouldn’t close down (and they got caught and have been fined but ironically, the mattress job has a policy on it’s wall about being loyal to God and the Bible). So you sell Video games during the pandemic-ESSENTIAL! Heard you sell Boba Te-ESSENTIAL! WE ALL ARE ESSENTIAL.

    Finally on our list, we have the “essential hero” lie that was sold by corporate America, to the American people. Brought to you by, the same people who make children pay for their lunch because food brands control kids’ lunch and need to make a buck off of elementary kids (not even a lie, it’s damn true). Anyways, over the pandemic, to really keep employees, corporations ran ads calling their workers “heroes” to increase workplace morale and to make workers feel like they belong; however, with the multiple other events happening in the paragraphs above, that unfortunately did not work to keep workers...instead this backfired. Shocking videos and stories came out about the horrible treatment of so called heroes because people treated fast food workers even worse during the pandemic...hell, the whole “essential hero” thing goes way further than you think. When Americans think about the term “hero,” they think about someone who will put up with all bullshit and never give up...so when Americans (especially older ones who grew up on comic book Superman) hear about fast food employees uh I mean heroes giving up and quitting their jobs, those American people began to view these former workers as scum of the earth...because in the time they grew up, if a hero were to give up, that hero was suddenly a horrible no good person to which they associate these “essential heroes with.” So now , you a former fast food employee who quit their job during the pandemic because they mistreated you like scum, are now seen as scum by older generations for quitting...

And ironically, these same older generations say “fast food isn’t a real job.” Well if it isn’t a real job, why call millennials lazy for not wanting to work fast food? They’re lazy for not wanting to work “non real jobs” huh? Aren’t you guys the same people who said “well if you don’t like it, find a better paying job,” which millennials did take your advice and now you guys are mad about it? Lol


TLDR; Corporations sold the American people lies about employees being “essential heroes” but not wanting to pay anything more than minimum. Same fast food places were forcing workers to come in if they had Covid while treating them even worse during the pandemic. Fast food places nearly tripled in orders but did not have enough staff, which caused extreme pressure and workers working nearly 14+ hours in many cases and greatly increased stress. Many Americans in turn assaulted and harassed workers because food was taking too long when they expect 100 Chipotle items to be done in 10 minutes (not exaggerating). Managers treated employees worse and fast food workers were being treated to inhumane levels.

501,Rant - empathetic people get the shaft in the workforce,"In my personal experience, and through observations of other  empathetic people, I've become very disheartened. I've spent almost 15 years in management and other leadership roles, and in every case I've seen myself and other empathetic people shuffled to the side because our focus was on our people more than the short-term company gains.

More broadly, if you do a Google search for best careers for empaths, the lists you get back are full of service jobs, teaching, school counselor, etc, all of which are pretty low paying, especially if you're talking about someone looking to exit the corporate sector.

Rarely you can find highly empathetic senior leaders and company leaders, often because they helped build the company in the first place, but in my experience most people welcomed into upper leadership put the short-term bottom line before their employees.

The thing is, outsiders to this sub will read that and think I have no idea how business works, except I do. I just reject the idea that it has to work that way. Dan Price is a great example of a highly empathetic leader who puts his employees first, but he built that company and maintained his leadership. I can't imagine that any company I've ever worked for would hire someone like Dan into Senior Leadership, much less as CEO.

Sorry for the rant. I'm so tired having maybe a couple hours where I'm not eaten up by stress. Wake up and immediate anxiety knowing I have go do something I hate (and currently can't find something I enjoy that can pay the bills), anxious all day, finally after dinner it starts to subside, but then a couple hours before bed time knowing I have to do it all again kicks things back into gear.

I like working, I don't mind working for someone else, but I want to be valued as a person and for the strengths I bring to the team, not whether or not I can make the company the most amount of money possible.",False,mzspb0,brumby79,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mzspb0/rant_empathetic_people_get_the_shaft_in_the/,26,2
502,I’d rather be eaten alive in nature than work at a “job”. (semi-long rant),"I would rather live life as an animal, even one prey to a lot of others, and die a horrific death being picked apart by a predator, than spend 40+ years of my life working. 

You know what doesn’t benefit me? Destroying my mental and physical health at a “job”. 

You know what’s not meaningful? Slaving away 40+ hours a week at a job where nobody actually cares about you. You never see the fruits of your labor, even in physical jobs to an extent. When are you going to stop and ask yourself “wait a minute, why the hell do I do a nearly perfect job everyday but I only receive comments for the moments I mess up?” 

They don’t fucking care. The only time they care is when their machine starts stuttering and slowing down / not turning the cogs smoothly. If they actually cared, you wouldn’t be getting a 2% raise once per year, if you’re lucky to not have a boss who skimps on raises.

Here’s my biggest problem with work. I’m not fucking motivated. Where the fuck does my labor go? Why the fuck can I do such a good job on a task, but not see the extra compensation? Why the fuck do higher ups get incentives and bonuses but the “crew” is left to die in the streets? There’s no meaning to it if we don’t get rewarded for our labor. We never see the fruits of our labor because it just makes the rich people richer. We’re working for the profit of others. “Jobs” create a middle man in between our work and our reward. You have to come provide labor to actually be able to receive the means to go get your food and shelter, and in today’s world, you can barely even get it. That’s why there’s so many mass shootings. That’s why there’s so many suicides. That’s why there’s such a massive spike of mental health issues.

Because work takes away every sense of control in our lives. We have to show up for our scheduled times. We have to wait for a higher up to confirm that we can go on break. We sometimes have to ask if we can even just go to the bathroom, and sometimes get told no. We’re expected to come in even while sick with a contagious illness. If we call in we go through a stressful lecture designed to make us feel guilty about trying to take back control of our lives. We barely receive any paid vacation time, if any. To me, suicides related to work life are because they want to escape it. Mass shootings with issues stemming from the insanity of work are because they’re trying to regain a sense of control. Im not at all defending these actions nor do I support them, I’m just trying to see the reasons behind them. A lot of us can’t afford to request personal weeks off, and for those who can, you can’t do it multiple times or you get “no, you can’t have any more time off, we need you” 

What the fuck do you need me for? My wife needs me more than you do, and if I want to spend time with her, I should be able to. What about when I have kids? Why are we expected to prioritize the profit of others over our own families? Why should work have the right to get mad at me for taking time off work to make sure my wife is okay in the hospital? I just want to be able to do basic work. Go out and hunt for my wife and kids. Build a pen and raise some animals. Grow a garden of sorts. Build us a shelter. Learn to fish. 

In my mind, so what if I get eaten alive by a bear? So what if I die of a deadly illness? In this life I’ve already contemplated and attempted suicide, so what’s the difference? At least I’d live a life with meaningful work. Supporting the ones I care about, not supporting some corporate psychopath that lives 1000 miles away from me, bored out of my mind day by day in a boring dystopia.",False,mzogvd,Fetrospec,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mzogvd/id_rather_be_eaten_alive_in_nature_than_work_at_a/,13,1

512,I’m so frustrated and burnt out and I don’t know what to do.,"So I started a new job about 2 months ago after walking out of my job where I was verbally abused daily.

I really liked this job when I first started. It was normal. A desk job, which is fine with me. I would just put my headphones in and do my work. I was getting praise constantly. I felt validated after everything that happened at my last job.

Then one person quit because they were not comfortable with the Covid rules here and another was fired for performance issues.

Now, my boss has asked me to take over both of their tasks. Which I don’t even mind. The thing is, I’ve had no training on their work, so I am making (small) mistakes here and there.

However, my boss calls me out on them in snarky ways and it’s just frustrating to me because I’m trying to help them out and be flexible, etc etc.

I’m no longer getting praise, but only getting told about when I do something wrong. Even though I was never shown how to do the task. And when I do have questions, I ask, and then do whatever they tell me to do. So if that’s wrong, then I’m not really sure how I’m supposed to know that? Obviously I’m asking how to do it because I don’t know how to do it. So how is that my fault if they tell me to do it wrong? I feel like I’m talking in circles.

Anyway, I feel like I’ve got myself in a hole just because I was trying to make a good impression and seem willing to help when they asked if I could take on the other tasks. 

I’m just so tired of this cycle. I was so happy getting this job and now this past week has just felt like the same shit I left my last job for.",False,mzwtaw,stormyllewellynn,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mzwtaw/im_so_frustrated_and_burnt_out_and_i_dont_know/,4,2

530,I hate businesses operating with little to no regard for covid while my industry is still in shambles,"Prior to the pandemic I was a freelance musician in Austin, TX. I moved there after the Ringling Brothers circus closed in 2017; I had been touring with them in the band prior to moving there. Was on an insane grind for two years getting established in the scene in Austin. By April 2019 I finally had enough teaching and playing work to leave my pt job &amp; freelance full time. Working insanely hard, both in jobs &amp; practicing, was what got me to that point. 

By the end of 2019 I was living the life. More gigs than I could handle, I was actually having to pass some along to other players! Life was great. 

When the pandemic hit I couldn't get through unemployment. Couldn't afford to stay in Austin with no gigs, so I left. Now I'm in the Midwest making $16/hr as an assistant manager at a trampoline park and hate it. 

$16/hr isn't shit! After taxes it comes to just under $2k/mo. That literally leaves me NOTHING after I pay bills and buy groceries. The owners are booking around 20 birthday parties every Saturday, won't let us enforce masks, capacity limits are a joke... and it kills me. 

It kills me places like this can operate with virtually no restrictions, yet my entire industry is still in shambles. I'm so pissed the life I had worked so hard to build for myself has been stripped due to things completely out my control for the second time! The first being the circus closing, I was planning on doing that gig until retirement. 

My boss at the park asked me if I enjoyed my ""fat check"" the other day, because the owners were in Hawaii on vacation &amp; didn't get my direct deposit info on time, so I had to wait another two weeks to get paid. I laughed in their face and told them I used to make that in a week. 

I hate everything about this country. It's disgusting how little people are expected to get by on. I'm not antiwork, I'm anti bullshit wages. Forget $15 minimum wage, that doesn't let you get ahead at all!! Anyone who thinks that's enough should FOAD. 

I can't transition to a heavy online presence because that requires gear that requires money, and at my current rate, I literally never have enough left over to get what I need to get started. 

My only silver lining is that I have opportunities to audition for doctoral programs for Fall '22, but even then, unless I get a tuition waiver and teaching assistantship, I won't be able to afford to attend. I'm trying desperately to save money but at my current pay it's literally impossible to do.

meanwhile, i bought a flight out of town several weeks ago, which my team already knows about. a project just came up today. its deadline is smack in the middle of my flight. i told them i'd like to get this project done a couple hours early so that it will already be submitted by the time i leave for the airport, which i didn't think would be a problem. instead of replying ""oh, we'll make sure to work around your constraints and finish our portion of the project early to accommodate you,"" they gave me looks of disgust and confusion and said ""why can't you just reschedule your flight?""

No I do not want his job.  Ever.  It's bad enough at my level but it's worse at his.  At least I can go home at 5pm he gets calls at all hours from people above him.  He's one of those kiss ass charming bullies so he gets away with everything.  I am not like that.  I'd rather be poor than be him.  There is another manager here and because I'm stupid I know more about her job than I should.

In a year my boss and the other manager are going to retire.  Tag I'm it.  If I don't come up with a game plan now my life is going to get a whole lot worse.  I've been here 2 years and I took on additional work and today I gave it all back.  That is step one.

548,Overworked and underpaid. Story of our lives.,"I work in the public sector and have witnessed some horrendous behaviour and treatment from my employer. I'm flabbergasted by self absorbed egomaniacs who become managers and ""leaders"". It's truly disheartening to see people get treated like shit and I need to vent. I apologize for this lengthy post.

 Our boss is a self absorbed, racist (thinks they are woke but really not), and treats their employees with utter disrespect. We've had high turnover in our department ever since our boss started (unusual in our field since most employees stay for a long time). 

The quickest someone has left was 2 weeks after they joined the job. We've had people who've worked there for years transfer to other positions or departments just to avoid our insane boss. My boss has their favorites but talks shit about everyone behind their back. Every conversation you have with them is negative bullshit about work, their employees, or some drama between other higher ups or even their family members. It's honestly mentally tiring to have a conversation with them when they are talking shit about their own employees to you (when I am also their employee). 

My boss brings their pet employee ( a part timer, very young lower level employee) with them to their house to run personal errands which I personally believe is a huge breach of ethics due to the age and power imbalance. Boss makes this pet employee  mow their lawn, build furniture, help them move, takes them to run personal errands - one time which made that pet employee late to work because they were both running a personal errand together. My boss has been grooming this pet employee since it's their first real job and has basically been manipulating them into  becoming their lackey. Now this pet employee sees boss' toxic behaviour as normal workplace behaviour. She excuses my bosses toxic behaviour as them having a bad day or saying they just have a lot on their plate. I have bad days too but I don't treat people like shit! It's frustrating because boss had treated me like shit some days and this pet employee excuses their behaviour when directly witnessing this shit. Boss also tells this pet employee about all the interoffice BS,  workplace problems, and personal confidential info! So this pet employee tells me this shit before anyone else even knows - i.e. like when a employee is leaving a job. Huge breach of company regulations.  It's crazy how much bullshit my boss gets away with. Funny thing is that boss was mad at pet employee one time and started talking shit about her to me. If she only knew.

 Employees have complained but my boss was bragging to me one day about how HR sided with them. How is that something to brag about? It's honestly infuriating how people can get away with treating people like this. Boss has said racist shit to me about other races and has made offhanded comments about my race and culture (I'm poc). I've brushed it off as ignorance but my boss is seriously a racist prick after I witnessed them making blatant racist and ageist remarks about white women (hypocritical bc they are white and middle aged). My boss is a loud, braggadocios blobfish who doesn't think before they speak and says the most ignorant comments. Well apparently higher ups noticed and my boss started to complain about how they have to take more sensitivity training. The most infuriating thing is seeing them treat others like shit. I wish I can stand up and say what they are doing is wrong but at the end of the day it's easier to replace a lower level employee.

I've stayed and witnessed the most insane bullshit from this birdpecked brainturd. I'm also overqualified and severely underpaid  but due to covid, job hunting has been hard. I accepted this job since it was my first real job and I liked that I was helping otherd. I love my job but this toxic work culture has made me hate what I do. My boss' toxic behaviour has also affected my confidence and mental health. I've started having anxiety attacks which I've never experienced before starting this job. I dread going into work everyday.

549,Need advice on being talked to for comments,"(WARNING: WALL OF TEXT)

I was called into a meeting today regarding 2 comments I said during lunch time that the higher ups deemed 'unacceptable'. One of my comments were I was telling my co-workers how I was asking one of managers what I needed to know which task to prioritize; but I guess how I worded it when I was telling my co-workers the story was 'unacceptable'. I even  clarified with the high ups what I meant and what I actually said to the manager; they still said what I commented was 'unacceptable'


The other comment was I said I not gonna plan to work overtime after busy season (we already been pulling OT for several months now); their response was them giving me a lecture as to why certain task were assigned to me and even the other department and the reason why everyone is working all this overtime is so no one needs need to work till 7-8pm to pick up the slack (I already knew this; I don't need to be reminded) However, the WHOLE reason why we are in this position is because they didn't hire enough ppl and we have had crazy turn over


But they were saying my comments will create a negative work environment; but in reality it's already happened I'm just opinions as senior who has been for many years now.


I left the meeting just saying I understand but I also didn't apologize to them. However this conversation made my blood boil after thinking it over because it felt like what commented was twisted in the way I looked bad. And even though I tried to clarify what I meant; they still deemed it unacceptable.

550,I HATE THIS FUCKING DAY,"It's Monday Eve, my entire fucking work week starts all over again in just a few hours. Mondays are the worst day for me (I know I'm not the only one). 


I just found this thread tonight, so I can spare my best friend this conversation that we have every Sunday night...hell everyday really. I think about work even when I'm not doing it because I know.... it's coming. 

So it's beyond the 40 miserable hours a week at this point. 

I work in customer service, and I cannot stand  people. It's funny bc I never said that before I had a job. I am very introverted, small talk and the tons of unnecessary team meetings we have makes me want to jump out of my skin. 

The only thing that holds me together is, I'm not talking on the phone anymore (thank GOD). I do emails. I'm good at my job, and finally got another well-deserved raise.

 I thought that would give me some my fire to just bear this a bit longer.  I was totally damn wrong. 

I have tried everything... online store, virtual assisting, YouTube, baking, marketing, coding, graphic design and so fourth. Nothing fits!!! That's not even counting the actual jobs I have had and hated before.


I just don't want to dread waking up each day. It's just a terrible way to live considering we only have but so much time. 

I was watching someone and this girl said ""This is your passion"". I've heard that before of course, but it really hit me tonight. 

Like wait, there's people who actually like what they do? 

They don't spend five days a week dreaming of a completely different reality? Or looking up articles on what do to when you hate your job, articles that they already know by heart? 

They are so damn lucky. 

I just want to actually enjoy my life and not be homeless. That's it. 

But If I don't clock in... homeless it is. I also have family members that depend on me.  I'm right back where I started. 

I love creative writing though...I do that happily for free. Maybe I can do that and get paid for it. People enjoy the chapters I share with them. I have got to figure something out.

I’m very good at playing video games (FPS to be specific) and I always wanted to upload videos on YouTube and make living out of it. My friends always used to tell me that I should try record my gameplay and upload it on YouTube since I can get some clips etc.. Honestly to me it’s sounds like a dream where you do something you enjoy and also get paid for it.

At the same time I also got some programming knowledge so that’s another thing I can do, but I don’t really have any passion for it, it’s just something that I at least can tolerate doing. 

So the point is I don’t really know what to chose and  spend 1-2 years to master and and make living out of it.. I really wanna try the YouTube thing but I believe it’s very hard to succeed at it even if you got something to show (a lot of people also do this as well), at the same time programming is gonna be easier since I got engineering degree and junior level of knowledge, but I’m still gonna end up like a typical wage slave that have to work from 9 to 5.

I have been unemployed for almost a year and unlike a lot of people I have lost my benefits and have been going without pay since October. My savings is slowly going down and I’m realizing the time is coming that I need to do something about it and it’s killing me. I understand I have to work. I’m not lazy or anything like that either because when I worked, I busted my ass and made life changing sacrifices for nothing. My life consisted of work, work, work. And it has gotten me literally nothing.

But I have been in the comfort of my own home and doing things that I love for almost a year and it’s killing me knowing I have to give it up and become a slave again. I don’t want to leave my fiancé and animals. I love being with them all the time and doing whatever I want. I don’t have the pressure of meeting these stupid standards for the workforce or pretending I care about bullshit surveys. I also don’t have to worry about my life vanishing before my eyes because I’m working 40+ hours a week to have a whole measly two days off.

But as of right now my life is great and I see no fight to go back to working. I want to stay inside all day? No problem. I want to write all day? Go right ahead! I want to go on a road trip? Let’s pack up! I don’t want to go back to some bullshit ass place and have someone dictate my life. I don’t want my life to be surrounded by work again and making sure I’m right on time and make the good old boss happy. 

I don’t want anyone to ever have power over me again. Whether it be customers or managers. I don’t want to get abused by these people ever again. I’m not a doormat, I’m human!!! 

I guess I should talk about it. I don’t really talk about it that much and if I do, I just call him a fucking asshole. But this is where my main issues with work have scarred me.

Okay quick backstory: I started working at a grocery store right after high school, it was fine I was young &amp; trying to go to community college but it didn’t work out because I picked income over school. Then I moved to the Midwest to be closer to my family but work took over and I was working so much I didn’t have time for family. Then I moved back home tried college again but I realized I wasn’t a school person and worked retail and also a mobile clinic. I liked the clinic even though the hours were long but it was only on the weekends. Then I got a certification for HR &amp; after that was completed, I quickly found a job and the job that completely fucked me up.

I don’t know why I even accepted the job (Oct. 2017) let alone stayed as long as I did (9/10 months? Left June/July 2018). My family was so proud of me because I found a ‘big girl job’ and the work was easy enough but the place was horrible. 

It was for an adult day care and I was the administrative assistant. The interview was insane to me. I remember my future boss was making these mocking faces at me and using pressure and anger to try and throw me off guard. I walked out of the interview thinking: that guy is an asshole and there’s no way I got that job because it seemed like he really didn’t like me. A couple days go by and I get the call that I got the job! I was shocked because I literally didn’t think I was going to get it and everyone told me to take it and maybe the boss was just being a bad cop to find the right person. It paid $14.65 an hour and I never made that much money before (at the time). 

My duties were: checking clients in from 7am-11am (I loved these clients and I feel so bad they are stuck in this shithole), calling potential hires, doing reference checks, and monthly charting. Of course, some other things here and there but it was EASY. But it was never enough for this douche bag. If the potential hire went ghost on me it was my fault. If the reference checks didn’t match up to his standers or didn’t give answers that he wanted it was my fault. If the reference checks NEVER ANSWERED, it was my fault. Everything was my fault. I was in charge of the food delivers and if the meal didn’t come out how it was supposed to, he would expect me to scream at them and get angry with them. When I am not an angry person and I don’t see a reason to be so hateful when two people can calmly talk about an issue. But if I didn't yell he would look at me with his squinted up eyes and scream at me for being weak. 

He would abuse me to pieces where I would cry going to work, at work, and coming home to work. I couldn’t handle the pressure of everything being my fault again and again. I never received any training for anything so I figured it all on my own yet I never was enough compared to the woman who was here 14 years prior. If I had a question about my work I answered with a sigh &amp; ""how could you not know this?"" I remember I asked the nurse a question about the client charts (to make sure I was doing it right) and she went to him and complained that I asked her about it and he yelled at me for being so embarrassing. Okay... I guess I should just fuck up the charts and when you guys get audited you guys can explain why they're wrong. 

He abused the social worker at the place too. He would scream at her as loud as he would scream at me. One time, before I got hired there, he threw the phone at her because he was so mad at her. How can your employee make you that angry? I tried everything I could to report him but he was best friends with the owner of the place and also ran the compliance program, that if you had to report an issue with the place, he would be in charge of it. I had an issue on my first week of the job where one of the drivers was being very flirty with me. He would make these comments about how I looked and would bring me coffee in the morning. I was 21 at the time and he was 50. I told the boss how uncomfortable I was with his actions and he laughed at me and told me to stop being stuck up for someone being nice. 

A few months of being hired there I found out my mom had cancer. Ugh. I hate talking about this. He saw I was down and abused me even more. He wouldn’t allow me to leave early and be with her because I had the weekend to do that. And when the cancer became terminal (eight months of being here) I had to write a report asking to take half days for her final weeks. Once she passed, he gave me three days off to grieve and that was it. If I just lost my mom at 22. My best friend and I couldn’t even spend that much time with her because I had to suck it up and do this stupid fucking job. I regret it so much. I feel so stupid that I did this and regret it more than anyone could know/understand.

The plan was to spread her ashes in Florida (in an environmentally friendly way). I asked him if I could do this (was planning to do it no matter what) and I gave him three weeks notice. He gives me this very smug look and goes: “you don’t have vacation time until you’re here for a year. I’m don’t think so.” My mouth dropped to the floor and the tears started right away. I had to excuse myself and ten minutes later my phone rings and he goes: “You know I had to make a couple calls and I guess you can go. Charlie is going to have to do all your work for you and he’s a real busy guy but he said he didn’t mind.” Like you’re such a piece of fucking shit. I’m not going to kiss your feet because you ‘broke your back’ to let me spread my mom’s fucking ashes.

After I came back, I remember I had this one reference check that wouldn’t answer and I faxed this woman, I emailed her, and called her daily. Yet, I get the call from him, screaming, to come to his office to sit down and talk. He had the other program director there and he was screaming at me telling me how much of a horrible worker I am and I can’t do anything right and how he’s disgusted that I can’t get this reference to respond. I just lost my mom…and you’re yelling at me over a reference check. I take the abuse, there’s a half hour left in the day, and write out all the abuse I have taken and what I witnessed with the other employees. I woke up early the next day and got to the office before anyone showed up and left my keys and the letter on my desk. I emailed the other HR people that were at the other location my letter and that was it.

I escaped and to this day he’s still there. I hate that I put myself through that and I wish I was smart enough to leave or not even accept the job. 

A few weeks later I was hired as a manager at a retail company. The customers sucked as always-- it’s retail. But my manager was very nice. But I spent so much time working there and the abuse from a manager was replaced with abuse from customers. I left when COVID happened because they weren’t taking any precautions and I was exhausted from the customers that were upset over a two-dollar coupon. HERE TAKE IT I’LL MAKE IT FIVE DOLLARS OFF IF YOU JUST FUCK OFF. 

My mom was an amazing woman but she worked all her life. She worked two jobs to make ends meet and I appreciate her sacrifice. But the year she was supposed to start her retirement she found out she had cancer and died. She spent her whole life working and not living. And I don’t ever want to be that way. I don’t want to work so much for a retirement that I might not even see one day. Because no one is guaranteed their life at 60. Shit people aren’t even guaranteed their life the day they wake up and start their day. 

I just want to live.

572,Do people want to achieve the dream.... or do they want to complain about it?,"Hey guys... so there are a few ways to achieve the dream of not going into work. I have almost done it myself. But, when I share how I did it here, I get alot of hate. When I show other people the path I took... I get alot of dislike, and nobody follows. I took the cryptocurrency route to breaking out of the debt slave cycle. 

But, here is something to think about. How do you break the cycle of work? How do you personally see yourself breaking out of the rat race? If you simply post here on reddit, and foment, and complain, and post memes... that will not change the fact that your boss has dollars, and you don't. It will not change the fact that your bosses boss paid dollars to get free government loans for employing you, and took a nice healthy helping for himself before he gave you those dollars. It does not change the fact that those dollars are also worth less than they were just two months ago, and all the supermarket prices went up... because the dollars that the gov gave to your bosses boss were printed out of thin air. 

The united states government is robbing you. Your boss is robbing you. Your bosses boss is robbing you. And of course, nobody will ever tax the likes of jeff bezos, cause jeff has his fingers in the government pockets. Yay!

So, here is the thing. Unless you change your actions, you are DOOMED to grow poorer and poorer at just a slow enough rate that instead of getting mad and fighting back, you slip further and further into despair. You will never have enough spare money to date, buy a house, raise children, or do anything else a biological organism was meant to do. You will die young. Poor. Alone. Impoverished. And your boss will make bank. 

So, the next point you will inevitably ask- how can I fight back? You cannot fight back through the legislature. You know why? Your boss paid more money to the representatives of both parties than your entire neighborhood makes. Your elected representatives listen to the people who pays the bills. Your bosses. You cannot fight back with weapons. The police will shoot to kill, and will outgun you entirely. 

There is however one way you can fight back. You can change the narrative about what has value. Do intricate pieces of paper art that are mass printed have any inherent value? No. That 100 sign magically confers that the piece of paper is worth more than the 1 when you need to buy food. Never mind the fact that the fed prints both for free and gives them away to your bosses via the bonds market. The moment people stop believing that the us dollar has any value is the moment when the entire edifice of work, and the society that has been built as a prison around us comes crashing down. 

This is why cryptocurrency is important. If the haves suddenly see all their net worth evaporate, and the have nots suddenly see these magical tokens they hold on ledgers suddenly have value, then wealth is redistributed to the masses. 

So, is cryptocurrency a big ponzi scheme? Maybe. But if its a ponzi scheme, is a scheme with a goal in mind. Burn down the bigger ponzi scheme that is reckless federal printing and giving of free money to the 1%. We need a major wealth redistribution, and the only way that is going to happen is if ALL cryptocurrencies take off in value. Cryptos are something that the everyday person can hold onto and obtain value from. You are a slave to the system, and you need to break free.",False,mxqrj8,Ghostcarapace3,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mxqrj8/do_people_want_to_achieve_the_dream_or_do_they/,6,1

578,How I view everything,"The government had black slaves that were taken away from them for humane justices, so they needed legal slaves. Black slaves did all the hard labor work, and I mean all of it and when this was taken away there were no slaves left to work freely. 

So the government needed to devise a way to get people to work for them still. They created minimum wage, and it’s called this because it’s what the minimal amount of money’s needed to keep the worker “slave” coming back for more money.  Never satisfied only hungered. Since a wealthy man is seen more than. 

As population grew the number of labor jobs grew, as well as the overall segregation began to collapse, white people began to take black peoples jobs not by choice but because there was nothing left since what was rightfully just became fruition and black people started obtaining non-slave labor jobs. 

And because of all of this nothing ever changed. So the government created colleges to educate people so they wouldn’t have to have labor jobs aka slave jobs. But the lack of access to college for a mass majority of Americans has created a system of failures. 

And now in 2021 you have jobs paying not enough money to afford a no bedroom studio apartment, everyone is either living with their parents, leeching a relationship, or homeless. A bunch of kids taught to work to live is the only answer. Trickled along by a 15$ a hour on a rope hanging over their head. Blinded by the thought that it should be 44$ a hour. 

The government spends trillions of dollars to fight an imaginary war. A government who allows billionaires to milk the poor. A government who cares more about its own image than its own citizens. Who spends less money on us than any other country. Who for the past 5 years has destroyed democracy. A government who has created a uncertain future for 80% of its people. A government who only cares about the wealthy. A government who denies mentally ill people disability income. A government of just absolute SHIT. 

Until the government stops legal slave ownership, I refuse to work. I am anti work because I refuse to bust my ass for 40 hours a week to make 600$ before taxes... in a world where Apple charges 660$ for a headset... it doesn’t add up.

587,Stand strong when managers/bosses try to push you around about time off.,"I work in a restaurant as a server. Get paid 2.13/hr. When I get my paychecks, it literally says 0.00 because all of my hourly wages go to taxes. I make my money off of tips. Generally make around 10-15 dollars an hour. Definitely not enough in my opinion because 1) the tips are so variable; depends on how busy/what customers etc, and 2) I bust my ass doing side work and normally work at least 2 hours a night where I’m not getting tipped, just doing side work. 

Also, I’m a college student, about to start grad school. This money pays for my gas and food and things of that nature. 

When I got hired, I specifically and plainly stated I can only work Thursday-Saturday. That’s it. I said I didn’t want to work more than 25 hours a week. 

Now that they’re short staffed because who wants to bust their ass and ruin their legs &amp; feet for ~twelve dollars an hour while simultaneously getting super stressed and tired out, they’re putting me on for more shifts than I originally signed up for. 

So I just tell the manager, no, sorry, I cannot work that day. He/she asks me why I can’t work that day. I make up an excuse. The truth is I need days off so I don’t get burn out/I have classes and homework/I have a boyfriend and friends and family to maintain relationships with. It’s none of their damn business why I can’t work a certain day! I could want to lay naked on my couch all day and watch TV-none of their business!

602,Seasonal work may be an alternative for those who hate traditional work.,"I stumbled across this sub and have been lurking for awhile. The system sucks, and it really does feel like torture if you dislike your job/working in general. 

Look into seasonal work if you work a shitty minimum wage job and want out. Many companies have employee housing and either cover the cost of your housing or charge a small fee for rent ($100-$200). The company I work for charges $120/month for housing/utilities and pays for 3 meals a day. You also get to travel to beautiful places- national parks, overseas, etc. You’re still working a 9-5 that may/may not suck but it does relieve a lot of stress about making rent, having money for other necessities, and you can travel every 3-6 months if you choose to move around to different seasonal locations. Seasonal locations typically need a lot of workers and will take anyone they can get too, so there’s less of a barrier to entry when you apply. If you’re going to be forced into a shitty 9-5 for a company you hate, might as well travel and pay little or no rent. It would free up a lot of money for debt payoff, saving, and investing as well. 

I know this post doesn’t necessarily fit into anti-work, but I hope someone finds this helpful or looks into this as another route in life until you can get to the point of not working. If this doesn’t apply to you I’m sorry for wasting your time &amp; have a great day.

612,What are we working towards,"Hello everyone! I've been a long time lurker and a now a first time poster. I wanted to make this post because most of the sub is memes and not substantive discussion, which is problematic for a lot of reasons (of course not that the memes are bad or unfunny, but I think without some other kind of content it's easy to fall into a kind of capitalist trap, more on that later).

Today I wanted to write a little bit about the concept of *hope*, and why it's important to not only be critical of the landscape we are currently inhabiting but also to develop an imagination for a future that could be. In fact it is deadly important, as failure to create a vision of a post-work society will only allow the wheels of capitalist oppression to keep turning in its quest to crush all of humanity.

---

# Desire and Feelings

---

We know that the labor landscape we inhabit is bad because it makes us feel bad. We come home from work tired and angry. Unable to do any of the things that actually gives us rest or makes us happy. Because those activities that give us true satisfaction are difficult and work in themselves. It is work to maintain close relationships with your family, friends, significant other. It is work to improve yourself as a human being. It is work to do whatever hobby it is that you love. We are expected to sell all of our energy and leave none for ourselves and for our communities (family, friends, significant other(s)).

Work itself is necessary. Even when humanity was just gaining consciousness millions of years ago, it took some amount of work to gather tools and food and shelter. But we only gathered what we needed, and then we stopped. 

Yet now we're in a cult of devoting all of our energy towards the accumulation of stuff, or worse, towards the accumulation of our basic needs for survival in the 21st century. Nobody is free from the cult of work, whether you are rich or poor. Both classes feel the tyranny of consumption, though with different stakes in the outcome.

We all know this, if we didn't we wouldn't be on this sub. I say this because it's important to recognize that if we know our current landscape is bad because it makes us feel depressed and suicidal, we should be actively pursuing a landscape that makes us feel *good* and *satisfied*. We have desires, just most of the time we're too tired to even consider what they might be.

Recently I've taken up a new practice. We'll see how long it lasts, I'm not a terribly disciplined person and I don't care to be. The practice is this: get up at six in the morning (two hours before I go to work) and just reflect on how I feel. It has to be before I go to work, if it's after I'll feel too tired to do it properly. I expend this mental energy before I go to work because it doesn't matter to me if I go to work with all of my mental energy, I want some for myself.

This has been an incredible exercise. It gives me time to think about how I feel, what I want and how I want to get that. If I was smarter, I'd probably also try to think of ways to change the landscape of my community as well. But I'm not that smart, and worrying about myself is enough for now.

It's crazy to me how much having time to think can change things.

---

# Cynicism and memes

---

Critique is good. Full stop. Memes actually are a weirdly good format for passive critique. An observation followed by a quick interpretation that is easy to digest. But if that's where the anti-work discourse begins and ends then all we're doing is pacifying ourselves by complaining and getting the easy dopamine hit of upvotes for it.

My broad critique of left internet spaces on Twitter and Reddit and Youtube is that they're overwhelmingly critical with no call to action. This in fact, seems to be exactly what the capitalist wants.

For all the consciousness that has been produced by the internet, there's so little action that follows. Not only that, the critique has the effect of a drug. A little hit of satisfaction at being correct, while pacifying us to the need to act. 

Or worse, I was talking to a friend on discord the other day who, being awakened to the tyranny of work since graduating college, has decided to spend all of his free money investing in order to retire early. *What?*

That's the opposite of what we're trying to do. In order to escape the capitalist machine he's perpetuating the system that exploits him.

He has been awakened to the capitalist machine that exploits him, but without an imagination for a future *without* capitalism his only hope for escape is to become a capitalist and exploit others.

---

# Tying it all together

---

My thought process is a little scattered, but here it is in its basic form. People are being awakened to their own exploitation on the daily. It seems that kids my age (I'm twenty-two) and younger have a consciousness. We are rapidly being disillusioned with the cult of work. Yet, there is no hope for something better. The escape that I see people pursuing is becoming an exploiter instead of being an exploited.

We must create a vision for something beyond capitalism, something that can exist in the real world. And then we must communicate that vision. But in order to have a vision, we have to know what makes us happy, we have to know how we feel.

Critique lets us know that the world we inhabit isn't good, but we also need to know what is good in order to go after it. There's a brilliant movie called [Burn!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=an_7OWnW6wE) by Italian director [Gillo Pontecorvo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillo_Pontecorvo) about a colonized island in the Carribean that is trying to liberate itself. In the middle of the film, the revolutionary leader José Dolores is speaking to English provocateur Sir William Walker about the nature of liberation. He says:

&gt;It is better to know where you’re going but not know how to get there, than it is to know how to get there but not know where you are going

Meaning this: liberation requires imagination. It requires imagining a world that you would be happy to live in.

That's all I got. I apologize if this is too scattered or hard to follow.

613,"Put in my notice today, and I couldn't be happier","I've mentioned a couple times I had a new job starting soonish, and today I gave notice to work. I told my boss the reasons behind me leaving, and gave him a heads up there's others about to follow in my footsteps if he doesn't start to adapt.

True to form, he didn't listen to a single bit of it, tried to shift blame, and took notes of how to try to convince someone else to step into my role. Problem is, he wasn't aware one of the 2 people I knew was about to quit too was that person. We'll call him James (not his name, but good enough)

James told him ""I have an offer that I'm debating on taking"", and let me know as soon as he was done talking to him that he's going to hit him with a bombshell Monday morning.

Then, I get a text from my direct supervisor Jim (again, not his name, you get the point)

Jim tells me ""I can't keep doing this either, I thought this would be a place I was going to retire at"" and ""Shit needs to change there"" and ""I will not be able to sustain this level of humility and condescension for too long""

He finished with ""It's his leadership style that leans more towards putting people down vs building them up"" before he asked me to see if the new place is hiring someone for his role.

He wasn't even someone I was aware was about to quit. Meanwhile there's at least 1 more I know of. This is a near death blow for the company, because of the people who are leaving, I'm the only one who knows how a massive portion of the company works. James was my backup and being trained to learn how it works but was still a long way from being caught up, and Jim was their only department manager. If either of the two I knew were debating it see the writing on the wall from the 3 of us who are done, it'll be years for them to recover.

All because the president of the company told me ""I need to show leadership"" when I asked for a raise. Well, consider this leadership, leadership out the fucking door.",False,mx9uch,crypticedge,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mx9uch/put_in_my_notice_today_and_i_couldnt_be_happier/,6,1

653,"Graduating in two weeks, not excited at all to enter the work force","I am an engineering student who graduates in two weeks. I have a good job lined up with a good salary and benefits, but I am not excited for it at all.

In fact, as I think more and more about my future I am feeling sadder and sadder. I have only have two internships in college, which was my main perspective into the work world, but those were both very depressing. They were both 8-5 corporate engineering jobs where I went into an office for 8-9 hours a day to do 2-4 hours of work.

I cannot escape that I was lied to by everyone I. My life that graduating and getting a good job would make me feel happy and fulfilled, but I am now realizing that I do not think work will make me happy or fulfilled and rather it is simply a means of acquiring the money I need to live. I just felt so sad having so much of my time taken up by work and having almost no time to do the things I actually enjoy. Also, I hate that everyone else seems to just have accepted these poor conditions, especially when so much time is wasted at the office anyways.

I do not consider myself lazy as I graduated with honors from both my high school and college, but I really hate the idea of having to work a corporate job for the next 40 years of my life just to support a family with kids. 

At this point, I’m really not sure I even want kids if it means I have to work a job I hate to support them and I lose all my free time and freedom. Why make those sacrifices just for kids?

Anyways, I am feeling very sad about graduating (even though I didn’t have the best time in college because I dealt with a lot of anxiety and depression and I had to work hard because of engineering) and I’m not sure what to do. I am thinking about joining e peace corp but my current partner doesn’t seem like they would support that.

I honestly wish I had done an easier degree and partied and had fun through out college if I knew I was going to have leave college and work a depressing job regardless of what I majored in. I also know some people with easier degrees who seem to have the same level of jobs.

Anyone have any advice on how to overcome these feelings or patches other than general corporate work?",False,mxabma,Nuggets-Melo,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mxabma/graduating_in_two_weeks_not_excited_at_all_to/,12,1

656,our society is mechanistic and doesn't allow for emotions,"one of the worst parts about work culture is that it demotes our humanity, in more ways than one.

at the workplace, the only feeling that is allowed is surface positivity.

and the way work is set up in its mechanics and logistical aspects, your mood and your current place in life is irrelevant to the job. you just broke up with someone or was sexually harassed at a bar during the weekend or your cousin just died? it doesn't matter, you're supposed to be at work.

it doesn't matter if i'm feeling sad and need to isolate myself from other humans for a while, it doesn't matter if i need to focus on grieving the fact that i've been ill for months at my own pace, i need to be at work because it's a weekday, for fuck sake.

we're not people with our own lives, moods and feelings - we're just tools. beasts of burden.

for some reason, we are to treat our coworkers as beasts of burden, but also as family members, at the same time.

let's do some customer service!!! let's get those sales, guys! let's not deal with our shitty attitudes towards each other and focus on getting those sweet, life-affirming stats =)

I didn’t even believe authentic friendships could be formed outside of a shared venture--if not doing work together, then chasing a trophy on a sports team, or invading a country together in an army. 

Despite realizing my idiocy, I still have made some of my best friends at work.  And how convenient this has been for employers trying to squeeze every last drop out of me!  I’ve chosen to endure many an abuse of management because I knew dropping the ball would screw colleagues who A) I love, and B) are under the same pressure.   

The energy workplaces put into “culture” tells me that employers are aware of this dynamic and want to encourage it.  I can’t yet prove it, let alone explain the method.

But if someone has formalized the technique of weaponizing friendships to make you work harder, it’s gotta be out there somewhere in a book.  In the corporate world, no cabal’s secret can outlast someone’s desire to be a thought-leader.

SO...

I’ve been struggling to find a *good* job ever since I graduated college about 4 years ago. I’ve landed positions in my field, but they either fall through due to budget issues or outright lies (start ups not working out, lies about hours/pay, lies about job duties, etc). 

After accepting that the workforce is treated like a game or a stage, I started acting, too. I lied on my cover letters/resumes and got immediate results. Jobs that never responded to me, started blowing my phone up. Recruiters that I expected to ghost me, were offering me so many jobs I turned down at least 5 offers within a week. Now I have a work from home job that pays better than any position I’ve ever had and I barely have any work to do. 

No, I’m not exaggerating. No, I didn’t add on to my resume and create outlandish lies. All I did was take my marketing degree off my resume and wrote the cover letter from the perspective of a hard working high school graduate...

698,A vent about breaks,"I started a job at Sandwichdirection. I would be pretty happy, however the owners don't give their employees breaks. There's a written 15 minute break rule, but they just eat a sandwich at the prep table in the back of the store and don't even sit down.

I've been going to my car for 10 mins or so. The other employees seemed angry about it, even though the owners had told me it was allowed.

No. They texted me this morning saying they ""talked about it"" and ""it would be a mess if everyone did it."" I'm *angry* and depressed. Why even offer me a break?

I know one of them is going to try to talk to me about it and I'm not going to hold back my thoughts. It's dehumanizing to demand your employees be available on the tiiiny 15 min break you pretend to give them. That's my moment to look around and be happy with my life. Plus, I don't eat quickly, and nibbling in everyone's way is just bad in a kitchen. As a customer, that would affect my decision to eat there. It just feels *wrong* you support a business that doesn't give their employees breaks.

702,Possibly the best chance you will have in this life to make enough money to break free is coming soon,"I’m not giving financial advice , but AMC and GameStop are ridiculously shorted by these greedy ass hedge funds that tried to bankrupt them. What they didn’t expect is how the public would react. Since they shorted the stocks, but the price went up instead of down, they are bleeding tens of millions a day in interest. 

Eventually they won’t be able to maintain this and will be margin called most likely. That will require them to buy the stocks back at whatever price the market is at. During short squeezes in the past you saw stocks shoot into the thousands, and they weren’t near as bad as the situation happening now. AMC is trading at $10/share, and GME at $150/share, more or less.

About me&gt;
- only positive feedback so far since I've been at the company
- 0 sick days, literally 0 days when I've been sick 
- never left a project unfinished 
- always supported my colleagues or other departments when they needed help
- checked my emails and replied to urgent ones even on vacation
- overhours that never got paid or I asked for it

This is how my employer thanks me:
- in the three years I have received only a raise of 1,5% and my team lead said ""you are getting paid pretty well anyway so you shouldn't complain""
- our team of 6 people has been asking for a training for the last 2 years and our team lead ""checked the budgets and got approvals"" --&gt; result: we can book an online training for $20 each 
- no career opportunities, no talks about getting a senior role or advancing my career

709,I feel like Capitalism will win me over. And I hate it.,"I work in a call center. Some weeks ago I got a promotion as a Supervisor. 

Now, I had my fair share on this industry. From technical support to video game support but this is the first time I get to be something else other than an agent. The gist of it is that I see some of my colleagues that do not work. They have cases in their inboxes and calls keep coming. Of course they know that I am not an asshole and I will not call them out for it but if the upper management gives me shit about low productivity all the time, I will get fired. 

So, I went to each and every colleague and talked to them. And they feel like how I feel. Slaves to the grind and demotivated. The company I work for is not the best but it is far from worse but if you worked in a call center before, you already know the turnover rate. 

I am in place right now that I have to take actions for some colleagues of mine but I don't want to because I understand them. I am not power tripping just because I became supervisor. The thing is that if I don't show signs of improvement, I will get fired. And I get fired, I won't have income until I find another job which is hard in my country (Greece). And I don't want to fall in the bullshit of toxic positivity. 

I have extreme anxiety over this and I threw up today. My colleagues are not the enemy, the upper management is with all their reporting and their KPI's. They base their evaluation of the people in fucking numbers. Fuck this industry but regrettably, it's the only thing I know.",False,mx2zqc,Onslaught23gr,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mx2zqc/i_feel_like_capitalism_will_win_me_over_and_i/,4,1
710,I was listening to a book today which said that jobs where money is at stake are way more stressful than jobs in which lives are at stake,"The book is Lori Gottlieb's *Maybe You Should Talk To Someone* and in it, the author relates the events that led her to go from being a top TV producer (on ER) to going to med school in her late twenties. She says she was in an operating room watching brain surgery and noticed how calm they all were. No stress, no shouting, no blaming - stressing would just be detrimental to the main objective, which was not to kill the guy. 

Whereas when she was on a TV set, on which the only stakes are loss of money, it was super toxic and there was constant shouting, blaming, toxic pressure, people declaring they were going to have ""heart attacks"" from the stress, and so on. 

I currently work in a similar environment and it's super toxic. It's like... if you're not stressing, you mustn't be busy enough, and you're slacking. Stress and productivity are seen as the same thing.

So she sent me to count how many we had, made me print +50 papers out and even laminate each. Now the funny thing is I had to replace them with April 2021 papers and absolutely nothing has changed between them except for 2 numbers.

721,I'm only 23 and work is my entire identity.,"Just for some background, I went to a technical school in HS and took an electrician class. After that I worked for 2 years building electrical panels for a small shop. I got laid off there and wanted a bit more experience and money, so I started as an entry-level service technician for a prominent industrial equipment company. I've been here for 3 years. My schedule varies, sometimes I barely get 40 hours, sometimes I get 70+. I make $24.50 per hour. My job mainly consists of electrical and mechanical work on large CNC machine tools. 

My problem is that I have no friends, still live with my parents, and work is pretty much all I do. I don't have any real hobbies outside of reading and browsing the internet. Everyone tells me that I'm ""lucky to be making so much at such a young age"" and what a ""hard worker"" I am. Inside I am fucking dying. I have completely sold my youth to American industry and I regret it so much. I can't bring myself to quit because I have a compulsion to stay at this place at least 5 years so it ""looks good on my resume"".

Every time I get into my company truck I think about pulling the GPS out (yes, they track us with a GPS. Don't sit in the Sheetz parking lot too long wagie!!!!) and driving across the country to start a new life. Then I get back down to earth and think ""your family is proud of you, you can't quit and be a bum"".  

I am going on an out-of-town job next week that will be 12hrs/day for 7 days. Large overhaul on a gantry mill. I don't know if I will survive. Sorry if this post is rambling, but this is the only place I can really vent to people that ""get it"".

Same duties, $1/hr more, much less stressful work environment. I hate the gas station i work at. I hate the customers. I hate the assistant manager. I hate the manager. The manager doesn’t give a fuck about anything but his bottom line and keeping corporate off of his own ass. He goes on vacations, barely even works during the week, tells you that you have to find coverage for your own shifts, barely lets you call out of work unless you call out sick, even with several weeks in advance. Basically i want him to get FUCKED. I technically have one more shift, the closing shift later on tonight. But i think i’d rather go in the morning, turn in my key and tell the assistant manager to tell the manager that i said “Good luck finding coverage, asshole” My only real concern is my coworkers but more likely than not, the assistant manager is the one who’s going to have to come in and close up. I hate her too. She’s done nothing but suck up to the manager, pawn off her least favorite duties to the 1st level associates and make everybody’s job harder.

730,Weekend gone in a trance,"My job isn't the worst in the world by a long way, but it's pressured, and after a buy-out and continual, harmful change in the years since - including several rounds of redundancy, giving everyone who doesn't lick boots bad appraisals to coax them to accept redundancy, etc. - I can't say it's an environment that is helping me thrive. Where I'm at is much closer to burnout. 

This weekend I probably spent most of my time ""running away"" - in various ways, most involving the internet or my smartphone (not much going out right now amid the pandemic) - and not doing a ton of stuff that, had I done, would've made me feel much better about my life.

Why did I do that? This evening I've been reflecting on that (as I'm sure you can imagine). 

It's because I feel like shit. It's because my career, which has always been an important part of my life, and the company I work for, which I cared about deeply, has been shat on from a great height by assholes who if they saw good management would try to destroy it. It's because the time I have spent immersed in the hell they have turned the place into has sapped so much of my self esteem that I feel utterly hopeless, that I cannot possibly succeed in anything - so what's the point in trying - not just professionally but as a person as well.

Of course there was a point in trying, and now it's too late to do anything about that. But I hate that this whole situation has happened, despite efforts by many good people to stop it (most of them no longer part of the organization). I hate the effect this has on me. 

If this hopelessness was conscious I'm confident I'd spot it fairly quickly and shake it off, but it's like being in a trance... and by the time I start to come out of it the weekend is almost over.

750,"I got denied a minimum wage job, in a field I have experience in.","Go fuck yourself Kenl Inn.

I've been working semi-professionally with animals (pet Care at petsmart, a doggy daycare, and freelance) for 3 years now. I need a job, any job, and decided I guess I can start lowering my standards and do minimum wage. So I apply, they say they're hiring about 4 people for the job, and I dont even get a fucking interview??

I dont live in a super big city, its not like there's a ton of animal care workers willing to get paid minimum wage. I'm so pissed they had the audacity to deny me tbh. 

Also the job I got let go from because I had the Gaul to not want to work 45 hour weeks at 10 dollars an hour? Hiring for every. Single. Position. I literally just asked if i could cut down to around 20 and they hire someone else, they fire me instead and less than a month later pretty much every position is open. That's what you fucking get, glad the other delightful (non sarcastic, my coworkers there were great) finally saw how stupid it was to work ""part time"" 40 hours a week with no benefits, at minimum wage.",False,mw810s,AllyisntFair,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mw810s/i_got_denied_a_minimum_wage_job_in_a_field_i_have/,13,1
751,"""jUsT gEt A bEtTeR jOb!""","For starters, what the fuck counts as a ""better job""?

Let's pretend for sake of argument that your rent is $800 per month, your utilities including electric, water, trash, a phone plan and internet are $250 per month, your food cost is $250 per month, your car payment is $250 per month, your car insurance is $100 per month, and you pay $0 for health insurance and student loans. That is $19,800 per year. If we double that to $39,600 and add $400 for a year of clothes and shoes, we come to $40,000.

Of course, while we may have 50% discretionary income, that does not include income taxes, personal care and hygiene products, sudden expenses, car repair and maintenance, retirement plan contributions, etc. 

$20 per hour, 40 hours a week comes out to $41,600 annually. This is what I would consider to be ""middle class"", although just the very bottom layer of it, especially when many places like gas stations and department stores are hiring for $15/hr here and honestly $15/hr should be the standard to ""survive"". 

This is the latest data from the BLS, May of 2020.

[https://www.bls.gov/oes/2020/may/distribution.htm](https://www.bls.gov/oes/2020/may/distribution.htm)

Lots of math below, I'll separate it to make it easier. 

&gt;!We get 48.8% of all workers making $18.74/hr or less. The next range is 18.75 to 23.99 dollars an hour which is a range of $5.24 at 14.1 percent. !&lt;

&gt;!This leaves us with 1.2% needed to state that half of all workers make $20 or less per hour. I can comfortably say since the percent of distribution is 14.1 percent, that 1.2% needed to gap $1.26/hr would be true. !&lt;

&gt;!At the start of the pandemic before things went to shit, there was a record number of 164.6 million people working. Meaning of those, 82.3 million were earning $20 an hour or less. !&lt;

&gt;!So what does all this mean? !&lt;

&gt;!To get a better job would create two problems. The first being the need to create or modify 82.3 million jobs that would pay $20 or more an hour. !&lt;

&gt;!The second problem would be needing to find people that would want to work at $20 per less an hour. !&lt;

&gt;!How many of those 82.3 million jobs would want to increase their hourly pay to $20 or more per hour? !&lt;

&gt;!If we look at our dataset again, 34.6 percent of the workforce currently earns between $11.75 and $18.74 per hour. I highly doubt that of the lower two ranges, which account for 14.2% of the workforce, would want to make an increase from $11.74 to $20 per hour. If we pitch in the next highest range, which brings us to a max of $14.74 an hour, or 32.9 percent of the work force, I doubt those would be willing either. So if we take the next range, $14.75 to $18.74, accounting for 15.9 percent of jobs, and say 3 percent of the next range, peaking at $20 per hour, we have 18.9 percent of all jobs, of a range from $14.74 per hour to $20 per hour. What percent in reality would be willing to increase wages to $20 per hour? My guess is around 10 percent. This gives us 3.11 million jobs willing to increase pay to $20 per hour. (18.9 percent range of total workforce making $14.75-$20 per hour is 31.1 million jobs)!&lt;

&gt;!So we have 3.11 million jobs willing to increase pay. Leaving us with 79.2 million jobs needed to be created to pay at least $20 per hour. !&lt;

&gt;!Which is almost half the workforce....!&lt;

Even if **5%** of those people got lucky and found a higher paying job, we would still need **3.96 million new jobs** (remember, 3.11 million of those 31.1 million were willing to increase pay).

Meaning we would either need to create 4 million new jobs, or take 4 million jobs away from other people making $20 or more. Neither are realistic. 

To put this in perspective, Amazon currently employs about 900k in the US, Walmart employees 1.6 million and McDonald's employs about 400k, totaling 2.9 million. 

This means to elevate JUST FIVE PERCENT OF THE TOTAL WORKFORCE to a job that pays $20 or more an hour, we would need to create the equivalent of:

**All McDonald's in the US**

**All Walmart Stores in the US**

**All Amazon distribution centers, corporate offices, etc.**

**Plus another MILLION JOBS.**  

Or demand about 1.5 million jobs that currently pay between $14.75-$19.99 an hour increase their pay to $20 an hour (but remember that only helps 5% of the workforce too).  


So the next time someone says to get a better job, remind them we would need to create almost 4 million new jobs out of thin air or demand a wage increase on 1.5 million jobs **JUST TO GIVE 5% of people a better paying job.**",False,mvsva1,_Raspootin_,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mvsva1/just_get_a_better_job/,24,1

756,Choosing between crippling anxiety or functional depression while working,"I've never been this depressed in my adult life.

2 years ago I left a high stress job in the dental field where I'd work 3, occasionally 4, long (10-12) hour days, plus one half day a week and almost always a 3 day weekend. I had benefits, while not very good ones, but did get a decent amount of vacation and sick time. The office I worked at would close for a week at a time probably 9 months out of the year. Some months, like December, would have 2 weeks off in a row. During those I could use vacation time and I had the option to work on projects as needed/desired for hours.

This job gave me crippling anxiety and worsened my pre-existing but then undiagnosed chronic pain and illness. I would work myself into the ground every single shift. I was constantly sick and by the end of my 6 years there was having anxiety attacks nearly every day I was there. I developed chronic back pain, spasms, issues that I still deal with constantly. 

Eventually, I had to quit. Someone I know offered me a job at a small local business, shorter hours but more days a week, easy office job. No benefits, but at least I wouldn't be so stressed all the time.

Fast forward two years. I have been ignoring my chronic pain issues because I don't have insurance. I quit physical therapy because I no longer have a day off during the week to take care of that type of thing. I still get horrible back pain and spasms and sitting in an office all day makes it much worse. I'm currently dealing with a pinched nerve in my neck and back pain and am exhausted. 

Over the 2 years I've been here I've had one paid week off, 2 unpaid weeks off and during covid we did not fully shut down but my hours were drastically reduced and I basically came into work to do what needed to be done, which took maybe 2-3 hours twice a week. I am here 32.5 hours a week (30 on the clock) sitting in this goddamn uncomfortable chair in pain. 

Since things have been reopening our work has become busier and busier. I work in the office of a construction/home remodel type company. I am constantly berated by people who are impatient, rude, and have too much money. I have no authority here. I literally do office work, answer the phone, pay bills, make appointments. I am not involved in the rest of the things that go on here. 

I am exhausted I am drained. The phone rings constantly, people hang up on me or yell at me if I have to schedule an appointment for them they don't want to wait for. They don't care that this is a very small business, less than 10 employees. They don't care we have probably one hundred jobs lined up currently and they are not special, they have to wait like everyone else. I am the first contact, the front line, the last contact. I am the only woman who works here. Sometimes men won't even give me the time of day when I try to get information from them or answer questions. They will only talk to my boss, a man. 

I am paid more than minimum wage but am still low income. Not low enough for state insurance or any benefits. Low enough that I can't afford it myself. Low enough that if I was single I couldn't afford to live in my house anymore. 

I am so depressed. I've never worked this much in my life and while it's not ""that much"", it's still 5 days a week and 35 hours of my week spent driving or at work away from home. 

When I was doing very limited hours during the height of covid I was painting, practicing guitar, walking my dog and seeing my family nearly every day. Now I'm lucky to get in a dog walk. I haven't painted since I came back to work full time. I havent picked up my guitar since then either. I see my family much less. My SO works about 60 hours a week and I don't see him much either. There are days I go home and by the time he gets home around dinner time I haven't had a single pleasant interaction with another human being and because he has worked a 12 hour day he barely has the energy to talk to me and eat dinner before falling asleep watching TV. 

How is this living? I am miserable. I want to die nearly every day but could never do that to my sister or my SO or my dogs. The best thing that's happened since going back to work with covid was getting another dog. I can't think of much else that has made me happy over these last ~10 months. 

I am at work crying and why am I even here? I'm literally doing nothing. I am in a lot of physical pain. I am not mentally well. I was yelled at by a customer for a delay I am not involved in but I am the messenger. I am exhausted. 


If you read this all, thanks. I'm not really sure what to do. I can't leave this job for reasons I don't want to share on here and I live in a rural area where not much is available anyway. I hate zoom therapy and haven't had an in person appointment since last February.

There are 60,000 households who are surveyed for work. According to the BLS, this is supposed to be ""representative of the entire United States"". 

The way this is conducted, 50% of the sample remains the same from year to year.

This is such a small sample, I know of no one, including myself, my parents, my extended family, or friends who have EVER been contacted by the Census bureau for labor interviews. 

It's absolutely bullshit. There are 122 MILLION HOUSEHOLDS in the US. How is interviewing 60,000 of them anywhere close to being accurate? Even a million would not be a 1 in 100 sample rate. 

But to find out how many people AREN'T working, we need to find out how many ARE.

Pre pandemic employment in the US was about 163 million citizens. Politicians (elected persons) and military are not counted. 

Not everyone can work at 18, many jobs require the age to be 18, and many people chose not to work in high school. So let's completely cut out 18 and under from our work. 

It's also a tad messy to work around teen employment because for whatever confusing and stupid reason, a lot of BLS charts go from like age 16 to 24. For example, 17 million are employed between 16 and 24. But this counts 18 to 24, a 6 year difference. There is also little data on people working on farms and other jobs you can start at 14-15. McDonald's will let people as young as 14 work, depending on state laws. The BLS does not even count people under 16. 

We are left with about 255 million people, of 2019 numbers which are probably estimates from the 2010 census. 

54 million people are over the age of 65 currently. But, 8.9 million are working, us with 45 million we can get rid of too. This brings us to 210 million people over the age of 18 who are able to work or retired and working or need to work.

But we aren't done. For starters, inmates have never been part of unemployment figures. They account for 2.1 million, not counting people in immigration detention, youth detention, etc. 

So now we are down to 208 million. We also need to figure people with extreme mental or physical disabilities that prevent them from holding ANY kind of job. The data gets foggy on this, but the best number I can find is 11 million people cannot hold any employment due to severe physical or mental impairment and receive disability payments on account of it. There are people who are disabled and can work with the use of an assistant or work in a field where blindness, deafness, loss of mobility, etc is not an issue.  

This brings us to 197 million people. Now remember, the workforce does not count military, so we need to balance that out. Now I won't count ""reserves"", because many in reserves also hold employment, and honestly it starts splitting hairs at that point. Active duty is 1.3 million, bringing us down to 196 million people.

Alright, I think that covers everyone. We removed under 18, people in prison, people disabled to the degree of not being able to work, and people over the age of 65 who are not looking for work. Our grand total is 196 million people. But I want to do more work to make a more accurate figure.

From the latest data I can find, 3 million high school students between 16 and 18 work, or 1 in 4. Remember the workforce is not counted below age 16. This makes 9 million we can remove from the 196 to make 187 million. (12 million total, 3 million working).

So realistically, the true unemployment rate in the US is **12.8%**, quite a difference from the 3.5% boasted in 2019 before the pandemic.

So, let’s start with how much they make.

Assuming they work for 8 hours a day and five days a week, every month, they would make about $1,160.

Now let’s look at the monthly outflow of the expenses they have to pay.

Rent: $500-800
Food: $480
Utilities: $275-325
Entertainment: $100
Gas: $160-230
Car insurance: $35-40
Medical insurance: $100-150
Cell phone bill: $60-70

769,I really want the people who make job searches awful to be named and shamed,"This is going to read like a rant because it is. Hiring processes are all so fucking bloated and I fucking hate it, but people aren't helping. 

I heard from several boomers that a store is taking walk in interviews for 15 dollars an hour. I've been pretty hard up so I followed that lead, knowing it was a boomerism. Of course, each and every sign that even smelled like a job offer had ""apply online"" plastered all over it, sometimes in bigger text than the ""walk-in interview"" part. I guess the boomers didn't like that part so they ignored it. They will continue to feel validated that they proved ""all jobs are processed online"" to be a lie until they leave this earth. Oh, and it wasn't anywhere close to 15. 

So after a wasted trip to jump on the chance to skip the online process, I went home and filled out their shitty fucking personality quiz, their insanely inefficient data entry and hit apply. I had to give my address to make the account, I had to give my address again to pick what store I wanted to work at, I had to give my address AGAIN to apply for the specific position (there were three, and all of them had a separate nonsense job-title and the same description) And I had to fill out my entire fucking address at least two more times on other paper work adjacent to the job, like confirming that I can work in the US and something else. That all took me about 30 minutes.

I did the walk in thing the next day, they asked me some stupid fucking open ended questions about my experience, side eyed my patchy work history for a fucking **SEASONAL** position. Like how the ever living FUCK are you going to say anything about an inconsistent work history if you literally offer inconsistent work? Eat shit and choke on it you fucking inbred excuse for a person. 

They told me I pretty much have the job. This was 3 days ago. they sent me home with instructions to come back *an hour and a half later* for the drug test. This store was a 20 minute drive. The fucker told me to my face that he did that because he wanted his lunch break. 

So they stick a fucking swab in my mouth to make sure they don't let anyone who participates in the devil's cabbage doesn't have the privledge of dealing with slackjaw customers 8 hours a day, and send me home. I spent twice as long driving as I did getting drug tested. If the entire fucking lab fell into a sinkhole I'd mark it on my calendar. People told me to ""get a real job"" when I was trying to write for a living, but most people actively make life worse for everyone and I fucking hate them. 

I'm now waiting for them to fucking email me a consent form so they can do a background check. I've not received one, but I have gotten an email telling me that I'll get another email that I need to click a link on. I don't know if their knotted, bloated, automated system shit the bed or if he was just wasting my time incase someone else didn't show up for work. 

Every single step of this process is a direct, intentional actionable act of pure malice by multiple, possibly dozens of people. Why shouldn't I view these people with the same amount of hate and disgust they treat me with? Why do they get to hide behind anonymity if you can't even vote on a union without people bending over backwards to make sure the voting ""booth"" is in plain sight of the bosses?

I often wonder if the 250k or so members of this sub are somewhat enlightened in a way? I assume most of us have been through an awful experience in work that has changed our views.

I’ve been unemployed since I was fired and have been living off my savings while I wait for the job market here in the UK to somewhat get back to normal. The incident has truly made me feel like a complete failure, I’m 25 and I really am struggling to see any sort of future for myself.

I feel once you really experience a toxic, degrading workplace you can’t see the world in the same way. Even in my time away from work, the horrible dark cloud of knowing one day I will have to return has made enjoying the time near enough impossible.

Browsing job adverts daily is horrible, the same buzzwords, the same corporate nonsense, the ridiculous number of hoops you are expected to jump through to work in these vile companies who barely pay above minimum wage. I’m so sick of it, and I just can’t bring myself back to the misery of my previous job. I feel like I’m out of options, watching time slowly pass me by every day. Of course I have been able to enjoy my hobbies, it’s been a true escape, but it feels like it’s exactly that, ignoring the real world and the stress and sadness I know it will bring again.

I hope there’s someone out there that may have been in a similar situation and if there was any advice on how you recovered, I would appreciate it so much.

777,does anyone have advice about quitting an extremely understaffed job with overemotional coworkers?,"since covid, the company i work at has been laying people off  everywhere causing every single person at the company to carry pretty much double or triple the workload they were once responsible for. i won’t get into it more than that but the environment of the company now has led me to the decision that i’m ready to go. however the company has forced everyone, including me at times, to feel as if you owe something to it and your coworkers, constantly using the “we’re a family” and “we are here for each other” language, and most insidiously imo, occasionally using HR people to hang our benefits packages over our head, reminding us that we have healthcare and all this shit only because we work there. i know in my conscious brain these are obviously tactics to keep you too guilty to set boundaries or quit, but i do feel as though sometimes i can’t go through with my plan to leave in a few months because i “owe” it to them for letting me work right out of college and through the pandemic, healthcare, etc.

i also am terrified of even having that conversation with my boss because she is extremely emotional and self-invested to the point where i hate telling her the truth because it just never comes across correctly to her. 

i want to give two weeks but some people say give up to a month’s notice if you work in an understaffed environment. i mean really i want to just leave the day i tell them i’m quitting but i don’t think that’s totally an option if i ever want to work again.

778,Just packed up and walked out...,"***Please don’t follow my example unless you have money saved up***

Today ends 2 years of torment at an abomination of a company. 

Story time: 
2 years ago I was hired by this company to come in and manage their Engineering projects. I came in with all kinds of processes and tools ready to wrangle everything up. Within 2 weeks it was glaringly clear that they were understaffed. Ok, I can work with that. I will use my expertise and put together some tools to demonstrate we are understaffed and present it. 

Done. Boss says... “We cannot get headcount. You’ll have to make due.” I respond that its not possible. Deaf ears. 13 active development projects and production support with ONE ENGINEER!! 

3 months later I am the scapegoat for everything being late and I sat in fear for months my job was in jeopardy. Worked to the bone and every week it was a 1 on 1 about how I need to improve etc etc. 

New year rolls around. I was able to close out 8 of the 13 projects in 9 months to the tune of $5mil in replacement and new incremental business. No raise, no bonus, no thank you. I was rewarded with a demotion from management to engineering because “... its your background and we need engineering help. It will only be 3 months.” 

Pay stayed the same I guess thats fine. HOLY CRAP was I wrong. They quickly piled on new business and overwhelmed me and the other day engineer. He put in his notice. They move another employee like me to engineering from a different role. The 2 of us survived all the covid layoffs while they kept adding projects. 

Well another year passed and out of nowhere they sell our division to a competitor. Who is smaller and Mom and Pop not corporate. We lose a majority of our benefits, all of our bonuses and vacation. We had no control and accepted the new roles to stay employed. 

I kept my title and pay, but was told still do Engineering. Figured I’d give them a try while I job hunt. 

They add more and more work. They switch databases and tell me and the 1 other Engineer to do the data entry. I’ll spare the details but roughly 800 hours of data entry to go along with the 24!! 24!! Development projects for 2 engineers. We work 50 hours a week and get called part timers when we leave at the end of the day because its JUST SO FUNNY. 

Well today I hit my limit when my retard of a boss promised a full development project that usually takes 12 weeks to be done in 1 week. Which means its all on me! He proceeds to leave early after dropping that bomb. 

So I apologized to my fellow engineer who is also my friend IRL and packed my things and walked out. 

I have a few months salary but last time I was unemployed it took 6 months.

I still need to sell my time so I am accepting good luck in my job search until I can leave the rat race.

781,Finding work just to fund a suicide method just to avoid having to work.,"Having a reliable method on hand would at least afford me a safety net in case the workforce life becomes to much to bear. I know how weak-willed that sounds and it goes against my values of pushing forward in life no matter what. Don't get me wrong, I want to live, but I refuse to live a life dictated by whatever 9-5 I can find. A life where I can only travel when my boss allows, assuming I make enough for even that. A life where I'm spiritually drained, figuratively speaking. Where I lend my time to something that doesn't make my heart skip a beat. 
People would love for you to lend yourself to that lifestyle or you have no real value. They won't care how a job is affecting you because...a job is a job. I mean, has anyone shown concern about your physical and mental wellbeing after asking what you do for work? 

I don't know. I guess I speak a lot of shit for someone who hasn't actually been in the workforce officially, only doing under the able jobs for a few months. But I've spoken to many people who have not gone a day without complaining about their work. And I'm expected to impose that shit on myself until I'm infirm. Retire and enjoy life when I'm not as spry as I once was? What the fuck?

791,My experience at Walmart,"I used to work for Walmart as a cart pusher and I wanted to talk about my garbage experience. I need some answers to some questions that genuinely confuse me.

I started workin at Walmart as a cart pusher in November of 2016

I immediately hated the job it was hard, I always stunk cause of sweat and you were expected to work in the elements unless it’s a tornado or flood. 

I somehow stuck with it for a year and by then I figured out some tips that made the job way easier.

We had a cart pushing machine that did a lot of the pushing we just directed them to the left or right.

The grocery side was harder and more busy so us cart pushers organized and split the work evenly. The hard side had three or two people and the easy side had one or two but don’t feel bad for them that side is so easy I offered to take it by myself and have the other 4 people work on the hard side. 

They were friends and I wanted to be able alone and finish work stress free so it all worked out. (Btw we moved around daily so it’s fair)

Ok to the point we got so good with this setup to the point where we were able to get all the carts in 20 minutes or less and then half would be gone by 30 minutes. Half is not much they’re not enough to jam to cart corrals.

We turned a hard shit job that no one wanted and no one could fill for more than a few weeks into a sweet setup.

Instead of having workers come from inside the store to help us we sometimes went in to help our friends we liked all while doing our jobs to the fullest and more. We found enough time to clean and when all that was done we would sit for 10 minutes to 30 behind the carts to relax and get off our feet. After that half the carts would be gone we’d go get them in 15 minutes or less then rinse and repeat.

This worked out for a year until a bitch Customer service manager who does nothing but get on her phone and micromanage people got on us. 

The store manager didn’t care at first and pretended to discipline us but soon he started taking her side after she bitched for long enough. 

She tried to micromanage us she caused a bunch of people to quit and ruined our flow. Everytime we recovered she did the same thing.

My question is why the fuck would you shoot yourself in the foot like that.

You couldn’t find anyone to fill this position before and now you found some people who can do it and go beyond and find time for themselves and to relax why would you fuck with that. You literally lose more money and productivity goes down when you get on us for just relaxing a bit.

My jobs duties are cleaning the front of the store area and getting in carts I did more than that why micromanage me when you don’t do shit. Then soon all the managers got on to us for that.

792,The only time you have power in a job,"If you feel like quitting your job, you've just achieved the point of power in your job.
Being able to say ""F you"" and walk away is exactly what your employer doesn't want, they want quiet accepters, people who will take any crap that is thrown at them.

It's easier to be in this position if you have some sense of stability (rich/supportive family, savings, new job offer) and therein lies one of the secrets of being born to privilege, you never have to suffer a crappy job and can always have confidence to complain and make your job better. For everyone else, we suffer anything until we can get one of the other two sources of financial stability; a new job or savings.

Having the confidence to throw the job away at a whim and be able to tell your superiors about your intention often results in being offered a raise or a better work/life balance or blah blah. Things they could have given you but didn't until they felt threatened.
I wonder what solutions there are to achieving this level of confidence when you have no financial stability?
I've deluded myself to that point in the past and it worked well for me, but in the end the job wasn't worth the extra benefits. 

I went through a phase of a capitalistic mindset, doubled my income over 3 years, constantly moving from one job to the next. But there was no real satisfaction, the job was actually mind-numbing and was never given any respect (accounting), working with idiots who talk down to you all the time is not worth the mediocre salaries you can make in accounting (not including executive positions you can potentially achieve in that industry).

814,The real reason why there is a big lack of automation.,"You can't exploit a robot.

A 24x7 McDonald's spending $10 an hour on a fry cook would spend over $87,000 in one year's time and $870,000 in ten years time assuming wages did not change.

In contrast, you can buy a machine that makes pizzas from dough, prep and bake for around $50,000. A fully automatic pizza machine. 

So how much would it cost to make a robot that could fry fries? Probably a little more or less.

The point being, the cost would be less than a year of paying a worker at McDonald's. The technology to do it has been around over 10-15 years, too. 

So why aren't these places automating? Especially when they are having more trouble finding work now than ever before?

Because automating all these jobs would make a large number of people unemployed, and then of course the next logical step would be universal basic income or UBI.

I think even if I worked full days every Saturday and Sunday I couldn’t get everything done that was required of me. I was sick of coming home at 6 PM, immediately passing out from exhaustion, and letting my health go to shit. I ruptured a disk in my spine at age 23 after 3 months working there, purely from stress. I have to pay back a year of tuition, but I don’t even care. I had to get out. I’m free. 

I’m going to run errands for my grandmother, declutter her house, babysit my little siblings, and make arts and crafts. I’m going to work on my health. I’m going to start living the life I’ve imagined! It’s awesome. I’m so happy.",False,mwx36a,caribbean-amphibian,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mwx36a/i_quit_my_job/,3,1
824,It's all a lie!,"I need to be honest, I drank the juice and I paid for it. 

I was a manager of an average office job. I championed the mission of the organization to my team, I worked late at night and even early in the mornings, I stood up for the (non-existent) integrity of the organization to my team members, even when the company was CLEARLY in the wrong. I did it all, and I was fired. 

I believed the narrative they tell: this is a mission that is worth investing in and committing to. The problem is that they never invest in you. But boy of boy they'll tell you they do. 

When I first began at the job, during the interview I explicit told them that I have high expectations to be trained well. Except their version of training was ""sink or swim"". I quickly sinked, and almost 4 or 5 months into me starting, my boss took over all of my leadership responsibilities. Weekly one-on-one meetings with team members. That's my bosses job now. Leading larger team gatherings? That's my bosses job now. Quarterly reviews of my team? That's my bosses job now. The only thing I had to just me was my weekly team meetings. And the worse part is, this was announced when I was on vacation! I took a week off and came back to this new system. I was told that I wasn't providing enough direction, and they needed someone there to do that. Was I perfect at my job? no. Did I wish that instead of replacing me, they trained me? yes. Did they do that? no. They blind sighted me, and my ""authority"" in the company dropped drastically.

Once COVID hit, my team began to meet online for our weekly meetings. Like I said, the only part of the job that I kept as the ""manager"" was the team meetings. My boss, who was running the show almost entirely at this point, wanted to drop in and listen in on the meeting. Usually the atmosphere is casual, people are relaxed, but everything stiffened up during this meeting. The next day I was told that I don't have a team anymore. I was given a different job that previously wasn't held by a someone with a ""management"" title. Was I perfect at running meetings? No. But should they have put a deeper look into things than to just drop in on one meeting.

All throughout this process I had tried to advocate that I needed more training, but nothing changed. I kept on being told ""we don't have the resources to train you right now"", and my favourite line of all time ""we're in a spot where we can only afford 'bandaid solutions', not long-term solutions."" I was finally able to convince my boss that I needed training and we got registered into some online program that you can pay for classes on specific areas of growth for managers. Did we ever use it? No. Did we pay for the subscription for 8 months straight? yes.

And it actually feels like a betrayal that this whole time, no matter how much it felt like they didn't train me, no matter how many times they didn't stand up for me, I was still advocating for them. I was still working the 60+ hour weeks. I was still giving them the best I had to offer. The CEO of the company had only met with me 2 or 3 times up until this point, but he was always very supportive... at least I thought he was. He always said things along the lines of ""I see a great future for you"" and ""you have so much potential, and I remember being a lot like you"" blah blah blah. 1 week before he fired me he told me that he sees himself as a mentor in my life. Thanks Mentor.

Just 2 more facts to help solidify the crap that is this company. Firstly: in 1 years time, 11 of the 13 employee's in my cluster of departments had quit. When I had talked to some of the higher ups about this, all they had to say was ""oh that just happens every 2-3 years here."" Ummmm... why? Maybe if this wasn't such a crappy place to work that wouldn't happen. I tried writing them a letter as to why I think this is the case, and how I think we could make changes to fix this. No response. Second: of the last 5 people to have my position, none of them lasted longer than 1 year. 4 were fired and 1 changed jobs. When I asked about this, I was told ""I don't want to confuse stories. Their story is not your story.""

Anyways, I was fired. The whole time I kept thinking about how I wanted to be remembered and celebrated here, but in the end I never was. I was let go, and no one was told about it until after my last day. They told me after a few months they'd reach out and celebrate me then, but it's been 4 and nothing at all. 

I'm pleading with you. Please don't believe the crap they tell you about growing YOU. You mean nothing to these people. They don't care about you, and all they want is production. You are only a means to an end. NOTHING more.

For example, when I was younger, I remember that people used to tell me not to spend too much time in front of screens. But how many hours do we spend in front of screens in the name of work? Society loves to hate people spending ""too much"" time on their phone while in the meantime respecting those higher-ups who have their phones glued to their ear.

Lockdowns have this to a T. Meetings are discouraged, and we should (righteously) stay at home, but in the meantime (at least here in France), we have no problems getting in the subway, with less than 30cm between two people, as long as we are going to work.

Living off $11 an hour is absolute hell, but I know myself, and I think I would fall into even more of a depression/ suicidal thoughts if I were to take a job I literally see no point in. I cannot imagine working somewhere for 40 years and like feeling like I did nothing with my life. 

I don’t know how to get out of this cycle. My bachelors degree got me nowhere and going back to school is costly and honestly not sure if it’s something I can swing. I would need to leave this rural area but that costs money too. It feels like a catch-22: I am trying to think and plan and save for the future but I never get anywhere. I want to enjoy the present- it feels like I can’t have both. 

Every time I start to dream reality crashes back. I feel trapped- I feel alone. I make “too much”to get support from the government but yet I am living without a doctor, dentist, therapist, eye care. I do not have a savings because the bills take everything. Some days I do not eat. I feel like a failure to my family and friends. I want things to get better but I feel like I don’t have the resources (or the focus) for any significant change. I can identify what would make my life better, but it’s all out of reach.

864,Retail Hellworld (EU),"I am in central EU.

In my final semester to get a bachelors degree in a STEM field, I have more time on my ends due to various reasons (finished some stuff last semester and COVID).

I decided I want to work saturdays in retail. Something physical, something ""easy"" where I only need to use my body and not to think. I wanted to put stuff in shelfs. On saturdays.

So one month of job hunting later I found out one thing really quick:

No matter if you go for a blue collar student sidejob, or a white collar part time job, you have to deal with a lot of coorparate BS.

Filling out personality quizes, brutal and stupid job interviews. Time consuming stupid questions. You have to lie, you have to decive, you have to play ""their game"". 

HR can go fuck themselves.

I have a lot of stories, but this is the one from the job I finally got.

After working a day of unpaid labour ""to see if I am the right one"", the boss said he will take me.
But only after I promised to at least work for 1 year. LOL, I will move to a different city after summer to go on make my masters. But thats something you are not allowed to say.

You must show that you will ""live"" for the company. You dont exist outside of it.

Anyway, after he said he will take me I should drive 20 minutes to a different retailer shop of the same brand to sign my contract. Why not send it to me? Or just print it out here...whatever OK I got the job, nice.

So I go there, only to meet the boss of the boss who is the boss of all the bosses in the area. Evil aura from the guy. He didnt know that I am coming today and was instantly pissed off and arrogant af.

Also: SURPRISE INTERVIEW he decided to do. I wasnt prepared to answer all this questions about HIS company (how many products do we have, how many people work for ME) etc. 

Bad vibes.

After some time another person joins the interview. He got the same order as I, to come here and sign.

But the guy looked quite feminime appearently, so the manager started to mock his voice and appearence and only called him ""young lady"". The guy was shocked and afraid. I was angry af.


In Europe we generally have strong labour laws and unions. The manager started to explain all my rights and union stuff to me. While he does, he had a look of disgust on his face. He hates the union and labour laws, it was obvious.

After a shitload of time I got my contract signed. The other guy didnt. The manager didnt like him/her. Due to sexist reasons I assume. We both worked unpaid in order to get this job only to meet Satan himself.

Anyway, the pay is bad, the work is easy to understand (but they chose to not explain stuff to me, but scream at me for not knowing stuff --&gt; learning by doing as they call this BS) and I will quit in 2 months and I will do it by surprise, maybe on a busy saturday.


I skipped a lot of things but you get the idea.

The world is insanely stupid. You can only work, even unskilled help-jobs, if you manage to climb an iron wall full of capitalist coorperate BS and lie lie lie.

Also my contract says 6 hours per week. I only worked full 9 or 10 hours so far. They dont give a shit about my contract. And the moment I will complain, they will let me off. Before I try to talk to the union, I would rather quit this shit. Takes less time and effort.

865,I Hate Being Forced To Stay At Work When There Is Nothing to Do,"At my job, being sent home when there is no work (without having to use PTO) is at a supervisors discretion.  

My new supervisor refused to do it.  And it drives me insane.  

The other day, the machine I run went down 8 hours into a 12 hour shift.  

A mechanic came over, said ""Oh this down the rest of the shift and into next, everyone else is busy and I can't get this done by myself.""

So I call my supervisor over.  Mechanic tells him what he told me.  I ask if I can go home.  He responds, ""Only if you use PTO.""  I ask why.  My old supervisor basically threw us out the door in these situations.  He told me it's his discretion, and I should be *grateful* that I'm getting paid four hours to do nothing.  

Fine.  Whatever.  

So I go into the break room so I can at least try to entertain myself on my phone.  About 30 minutes later he sees me there and asks what I'm doing.  I tell him, I'm killing the next four hours.  

""Oh no....you have to stay on the floor.""


Why?  Do you have something for me to do?  

""No, just sit by your machine.""


Now this is real BS.  Can I use my phone on the floor?  No.  Can I read a book or magazine?  No.  Can I walk around and talk to other coworkers?  No, I'd be ""distracting them and causing safety and productivity issues.""

So I just had to sit in a chair.  For four hours.  And stare at everyone else working. 

Now, did I make over $100 in those four hours?  Yes.  Was it worth it?  Absolutely not.  


There was no reason to not send me home, other than having a supervisor with small dick energy who needed to exert control over me to feel good about himself.",False,mwioy7,adocdt,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mwioy7/i_hate_being_forced_to_stay_at_work_when_there_is/,33,1

882,We are generation fucked.,"I try to remain optimistic, but it's really hard to when the future does not look good.

Currently, a large amount of our political body on both a state and federal level is composed of old boomers who have little to no clue about things like the internet, or the state of the economy for people age 35 and under. 

Over 31% of all single family homes are owned by landlords, and that number climbs daily because homes bought by landlords rarely get sold to non-landlord buyers. We are seeing an increase in the number of large corporations including blackrock buying up massive amounts of real estate.

Those wanting to find a ""starter"" or fixer upper home are left in the dust because of how popular it is for flipping houses. They buy a house for $100k, spent $30k on it, and somehow can add another $30k in value because of the $30k in improvements. So the $100k house becomes a $160k house with only $30k in improvements. These flippers often have massive capital and can buy in cash, wish is pretty much a death blow to anyone needing to purchase with a mortgage. 

Not only is college expensive as hell, with the rates continuing to constantly outpace inflation, it is said the ""total cost"" of a master's degree including loan interest, room and board, etc is about $400,000.

The median wage of a master's holder is $68,000 according to the BLS, and the median of someone who went only to high school is about $38,000, a $30,000 difference per year.

This means it would currently take a little over **13 years** to make up the difference of just having went to high school, and that is only IF you find a job. 41% of recent graduates are currently working in a job that does not require a college degree at all. You'll find them sobbing in the break rooms of McDonald's and Walmart stores nationwide because their high school teachers told them on a daily basis they would be a garbage truck driver the rest of their life, unless they went to college. I always wonder if high school teachers got some sort of kickback for this propaganda. 

This means on a 30 year career, a master's holder will have earned about 1.6 million (including the education costs), while someone who went to high school will have earned about 1.1 million. That's a lot of extra work to not even double your money.  Don't forget at that salary, you will also need to pay for health insurance. A lot of high school graduates are on state plans, and I didn't factor that in either. 

Regarding earning, adjusted for inflation, people who have a college degree are earning less than the ones who graduated in 1990. 

Speaking of college, it costs next to nothing to attend public school from K-12. Maybe $100-$200 per year for registration, calculator, notebook paper, binder, supplies, etc. But somehow people lose their shit when we should be able to go to college for free. 

In 1990, the price of a new car was about $15k, or $30,400 today. However the average new price of a car is now $40,000. I know newer cars have more safety features, but I highly doubt they have nearly 10 grand in safety features. 

In 1990, the median home value was $79,100 or $160k today. Today, the median home price is about $230,000, a $69,000 increase (nice).

We are truly fucked. I don't see this changing soon either. We are getting paid less and being charged more, and both figures go up (housing / education) and down (wages) every year .

We've all been hoodwinked to think we have to go to college and we have to get a good job to become successful and I strongly disagree with this notion. 

College degrees have been diluted to the point you need to have 8 years of college to even think about getting a six figure income and even then it's going to be highly competitive.

Students accumulate so much debt before they enter the real world, and receive almost zero education as to how to manage money, that they're crippled before they even get out of the gate and yes it is intentionally designed this way. It is called wage slavery.

My advice is always to work for yourself. Go to school if you require a set of skills that you can only learn at a school otherwise focus your resources on providing a product or a service that people need. Get a job to supplement your income so you survive while growling your business but have your job become secondary income as soon as possible and before long you won't need the job at all.

Provide your product or service at a profit and reinvest your profits into providing more of this product or service. If you hit capacity then start another business or invest your extra capital into assets and let your money go to work for you.

You have to become a problem solver. You have to learn how to think critically. You're going to be surrounded by people coming up with problems but if you can be the one to come up with the solutions you'll easily become successful. 

My apologies if this post comes off as braggy, it's meant to be eye opening and inspirational. I feel bad for much of the workforce because people think they have no opportunities available. Opportunities are always available but if you're not looking for them you're not going to see them. Opening your eyes is step one.

887,"""Sorry guys, no raises this year. It's just not in the budget :(""","I would rather deliver this criticism directly to leadership at my company, but they have made it abundantly clear that they will have none of that, so I'm sharing with you all.

Earlier this year, in February or so, the CEO of my company made an announcement to us all that due to financial hardships related to the COVID-19 pandemic, no one would be receiving merit-based raises. To be honest, I saw it coming; it struck me as something every company would do regardless of how much the pandemic really affected them. That didn't make the announcement any less disappointing, but whatever, we moved on.

Shortly after that announcement, the CEO also announced that the company was closing on an acquisition of another company. Naturally, this rubbed people the wrong way. A few reached out to leadership and pointed out the suspicious and tone-deaf timing between the company stating ""we can't afford to give you raises"" and ""we just spent who knows how much money to potentially acquire more business.""

Leadership responded, but their response was, of course, lacking. Someone stated that the company has two budgets: one for merit-based pay increases and other incentives, and a second for basically everything else. That was the best ""explanation"" we were given as to why we got nothing, and we were discouraged to probe further. I'm sure many others saw, as I did, that they just found a polite way to say ""we had the money but didn't think you deserved it.""

Fast forward to this week. Our supervisors schedule everyone specifically to watch a video. The video was of an awards and recognition ceremony - essentially a glorified meeting where some members of the company receive a shout-out from leadership. Each of these ceremonies has a theme, and my supervisor in particular was very giddy to announce that this ceremony's theme would be based on ""The Office."" She said there would be a 'special surprise' related to the theme.

I wish I could say this as a joke, folks, but I must say I was absolutely surprised to discover that the company paid for Brian Baumgartner and Oscar Nunez (the actors for Kevin and Oscar, respectively, from The Office) to make a couple of statements specifically for this reward ceremony.

As I listened to the actors' statements, I was filled once again with a deep-seated rage towards the financial irresponsibility of our company. I'm sure others were too, but leadership must have anticipated such criticism because comments for the video were disabled. Once again, they made it abundantly clear that criticism would not be tolerated.

I just can't imagine anyone being happy about this! Who gives a fuck about a pre-recorded statement from two actors? Our company decided to fork money over to literal multi-millionaires instead of giving their workers a goddamn cent. And they even did this after fucking their employees over the first time by nabbing a subsidiary instead of rewarding them for the work they did.

And the best I can do in terms of rebellion is typing this up while I should be working instead - which I absolutely did. I'm so furious but there's basically nothing I can do but share my frustrations with people on the internet.

907,It must be nice ....,"Let me start ... Yeah I am white (sorry, but I didn't get a choice ... I grew up poor AF ... my dad was alcoholic .... I had to wear my sisters clothes to school because my dad prioritized drinking over making sure his son wasn't the laughing stock of the school. Yeah I got beat on ... laughed at ... but that gave me the strength to want to be something better than my dad. No one feels bad for me ... they say it's my ""privilege speaking"" when I say I am offended that people assume I have a decent car because I am white. Everyone wants to take me down because I had it too easy in life because I am white. I am a Gen X fin-tech worker. 

Years ago I worked in a video store .... cool job ... got to talk to a lot of people and was around movies all the time which certainly beat packing grocery store shelves. 

Packing grocery store shelves is a horrible job, it paid 7 bucks an hour, I was demeaned by my a-hole boss that cared about quotas more than me and I injured my back ... I maybe made $2000 the entire time I worked there, but at the time it was hard to get a job, times are obviously different now (and we should be thankful for that). 

Anyway, I ended up beating out literally 100 other people to get a job working at the local video store ... it also paid 8 bucks an hour ... but I wasn't going to injure my back. This was the early 90's, again ... way more willing workers than jobs ... at least where I lived. 

A tow truck driver used to come in when I was working nights and say ""it must be nice"" ... suggesting that I didn't work as hard as him and that somehow I am less of a person or I am contributing less. I learned at that time that ... if you look at someone else and say ""it must be nice"" ... then you should become them ... not bitch about them. The reality is this douche didn't want my job because he made 5 times as much driving his tow truck. 

As someone who didn't get ANY time off during the pandemic, I would say to myself ""it must be nice"" to be running out of stuff to watch on netflix while I went to soul-sucking meetings on zoom at a job I hated. But I forget ... that I probably got paid more than those people ... and I could just quit or get myself fired and I'd be in their position. 

My friend runs a small finance company and is loaded ... he pays his workers OK but he makes 10 times what they do .. ""must be nice"". he has a ton of new stuff all the time ... takes time off during the day, vacations a lot. What I didn't see is him doing stuff I would never do, risking his house to start a business ... suffering for ten years and nearly losing his wife. Now he's made it... but he recently attempted to take his own life because he is so damned miserable, while I sit and say ""it must be nice"" for him having that sweet new Tesla model S, I realize that I am an ignorant a\*\* for judging him ... it's not nice ... he took a hard path, he actually succeeded ... and he's still miserable. 

I f\*\*ing hate working, CEO's make way too much money compared to their employess, college is WAY too expensive and locks so many people out of getting ahead. I ruined my 20's studying when I could have been drinking and banging. For that I make more money, but I hate working ... it sucks my soul .. and I am trapped. People look at me and say ""it must be nice"" having that sweet house. 

The truth is though ... it's all a choice ... except for our genetics, our parents, our school teachers ... lal of which we can't choose, the rest of that is your choice. If you think it would be nice to be a CEO ... be one ... a stoner ... be one. If you think you should be able to be a stoner and still have the CEO's house ... then you are a fool. 

I realize I am on my way to a million downvotes .... my point is that you can't look at other people and assume things are unfair ... you don't know sh\*t ... it just makes you weak and privileged. I want a better way too ... I dream for a 4-day work week ... my life has been ruined by being a corporate slave ... but I have been around enough to know that the government isn't going to fix it ... Nike is not going to fix it ... only I can fix it ....

921,Should he work while he's injured?,"To give you a bit of a background, my husband and I got married three months ago. He started working in a rail yard where he drives a truck that moves the boxes. He also climbs up on train cars and locks the cars in place, even though that's not a part of his job description. He is required to work at least 68 hours a week.

He is 21 years old and already struggles with his knees. He has to wear knee braces everyday and often times I push him to ice his knees after work. Yesterday he slammed his worst knee into a metal wall and definitely sprained it. There is no swelling or bruising, but he limps when he walks and is in so much pain that he can't sleep. When he bends his knee it makes a scratching noise and you can feel something rubbing on something else. 

He works 12-hour shifts and, at the speed that he is bringing in money, we could have our student debt, a house, and savings paid for in less than 4 years. The only way we could do this is if he got a promotion in 6 months. Normally this promotion would take two years to get, but they're really low on people, so his manager promised him that he would get it in six months if he never took a day off and worked really hard. We are worried that if he takes off a day to care for his leg the manager will go back on his word and he will have to work this strenuous job for even longer. 

If he continues to work and put so much pressure on his legs, the adventures that we are saving up for in the next couple of years (hikinh the Appalachian trail, visiting Israel, etc) he won't even be able to do because of his joints. We can't decide if he should take a day off or continue working and hope that his knee heals despite all of the pressure being put on it. He talked to a supervisor today and asked that he not be put on the trains today. The supervisor agreed not to but, as soon as his shift ended, the next supervisor forced him to get onto the trains. 

He is planning on filling out a incident report and asking them about workers comp, but, since the agreement between the manager and him about the promotion in 6 months wasn't in writing, we're concerned that he'll go back on his word. We're 21 years old and we don't know what to do, or if this is really what the whole Workforce is like.

It provides me with my health insurance, which is a requirement since I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2019. I have no visible symptoms, but I have cognitive fog, which especially gets bad under stress and depression. So I apologize for any grammatical errors and such moving forward. It's been really hard to focus and think clearly lately.

Despite having health insurance, I still have to pay hundreds of dollars for MRIs, and I got my last bill for my infusion (my drug modifying therapy which is supposed to prevent new lesions from forming on my brain and spinal cord), which was about 1,000 dollars. The full price? 100,000 dollars. My mouth dropped when I saw that price. I was appalled, and mostly disgusted at our pharmaceutical industry for how they take advantage of people who just don't want to get sicker. I now fear not being without health insurance, and employer provided insurance is my best option. The marketplace plans are hundreds a dollars a month with high deductibles that wouldn't even cover me until after 1000+ of my own money.

I got diagnosed with MS in grad school actually, studying for the career I currently have. By the time I graduated, I was working 60 hour weeks between my full time job and doing an unpaid internship. A lot of my classmates were surprised I was doing this, but I didn't have a choice. I needed to pay rent, bills, and desired health insurance (which then I was diagnosed with MS, so then became needed). I tried to ask my job at the start of my fieldwork to lower my hours from 40 to 30 (still full time, so I could still have benefits), but they didn't budge. They couldn't work around it they said. My company even had a internship program for the exact field I was studying for, but company policy stated you couldn't work for them and be in the program, which made no sense, since I already was familiar with everything, and the particular clientele. Hence I struggled to find a fieldwork site initially, because places wanted hours while I worked. Most of peers, who were either young 20s and so still on their parent's health insurance and financially supported by them, or older by supported by a spouse, were either working part time jobs or not at all, and so could focus 100% on school and dedicate time to fieldwork at places of their choosing.  You know I got advice to just take out more loans and leave my job? How does that make sense?

While there is not hard set proof, there are links between stress and autoimmune disorders, so I keep wondering if the stress I was going through at the time didn't trigger it. I blame myself, even though I tried what I could to resolve the situation. I even tried looking for different jobs, but they usually paid less and I couldn't afford the pay hit.

After my diagnosis, I sat with my supervisors at my job at the time and I told them that there may be times I have to leave mid work for an appointment. For anyone who has had to schedule with a specialist before, you understand. They're booked months in advance. I tried to be helpful and schedule my appointments around work hours, or if necessary at the end or beginning of my shifts. But if my neurologist was only available at a 12 o'clock, this particular day for the next 3 months, well I needed to go.

One of my bosses looked me in the eyes and said, ""Customer care comes first. This company pays for your insurance.""

You can imagine my reaction. I was fighting back tears at that point. I cried later on and that's when I realized all the times I had busted my ass for that program and company meant nothing. Prior till then, I was under the illusion that, ""They can't risk to lose me, I work too hard. I've held this program down. It wouldn't exist without me."" When I started working in that program, there was 3 of us working it. One was let go, and the other was frequently gone, as she was older and dealing with her own abundance of health issues. Many times I was the only one working that program, due to her frequent call outs, doctors appointments, and medical procedures. I held it down. Even when I was told they wouldn't hire a temp worker to help me while my coworker was on leave for 3 months due to FMLA. I did it.

Then boom, this diagnosis happened. You never think it'll happen to you until it does. One day, I was at work, super stressed, and the next day I wake up and can't see out of one eye (optic neuritis, which is usually the onset of MS, my vision was fixed with steroids thankfully). 

Since then, I haven't trust a company to take care of me, to genuinely care about me. I did go to HR with what my boss said, and they sided with them, because they did apologize to me... in an email, sent after I was off the clock. HR also put words in my mouth, and I realized HR wasn't meant to protect me either. They were meant to protect the company, the upper managment. Me? They could give less a fuck about me.

So I ended up moving to a state with lower cost of living after graduate school, because loans, amirite? 

I live in a questionable area of my city, and while I can afford the rent and bills on my salary, this apartment is terrible. Walls are paper thin, you hear sex, people yelling at children, dogs barking, even just heavy walking. I've been woken up several times because of it. My packages have been stolen from the front of my door, and now I stop ordering things. 

As I mentioned before, I work 2 jobs. My current job pays me less with a master's requirement, then my previous one which was only bachelor's level, though the cost of living was higher where I held my previous job, so that might have been why. But to offset that, I got a part time job.  I want to move into a nice apartment, start building up my savings again, spend money for ""fun"" without feeling guilty"". I was expecting to make 50k with a masters and that seems like a joke.

But my my part job is more flexible. I can do my schedule however I want, take leave whenever I want, I enjoy it. Only cons are is that it's not hourly, its by client interaction, so if a client doesn't show up to their meeting, I make less (if anything at all), than if they do show up. So, income isn't stable. Also, their healthcare plan is terrible. Their best plan has a 2,000 deductible, and eligibility for benefits doesn't start until you meet so many client hours in a 3 months period. If you fail to meet those requirements during a quarter, you're at risk of losing your insurance. So that's why I'm hesitant to make that job a full time one.

But my mental health has spiraled badly since the end of last year with my full time job. When I started with this particular company last year, I signed up for a position that while wasn't 100% what I was looking for, I'd be working with customers that I preferred, so I jumped on. Plus I was grateful just to find a job during a pandemic. But, when I started, I quickly realized I wasn't going to be doing what I signed up for at all. In fact, they had me working a lot in a different program, with a different client population, and not doing at all what I expected. I began to dread clocking in. Every time my phone went off, my anxiety spiked. Also, my shift was less than ideal, and I had no set break, so sometimes I just went an entire shift without eating, or taking a break in general.

I wanted to get out and get closer to what I wanted to do, and so when the opportunity arose, I applied for a different internal position and switched.

And since then, my health has continued to plummet. 

I was poorly trained, and now receive upwards to 10+ emails daily of my fuckups. Asking why I did this, or that, and asking me to redo documents and reports. I literally have closed outlook on my work laptop, because just hearing or seeing the notification of a new email gives me an anxiety reaction. One of the work things is the productivity. The numbers game. I have to have so many meetings a week to meet productivity. But some things are out of my control. Sometimes customers don't answer the phone. Sometimes they don't want to talk to me. I keep getting told I'm not meeting productivity. My supervisor asks me why are my meetings so short. The amount of time she asks for keeps getting longer and longer. Like the emails.

Oh the emails.

She'll state sharply in an email something I did wrong, or ask why I did something, and throw out, ""We'll talk about in supervision."" Then we never have it. Or it's like 2 minutes. Literally this week she went on my calendar and scheduled over it.  And since my MS diagnosis, my memory sucks now. I can't keep track of stuff she needs to talk to me about, and I feel like I shouldn't have to. I mean, if you want to talk to me about something, make a note, and actually have supervision with me.

I can no longer keep up with the emails, or the reports. I'm literally up all night working. Averaging 2 hours of sleep a night. Part of it is due to my concentration. It's really hard to focus, and the stress and depression I've been feeling has only had it worse. I'll start a report, lose focus for like 10 minutes, and repeat this cycle. I frustrate myself for long long it takes things to get done. I used to be able to multitask, but I don't think I can anymore. And the amount of stuff my supervisor puts on me without explanation or support is driving me insane. She's even began to say we have to modify our personal time for work if it comes down to it, which I am **not** okay with. I have my schedule, and I won't budge it.

I'm starting to cry before clocking into work now. When it's Sunday I start to shut down emotionally and mentally. I lack sleep whether it's because I'm working or due to anxiety about work. Passive suicidal ideation which was gone is now creeping back. Depression that was gone is now back in full force and has sucker punched me in the face. And as of recently, my full time job is affecting my part time job. I am getting behind on reports there, because I'm so busy doing shit for my full time job. Or I happen to pass out due to sleep exhaustion, or crying, whatever it may be.

I haven't told my current company about my MS diagnosis, because honestly I felt like it wasn't their business. After how the last company treated me, I don't trust to be protected, and because I haven't been with them a full year, I can't apply for FMLA yet, which the fact that it has to be a year is bullshit.

Up until the current job, things were fine, so I really think the stress and my mood has impacted my cognitive fog to where it impacts my work. Everyday I fear new lesions possibly forming, or having another flare up due to the stress. I know it'll only get worse if I stay.

I've tried doing this the safe way. I've applied to other jobs, and have all the education and experience they're asking for. But I've been facing rejections.

I think to myself, ""Fuck man, if only I was married to a spouse who could financially support me for the time being and give me their health insurance, I'd be out, like **yesterday**."" 

My other option is just make the job and make my part time job my full time job. I enjoy it more, there are no productivity standards, it's actually the type of work I want to do, and the flexibility is amazing. I can probably set my schedule to have a 3 day weekend, which I do miss having. Also, depending on how many customers I see, I could make more at that job than what I currently do now.

Seems like a no brainer right? But I'm scared of that unstable income (since it's not hourly) and am stuck on that health insurance. I'd have to get a marketplace plan, and I checked today and the best one (still with the same company, because I don't want to switch doctors) was like 330 dollars (with a tax credit). 

But this system sucks.

You do the work, get higher education because it's what to you're told to do, in my case I had to to do what I wanted to do.

And then when you have a chronic illness, it's a whole other ball game, because you need health insurance for your medicine or treatment, but may be locked into a terrible company because the USA thinks socialized healthcare is fucking evil for whatever reason. 

So you continue to work, while your condition gets worse. In the case with autoimmune disorders, stress can make it worse, so you only get worse, and yet you can't quit, because the anxiety of medical debt paralyzes you.

I believe the system triggered my MS, and it's just making it worse.

937,Watching my dad (67M) work himself to death. I feel angry and helpless.,"I live in Southern California and the city my father works in passed a temporary mandate that required employers to pay an additional $4 in “hero pay” for the next few months. His company’s response? Shut down the store of course. My mom was also “temporary” laid off during COVID and hasn’t been called back in, so he’s the only one providing a consistent income. 

He has gotten COVID, been hospitalized for a GI infection and has a hernia that he hasn’t been able to take time off to heal or recover from. They schedule him to work closing shifts almost everyday so he doesn’t get much sleep or seem to take sufficient breaks at work because they’re so short staffed. He also got a concussion at work. I’ve begged him to take a sick day off, as I can see he’s clearly in a lot of pain and he refuses to in fear of getting fired. The retail drug store he works at is shutting down in less than a week and they still haven’t told him where he’ll be relocated. Some of his coworkers are having trouble finding a store to accept them because they “don’t work hard enough” and the store “doesn’t want them”.  It’s driving me nuts, I’m so angry but it doesn’t feel like there’s much I can do. He’s in a union but it seems pretty useless and the staff is afraid to do anything that would compromise their job. 

Growing up and seeing my immigrant parents work so hard to make ends meet..going above and beyond only to be exploited and never recognized for their work has made me hate capitalism before I even knew what the word for it was. My parents would always say “this country will work you to bone” or “work you until your dead”. It’s true. There’s no safety net or support system for us, the bills keep coming either way. I used to work retail for five years until quitting right before the pandemic lockdown and dedicating myself to school full time. I feel guilty for not working, but being so close to graduating from university I’m not sure if I’d be able to handle the load of work and school anymore. I’m exhausted. I’ve considered dropping out a few times to just work but my parents want me to stay. It’s a lot of intense stress and anxiety to wake up everyday and see how much he’s dealing with and having to pretend it doesn’t affect my daily life.

946,I feel like my issue is ultimately with the system not the actual job.,"My job is very alright compared to something like food service or cashier. I work from home currently and people don't really keep tabs on me. However this makes me feel a lot of stress, there is always something to be done at my job  and it feels like the goal posts are always changing. One day my boss will tell me our new priority and then within a couple days it usually changes without much progress actually being made towards the pursuit. My boss is so busy that he can't really keep track of the things we do, we have a 15 minute meeting every morning where he says we can hit him up with anything, but he usually doesn't respond when I message him and he absolutely doesn't have time to add meetings to his schedule 9/10 days. Because of this I pretty much have to find my own tasks to keep busy and hope that it's correct or satisfactory. 


Maybe this is harder because it's my first job out of school, but I really can't imagine feeling like this for over 40 years with only two days of break every week consistently. Having money to do things is nice, but feels like I sacrifice 5/7 days every week. I'm constantly strssed about my understanding of the business and not being a waste of an employee. My rationale brain is able identify that I shouldn't be that obsessed, but that's where I am mentally. I spend more than half my time doing this during the week.

Don't get me wrong this isn't to say old people shouldn't be working....( God knows nobody should be working really).. but why do older people work past retirement? 

I've seen so many tragic posts in this thread about loved ones and others making it to retirement age only to spend a month or two really enjoying their ultimate reward after a life of servitude because of an untimely death or being stricken with an illness. 

There is also a huge amount of people who are forcibly retired after suffering from a mental illness like Dimentia or Alzheimers. If we find this to be the case more often than not why would so many people choose to work after they have reached their supposed ""golden years""?

 Unfortunately the answers to this question are all too common and continously coincide with a great deal of what we deal with when we are forcibly thrusted into this evil contract. These people are either still trying to make money to live because of a failed social security system, they are trying to give themselves a sense of purpose because they never had time to find out who they were when they were being overworked, or they have been tricked into thinking that they must contribute to society in some way to ""earn"" their right to be here. The fact that most  of the elderly go through this is sick and infuriating.

959,Prolonging the inevitable (my life story),"This is gonna sound crazy but I wanted to fail my Senior year of High School. Why? You might ask. 

I transferred from another school my Junior year and no one in my classes would talk to me so I made friends younger than me during lunch who were in a similar situation being Freshmen and all. Naturally I was their leader which was a power trip in and of itself. We would cut classes and hangout near the campus and at kids homes when the parents were at work. Fast forward to Senior year and not much changed, except I fell in love with a girl a grade lower. At this point a couple months away from graduation I’m almost certain I’m not gonna graduate since I failed every junior class. I was oddly ok with that. 

The school is located in a somewhat impoverished suburb. It was not unusual for kids to have failed a grade previously and so there was a lot of 19 year old seniors. I was willing to purposely fail my senior year to stick around with my tight-knit group of friends and to have a chance at my first relationship with the girl I had fallen in love with. But on the literal last week of school, they sat me down at a computer lab and force fed me the answers to tests in a “credit recovery” program and pretty much made me to graduate. Their reasoning was that I was literate, and had scored highly on the state exams. They looked me in the eye and said in so many words: “We know you’re playing dumb”. I was bewildered because I had spent the whole certain that I was gonna fail and repeat. I walked out the door on the last day of school knowing I was now an adult who had to start doing something. 

I ended up doing nothing for 6 months still in shock. I finally enrolled in the spring semester at my community college but I must admit I would frequent my high school campus to hangout with my friends when my classes were over. It was different because I had a car and we would drive around the city doing dumb stuff. We did this the next year too until I dropped out of community college to join the Army. I had four months to prepare so I planned on just spending it messing around with my friends who were still in school. We had fun all the way till spring break when Covid hit. My basic training got delayed 2 weeks and we renegotiated my contract till July, before I ultimately decided not to go under the circumstances of a pandemic. 

I’ve been working almost a year for the first time in my life. I just got in to student housing at the four year university. When I look back at the last three years I can now see that all my fears were true. Becoming an adult truly does suck. The expectations are for you to work 47-49 years till retirement. Except even then there’s still a bunch of coworkers I’ve had in their 70s claiming they can’t afford to retire. I tell you, I used to feel ashamed of thinking like Peter Pan but now I see it as the only rational response when faced with corporate serfdom. I now plan on staying in college for as long as possible as well. This time no one can force me to graduate. And I get to prolong the inevitable entering of the workforce. To many this may seem very immature. But I would posit that getting a good paying job (along with higher tax burdens and financial responsibilities) is consumerist and that consumerism is much more childish than delaying “adulthood”. 

I don’t want to drive a Mercedes-Benz if it means I have to sacrifice my free time. I don’t want to live in a “safer” neighborhood if it means I have to work more. Hell, I don’t think I even want to have children. I’m so disillusioned that my personal strategy is to just lay low and frankly, underachieve. The capitalists will say that I’m lazy, but I see it as a defensive mechanism much in the same manner as how poor apartment residents leave trash outside to keep rent prices low as a means of self survival. 

For now I will keep selling my plasma to the vampires to afford food. And I will pay rent by working 20 hours a week around my own apartment complex. I’ll take one or two classes per semester.

968,"There are no real alternatives to wageslavery. For years I've been trying to find any business idea so I could do that instead of rot at some job. The past few weeks I've been frantically researching extra hard, and I truly believe that it takes a 1 in a million stroke of luck to be self-employed.","I don't even need to make a lot of money. I'd be happy to make even less than I would wageslaving, just to have my own little business.

But it's just not as possible as people make it seem. 

I've been reading books, scouring the internet, browsing every community related to business and entrepreneurship. It's mostly just smoke and mirrors, very real substance. Even when it comes to books written by respected people who really are rich, there's just nothing there that's real advice, applicable to normal people.

**But there's a lot of options people could point to, to make you look lazy.** Like go be a plumber or an electrician. Yeah, go and wreck your body. Luckily I'm not healthy enough to even consider those options, those would turn your body into a mess in just a few years.

Of course a lot of people are desperate to find their own niche, so there's a lot of advice out there. And there's good advice too, but it's just so ... tone-deaf. ""Find a burning need/problem people have, and provide solutions!"". Yeah that obviously makes sense, that's the basis of business pal. But when you ask how exactly would you do that, the answers are lacking. And even if you can do that, guess what, any need that a small business could fulfill was already fulfilled. Anything left simply isn't possible for small businesses, it takes the efforts and capital of enormous corporations. 

So the options that are really left are more like ... gambling. Things that are one in a million. Same as hoping that you strike gold with a business idea. Like writing a novel that becomes popular. A youtube channel that becomes popular, streaming, drawing etc... Things millions of people do for years without getting more than 2 viewers, and yet everybody thinks they'll make it, they point to the ones that did make it as examples that these are indeed options. 

Or alternatively they'll tell you to invest, or crypto, daytrading etc... ideas not really worth discussing. Or learn to code. I could make a whole other post about this, but it's just such stupid advice. There's so many people who actually studied this for years, got degrees, and can't find jobs. And yet just go learn coding bro, that'll work out.

It's all so exhausting. I spent so much time researching to find just something, anything at all. And yet I'm left even more pessimistic than before. Nothing left to do but resign myself to my fate of wageslavery, and try to become numb. Wish I at least had the option to save up and retire early, but not in this god forsaken country with its piss low wages.",False,mun56f,dadasad2125,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mun56f/there_are_no_real_alternatives_to_wageslavery_for/,47,1

996,"All Set, for Now","I used to work in a factory office, handling paperwork and quality assurance. Was there three years, since I was 21 to 24. I had a mental breakdown there, due to the stress of the long hours I forced on myself (damn societal expectations and peer-pressure), and had to undergo treatment for all the things that arose with it for several years.

I recently returned to that place this March, because, honestly, it was the best place I could find. I closed a deal for half days, four days a week, with a higher salary than I had before, and, having learned I can actually say 'no' to my superiors requests for overtime or doing something that is not part of my role, I now handle everything pretty well.

I also suffer from an autoimmune illness, treatment for which renders me very tired and exhausted more often than not. Luckily, my country leans towards socialism and I get a 'living grant' due to my disabilities.

This is not a dream job by any means, but it's now relatively stress-free for me, and I enjoy it at least a small bit. The people are also very nice and well-meaning, and I have a very good relationship with my supervisor. I also make decent money, well above minimum wage.

Still, having most of my day dedicated to work, returning home exhausted only to do chores and sleep until morning is very taxing on me.

I thought it was $3 an hour but talked to him tonight and I misremembered it. His brother worked at the same one and confirmed it as well.

He will be 70 this year and started working at a rubber hose factory in 1970 for a starting wage of $4.50 per hour. He was a factory production worker. Not supervisor or anything above a regular worker.

This is $30.72 an hour today. We all know the inflation calculator is ""broken"" because housing costs, healthcare, education, etc have all outpaced inflation. 

The factory is still there, curious I looked on Glassdoor and some other sites and their starting wage is only $14-$16 an hour, for the same role my dad had. 

Now lets have a look here:

[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015021301612&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=406](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015021301612&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=406)

In some states, like Ohio, production workers were earning $5.12/hr in 1974, or $27.50 today, averaging about 41 hours a week, which would be $1127.50 a week today. 

That's $58,630 a year with no college needed. 

Reading down further, 75% of plant workers got **7 days of PAID holidays** or more, and 3 weeks of PAID vacation each year after 10 years of service, 30% getting 2 weeks after their 1st year. 

**It gets worse.** 

In 1975, in Cleveland, a union laborer or helper (basically someone nailing plywood to a house frame) made $8.10 an hour, or **$39.88** today. Today, even a union laborer in Ohio only makes about $22 per hour. 

In 1975, the median weekly earnings of ALL workers was $185 per week, or $910 today. 

A white male over the age of 25 made $235 a week or $1156 today. Today the median for all workers is only $989 per week, and with all the equality laws passed since then, means most people are paid about $250 per week less than in 1970.

In 1975, retail trade workers earned **$3.34 an hour** which would be **$16.44** today.",False,muk6t1,_Raspootin_,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/muk6t1/here_is_great_link_if_you_want_to_make_yourself/,52,1
1001,What's more valuable?,"I am as feminist as they come. But having become very disillusioned with the world of work in general, and also the sheer number of Bullshit Jobs (David Graeber) I've re-assessed my former judgement of housewives (and indeed, house husbands, let's get more men on that so it doesn't remain as gendered a role. Plenty of men would be happy to to take on this role).

How is looking after a home, doing chores that probably won't get done if both are working full time and always bloody exhausted, looking after and caring for a family, either your kids or just you and your partner if no kids, making sure there is decent food on the table and not just ready meals as again you're both otherwise working full time and probably too exhausted, any less valuable than working? Any less valuable than most of the Bullshit paperpushing Jobs on offer? It's NOT. It's just as valuable to be a housewife/husband. In some cases I would say it is MORE valuable, it is MORE meaningful. Especially if there are kids involved, and also even if there isn't.

David Graeber states that those in Bullshit Jobs are more likely to become burnt out and depressed because they know their work is meaningless and has no value. But yet we are told that being a housewife is not as good or as valuable as sitting in an office looking at spreadsheets all week.

Look after home and family, Vs paperpushing for some office or bank or whatever? What's more valuable? Why do so many people judge those that are full-time housewives/husbands?

1018,Yesterday I had an interview.,"Currently working as a low tier design engineer at a job really far from home, I have to commit pretty heavy amounts of time for commute and have to work 40h+/week on top of it. WFH made this easier but I never want to go back to 5 days/week there.

So I tried applying at other jobs closer to where I live, to get better conditions and maybe less hours.  I had one interview for an automation job, and it was a total disaster.

They offered me, literally, the most average salary you can get (they actually just go check stats and tell you ""you get the avg salary for a xx years engineer, non negotiable""). The engineering director who interviewed me said, in his words "" we look for people with passion, not people who count hours. You wouldn't play music (interest listed on CV) 2 hours and a day and just 15 mins the next because you did more the day before. We want people who will still come in even if they win the loto, they'll just come in with a lamborghini"". What in the f*ck is this? Who in the world would accept such a trashy offer? Are employers now 'expecting' you to have no life and take your job as the primordial aspect of your life? Why would I work 40h/week+ if I don't need money anymore?

This interview hit me in the face with realism and I now see there is somethig very wrong with the system.

Needless to say, after the interview I immediately made it known I do not wish to push for the job an rescind my application.

I will be using gender-neutral pronouns and keeping it as vague as possible because who the fuck knows who lurks this sub so sorry for any confusion.

&amp;#x200B;

So this was in 2018. I applied through a temp agency and got placed in a warehouse pick/pack position. Normally I am completely averse to warehouse work, but this was a very small setting and is owned by the family of an extremely famous musician who you've heard of. The direct supervisor and supervisor of the warehouse were both great to work for. I started as a packer, then they transitioned me to being a picker, where I excelled to the point that eventually I was doing pretty much anything they needed me to do. I didn't mind because, again, I liked working for the people, it wasn't a hard job, and it was Monday-Friday with no mandatory overtime. For a warehouse that is fucking unheard of. The commute was only about 20 minutes as well, which was nice.

Anyway. For about three months I was probably the most trusted employee there (as far as the regular employees went). There were a lot of shitty workers, and by that I mean workers who would come in, talk and fuck around on their phones, then get mad when they were reprimanded for it and start talking shit about the bosses. One of the people who worked there was a close friend of the boss, and we became really good friends as well. A lot of these people would talk shit about this person too or even straight up bully them to their face, which pissed me off. I ended up basically becoming the warehouse supervisor's eyes and ears, they wanted me to report shit like that because it creates a toxic workplace and they didn't want people like that working there. I agreed with it and was totally fine with doing it. I respected the supervisor, the person they were friends with was my friend now too, and I can't fucking stand being around workplace bullies either.

About five months in, shit completely changed, and I still to this day have no idea what it was. The direct supervisor started cold-shouldering me. The warehouse supervisor was suddenly distant as hell. That probably sounds weird, but before this they would often come into the break lounge on my lunch breaks and we'd shoot the shit for a while. I'm an aspiring novelist and I'd usually bring in my laptop to work on my writing. It turned out they used to live right down the road from one of my favorite authors (again, you've heard of this person), and the supervisor showed me the pictures of their house they had on their phone. They'd ask me about shit out of work, ask how my novel was coming, what it was about, etc. Same thing with my direct supervisor, just not as often because they weren't as available for obvious reasons.

Shit kept getting worse, to the point where if I made one little mistake it was the end of the fucking world. I was reported for giving ""pushback"" to my supervisor (no idea what the fuck they were on about, because I never did anything but what they asked me to the best of my ability). At one point the supervisor just straight blew up on me because I mistakenly grabbed a box of product from one of the trucks that we didn't need yet (there was an unopened box on the floor, on a fucking shelf behind another box that I guess I was just supposed to magically know about). This was on Friday. At the end of the shift they sort of apologized and we seemed cool again, and the warehouse supervisor came out to talk to me about random shit again near the end of the day. I figured maybe they'd just been having bad days or something.

Went home that day, two hours later got an email telling me not to come back Monday. No explanation or anything, just ""Do not return to work on Monday"" with the subject line ""Assignment Ended"". Still, to this day, don't know what the fuck I did. That was the last time I ever put serious effort into a job. I did a shitload of extra work for these people because I actually respected them, there was one day I skipped my lunch break because a bunch of people called out and the supervisors needed help with a specific project. I volunteered for it just because I wanted to help out. My thanks was being shitcanned without any notice whatsoever.

&amp;#x200B;

The moral of this long tale is: Never fucking go above and beyond for these shit jobs, because you can literally break your back for these people and they'll just use that as an excuse to fire you. Never bother with a two week notice because they will let you go at the end of your shift without an explanation or anything resembling advance notice. I guarantee you they had decided to fire me but waited until the end of my shift so they could get one more day of labor out of me.

Never do above the bare minimum for these people, especially without being told. NEVER. They do not give a fuck about you. To them, you are human labor. Human capital. You are sentient time. Anything BUT human, basically.

1039,"The ""Do what you love"" tax is really depressing","My paycheck just came in, and after my 177$ car payment (my parents recommended that I get a car with this type of payment because my two previous cars were total lemons) I have 100$ left over for the next two weeks.

I'm not even talking like 100$ of fun money, I'm talking 100$ of regular money. Just to not starve I pay 50$ a week in groceries so I'm now in the red, I'm going to have to beg my parents to help me with rent again.

The sad part is that I work two jobs, one of which was *supposed* to be full time. Keyword supposed to be. My main gig is as a field service computer technician. I work for a company that works nationwide, and in fact I'm the only tech in my city. I live in a hippie mountain town about 2 hours away from the nearest big city. I've never even met my supervisor in person, my job is just me and the clients. I just show up, install the part, and leave, and for the most part it's awesome. The pay even ranges from meh to pretty good.

The thing is though, the company didn't do any field research before they hired me, so I was effectively lied to in the interview. In the interview they said that I would be getting between 3 and 8 calls per day, and that it roughly equals a full time position. For reference after working here 3 calls is about a 4-5 hour day and 8 calls is probably a 10 hour day. *But* since like I said nobody else from the company actually lives here, I don't get the advertised number of calls. The *most* I've ever seen is 4, most days range from 1-3. And obviously, I'm paid per call so if I'm not fixing a machine I'm not getting paid.

The other thing I do is teach violin. It's great! I love going into work, the pay is good, the time flies by, I feel like I'm helping people, and I feel confident and professional at what I do. *But* again the caveat is that I only get paid when I am teaching a student, so between two days of teaching I'm working for under 8 hours.

Once everything is added up my hours come out to part time at best and literally nothing at worse. But at the same time I work just enough teaching violin to make getting a full time IT job probably not an option, and teaching violin is what I've always wanted to do anyway.

I had a nice little path laid out last year when I got a job doing help desk at a major company. The schedule was great, the pay was okay, there was the possibility for upward mobility, healthcare, 401k matching whatever that means, all the good stuff. But the environment just totally destroyed me, I was considering drastic things just two weeks into the job, so I quit.

1041,How do you protect your energy in a toxic and drama-filled workplace (that you can't leave)?,"I work in mental health, which means I'm often surrounded by clients with negative emotions, and I'm there to bring some positivity into their lives and help them through their issues as best I can. But my co-workers are often talking about other co-workers behind each others backs and there's a big lack of communication that often results in bigger problems and dramas. This has been going on since the beginning of the year when we became so understaffed and management couldn't sort their shit and the employees are all trying to figure out what to do on their own without any direction from management, which just creates more drama and negativity.

I struggle with protecting my energy. Often when someone near me is in a bad mood that is irrelevant to me I will adopt a bad mood as well. Then when they're upset about something that is relevant to me I also adopt a bad mood, instead of trying to sort through it in a problem-solving approach or even just laughing it off and not taking it so seriously, like with the drama and gossiping stuff. It makes going to work and also not taking it home with me difficult, but I can't quit right now and so I have to find a way to protect my energy and not succumb to the negativity constantly surrounding me at work.

How do you guys do it? I have tried brushing it off and using logic even to understand why I shouldn't let it get to me, but I still fall into the trap of sensitivity and I am in need of advice on what to do.",False,mv3x8q,nuggetyboon,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mv3x8q/how_do_you_protect_your_energy_in_a_toxic_and/,3,1
1042,You lose money for being loyal to a company,"I had to learn this the hard way at an old job. I spent all my 20s at this place and can honestly say I worked harder than anyone there. I was the model employee, no call-outs, no sick time, just put my head down and worked like a dog. The thing is that the raise schedule was so poor that new hires made more money than me and I was actually making less money every year due to inflation. I wasn't learning any new skills and stagnated. So by the end of it all my sacrifices, my labor was for very little.

Loyalty in the modern job market is a one way street. You're expected to sacrifice your life for the Lord class but they will throw you away like used tissue the second you're not profitable. Instead of being loyal to a job, be loyal to yourself. Demand at least a 3% raise every year to at least beat inflation. Learn as much as you can and pad your resume and skillset. When you've been there for 2-5 years start looking at other companies to either get a better job or leverage it into a raise. Never ever be loyal to a company!

The problem I see is everyone has the same problem we work to get money with the goal of not working but it takes so long we keep increasing our expectations of how much money we need to live. We are not gaining skills on how to live well cheaply.

By the time we retire we have become institutionalised into being told what to do so we can no longer occupy ourselves in a meaningful way. So many people retire at 65 and are miserable because they can't think for themselves. My dad has a reasonable pension and is bored shitless. I keep thinking he should have stopped earlier and had less money.

In my early 20s I owned a bag of clothing travelled the world doing work here and there have never been as happy.

So I see the solution is learning to live well on less. With that in mind how little can you live on?

1058,Well it's time to talk crap about my old workplace.,"Not gonna name and shame, but it was a call center job. 

We had 8 days of ""occurrences"". Sounds like a lot, right? Wrong. 

For starters, none of them are paid, full time or not. 

If you rack up 8 sick days, 9th was usually termination.

The occurrences fall off, ONE per 60 days. Meaning you pretty much had a two month probation of not being sick, your car starting every day, not being late, etc. 

They did NOT reset yearly.  So if you got sick once during those 60 days, then you got another occurrence, and the 60 days reset. So it pretty much ran on a principle of one step forward, two steps back. This also encouraged people to show up sick to not reset the clock.

We were required to make a sale on 25% of our calls, but we did not work in sales, we worked in insurance. Some people, mainly girls with more how should I put it ""sweeter sounding voices"" got 50-75%, while us makes often hovered around 15-30%. Call it the ""siren call"" but women seem to do better at selling on the phone, particularly if they have an attractive voice. 

Why should that count against me? I can't force someone to buy something, it's their choice. We could not push on the sale either like car salesman can. We couldn't say ""come on this is a great deal"" or pressure AT ALL, no matter how slight. Why am I being punished for someone's decision? I advertised it politely with all the selling points just like anyone else. 

We were required to be on the phones pretty much all the time, yet had to watch random training videos, answer emails, take surveys from corporate, etc. 

Our time clocks were also on the computer, meaning when I got to work, 5 minutes per day went unaccounted for because it took that long to load the computer and access the time clock...website. It was not even an application. 

Supervisors fucked around all the time. Their time wasn't watched like a hawk like ours were. I remember them walking around saying we need ""everyone on deck"" (what are we on, a pirate ship?) yet I'd routinely see 3-4 supers just standing around shooting the shit. 

We also had our breaks reduced from 20 to 15 minutes, since most were now working from home. The VP put out a video about how much money ""this would save the company"". 

But the people still at the office, a good 25-30%, did not enjoy the break reduction. We were also told to use the bathroom on the break.

So somehow 15 minutes was plenty of time to walk to the break room, get out food and microwave it, eat it, throw away any containers, refill our water, go to the bathroom, wash our hands, and walk back. Ya...no. Not unless your food was in capsule form like on Star Trek. 

Fuck call centers. The job itself was easy, but they made it hell. So many of these workplaces wonder why they can't keep help

Well, maybe don't expect people to talk for 5-10 hours per day nonstop with rarely any downtime between calls. 

I'm considering reporting them for time theft. There is no reason why we had to access a time clock on Kronos website, one could of been installed in the break room or entrance like a normal fucking workplace.",False,mvnbz4,_Raspootin_,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mvnbz4/well_its_time_to_talk_crap_about_my_old_workplace/,2,2

The difference is society. We live in a system designed to extort every ounce of labor out of us. School for over a decade preparing us for it. The job. 8+ long hours. Then we come home exhausted looking for a break. No energy to self improve/work out/eat healthily. We look to doritos and TV. Our phones. In this mindless consumption of media we're given our opinions which keep us in this system. We're also fed ads by the same companies we work for. They give us a tiny percentage of what our labors worth as a paycheck and then try and do manipulate us into giving it right back to them. Like i said, a system designed to extort every ounce of labor out of us. Sure, there are benefits. Understandings of the universe. Healthcare. Other advancements. Most of which we dont get to really appreciate or participate in. The medical industry is corrupt. Most of us have little desire to always spend our free time reading. But we also get cheetos and corn puffs. Hoverboards. Ect. What we get basically consists of comfort and dopamine goodies. Primitive life was hard. Uncomfortable. But it will always be fulfilling in a way that modern life isnt. True freedom. True adventure and excitement. True wonder. This is how humans are supposed to live. Something we need to move back towards. It can be a mix. Most of the good parts of both lifestyles. Modern and primitive. Many people are already doing it. Thing is, more people need to. Once that happens, change will happen, and it will get better for all of us. Food forests. Clean water. Laxxed laws. More support. So I call upon you to question your life.

But in those 30 years, hell became real. 

I did not wake up in my body, but rather having  simultaneous view of the entire United States; it's people, their homes, their places of work, etc. I could hear every voice of every person speaking, and yet understand every word. 

The workplace was, in a word: decimated. Nearly 35 to 40 percent of all jobs were replaced by automation. Stores such as Walmart and Target retrofitted their stores for automated stocking and inventory equipment, cart returns, food disposal, even asset protection was automated. 

An ""observer"" or basically an inspector, but not a manager or paid well, watched over the store daily for any malfunctions in equipment or other problems. The latest version of automation could even repair other machines, a non-working part could be installed by another machine, the parts would arrive on a normal shipment of goods. The trucks were self driving and could reverse to loading doors by themselves and were unloaded by automated equipment. 

The only thing that would prompt human intervention would be damage to the units, such as a heavy item falling onto it, or a software issue causing it to shut down before hitting product or another shopper. 

Every restaurant and fast food establishment was automated, except for a few that catered to the ""real human experience of cooking food"". This was initially sold as being cheaper for the consumer, and it was for a few years as human-held jobs were gotten rid of, but then prices became that of human work levels, solely to enrich the executives and owners. 

Uber and other ride-share services were all automated. Janitorial services were automated. Teaching, except that for anything requiring great skill or hands on experience became automated. Bank tellers, shelf stockers, fry cooks, floor sweepers, hotel workers, front desk workers, receptionists, etc all became automated. A lot of surgical procedures became automated. Automated home construction was in its testing phase. 

Of course, universal basic income did not arrive either. Unemployment was the highest it had ever been. Amazon penned many contracts to built automated equipment and once the processes became more efficient, the people who made the machines were replaced with machines themselves. Almost all of Amazon's operations were now automated. Jeff Bezos, now 87 years old, became the world's first trillionaire in 2028. 

Home ownership became almost completely eliminated, reserved for the rich few. As baby boomers died off, some 40 million of them, homes were quickly bought up by massive and often national property management firms. They owned the apartments, the duplexes, the town homes, and the single family homes, as well as many businesses. They often paid above market rates to snatch them away from prospective home buyers and paid in cash to entice sellers to sell and not have to go through the conventional sale process that took much longer. Homes were often sold in as little as 2 days. 

The rate of home ownership was under 15%. As many as 8 to 10 people lived in a single 2 bedroom home. Privacy no longer existed. It was sold to people as a ""cheaper way of living"" as the $11,000 average monthly rent for a 2 bedroom home could be split between as many as 10 people. 

Entire cities had their homes and apartments owned by the same firm. Amazon was a large player in the rental market, making Bezos a quadrillionaire sometime around 2045. Rent increases could not be opposed, and renters had no choice but to accept substandard apartments, as every home and apartment and town was owned by the same company. 

Most of those who still had jobs went to college. College was insanely expensive and paid for by a lifetime garnishment of your wages that was tied into social security deductions. It was called the CWGA or ""college wage garnishment act"". 

This was not the same as tuition free college, because the cost was astronomical and paid for by paycheck deduction and not taxes. Even if you did not graduate or land a job requiring the use of a college degree, your paychecks were still deducted, for the rest of your life. Even death would not satisfy this, if you died before the set amount of tuition was paid in full, it was taken out of your children's inheritance. If you died penniless, the garnishment would be tacked onto their garnishment as well, ensuring a lifetime of what would be similar to indentured servitude. 

Rent was also a part of garnishment, ensuring these massive and often nationwide property management firms never had late or ""deadbeat"" renters. If you did not have a job for whatever reason, it would be racked up as a debt and then added to future wage garnishment. While this might sound nice in practice, and you might think it solved homelessness, you were wrong, as people who did not find work after one year were sent to the ""camp"".

The camps were these large, military style barracks were setup on large areas of land in the country, and each state had multiple zones of these camps. 

The camps were officially called the ""unemployed, disabled and disobedient worker housing projects"".

No one could protest what little employment there was. For starters, with unemployment being extremely high, companies had the pick of the litter, and if you disrupted the workplace in any way, such as striking, protesting or attempting to unionize, you were barred from employment for a period of one year and sent to the camp. 

Those who racked up a year of rent would work a year in the camp doing hard and manual labor to pay back half of the back rent. Once you were released, the other half was added to future garnishments. If you did this a total of 5 times, you were assigned to the camp, forever. 

Those sent for being ""disobedient"", worked a year for no wages.

Those with mental and physical disabilities were lifetime residents of these camps. 

Now you might think ""what if someone doesn't find work for five years?"" Welp, too bad. This was done on purpose to pad unemployment numbers initially and then to make private home ownership harder and then impossible. You are also probably thinking this made a lot of single mothers and fathers, and you would be right. The goal was to eradicate private home ownership and to take care of the vast amount of ""idlers"" created by skyrocketing unemployment. 

The camps had little to no privacy, terrible food and less than ideal living conditions. They cost the government little to nothing as they were built out of high strength cement and rebar and would last over 200 years. Automated equipment handled many tasks so once the equipment was purchased, there was no wage to pay or benefits either. Those who did have to work in manual labor were mainly ""back renters"". 

You might think this would never happen, bet less than 60 years ago we had segregation of blacks and whites. Less than 80 years ago we found it acceptable to turn over 120,000 Japanese citizens into ash and charred remains.  Less than 160 years ago we owned slaves. 

We were given many, many, many chances to revolutionize, protest, unionize, etc in those 30 years but we became to docile and placated, and this is what we ended up with.

But he didn't complain that he received such short paternity leave, he complained that my co-worker receives such ""long"" leave.

And then he regaled us with something an old boss told him years ago. ""You know you made it as a boss if you workers think of you first thing in the morning, even before they think of their wives.""

And this is the mentality keeping us on a 9 to 5, 5 day work week for a minimum of 40 years of your life.

1097,Conflict Theory,"Conflict Theory 

Conflict theorists focus on how advantaged and disadvantaged groups are bolstered or broken by the competition for necessary resources. These theorists seek to understand how/why some groups of society have attained the power to facilitate resources to other groups of society that they have deemed inferior. 


The conflict perspective seems to especially resonate with my view of the world. It encourages you to take a closer look at the tremendous gap among different classes/races and their accessibility to material wealth, quality education, clean water, affordable health care, equal and fair treatment by police and well-paying jobs. These issues are at the forefront of society today in 2021 and the consequences of these issues really seem to have adverse effects on people of color, of poverty and those with disabilities. This disparity amongst different classes/races is in direct correlation to rich white men “camouflaging the real motives” of their greed. 

A few questions I have asked myself over the years are “Why do most of my friends and family live paycheck to paycheck?” “Why do most of the black people in my community live below the hill in a 20 block span away from the interstates and downtown”? “Why is that in the nicer areas of my city there are Whole Foods, Movie Theatres and Pharmacies yet in the lower income areas there are Save a Lots, Pay Day Loan services and abandoned buildings.” 

A conflict theorist would approach these questions with the notion that these groups of people’s foundations and futures have been undermined by the insatiable desire for power and wealth that the people already in power possess. They would focus on the idea that a position of power usually comes with a desire to protect that position of power and that those higher up on the social hierarchy would damage the prospects of a better future for the disadvantaged even further if given the opportunity to advance their own.",False,muvqa2,Responsible-Ad9694,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/muvqa2/conflict_theory/,1,1

that is the amount of studies that is expected from an engineering student for examinations. 

That has been my timetable for the past 2 months, and it wasn't too different before that. This adds up to 84 hours a week(80 effective) with no holidays, not even during festivals.

And I do like Science,  that is what is being done in class, but the way that it is being done, rote memorization, and making students think in only 1 particular way, focusing only on getting marks, has made so many of my good friends hate studies. and for those like who don't hate the subjects, its like a torture for them.

1125,I was told by HR to “give up” after returning to work from a stay in the psych ward,"I returned after a week in the psych ward for suicidal ideation with a doctors note where a team of doctors signed off that they “strongly urged my work from home days be extended from twice a week to three days a week”. HR met with me twice saying “legally they don’t have to do anything since it is a suggestion” and “I can move my arms” and “feeling drowsy from medication isn’t a big deal because I can Uber 30 minutes to work” and “have your doctor fill out this form” the form in question asks if I can “be on my feet” and “lift boxes” etc (all things I don’t do normally for work anyway and mental health doesn’t necessarily effect those abilities all the time.) And how “since mental health isn’t really a disability or a real medical issue there are no accommodations that can be made without the doctor saying I can’t perform. In Which case if he says that then they will just reduce my hours. Also you should only be working from home one day a week since we hired a photographer (which means nothing as he doesn’t get the lifestyle photos I need for my job, just generic product shots) So no more two days a week. And so if this is all too much just give up.” That’s not an exaggeration those were her exact words “just give up” Not the best thing to say to someone who was on the verge of suicide a week ago in my opinion. 

So, I’m working from home today and putting in as little fucking effort as possible. Don’t know how much longer I can be at this place or any place at this point.

1131,What are the new loopholes to collect unemployment benefits and quit your job?,"So I'm working right now but I would rather not considering Biden extended the extra $400 a week until september. Last year I didn't work for 10 months which made me not ever want to work ever again unless I'm getting paid really really good money and I don't get paid really really good money so it's not even worth going to work.

Anyway, what are the new loopholes for quitting your job and still being able to collect unemployment benefits? People at my work don't wear their masks sometimes and the front desk staff don't say anything when clients come in not wearing their masks correctly. Is this technically a hazardous work area? I texted my boss about it and she didn't respond to me which tells me she doesn't give a shit. 

Should I give it another week and if nothing happens, quit due to hazardous work conditions and then get unemployment?

Even though I make too much money to get any benefits I'm still certifying every two weeks because we are still under a national emergency and this pandemic is not even close to being over with. 

So is anyone familiar with biden's unemployment extension rules and guidelines? I want to know what the new loopholes are for being able to collect unemployment with quitting the job. 

I know I know I should have refused to come back to work but I went back to work before Biden signed the bill to extend the extra unemployment until september and now I'm trying to figure out how I can stop going to work and still collect the unemployment benefits.",False,mt64m2,Talk-To-TheHand,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mt64m2/what_are_the_new_loopholes_to_collect/,13,1

I'm not a Capitalist, so it makes literally 0 difference to me that I get to choose a job under it. 

It's funny how Capitalists will make our argument for us so often by admitting that the options are take part in one very specific system, or die. They will actually try to argue homelessness and potential death to overexposure as a ""option,"" without realizing they are admitting we're right. They're admitting it's servitude or die, which is our argument, and spinning it in a way that sounds like you actually have a choice.

1146,I think I’ve figured out how to break free of the system,"For the past months i’ve been trying my best to do exactly what the government doesn’t want me to do with my stimulus checks: make them grow. Use them as a tool to break free of the day-in, day-out grind to make rent that has been my existence for far too long. Depression, addiction, loneliness, hopelessness, the list goes on. I know them all too well. But. COVID happened. I was given the gift of free time and free money. I got sober and healthy. Then the whole GameStop thing happened. I think that was a spark for many people. I made a little money in that event, but more importantly, I realized that I could make money in the market, and that it’s all a game, truly. That shift in my thinking about money in general was a revolution for me, figuring out how to play the money game became fun. Like a puzzle. Fast-forward a few months to now: I’ve been in the markets everyday, reading books on finance every day, obsessed, determined to make this happen. I made some money and lost some money. I’ve made good investments and bad investments, but I’ve learned so much in the process. One thing I know now: we can break the pattern that we’re all dying to get out of. It’s possible. I also know now that we, the human race, is on the brink of a financial revolution, if we’re not already in one. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain tech in general is going to radically change the way people do things- everything- and soon. Some of you might know way more than I do, and I apologize for the wall of text. Anyway- just to wrap this up: SafeMoon is the golden ticket in my mind. It’s a brand new, super cheap token that is just EXPLODING. It’s kind of like a 401k on steroids in that it pays you to hold onto it. I’ve gotten my whole family and all of my close friends on board. We’re all up at least 10%, and it’s only. just. beginning. 
rule #1: never risk more than you can lose. Rule #2 do your own research. Rule #3 don’t panic sell. Crypto is extremely volatile and you need to emotionally prepare yourself for that. Don’t act in fear. If you feel confident in an investment, don’t sell at a loss. Diamond hands. 
Head over to r/Safemoon, the Discord server, and Safemoon.net for info. 
P.s. There are plenty of other coins too, I just think that Safemoon is literally a once in a lifetime, life changing opportunity. No hyperbole. It’s too good to be true, but it’s true anyway. There’s no catch. I’m confident that I’ve figured out how to live the life I’ve always dreamed of, but never thought was possible.

We replace what leaves like as soon as they buy it. I just started a few weeks ago and worked a Friday... on the next day of work I am called into the office and told I was slacking off yesterday.... even tho I stayed busy pretty much constantly sometimes the busy was just looking for things to do but coming up fruitless since all the bottles had been replaced. So I’m told to go home and come back when I am ready to give an honest days work... it’s likely not about my big mouth saying how I think working toward goals society sets standards for is pointless. That women are a system of control designed to make men focus on certain things instead of reality. Or how good should be free in a “civilized” society nah that couldn’t be the reason no way... thus always happens guys I get a job it’s going well... then I open my big mouth about what I think and feel. It slaps the face of my coworkers and here what it truly is. THEY WANT ME TO CARE ABOUT WHAT THEY THINK OF ME!!! Since they figure out I’m free to act as I please they get very uncomfortable and threatened. If he isn’t working to impress women buy a house and have a kid what is he doing here.

1153,Work has turned me into a slave with a death wish,"Not sure if this is the right place for this, I still think its relevant to the main point.

 I'm (24 M) work in a call center. I have worked here for the last 3 years (uk). I use to work 12 hour shifts on a 4on 4 off basis. During covid i was moved to working from home. I have no seen my friends in about a year. I have became a husk of my former self and i literally cannot see a way for me to get into a working mindset going forward from here.

I've recently moved to part-time however as my family really isn't well of (it's just me, little brother and mother) me and my mother are working class and my brother is in uni. I feel like a slave. I spend all my working day being micromanaged on proper ways to talk to customers, being more empathetic. how to support customers through this pandemic etc etc. I just feel like that same courtesy has just been left out for the workers. 

My employers have previously let me go before due to me having numerous health issues(long before covid) with cluster headaches, which i had to wait several months to get an appointment with neurology. They let me go the day before my appointment.  Due to being unemployed my family life got very stressful and i ended up back in the same job.

I'm currently working part time. I'm not going to be able to survive with this amount of money but there's no other jobs available, I've applied for several that may involve less customer orientated roles with no success. Feels like I'm hitting wall after wall. I feel like my work want to get rid of me  soon aswell. I keep getting invited to 'disciplinary'  meetings for the most ridiculous reasons, im due for a meeting tomorrow for an unauthorized absence from work, due to me leaving a voicemail because they understaff the absence line and you need to spend about 2 hours to connect with them, they now claim they cant find the voicemail and i may potentially be let go for it. I've had other instances where i've been penalized for collapsing during a shift due to severe headaches and not being able to continue work.

I just don't have the work mindset anymore. i can't go back to those long shifts i feel like I'm wasting away. I feel like I'm slowly finally making progress with genuine passions and my mental health. if i can at least  use some free  time  into discovering new hobbies or discovering myself i feel i could maybe actually feel happiness for the first time in many, many years. I've never had this amount of freedom before but i can't sustain myself. I feel like a slave with no free choice. How do i survive this? I was never taught this by my parents. I never learned anything about this in school. What do I do ? I just  don't feel working like this anymore. I just don't want to be alive anymore. I'd never bring kids into this f\*\*\*\*\* up place.

1154,I just quit my job and my manager doesn't care for the reason," I live in Canada so tuition isn't that high thankfully and I had some money saved up from previous jobs, so I was in a better position than most. I had trouble finding a job at first as Covid hasn't been generous to the Canadian economy, and neither was the government. 

I was excited when I finally found a grocery store that was willing to hire me, but as you would expect they paid minimum wage and expected more than minimum effort in return. There was one manager who took frequent smoke breaks, would sit and do nothing on several occasions, and then she would berate me for standing still and not being productive for just five bloody seconds.

I was scheduled to work today, but decided to just use my savings to pay for uni, I might have no money after graduating, but wont have any debt at-least. I texted my manager telling her I quit and would sadly not provide a two weeks notice when she paid minimum wage.  I went into a bit more detail, telling her I how I truly felt about minimum wage jobs, but I decided to delete those parts as I wanted to keep things semi civil and not have issues with my final pay-check. 

All my manager had to say was "" so does everyone else here make minimum wage,""  I had no idea what to think, did she think that justified paying people so little, or did she just skim my message and not care. 

I realized that not a lot of people are in positions like me where they can just quit their jobs and still be able to pay for tuition like me.

Strange thing was, I loved it. The freedom, fresh air, exercise, and pure novelty (seeing new environments, people, weather ever day) was awesome.

However societal standards have encouraged me to go back to office type work, plus it wasn’t sustainable unless I never retired. Currently the latter matters somewhat less as long as I dont want to blow my brains out for the next 30 yrs while working.

1167,When you can't run away,"Some people say that if you hate your job, you should just quit it. But for many people that just isn't possible. If I'd choose permanent unemployment, I'd so poor that the quality of my life would drop. Poverty isn't a funny thing. It isn't just about getting by with less or buying cheaper products. It's about living in too small apartment, not being able to travel anywhere, not being able to socialize (since that often happens in restaurants/bars), wearing only worn-out clothes, not having money for entertainment. You can only live in most unpleasant parts of town. Your neighbors can often be junkies or low-level criminals. 

I hate it when poverty is romanticized. And I hate it when people (often those who are wealthy) tell us that we can just quit our jobs and live the dream. The media and culture feeds us the same bullshit; if you just follow your dreams and do what you want, you can get it. That is a lie and it's promoted because it makes people feel less oppressed. And it makes us believe in more in current system because it claims that in it you can actually make your dreams come true. 

I'm disgusted because soon I'm being forced to take almost any job with any pay. I have a university degree but I still end up being a warehouse worker, cleaner or shop assistant. I can't run away. I can't choose what I do with my life. The modern society is a prison. And that is the case in almost anywhere. Only small minority has any chances of doing what they actually want to do. Rest of us are just doomed to waste our lives in dead-end jobs or end up poor and hopeless. And there is nothing we can do about it. 

The best you can get is a job that is not extremely uncomfortable. If you are lucky you'll work with other decent people who probably also hate what they're doing.

1189,Getting real tired of the corporate nonsense,"I feel like I post here all too often but find it to be strangely therapeutic. I work for a very large healthcare system worth billions of dollars. In my area there are a number of similarly sized organizations that are highly competitive, but the organization I work for is NOTORIOUSLY cheap. Because U.S. healthcare is more of a business rather than a service we push our providers and offices to work through all conditions and expect us to be grateful for getting paid. This has meant cutting staff to skeleton crews to pad our bottom line and getting mad at not being able to retain staff. Now we find ourselves in a “worst case scenario” where we are forced to adjust office hours because we don’t have anyone to run the front desks or screen patients. Then senior management gets more mad because we aren’t producing enough. 

One measure to combat this is most organizations raised their minimum wage to $15 which made a big difference. But after my organization “evaluated the market” they determined it wasn’t worth it. And adjusted pay scales in a manner that made it look like a raise for a few but didn’t affect 90% of the workers. 

So what are we to do now? Well, we decided to pay a contracting agency to supply us with staff, and we are paying them a more significant hourly over $15/hr. Which is still not that great but comparatively. So now the minimal staff we could get are costing us so much, we need to work everyone even harder to overcome the cost. Of course there is a savings in benefits I guess but I find the whole thing is gross.

Not to worry though, all senior leadership received most of, if not all of their annual bonuses. While our frontline managers didn’t receive a bonus because they didn’t hit their financial goals, because you know..... COVID. 

I took a position in leadership with the hopes that I could make a difference but I find myself disappointed in myself for the lies I have to keep. Just feel foolish and a failure.

1194,The Recent Surge of Anti Stimulus Propaganda Was Predicted By A 1940s Economics Paper Which Provides A Blueprint To The Likely Reaction Of Capitalists To A UBI Measure.,"I keep seeing Anti Stimulus Propaganda being perpetuated in the press, several articles of which have been shared here and rightly shit on for the propaganda that they are. This [insider article](https://www.businessinsider.com/mcdonalds-subway-struggle-to-find-workers-forcing-changes-2021-4) is fairly indicative of what I'm going to discuss, namely that small time capitalists are railing against stimulus measures ""causing"" a labor shortage and an increase in the price of labor even though the Investment Banking analyst (lol at the dead eyed IB analyst coming off as the sane one) noted that the industry has struggled for years for employees. These little barons whining about the stimulus becomes even more strange of a complaint when you think about how the stimulus checks [increased restaurant demand.](https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/financing/restaurant-sales-continue-surge) Why are they railing against something that helped increase demand and kept their restaurants open? 

It turns out this was explained by a little known economist (at least in the states) [Michal Kalecki.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micha%C5%82_Kalecki) The paper came out in 1943 and is titled ""[Political Aspects of Full Employment.""](http://gesd.free.fr/kalecki43.pdf) Despite the name, it is relevant to discussions of a UBI (and in my opinion that is the quickest way to less work at least in the states) as the paper is more about the apparent paradox of the capitalist being against government spending despite the increase in demand from that spending ending up in their pockets. You could consider full employment policies as anything that subsidizes consumption and increases worker power, this obviously includes a UBI.

Kalecki outlines three reasons why business leaders would be against full employment: (i) dislike of government interference in the problem of employment, (ii) dislike of the direction of government spending (public investment and subsiding consumption) (iii) dislike of the social and political changes resulting from the maintenance of full employment. I will summarize each of these points below though the paper itself is very short and not very technical:

(i) Letting the government spend money to keep up demand eliminates the undue influence capital can impose on the political process by unlinking employment from how capitalists feel about the future of the market. As Kalecki puts it  the current system ""gives the capitalist a powerful indirect control over government policy: everything which may shake the state of confidence must be carefully avoided because it would cause an economic crisis.""

(ii) Capitalists do not want the government to spend on public infrastructure as it may pave the way for nationalization. However, they are even more opposed to subsidizing mass consumption (A UBI!) because ,as he puts it, a UBI would put at stake ""a moral issue of the highest importance"" to the capitalist that one must ""earn your bread in sweat - unless you happen to have private means."" Basically, why would you work for McDonald's if the alternative was anything less than starvation? Now we're getting closer to direct parallels to present day

(iii) This argument is more about how even if these objections by the capitalists are temporarily overcome (such as our boost in unemployment spending and our stimulus checks), the capitalists will, if anything, oppose the measures harder. Kalecki sums it up nicely: ""Indeed, under a regime of permanent full employment, the 'sack' would cease to play its role as a disciplinary measure. The social position of the boss would be undermined, and the self-assurance and class-consciousness of the working class would grow."" This is why these little capitalists are all reacting in the same way today. They're seeing how people respond when termination of employment is not a recipe for destitution and they do not like what they see one bit!

Point (iii) I think nicely summarizes why you will continue to see these articles about the ""problems"" caused by government assistance and spending. It's upending the social order on which we are dependent on our bosses for survival and even though this would likely increase their profits, they are willing to take a loss on their overall profitability to see you under their bootheel. If we ever get a UBI, these articles will continue at a feverish pitch and we will have to be constantly on guard for capitalists acting to increase their power even at the expense of profits.

If you've read this far, thanks. I hope the information is useful, even if you think the paper is just pointing out the obvious, I find the more thorough rigor applied to it than my thought processes alone a great help. I have always found it a good framework to use when discussing the power of a UBI with skeptics from all walks of life but especially fellow workers. 

TL;DR: Discipline in the factories and ""political stability"" (no demands by workers for something better) are more appreciated than profits by business leaders, and that is why they oppose even the smallest of reforms, even when it helps them increase their profits. They will fight us every step of the way as we search for a better world and even in a better world we will need to reform our institutions to keep our gains.

1219,"Just had an infuriating conversation with family, why do people have such bootlicker mentality? How do you respect them?","I was talking to 2 very Republican uncles recently, and one of them mentioned they had to get new tires for their truck. We had been talking about SpaceX and the moon before, and the other goes ""You know I heard NASA invented some super resilient tires that wouldn't need to be changed for decades, but they purposefully keep it hidden away so it wouldn't destroy the tire industry"". And the other one said ""Oh I believe it"" and they both smirked as if they were on the inside of really smart business deal.

Now I don't know if that's true or not, being Republicans, they're kind of conspiracy theorists, but the principle of it kind of hit me. I kind of looked at them for a while blankly and went ""And you're like...ok with that? It doesn't bother you at all that we're artificially slowing down technological progress so stocks can go up, we all can pay more money, and at tens of thousands of people in that industry can keep waking up to an alarm clock, leaving their family all day to make sell something that doesn't actually need to happen?""

I kind of went off a little and through our back and forth I was just amazed to see the bootlicker mentality and crabs in a bucket mentality. They're generic cubicle monkeys, counting down the days until their 401k lets them retire, thinking they're better than anyone who isn't saving as much as they are. They seem to love the shared misery of everyone dragging themselves to the office every morning and wasting their life at work, if you have complaints, then *welcome to the real world*.

If someone is not also dragging their ass out of bed and spending most of their waking hours miserable like them, they basically want the might of the fucking U.S. military to either force them to work or kill them straight out. Children of rich kids who fuck off their whole life are ok, because presumably some grandparent made enough down the line for their kids to do that.

They are skeptical of even having post-scarcity, reducing work hours, as a distant goal. In person and on Facebook they sure seem to talk about work being miserable and wearing you down and I can't wait to retire and I hope I win the lottery. But changing the economic system also seems scary, they feel like big macho cubicle monkeys like them would get the short shaft since they're the super hard workers dragging themselves out of bed and paying for the unemployment that all these scam artists are on.

It's such a bleak worldview where I find their interpretation of the world, their values are so far out of line with mine that it's tough to keep respecting them.

As of 2019, there were 9,630 Dunkin's in the US. Probably more today.

If we conserve our number to half, or 30 donuts, that's **288,900** **donuts** being tossed EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. Over 8.6 million donuts a month, in the trash can. 

Sell them half price an hour before close? Donate them to the homeless? Sell them the next day as ""day old?"" Nope. 

Also with each purchase you get about a foot long receipt. In total across the US, Dunkin has about 2 million customers each day. 

That is about 2 million feet of receipt paper getting printed each day. Why are we printing receipts for donuts anyway? I get that if you need it for business expenses, but wouldn't it be smarter to ask if people want a receipt?

That's 60 million feet of receipt paper each month. In about 2.5 months time that's enough to circle the fucking planet.

1222,My Plan to Escape a Life of Work,"I see a lot of people on here who feel the same way as me about work. And so I have made it my life goal to eliminate work in my life as much as I can. I want to share my plan with you all to start up a conversation on how some of us can escape this. I know all our situations are different so I will express mine. I am 21 years old and living in the United States I live in a small farming town. And the biggest revenue in this area is warehousing. I got a union warehouse job working for a kitchenware company in the shipping department. I am making 20.30$ an hour currently with a raise to 21$ an hour by the end of the year. I am staying disciplined at saving money and not spending. I already learned my lesson with the cars. My monthly expenses are as follows. 200$ rent I live at home with my father, 200$ for groceries, 90$ for car insurance because I drive a beater, 90$ on gas, 50$ for internet I pay so my siblings can do school online, and 30$ for my random subscriptions. I do not have worry about health insurance I am still under my mothers plan. So in total my monthly expenses around 700$ a month give or take. Currently I am working overtime at my job. It's been hell 10 hour days six days a week on average. But I am saving three paychecks each month. And currently I have 33,000$ saved up and 20,000$ sitting in my retirement. My goal is to save up 65,000$ I am halfway there. This amount is enough to buy me a little property with a trailer cash in my area. I don't need anything fancy. I plan on living in the woods, buying a place with a well and sewage system already in place. This will remove any public utilities I would have. So the only thing I would owe is property taxes and electricity, internet ect. This would grant me the opportunity to work part time and have the freedom to work wherever I want whenever I want. 

And the next step would be saving up enough to invest and earning enough money to cover my expenses. Netting me more opportunties to save and invest until I can not have to worry ever about a work filled life.

1225,Why does less work makes sense?,"I'm curious to learn other people's ideas or references on the thesis for this sub.

My own take is that many people over the last century have pointed out the contradiction between the rise in automation, but the lack of rise of leisure (Bertrand Russel for example). Obviously noone ""pays"" the sun, which ultimately powers everything we do, if we can somehow automate most unpleasant jobs, it makes sense that we should progress toward a society of less and less work.

My favourite reasons for why this doesn't happen would have to be something chomsky-esque. I think to maintain power the wealthy elite use media-manipulation to encourage absurd values in the working class, like consumerism, work-ethic competition, and fake hierarchies. By keeping the working class stressed, busy, afraid and focused on these values, there is little room for any systemic change, and the power structure remains stable. 

I'm ignorant of any explicit examples of powerful people stating this agenda though.

I don't want to, because I just dont see a point to it. What am going to do? Work all day, then be too tired to do anything I want to do? Work all day just to be able to BARLEY afford rent and food, let alone any sort of hobby to keep my sanity intact. Work all day to just be constantly just to live paycheck to paycheck? When I bring that up, my therapist just says ""Why do think that that is going to be you when it hasn't happened yet?"" and I tell her that 78% of Americans do. There is a very good chance I will too. 



I just started working 9-5 a few times a week, and even though I dont do much, Im exhausted by the end of the day. If Im this tired after working so few hours, I cant imagine working those hours 5 days a week. She says the same thing when I say I dont want to work because Im just going to be tired all of time. ""how do you know that? You just need time to get used it,  You just started"" Ok, but even when I worked consistently in the past for a longer period of time, I was still tired for after work.


A while back I actually looked into just leaving. Waiting for them to go to work and then just leaving. I just wanted to be free from the emotional abuse. I looked into apartments for the first time in several different cities(as well as jobs) and the prices were ridiculous. Even in the bad parts of town apartments are $700 a month for a small little space. Anyplace in a safe part of town where several thousand a month. I dont think it is ridiculous to ask for a safe place to stay for a reasonable price. The jobs in the area were all awful. They were mostly all warehouse/retail jobs for like &lt;15/hour. There were others but they also involved destroying my body over minimum wage. I abandoned that idea, because honestly, I don't want to rush into that.


My future looks so bleak. I am way off track for my education. Ive been lying to them about it to keep them off my back, assuming that Im just going to make it work, but honestly Ive been dragging my feet. Depression and  anxiety make it impossible to focus on anything.

1228,5 years.,"Pretext: Been working in an unnamed restaurant corporation as a food runner and host for 5 years since I was 16. Due to alcohol laws, was unable to get a server promotion until I was 21 (This year). COVID-19 hits, downsizing ensues, my friend that I brought on to replace me when I get promoted gets the position I was gunning for instead of myself. All the other new hires to be my next replacement quit or ghost continuously crushing any of my dreams for a promotion.

The worst part is being stuck in your position expected to do the brunt of the stocking and menial labour while you watch more servers get hired than yourself remaining in the same spot turning insane.

The building was so reliant on me that it affected me at home, requested a weekend day off to celebrate a close relatives birthday getting approved, only for my GM to say it was a “mistake” making me work a double and FORGET to relay to the other managers that both of us agreed for me to get out earlier. When I got off my whole family observed I was a different person because of work and all they noticed was me bitching over it. It was embarassing. The schedule made me get two days off and working back to back doubles on the weekend. I put my two weeks in on the 9th, with my last on the 27th (which is 5 extra days than my actual two weeks). My manager only offered to change my schedule when I resigned. Pitiful.

tl;dr Dedicated 5 year hard worker shafted a promotion in a horribly understaffed and mismanaged corporate restaurant. Started to affect my relationship with family and fucked with my mental health, to the point of anxiety and mild depression.

1229,A poem: Money Madness by DH Lawrence,"Money is our madness, our vast collective madness.

And of course, if the multitude is mad
the individual carries his own grain of insanity around with him.

I doubt if any man living hands out a pound note with-out a pang;
and a real tremor, if he hands out a ten-pound note.

We quail, money makes us quail.
It has got us down, we grovel before it in strange terror.
And no wonder, for money has a fearful cruel power among men.

But it is not money we are so terrified of,
it is the collective money-madness of mankind.
For mankind says with one voice: How much is he worth?
Has he no money? Then let him eat dirt, and go cold.–

And if I have no money, they will give me a little bread
so I do not die,
but they will make me eat dirt with it.
I shall have to eat dirt, I shall have to eat dirt
if I have no money.

It is that that I am frightened of.
And that fear can become a delirium.
It is fear of my money-mad fellow-men.

We must have some money
to save us from eating dirt.

And this is all wrong.

Bread should be free,
shelter should be free,
fire should be free
to all and anybody, all and anybody, all over the world.

We must regain our sanity about money
before we start killing one another about it.

""Is it our social responsibilty to not work and claim off the state benefits until a genuine working wage is achieved?""

 Follow my logic: 

The reason many don't work is because after child care, commuting and other things. They are worse off than ""signing on"" and have no incentive to get off benefits where they have a better standard of living.

 By putting a strain on the goverments benefit systems the goverments themselves might start asking the big important questions such as: 

Why are the multiple big companies given tax breaks. Using those tax benifits to create private profit that does not trickle down to society as a whole. 

Why has modern capitalism created a system where a wage is so below average in hours per week or wages per hour. And where a worker has zero hour contracts and absolutly no rights. That the goverment then has to step in and give those workers ""tax credit"" or other help. Why not just force these companies to inflate there wages and make it worth working?

 Of course there will be those that say it will cause big business to abandon our countries but who cares!

I work in the restaurant industry, and have for several years now. I just took some time off to complete a web dev boot camp, which was amazing and I learned a ton. I'm looking to change career fields now, but with no degree and just this one boot camp it may take some time before I break into this new field. I'm continuing to learn on my own, I have a recruiter and I'll be applying to jobs like crazy, but in the mean time I have to pay bills and I'll have to return to that abysmal, soul sucking restaurant job.

I also just don't think my mental health could handle diving straight back into the restaurant scene. I'm hoping that it won't be that long before I can say goodbye to this industry forever, but until then... I'm just dreading the return. I cannot put into words how much I hate it. The only reason, and I mean the ONLY reason that I work in restaurants is because I can't make enough to live anywhere else that will hire me (hopefully that will change as I may now qualify for some dev positions). 

And two weeks is a nice solid break, it's pretty much a vacation. But even at the very start, it feels tainted by the dread of returning at the end. You'd think that I wouldn't start worrying about it until closer to when I go back. Nope. Literally 2 days have passed and I already feel like I want them back. That doesn't feel healthy or right.

Every waking moment is spent recovering from my work week, and I have just enough time every day to sleep, eat, and barely physically recover from the previous day, aay nothing of mentally recovering. The work I do is menial and manual, mind-numbingly boring and physically stressful. My feet hurt all the time and it's an endless cycle of doing the same tasks over and over again, dealing with people that can be assholes on a whim. I used to have faith in humanity before this job.

This is *not* real life! This is a shitty excuse to make my life a living nightmare for $700 a week. There is so much more to be had than this, and I refuse to let it be all I can bring myself to do.

I've only been working this shift for a month and my life has gone downhill drastically. I have no social life with my friends anymore. I have no time for my hobbies or interests. I eat less than I did and my relationships are now non existent, all because everyone else is on their ass collecting unemployment and stimulus checks making me do this every day for every week.

1283,"""A slave, Marcus Cato said, should be working when he is not sleeping.""","An excerpt from George Orwell's *Down and Out in Paris and London*, published 1933. I thought of this sub immediately upon reading it and wanted to share it (fair warning there is one sentence of racism in here):

""A slave, Marcus Cato said, should be working when he is not sleeping. It does not matter whether his work is needed or no, he must work, because work in itself is good -- for slaves at least. This sentiment still survives, and it has piled up mountains of useless drudgery.

I believe that this instinct to perpetuate useless work is, at bottom, simply fear of the mob. The mob (the thought runs) are such low animals that **they would be dangerous if they had leisure; it is safer to keep them too busy to think.** A rich man who happens to be intellectually honest, if he is questioned about the improvement of working conditions, usually say something like this:

'We know that poverty is unpleasant; in fact, since it is so remote, we rather enjoy harrowing ourselves with the thought of its unpleasantness. But don't expect us to do anything about it. We are sorry for you lower classes, just as we are sorry for a cat with the mange, but we will fight like devils against any improvement of your condition. We feel that you are much safer as you are. **The present state of affairs suits us, and we are not going to take the risk of setting you free, even by an extra hour a day.** So dear brothers, since evidently you must sweat to pay for our trips to Italy, sweat and be damned to you.'

This is particularly the attitude of intelligent, cultivated people; one can read the substance of it in a hundred essays. Very few cultivated people have less than (say) four hundred pounds a year, and naturally they side with the rich, because they imagine that any liberty conceded to the poor is a threat to their own liberty. Foreseeing some dismal Marxian Utopia as the alternative, the educated man prefers to keep things as they are. Possibly he does not like his fellow-rich very much, but he supposed that even the vulgarest of them are less inimical to his pleasures, more his kind of people, than the poor, and that he had better stand by them. It is this fear of a supposedly dangerous mob that makes nearly all intelligent people conservative in their opinions.

Fear of the mob is a superstitious fear. It is based on the idea that there is some mysterious, fundamental difference between rich and poor, as though they were two different races, like negroes and white men. But in reality there is no such difference. The mass of the rich and the poor are differentiated by their incomes and nothing else, and the average millionaire is only the average dishwasher dressed in a new suit. Change places, and handy dandy, which is the justice, which is the thief? Everyone who has mixed on equal terms with the poor knows this quite well. But the trouble is that intelligent, cultivated people, the very people who might be expected to have liberal opinions, never do mix with the poor. For what do the majority of educated people know about poverty? In my copy of Villon's poems the editor has actually thought it necessary to explain the line '*Ne pain ne voyent qu'aux fenestres*"" by a footnote; so remote is even hunger from the educated man's experience. From this ignorance a superstitious fear of the mob results quite naturally. The educated man pictures a horde of submen, wanting only a day's liberty to loot his house, burn his books, and set him to work minding a machine or sweeping out a lavatory. 'Anything,' he thinks, 'any injustice, sooner than let that mob loose.' He does not see that since there is no difference between the mass of rich and poor, there is no question of setting the mob loose. **The mob is in fact loose now, and -- in the shape of rich men -- is using its power to set up enormous treadmills of boredom**, such as 'smart' hotels.

To sum up. A *plongeur* is a slave, and **a wasted slave, doing stupid and largely unnecessary work. He is kept at work, ultimately, because of a vague feeling that he would be dangerous if he had leisure.** And educated people, who should be on his side, acquiesce in the process, because they know nothing about him and consequently are afraid of him...""",False,mte22f,_FullCourtPress,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mte22f/a_slave_marcus_cato_said_should_be_working_when/,1,1

1285,A quotation from Edmund Potter (mouthpiece of the English Cotton industry during the American civil war). He’s arguing that the state should prevent the workers from emigrating and allow the factory owners to reduce wages to mere subsistence so they can maintain profits.,"ANALYSIS of THE MATERIALS 153

the quantity... . The question I would put then is this: Is the
trade worth retaining? Is it worth while to keep the machinery
(he means the living labour machines) in order, and is it not
the greatest folly to think of parting with that? I think it is. I
allow that the workers are not a property, not the property
of Lancashire and the masters; but they are the strength of
both; they are the mental and trained power which cannot be
replaced for a generation; the mere machinery which they
work might much of it be beneficially replaced, nay in-
proved, in a twelvemonth.* Encourage or allow (!) the work-
ing-power to emigrate, and what of the capitalist? ... Take
away the cream of the workers, and fixed capital will dere-
crate in a great degree, and the floating will not subject itself
to a struggle with the short supply of inferior labour. ... He
are told the workers wish it (emigration). Very natural it is
that they should do so... . Reduce, compress the cotton trade
by taking away its working power and reducing their wages
expenditure, say one-fifth, or five millions, and what then
would happen to the class above, the small shopkeepers; and
what of the rents, the cottage rents... . Race out the effects
upward to the small farmer, the better householders, and...
the landowner, and say if there could be any suggestion more
suicidal to all classes of the country than by enfeebling a
nation by exporting the best of its manufacturing population,
and destroying the value of some of its most productive cap-
talk and enrichment. .. . An anything be worse for landowners
or masters than parting with the best of the workers, and
demoralising and disappointing the rest by an extended de-

 

 

 

it will not be forgotten that this same capital sings quite another
song, under ordinary circumstances, when there is a question of reduce-
ing wages. When the masters exclaim with one voice: “The factory
operative should keep in wholesome remembrance the fact that theirs
is really a low species of skilled labour; and that there is none which
is more easily acquired, or of its quality more amply regenerated, or
which, by a short training of the least expert, can be more quickly,
as well as abundantly, acquired....The master’s machinery” (which
‘we now learn can be replaced with advantage in 12 months) “really
plays a far more important part in the business of production than the
labour and skill of the operative” (who cannot now be replaced under
30 years), “which six months’ education can teach, and a common
labourer can learn.” (See ante, p. 126.)

I didn't want my wife to stress about money so i thought id apply for some jobs and work on building my company on weekends and evenings.

Well after applying months ago I got a call from a utility locating company for a phone interview which went fine, then a virtual interview. Im qualified as I have the experience and can start asap with the exception of an anniversary trip I have booked may 15th-21st (which was brought up during the phone interview). This is where they got indignant. Telling me id need to be willing to reschedule my 10 year anniversary trip and that they need someone ASAP. I honestly got so annoyed at the request that I told them that is a deal breaker for me. After all they took more than 6 months to call me for an interview out of their own desperation and they have the audacity to tell me to reschedule a huge milestone event in my life for.... work? No, thats not happening but if they are willing to work around this one event im still interested in the position. Havent heard from them since.

A while ago I worked for a company that evaluated employees on a scale of 1 to 5.

I had a pretty good relationship with my boss, so I could tell he was embarrassed to give me a 4. He had to write comments with the evaluation. The comments were like 1) needs to work on proper business correspondence. Employee seems too friendly and chatty , asking about client's day for example. 2) Employee needs to improve appearance. Top button of dress shirt often not buttoned.

My manager was a good guy, and apologized to me for this. He knew his comments were a bit of stretch.

1309,Stuck in a rock and a hard place,"So I work for an assembly plant and I've been thinking of leaving for a long time now. 

I initially started there 3 years ago as a part-time summer student during my last year at uni, after I finished I decided to stay there because the pay was good and I good make some money to pay off student loans, save for post-grad, etc. The past year or so was honestly pretty good especially for a pandemic, my boss at the time was ok, the hours were steady and I was able to ask for days off when needed. 

Fast forward to January and things suddenly changed. My hours were sporadic af, the culture started becoming more hostile, which is saying a lot for an automotive plant. But worse was management. Supervisors became more toxic and demanding, my current supervisor does not give me guaranteed hours at all. Instead, I'm expected to wait by my phone until they call me to come in, it's been like this for the past 3 months. Some weeks on the morning shift I'd have to wake up as early as 4 am, just to get ready and wait for my boss to call me in. And if I can't come to work, regardless of my reason? They'll beg me like a dog pleading for me to show up. They don't take no for an answer it's honestly disgusting. It's taking a serious toll on my mental health, as I'm starting to have no work-life balance and it's just making my anxiety and depression even worse.

I even planned on working here full time, but whenever I ask HR or management about that, they give the excuse that it's still being processed or some other BS, but at this point, I wouldn't even wanna stay there as a full-time employee.

However, look at the EMPLOYMENT rate, and reverse-engineer it. It was only 50% in 2020.

3. Disabled 
4. Discouraged (who have every right to be seeing our declining society and job-housing-education markets)

He say it’s because of “security purposes.” My primary responsibility is to design, implement, and maintain our infrastructure, including security concerns. I literally don’t have permission to do my job.

Simple answer to that one. He’s childhood friends with the CEO of the company. That’s one qualification I’ll never have, I suppose.

I’m in a mode of malicious compliance at the moment. I’m following policies and procedures to a T, getting absolutely nothing done and putting as much blame as possible on this guy’s department.

I gotta tell you, eliminating the 40 minute each way commute and eating lunch with my family every day has been friggin awesome. Also, I have Functional Bowel Disorder, so being close to my own toilet at all times has made my stress levels just plummet. That in turn has made my FBD so much better, since it is compounded by stress.

1327,"“I want change so much, why doesn’t it seem like it’ll come?”","Title is not roasting this sub. I love this sub. It’s just a comment I read that really got me thinking. 

I’m only 21 years old. I’ve already attempted suicide due to capitalism. I’m completely burnt out on this life and I refuse to live in this system for the rest of my life. I’ve been doing A LOT of thinking these past few days. I’ve tried doing everything I can to make my work life bearable recently, but it seems like every time I do, the higher ups do something to make it even more unbearable. 

“You pay peanuts, you get monkeys.” 

“Do the bare minimum for the longest acceptable time possible.”

I’ve been doing my own strategies to make my job bearable, like looping every piece of bullshit they throw at me, right back to them. “X wasn’t good enough quality? Okay, so now I make it perfect, but take at least 20 minutes on each task.”

Backwards thinking for backwards wages. 

You legitimately, wholeheartedly, DO NOT deserve my over-the-top work ethic for the bullshit pay, bullshit conditions, and bullshit treatment. 

I personally am working a position meant for 3 people as ONE person. Mandatory overtime every week, which obviously isn’t helping with money, considering I’m one of the now-many who are voicing their frustrations about this broken system. 

So now, the post title. It’s something I’ve heard others say, and it’s something I myself was always saying up until recently. It’s because there really are so many of us, we aren’t the few and far between anymore, we are the fucking many; and yet we don’t know how to make the change we want to see. We think we don’t have the power to make change. We’re afraid of consequences against us. We think “eh, almost 8 billion on the planet, someone else will do it”.

That “someone else” HAS to be you. It HAS to be me. It HAS to be that guy down the street who just lost his house. It HAS to be that guy being escorted by ambulance because he just tried to kill himself to escape this hopeless capitalist lifestyle. We are the last defense before this country becomes a completely hopeless case. If we don’t take action in our generation’s lifetime, we will never get a chance again. 

THIS SYSTEM IS FLAWED. EVERY SINGLE POSSIBLE ACT OF YOUR LITERAL HUMAN EXISTENCE IS BEING PROFITED OFF OF. You are not allowed to live a happy life under capitalism because it’s designed to brainwash you and keep you under their foot and prevent you from enjoying your own humanity. And you know what? You can follow their directions by the book, get good grades, go to college, get a degree, and still get fucked over in this system. “Your wife has cancer? Well, I don’t care that you have insurance. Gimme 20 years of your life savings!”

We can’t wait around for all these corrupt officials to do it themselves, because the truth is, if we continue on this course we’re headed towards a fascist country, assuming we weren’t already in one in the first place with all the social media shutting down people that say this stuff, and how most workplaces are essentially fascist. Challenge your manager’s authority in any way, and you get absolutely shit on. 

My view is still very very undeveloped and under-informed, I’ll completely admit that. I only recently, in the last few years, have woken up to these issues and just barely recently, have I gotten so fed up that I want to start trying to fight these issues. There’s a lot of things I need to learn about, but all the same, I believe wholeheartedly that we don’t need socialism, we don’t need capitalism, we need to form a BRAND NEW SYSTEM. We may not be able to make a perfect world, but we can make it a damn fair world.

We don’t HAVE to bend over and accept the oppression, living the rest of our lives in constant misery, barely able to live paycheck to paycheck, barely able to find jobs even with a degree, going into potentially lifelong debt just to go to college. I don’t want handouts man. I don’t want stimulus checks. 

You know what I want in life? A place to live and time with my girlfriend. That’s it. I don’t want any yachts, I don’t want a high rise, I don’t want all these goddamn luxurious bullshit THAT SHOULDN’T EVEN FUCKING EXIST WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE OUT THERE LEGITIMATELY STARVING TO DEATH IN OUR OWN GODDAMN FUCKING COUNTRY. FUCK LUXURY AND THE IDEA OF IT UNTIL EVERYONE HAS FAIR CIRCUMSTANCES.

There is no goddamn reason that, let’s say for example; “even at the least busy XX burger joint restaurant, we still make $3,000,000!!! Great job team! Oh— wait, I’m getting a call. Oh, Justin died? He said he couldn’t feed his family on $16,000 a year? Hmmm... Replace him with Simon!”

We need LIVABLE WAGES. WE ARE THE ONLY REASONS YOUR PRECIOUS BABY FUCKING COMPANIES RUN. IF WE ALL WENT ON STRIKE, YOU WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE FUCKED. We honestly should. Fuck your system, run it yourself. Anyway, back to the point. 

We need to stop letting the system brainwash us into accepting the fact that “life isn’t fair”. Yes, in a grand sense, life truly isn’t fair, but we CAN make it as fair as possible by giving people a fair chance at their own fucking lives. 

If enough of us wake up and realize that this system IS NOT HUMANE, we can make a change, somehow, somewhere, until we make a government that is TRUTHFULLY, WHOLEHEARTEDLY, BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT, by the people, for the people. 

We need to fight all the corruption everywhere. Whether Satan is on earth spreading his influence, or it truly is just the insanity of human greed, we NEED to fight it.

A worldwide, fortune 500 company. They consistently show up on lists such as “best companies to work for” or “most admired companies”


Since I started working here over two years ago, I’ve gone from handling approximately a third of the responsibilities in my department to over half. I get my work done right and on time. When other departments have issues, they come to me. Not the senior chemist with a PhD, not the manager. Me. 


My manager likes to brag that our department is responsible for $20 million in revenue. 


Last year, the rapid diagnostic division of Abbott tripled their projections. I know this because the head of the division congratulated us in an email. 


Mid November of 2019 was the last time my salary was looked at. Since then, Abbott’s stock price is up 100%. 


I asked for a raise back in December. Last week, my manager slid a piece of paper across his desk saying they’re giving me a 1.2% raise. 


1.2%. Which equates to $780. Abbott’s net income was about $3.7 billion in 2019. 


I know a lot of people are out of work and I understand 65k/year is more than a lot of other people working with. I just needed to get this bullshit off my chest.

1333,I have to be on time tomorrow but the thought makes me nauseous,"I  work at a fast food place.  I'm usually about 10 minutes late everyday,  sometimes 5 minutes or on time when I have my shit together.  I usually  have morning shifts and I have a lot of trouble getting out of bed  because I dread work.  I am bullied and micromanaged by most of the  managers/supervisors.  They frown on me going to the bathroom when it's  busy and I feel nervous asking even when it's slow.

I  am an essential worker with no hazard pay.  I am extremely resentful  toward my job and my supervisors who treat me like dirt.  Some days they  don't even let me leave on time and keep me 10-15 minutes after my  shift.  They ask for so much from me, constantly adding new rules and  demands to the bullshit I already have to put up with, but they don't  even give me hazard pay or bother to treat me like a person.

I  want to quit very badly but I'm really scared because I've heard  horrible things about almost every single job I can think of.  I'm so  worried that I'll get a worse job with a worse boss.  At least this  place has a union and some benefits.

My  supervisor, who has it out for me for some reason and constantly  micromanages me, said that she's going to tell the store manager that  I'm always late so if I'm late tomorrow I'll probably get in trouble and  I might be fired if I keep doing it after that.

But  I really don't want to be on time.  Like, I want to be on time, I know  that's what you're supposed to do in order to be a decent person and  employee.  But for this job, after being threatened and intimidated into  being on time, the thought of being on time makes me feel nauseous,  like I'm wiring my money to a scammer.

I  think I'm going to just be 5 minutes late instead of 10.  They usually  don't care if I'm 5 minutes late, just 5 or more is a concern.  Maybe  that's a mistake but I can't deal with being on time.  I'd feel like a  bitch, like a doormat.  Giving into their threats.  Giving them  something when they give me nothing.

I  hate that this is how they get me to be on time.  Not me doing it  because I got my shit together and learned to be more organized, not  them treating me better, not them finding a kind way to get me to be on  time.  No.  They threaten me and and I bend over and do what they want.   That's how they got me to be on time.

I  hate this place so much.  I wish I didn't have to work at all.  I wish  when people were late, instead of bullying me and micromanaging me more  they'd, I don't know, try to make the job better, try to treat me  better, maybe give me a reward if I am less late or on time to encourage  good behaviour.  It's like being fat and someone tells you you're fat  and you need to lose weight or says something rude and then you just  want to get fatter and fatter even though you do want to lose weight and  be better but then you feel like you're a pushover and just giving into  bullying if you try to lose weight.

Meanwhile one of my coworkers who was taking orders outside was saying “you got this, Joe” in the back of my head I was thinking about how 1 dude who was suppose to help me bailed out to take orders from customers instead.I finally finished after what felt like an hour. I come back inside in the little breakroom/hallway that leads to the kitchen and sat on a chair to catch my breath knowing I still have 5 more grueling hours to go. My boss comes up, without missing a heartbeat telling me I need to come back to the kitchen because rush hour’s stumping us rn. I told him “I reallly need to catch my breath from shoveling” all he had to say was “well it usually takes around 30-45 mins to shovel that, take a quick break, but I really need you back.” I was already busting myself before shoveling, the fucker can’t even give me 5 mins of rest. I was so close from walking out but I went to work. A day or so later we received an email announcing how everyone’s having 75cent raise. I go from 12.75 to 13.50 now, oh boy!!!

1336,Quit my job of 4 years,"Last 4 months have been a hell at my job. I participated at something called Death march in software engineering ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death\_march\_(project\_management)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_march_(project_management))) .   


Even though we all knew at the team that this was going to be such a project, I was the only one that pointed out that we should simply take our time and deliver it at our own pace. Due to my stance I was sidelined at first doing support work. Later on as the specifications frequently changed by client, and accepted by our managers, there was a need for an extra person to work full time.  They reluctantly assigned me the new tasks in a totally unexplored field for our company and gave me two months.  


Due to logistic problems and delays on project I could only work on a mock system with lots of problems most of the time. I got my hands on the actual system 6 days before the deadline and I had to adapt from the mock system. I had to work the weekend and I told my manager that this was unacceptable from my part but I will do it and its gonna be the last time. However as I was working at the full system I noticed design problems related to my colleagues' works and the constantly changing requirements. I was told to find workarounds and I did so however not every requirement could be met. All requirements were met except one. However we sent the system to the client and there I was again without equipment to work again.   


Client complains for the missed requirement and some other stuff not related to me. Due to logistic problems I still did not have the equipment I wanted. In every meeting I explained that I could not work without the system or without the colleagues reworking their design. No one seemed to care, I realised that my colleagues were so burn out that could not defend me or do the extra work I required. As the deadline approached I was required to find a solution without having the system I worked on.   


One manager told me that he understood me but I had to find a solution nevertheless because the upper management believes in the project and the client is strict. The other manager was pretending that I was making excuses to not work and that I could work with whatever equipment I had. So I told them that I dont want a part on this insanity where I dont even have the means to do my work yet I am constantly pressured to deliver. Suddenly the second manager acknowledged the problem and tried to persuade me to deliver the requirement by telling me that he gave us all the badget we asked for and that is our fault that we dont have the equipment. I just asked for the date of my termination.   


4 years working there with no failure at any project I was in and to have that behaviour was something beyond me. I know that people of my expertise are hard to find, the cvs we receive are from graduates only. I was a graduate myself who was clueless when I first came and now that I was trained on their expense they just let me go like that?

1344,Every day working for corporations feels like an opportunity cost,"Hi people, I've been a big fan of this subreddit for a while now but decided to post something more of kind of a rant. 

I'm from a small country in Europe, I finished my bachelors and masters there - Econ and Management. I never had guidance to where to go career wise as both my parents passed while I was young, and my school or teachers never bothered. After finishing school, I worked a min wage marketing job for an IT company where I would do unpaid overtime often and do work out of my scope. After a year or so I moved to Canada on an open work permit. Unable to find a job in my background, I worked hospitality jobs - often 3 at the same time as I never had a backup fund and with no parents I don't have anything to fall back on. So I slaved and saved until my gf got pregnant, after wich I needed stable income with benefits for us. So I started working for a big bank. First as a teller, now account manager, making pretty much an avg pay, or below average considering the rent here. I never took sick leave, I'm doing a good job, I worry about finances all the time, I don't have enough vacation time, I deal with the corp BS etc - all the regular antiwork stuff. I dream of opening a business, and even though I have some ideas, I don't have money and the know-how for designing apps/websites. I study in my free time to get investment certificates and also to do the GMAT so I can get into a decent MBA program. 

In short - I'm a clown and a puppet to the system, frustrated each day, killing my health with a pointless desk job.

Meanwhile, my now ex gf (we separated, but co-parent the kid), always had even less direction in life. She has bipolar, never could hold a job longer than 6 months, dropped out of school, did no upskilling whatsoever and had no plan other than work admin jobs. But, she started doing camgirl stuff recently. She makes my weekly pay in about half a day for sticking a dildo up her ass, and I still feel more fucked by my job than her. Basically, she won at life and can retire in 10 years.

This life just doesn't make sense, I'm losing motivation every day I go to my office and pretend I want to be there. 3 weeks of vacation time feels like a joke.

1355,An example of ''Christian'' loyalty to corporatists and the 1%,"4 Socialism Encourages Envy and Glass Warfare
Socialists demonize the rich, blaming all of society's problems on them. Erie Wanders once posted to his Facebook
Age: “Met us wage a moral and political war against the millionaires and corporate leaders on All Street and elsewhere,
whose policies and greed are destroying the middle class of America.”

Were, Wanders is mimicking Karl Marx, who viewed history as a series of class struggles between the rich and the poor —
and advocated overthrowing the ruling class.

Scripture strongly warns the rich and powerful not to oppress the poor. In fact, Proverbs 14:31 says, “Whoever oppressed
the poor shows contempt for his maker . ..”

But, Wanders — and other Leftists, including Axillary Clinton — go far beyond
decaying specific acts of injustice. They basically condemn an entire class of
people simply for possessing wealth. And, they encourage those who are poor to
overthrow them. In fact, Clinton once said the U.S. economy required a “stopping” of
the wealthiest 1%.

The rich are not causing all
the problems in American
society.

 
 
   

The rich are not causing all the problems in American society. People like Will Rates are not acquiring wealth by stealing
from the masses. They're creating great products, which produce wealth, and actually provide jobs for many people. But,

1363,I Just Quit My Job as an Amazon Warehouse Picker,"TL;DR: Amazon managers want me to play games, I don't

It was the summer of 2020, recently graduated college, and I was on the hunt for product design jobs. Granted, COVID really hampered that, so after 3 months of searching, I needed more money for food, gas, etc. Prospects were not looking good, so I bit the bullet and sold my soul to Amazon Fulfilment. That $15/hour for menial labor was what drew me in. It's not worth it.

That soul I sold has now been crushed.

There are a lot of bad things about working at Amazon. All the horror stories you hear are true. My experience was picking, the most common job entry level associates  get. Here's what the job entails: 

Picking is how products go from inbound to outbound. Whenever a customer on Amazon places their order, pickers are the ones who take the product from a pod(the tall yellow shelves of product that the robot brings to your picking station) and place it in those fucking yellow totes. When a tote has enough things in it, you push it forward and the machines and conveyor belts send that tote to the other end of the warehouse where outbound packers will get it ready to ship. Your entire 10 hour shift is spent standing in an area the size of a dinner table and constantly picking. And I mean constantly. You cannot stop picking or else operations managers will come breath down your neck. Everything is monitored by cameras and Amazon's algorithm, micromanaging as much as possible. You've probably heard terms like ""time off task"" yeah, fuck that BS. Managers want you picking at a breakneck 400 units per hour. 

The tipping point for me was their fucking ""games""

You see, the machines you pick from (ARSAW) have two touchscreens at each pick station. The main screen is all that matters, as it tells you what item to pick and which tote to place it in. It also tells you how many items you've picked, your rate, how fast you swap a full tote with an empty, and the time in-between each scanned product. Nothing wrong there, it's simply how you interact with your job. Now the second screen...fuck the second screen. It's for games. Everytime you sign in at your station, the second screen boots up games for you to play while picking. Except they're more like stat trackers than games because you barely even interact with them. You have a game that pits your floor against another floor in the warehouse. There's one where you raise a Tomagotchi like animal with food and excercise. There's one where you are in a spaceship and race other ships (keep this game in mind, it'll pop back up later). But the thing is, all these games are the fucking same because your game score is your pick rate. Which is already shown on the first screen. These ""games"" are said to be extra motivators on your pick rate. But dressing it up as a game is pathetic. It's distracting, serves no purpose, and makes us feel like a child. So I naturally just turn the second screen off, as most do, and just focus on picking. However, recently managers have been wanting all pickers to log into the games while picking, and by wanting I mean forcing. They keep pushing Space Race like it's hot shit, saying it helps them keep track of workers. Except they have always been able to track us without these stupid games.

So to the actual part that made me quit:
I wasn't even 30 minutes into my fucking shift before an ops manager walks up to me:
Manager: ""Is your game screen working?""
Me: ""I'd rather not play the games and focus on my work""
Manager: ""What?""
Me: ""I don't like playing the games, I want to pick""
Manager: ""Well it's actually required""
I continue picking, ignoring her like I didn't hear anything
And this bitch just stands there and watches me pick for a solid 10 seconds before
Manager: ""can you please turn on your game screen""
Me: *reluctantly turns on game screen*
Manager: ""go ahead and select..""
Me: ""I know, I know. Space Race at 350 units per hour""
Manager: ""ok, I'll be coming back around later to check on you.""
Me: *immediately turns off second screen once her back is too me because I know she won't be coming back around and the games are asanine anyways*

You know what Amazon should be doing instead of trying to push Space Race? Well how about:
•Making sure ARSAWs aren't constantly malfunctioning piles of shit.
•Giving employees more break time to physically move our bodies around this MASSIVE facility. Barely anytime for bathroom breaks, so some have to piss in bottles.
•Paying us more than a paltry $15/hour
•Stop infantilizing workers and trust them. Remove all the fucking cameras at pick stations.

Amazon has been, bar none, the worst working experience I have ever had. The only, and I mean the ONLY, solace is the camaraderie between pickers/stoners/counters/the AR techs (fuck ops managers) because we all are working in that hellscape. EVERYONE hates working there, but we never release that anger towards coworkers because we know how tough it is, and we revel in that empathy we share for each other's jobs. It's hopeful solidarity of the masses screaming ""WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER!""

I had been working there for 6 months, and I didn't know how much darker the tunnel would become. The physical toll is one thing, but the mental toll is beyond comprehension. Every time I saw that damn fucking smile on the facade of the warehouse, it wiped my smile clean off my face.  

Once I hit that resign button on the A to Z app, I felt like Genie at the end of Aladdin. I now have to bust my finding a good design job that matches my degree, because I'm not against work, just against *that* type of work.

I know this is rambling, but I just had to tell you guys. I have been a part of r/antiwork for about as long as I worked there at Amazon, and I knew you all would understand the most.",False,msy79q,NesquikScop3,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/msy79q/i_just_quit_my_job_as_an_amazon_warehouse_picker/,224,1

1378,"If your business idea needs governmental (financial) backing, you should just get a better business idea","This is my philosophy now. Been working on my own projects for a couple years but always been a hardcore proletarian in the process. Therefore I'm thinking of ideas that eliminate the idea of manual labor, minimum wage as an important business model and lax taxation.

Of course I haven't made any progress yet, but I thought I'd share this title with you guys. Because I see so many people complaining about socialist policy ""taking their money"", progressive reforms and revolutionaries being ""utopian"" and similar. Which is why it's important to criticize people like me, or even your local small business owner, just as much as you need to criticize your Bill Gates and Bezos.

If wealthy businesspeople are voting for less taxes and proclaim that the taxes are ruining their business, *THEIR BUSINESS MODEL IS TERRIBLE.* 

How often don't we hear that poor people ""just need to spend their money better""? Or that they need to drop their coffee, buy used stuff and practice minimalism? *Of course* this should also apply for businesses and businesspeople.

There's a disgusting amount of businesses now being made that attempt to tackle the symptoms of capitalism, not the core. We ""create jobs"" by making UberEats, Uber, Amazon deliveries, and whatnot. But these jobs are *at best* minimum wage. They are *at best* manual labor. And they are *at best* including any sort of security net as part of their contract.

We're effectively running out of jobs that provide value, beyond the value it gives to the business model of the business owner. 

However, there are also businesses being made that *hire no one at all*. These are the businesses I'm looking for. This is what I'm trying to achieve. 

I believe society needs *an abundance* of sole proprietorships like these. We need people to go to school, university and beyond, specialize in their fields and innovate something of value. Ideally, with a majority of sole proprietorships, we could generate value to the governments *without* extracting proletarian life energy, create a social security safety net in the form of guaranteed income OR guaranteed essentials + housing. 

Remaining jobs would be *essential jobs* (see C19). Jobs that aren't automatable. People deciding to work these jobs would (and should) be the richest in society. This would be a way more efficient way of working business and society in general, and radically improve life quality in the process.",False,msnb7x,yung_pupper,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/msnb7x/if_your_business_idea_needs_governmental/,5,1

Why the fuck don't you tell them off in your annoying ass voice?! Why am I the only one being told off for not half-assing my job? Well now I'm half-assing my job, but it's still FUCKING UNBEARABLE.

I stand here for 3 hours fucking straight before I can have only a half an hour break, which you scam us from all the time before I go back to work again for another 3 bloody hours!

If you make a revolution, make it for fun,
don't make it in ghastly seriousness,
don't do it in deadly earnest,
do it for fun.

Don't do it because you hate people,
do it just to spit in their eye.

Don't do it for the money,
do it and be damned to the money.

Don't do it for equality,
do it because we've got too much equality
and it would be fun to upset the apple-cart
and see which way the apples would go a-rolling.

Don't do it for the working classes.
Do it so that we can all of us be little aristocracies on our own
and kick our heels like jolly escaped asses.

Don't do it, anyhow, for international Labour.
Labour is the one thing a man has had too much of.

1405,I wish I could go back to not knowing what it was like to be unemployed and receiving enough money to live off of,"I’ve been working since I was 16 — and often, if I wasn’t also in school, I had more than one job at a time. I moved to NYC fall 2019, and quickly got two jobs and a side gig. I was busy all the time. I didn’t cook, or sleep a lot, and I lost sight of what I moved there to do. When the pandemic hit I lost all three of my jobs and moved back home for a few months. In July, I moved back, and I got a job at the beginning of September. That job also ended in late December when the restaurant temporarily (theoretically) closed.

At the end of March I was hired for a national coffee chain. I applied for the job because I thought that the restaurant I worked for July-Dec was closed for good...well, surprise! They reopened in March, and today I went to go talk to the owner. Now I have my first shift on Saturday. 

I should be happy. I’m only scheduled for ~20 hours at rhymes with “car trucks”, and I missed my coworkers at the restaurant. Now I’ll actually have money, I guess. But I just — I don’t care. I don’t *want* to work anymore. 

The thing is, the period from late December to the end of March (when I was unemployed) was the most creatively productive period of my life. I finished my novel-length fanfic (yeah yeah I know, but it’s not what you’re thinking — I can post an excerpt in the comments if anyone’s interested). I improved as a writer. I got a very short original nonfiction piece published in one of the most-read newspapers in the US. I came up with the idea for and wrote 5000 words of a play. I worked on my novel. I walked in the park. I read. I painted. I cleaned. I cooked. Sure, I couldn’t afford to spend money on things like clothes I didn’t really need or “stuff”, but I don’t really buy a lot anyway. Thanks to PUA, I could pay rent and utilities and my grocery bill. Not much else, but that’s all I really need. 

Don’t get me wrong, I know that subsisting on very little income while consuming very little isn’t that sustainable. Sooner or later I would have had an unforeseen expense, or wanted to move to my own apartment, and then money would be important. But for those few months, all I did was allow myself to *create* freely, and set myself free from caring about “keeping up” with fashion or consumer trends. Now I’m going to have two jobs again, and I’ll probably be making the same amount I was getting from unemployment, and have a much worse quality of life, and for what? Money for stuff I don’t want or need? 

I don’t want to go back to my life, pre-pandemic. I was tired all the time. I had never written anything creative that was longer than a few pages. My room was always a mess. I was eating like crap and sleeping like crap. And what do I have to show for it? I didn’t contribute anything meaningful to society. I didn’t bring people joy or catharsis or understanding like I was able to do with my writing. All I did was work. 

Before, I was okay with sacrificing my health and time just for that. I know now that I have value and potential beyond work. In a lot of ways, I wish I didn’t.",False,mrtphr,publius-esquire,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mrtphr/i_wish_i_could_go_back_to_not_knowing_what_it_was/,15,1

Parents, people with illnesses or disabilities, people caring for people with illnesses or disabilities, people like musicians who work to supplement what they actually want to be doing. 

But there are no “proper” jobs at less than 40 hours a week. If you want less than full time, your options are waitress, or basic customer service, or cleaner. You’re either stuck on the very bottom rung of the ladder, or you’re being asked to do more than is physically possible. 

This disproportionately affects women who, in many countries, tend to be primary care givers (although it obviously affects many men too and this kind of thing is damaging to both genders). SO MANY women must be stuck on not-quite-enough income, despite having degrees or work based qualifications, because they have to do the school run at 4, or can’t leave an elderly parent for too long. 

It’s bullshit. I shouldn’t have to prioritise work over every single other thing in my life to get paid above minimum wage. I am smart! I work hard! I can achieve a lot in 25 hours, I don’t think I deserve to be stuck on minimum wage for the rest of my life because I have other things going on. If I could get paid £40k for a 40 hour a week job, why can’t I get paid £20k for a 20 hour week? I *know* that the answer is “it would be slightly inconvenient for companies to split hours across more jobs”, but surely *some* employers can recognise that not everyone who might be good at the job can do 40 hours a week?

1488,My vision of UBI could be like. Fair? Stupid? Your general thoughts?,"I don’t want UBI because I want to sit on my ass all day. I want UBI because by default we’re deprived of basic human necessities without money and get below the bare minimum from our jobs.

The way I think UBI should work, which is as fair for all as possible in my view, is that UBI should be available for everyone old enough to work and old enough to start shifting towards supporting themselves. 

This ties into two different conversations I’ve been making lately with my coworkers;

1: It should provide enough money to live comfortably - a house, food, and water, which gives you time to just enjoy life and spend time with loved ones. Jobs are still out there, but you aren’t FORCED into them to comfortably live your own human existence. 

2: Now why would you work a job if we had UBI? Well, here’s how I see it. UBI would be cancelled for anyone who decides to go out and work at a job, however, jobs would actually pay a thriving wage, not a living wage, but a THRIVING wage. This is how you would get the things you WANT: video games, television, etc. That money not being used for someone’s UBI would be redirected to other things, but the employee in question could gain the UBI back from quitting their job. Also, I would imagine that alongside this we would fight for fair treatment in workplaces as well, not just fair wages. 4 days on, 3 days off. The way things are, the 40 hour work week is designed to drive you insane and strip you of your humanity.

This, in my view (as under-informed as it admittedly is currently) would create a society where the people who are tired of work and just want to live their life can do so in peace, while the people who want more in life can go out and seek it and work for it, but under no circumstances will we have people dying in the streets anymore from poverty.",False,msb3to,Fetrospec,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/msb3to/my_vision_of_ubi_could_be_like_fair_stupid_your/,8,1

1497,Things would have to get worse before they get better for most of us.,"Something I've been thinking about for a while has been the perspective of a lot of people who have access to the internet.  I come from an immigrant family and so does my wife, so visiting the ""third world"" before covid was a pretty regular occurrence.  In order to ""escape"" and become an immigrant in most cases you need to actually be pretty well off in your country of origin, and things need to be pretty bad there for you to make the move (think about those stories of doctors/engineers coming to the Americas for custodial jobs).

So even in these countries, when I go I'm seeing a pretty narrow perspective of these actual societies.  When I went to the philippines having a shower in your house was considered fancy, as was eating meat more than twice a week, and toilet paper.  When I went to peru it was about the same thing, a police chief's mother could afford to have a personal electrical heater wired up that would shock you every now and then.

I remember visiting a community of people just outside the capital city of the philippines, where people were occupying unfinished concrete buildings, taking electricity directly from the power lines, and digging their own wells, and still, this was pretty high up in a country that is still mostly agrarian, with lots of people still living in the mountains and forests and depending on their gardens and livestock for subsistence.

A more civilized society might result in less work for all, but a lot of westerner's (mostly American) perspectives of decline are built around a view of society that the ""boomer"" generation was able to enjoy.  Pension plans and mortgages  and healthcare and higher education and strong unions and good infrastructure are not common in history or on earth, they were mostly constructs as a result of the west's dominance in the early 20th century, and were often distributed in these places in an incredibly unequal fashion to top it off.  A more equitable world is possible but I think it would be best to accept that, because of our place in the global hierarchy, a transitionary period would look like something between what we have now and how the rest of the world looks.",False,ms2bnt,capnbarky,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ms2bnt/things_would_have_to_get_worse_before_they_get/,13,1

25 CENTS. 

But they now expect me to drive over three days a week to our sister location to help work their too. I wasn’t even being compensated for the drive.

I'm on call when asked, and do overtime when asked, but I don't voluntarily work extra or make myself available in my free time for work (it's not in my contract to be available outside hours unless asked). The elite truly won't be happy until we offer them every waking moment of our time for them to extract our labor.",False,mqw5vb,9-5Slacker,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mqw5vb/my_performance_review_im_a_top_performer_but_i/,26,1
1534,"I understand the negativity, but here's another perspective","Full disclosure: I'm new to this sub so I don't know it's history or the full context, so I might misunderstand the point a little.

I hate work. I hate capitalism. I hate being a wage slave. I hate the anxiety of losing work and losing independence or what society considers your only metric of value. It sucks.

Second, I should recognize my privilege. I live in canada so I have free healthcare(at least the basics). My family has always been low-mid income but made it in a low cost-of-living area and saved me a good education fund, which covers maybe 1/3 of the cost of my degree. I'm using this to study computer science at an average university here, and I should graduate in about a year. I have a bunch of student loans but I'm optimistic about paying them off. I'm extremely grateful for what I have and I acknowledge that a lot of people will have fewer opportunities, and that really sucks.

Now that that's out of the way, I'd like to offer a different perspective. This sub is a bit pessimistic. The system sucks. We all know it. So try to beat it. Take some risks.

Have you heard of r/financialindependence ? It's essentially this sub but with a solution. It's super encouraging to see people escape the grind on low incomes. The reality is that under capitalism, if you play your cards right and invest properly, you can escape from the working class quicker than you think.

Did you do okay in high-school? Go get some student loans and study something, please! An education is the best investment you can make. I know student loans are scary but please don't give up on your goals because of them.

From there, save all you can and invest it in a low-cost index fund. (These can average 9% a year). If you can get a degree and get a decent wage and save even 10k a year, it'll grow exponentially. After 26 years, you'll be a millionaire. If you can save 20k, it'll be 19 years.

With a million dollars, you can essentially live off the interest. (That might require moving to a low cost-of-livinv area and cutting expenses, but it's very doable)

I know that I'm generalizing and I know that this will be impossible for some people. But if there's a small possibility that this could work for you, please, try! Take some risk. Worst case is you go back to being a wage slave again.

I also know that I'm essentially encouraging you to participate in capitalism and become part of the ownership class that you hate so much. I get it. But realistically, it's your only escape. And you will have earned it. You're not the billionaire capitalist or the trust-fund kid. You fought your way into never working again, its entirely different.

But there might just not be enough jobs out there because of the pandemic. Or the jobs could be not suitable or safe.

Also of you apply for a job that is not safe or that pays a poverty salary and you get a job offer you have to accept it otherwise you lose eligibility.

What many don't know is that you are required to do ""job search activities"" which is not necessarily limited to applying for jobs. There are many other activities that count as ""job searching"" such as creating a resume, creating a profile on linkedin, attending virtual job fairs, etc. One program I'd recommend is the [virtual career workshops](https://twitter.com/UnemploymentPUA/status/1380783920980008965) program that lets you take online workshops that count as work search activities and also increase your job searching skills so that you can get a better job when there finally are openings.

1540,"Would your opinion on your current job change if you able to afford the ""American Dream""?","If nothing else about your job changed except the compensation (so the actual work and work environment stayed the same), would you feel differently about your current job if you could have:

* entered your job straight from an affordable 4 year degree (or high school)
* were able to support a spouse who didn't work
* were able to afford a detached house
* were able to afford 2 cars
* were able to afford everything else that went into the ""american dream"" lifestyle of your parents / grandparents. 

I work in a unionized company, and even with good wages and benefits (by today's standards) most of the newer workers entering the company will never be able to recreate their parents lifestyles. I have this thought rolling around in my head that a big part of the reason that younger workers get tagged with having a perceived lack of work ethic (I don't personally agree with the label) is that when they can't reach the same outcomes as their parents &amp; grandparents, they won't behave in the same way (read: put up with the same crap) as their parents / grandparents.

With no incident giving them warrant to do so. Then they wonder why people hate working in their company and good staff keep leaving.

Fuck CCTV cameras in the workplace.

The animosity towards staff is unbelievable, I really don't understand the logic with some of these people.  If you have staff that are pissed off, downtrodden and resentful, what makes you think they will be eager to work hard? They will just either do bare minimum because fuck you, or they will leave for better things.

Attempting to rule with an iron fist just does not work. This isn't the middle ages, people for the most part, have options these days. You don't own them.

1568,What it is about money that makes us okay with dysfunctional relationships?,"I'm genuinely curious about this. Think about the typical manager-employee relationship. Now instead of those two people being coworkers, imagine they were married, but their behavior stays the same. 

If a husband told his wife that she had to wake up at the same time every day to work on and maintain the house with meals prepped at the same times--all under the threat of losing her home and livelihood--we'd get pissed off and probably want the cops involved. But if that same woman gets a job, she'll put up with that exact same personality type from her boss and the customers, and everyone thinks its normal.

In terms of the question in the title: My thinking is that the supply of workers who will do *anything* to keep their job is higher than the demand for jobs that support their workers. You can't compete with people who roll over, because they are available when we tell our boss not to treat us like shit. And the boss knows it. So to keep getting paid, we have to keep putting up with bullshit. It's similar to the folks you hear called ""scabs"" in union picket lines, but on a wider scale.

1576,Reading group for Ernest Mandel's Introduction to Marxist Economic Theory,"Hello comrades, I was wondering if anyone wanted to be part of the initiation of a new reading group, where we'll read Ernest Mandel's Introduction to *Marxist Economic Theory*.  We can set goals per week and discuss our progress, ask questions, and discuss deeper meanings and implications of the text covered in the week.

What we will need:

1. People who've already read the text so they can mediate the discussion sessions.
2. Someone who is familiar with the text to lay out the reading plan across weeks.
3. People who would be interested in reading with the group.

# PLAN

I have panned out the following plan for us to go through. Kindly see if you'd like to provide more suggestions. We'll use Discord as a medium of weekly meetings; here are some details:

* For the purposes of discussions, citations and reference, we will use the page numbers from a specific PDF that can be found [here](https://book4you.org/book/5616545/614510). Some comrades already have a hard copy printed by various publishers; they can, of course, continue with reading the hard copy but for citing page numbers, etc., kindly use the page numbers in the PDF only. This will help us in maintaining uniformity and create a repository for readers in the future to easily find and navigate the discussions from the text.
* For comrades who are reading the text in languages other than English, kindly share your text also for other comrades to read the text in the same language!  


Kindly report your availability and feasibility of the plan. 

---

Some advice from someone on Facebook.

1. You need a leader. Not just to ""moderate,"" but to pick out the most important passages, ask questions that generate discussion, lay out the meaning of the concepts Marx is discussing. Most people are incapable of discussion spontaneously and need to be led by the hand, the illusion of horizontal learning is actually just the tyranny of structurelessness and being fettered to the stupidest (or merely most obnoxious) member at all times. Even then, the structure of discord is working against you given everything is disconnected and anonymous, you need to identify people who actually participate every week and give them a reason to care about educating a bunch of random people (you may want to rotate leadership between these people if they exist given the amount of work it requires).


2. 99% of people who say they are interested will either drop out entirely or stop reading no matter what you do. You will have to put in a lot of work to keep anything going, no one else will do this for you and the community will not generate it. Basically, every leftist internet community, many much larger than ours, has attempted a reading of various marxist books. As far as I know, everyone has failed. That's because the OP refused to put in the effort to become a teacher and waited for some angel to save the group. I'm not gonna do it and if you are doing this because you want to learn instead of teaching it is doomed, sorry. You can still learn and it may in fact be better since you can follow their argument as it develops with fresh eyes but you need to take extensive notes, plan ahead of time what you're going to say, and **force people to reference specific passages in the text.** That is the minimum to succeed where others have failed.",False,mnpa0e,mammaknullare123987,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mnpa0e/reading_group_for_ernest_mandels_introduction_to/,0,1

1585,How am I supposed to pick out an education and career plan for myself when literally everything seems either mind-numbingly boring or is just flat out unrealistic?,"I’m 22 years old and a university drop out (I dropped out because I was miserable out of my mind and only went because my parents expected me to go.) Since then I’ve worked shitty restaurant jobs that I’ve also hated, but liked slightly better than school because at least they didn’t require homework and studying and I got paid for them.

I’ve been trying like crazy to figure out some sort of life path for myself that will allow me to be a happy and independent adult but I just can’t. I end up changing my mind on what I want to do on an almost weekly basis. Like I said in the title, everything sounds boring and miserable and if it isn’t it likely offers minuscule pay or is super difficult to become successful in (ie. careers in the arts or starting your own business). 

I don’t know what to do. No matter what I’m just going to end up a miserable wage slave. At this point I seriously wonder if life is worth living at all? I’ve fantasized about being a digital nomad, van life, and living in a little cabin in the woods, but I’m not sure how realistic any of those would be. The jobs I’ve been considering include being a translator (I loooove languages but it’s low pay and there aren’t very many jobs) and being a web developer (I’ve been teaching myself how to code and find it interesting and know it’s good paying and very in demand, but having to do it as a job sounds like it would suuuuuuck). I’m also considering getting into photography but would likely only do that as a hobby or maybe a side hustle.

Anyway, idk. Being an adult human fucking sucks.

1588,Getting that boomer economy back on life support after COVID (Bit of a rant),"The company i work for has brought in ""professionals"" to study our jobs and work out a ""better way"" of doing things. I work in customer services and this is telephone, webchat and email based work - Some of it is targeted but the job is just about manageable and fluctuates between really busy and sometimes a little quieter than expected. 

Anyway, they've paid these ""experts"" to come and do the usual cuts. Lunches are now going from 45 mins to 30 which is just a pain the ass because we handle complaints mostly and that can get a little much and most times 30 min lunches are not enough to eat and relax after in order to come back to the job somewhat relaxed. I did ask and got told that they could only have a couple of people on lunch at the same time, around 4 in total i think. So the obvious solution is to employ more staff to avoid the burn out but that's only obvious if you actually give two shits about your staff. I'll be damned if im calling their ""helpline"" number to discuss my shitty mental health that they will inevitability cause with all of the changes their about to implement. 

Anyway, pay rise denied this year despite our company rubbing their hands at getting access to government cash which will likely be paid out to shareholders and higher management for doing such a top job over COVID. 

I give it 1 year COVID free before every one is back in the offices, the only people who will be working from home are the managers and even that will be part time. 

Boomers gotta get their economy back on life-support. Interest rates still at 0.5% because raising them would bust the housing market.

1590,Small Victories - Work Edition,"Thursdays tend to kick my butt, so I try to immerse myself in uplifting content as much as I can during. If you're the same way, you might appreciate a few ""small victory"" stories I have that happened recently:





1.My dad, who is an accountant, recently got a big raise in what is, IMO, the most boss way possible. About a year ago he quit one company to go to another that offered to pay him more money, after Company 1 refused to do so. He liked Company 2 less because they were a lot more formal (have to wear a suit every day, that kind of thing), but the pay raise was big enough that he put up with it. I just heard from him a couple of days ago - he called me from vacationing in Mexico (we're from the U.S.) - and told me that he'll be taking his old job back at Company 1. Apparently he had certain reporting he did for them that NO ONE can seem to do as well, so the owner called him and offered to pay him something like $8K more than what he's currently making to come back to them. He starts in 2 weeks!






2.My brother, who is a math teacher, finally got someone to take over for one of the classes he teaches, starting next school year. In addition to high school math (calculus and some type of algebra I've never heard of) he also teaches robotics, which he had been assigned to do when the old robotics teacher left. He hated the subject and has been trying to get someone else to do it in his stead for a few years now, so it comes as a welcome change to get rid of it. I think he said he's taking up a session of Advanced Geometry to fill the gap.





3.I have a pretty bitchin' sandwich waiting for me for lunch (meatloaf sandwich FTW), so . . . yeah. My workday post-lunch will hopefully be a bit better than normal.

1604,Just learned I'm a slave with no negotiation power,"I work a creative staff job at a big institution with a lot of red tape and I knew that when I accepted the job. But recently I've learned that my manager is at the bottom of a ladder of 8 managers, and he has no negotiation power over them. So if I point out a systemic problem, or I have a scheduling conflict, or I want a raise, or basically want to do anything outside of exactly what I'm told to do, he acknowledges it but then says ""I don't know what you want me to say"" and goes about his day as if he didn't hear me say it. He gaslights me all the time and I haven't gotten a raise in the two years I've been there, and likely won't get one this year, despite ""exceeding expectations"".

Recently we had to work all weekend (and I had to cancel a vacation I had planned weeks in advance) on an awful project that never ended up being used and he said in our group meeting of 10 other low level staff and his boss ""OK, we're in the 'trust circle' right?"", proceeded to bad mouth everyone we did the project for, then said ""I think this is where our salaries and benefits are justified.""

OK buddy, maybe YOUR six figure salary is justified, but as a staff member working below you, I beg to differ... It's like he and everyone above him is trying to hypnotize us into feeling ""satisfied and happy here"" and dangling our measly salary in front of us like it justifies the repeated, ridiculous and completely avoidable abuse of my time.

1607,This subreddit has changed my work life,"I've been a long time lurker on this sub and only in the past couple months have I started to implement anti-work philosophies into my career. I feel like a stronger person now.

I just turned 19, moved out of my toxic parents' house a year ago, and have been bouncing through jobs ever since. I currently work at a daycare as the lead infant teacher while doing schooling to get my CDA (Child Development Associates). When I applied for the job the owners promised me that they regularly give out raises, and make sure every employee gets 40 hours by the end of the week. I could never be happier. Except I've found out that they are the sleeziest owners in the world. 

Cue my use of anti-work philosophies! 

I quickly discovered that my supervisor is required to make sure none of the employees get overtime. Any minute over and the owner, we'll call him Andy, gets infuriated with her. I got confused though because some of the employees from my daycare would travel to another center and work an extra 4-5 hours a day after their normal shift. One of my coworkers, who does this consistently, told me she was tired. I said, ""At least you make good overtime"". Well apparently she doesn't. Andy runs both centers as two seperate companies, so he can get away without paying time and a half. After hearing this, I was offered to work overtime at the other center. I found the guts to say no. ""If you don't pay me time and a half, I'm not interested"". They quickly moved on to someone else. 

Another situation occurred when my coworkers and I started to discuss our salaries. It wasn't until this subreddit that I realised how messed up it is that this is considered taboo. Through having these conversations we learned that me and a couple. other new hires were making a whole dollar more an hour than our coworker who had been there 2 years longer than us and already had a level 3 CDA. We can call her Tammy. I later encouraged Tammy to ask for a raise. She was shy, but eventually did it. This was met with a series of demands such as ""transfer to this center"" and ""continue working extra hours and we'll see"". At this point, she got so fed up that she threatened to leave if they did not pay her what she was worth. Tammy got a raise shortly after that. 

There are so many other examples I can use about my job, but I just wanted to say thank you. Honestly, if I had not been browsing this subreddit I would probably be in the same position as Tammy down the line. Hopefully my story can help encourage you guys to stand up for yourselves too!",False,mquori,cadetgarlic9690,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mquori/this_subreddit_has_changed_my_work_life/,10,1

Every time I’ve applied for a job this year I had to lie in bed for 3 days afterwards really depressed. I’ve been rejected from all of them.

I realize this topic is beat to death on this sub, but I wonder if anyone has had a good dialog with the type of person who claims to enjoy working. What is their logic?

Personally I think the people who enjoy working do not have a creative bone in their body, and are the same type of people who can be bored while the entire world is at their fingertips via the internet.

I propose the question to find more ways to bridge the gap between this type of mindset and my own, as to find common ground instead of writing this type of person off as a mindless drone. Or maybe that is the sad reality of it? Maybe they've reached a state of acceptance that I will never be able to get to?

Choose the most basic accounts. Cash. No margin trading accounts. It's easy, you can figure it out.

Transfer all the money you can get your hands on into those two accounts. When the funds clear (like, a few days), buy all the gme stock you can afford.

the ticker is $GME, and the company is Gamestop Corp. 

Then go to /r/gme , /r/superstonk and start reading up. DD stands for Due Diligence, a fancy word for research. You have a lot of catching up to do, ask for help. There are a lot of shills on there atm, but you'll figure it out.

Since you spend 16 hours each day away from work, you: have used up 170 days,
leaving only 91 days available. You spend 30 minutes each day on coffee break.
That accounts for 23 days each year, leaving only 68 days available.

leaving only 22 days available for work. You normally spend 2 days per year

The machine I was operating REQUIRES you to stick your hand inside of it in order to feed the metal through. This then means your hand has to be inside of it while the big metal rollers are in motion. You must squeeze the metal on both sides while using your other hand to use the controller to push the metal through the machine.

I was doing this exact thing while wearing gloves. Probably not the smartest idea and I am a prime example of why you shouldn’t wear gloves while working the machine, but this is posted nowhere in the factory and we are hounded by supervisors for not wearing safety equipment such as the gloves. So I instinctively left them on.

This resulted in the metal catching on to a loose part of my glove and pulling it into the machine. Thankfully I was able to react fast enough and get my hand out of the glove before it was completely turned into mush.

Now I write this as I sit in my car on my 15 minute break heavily contemplating fucking leaving right now. No job like this should ever pay under $20/hr considering the risks you have to take. It’s honestly beyond cruel.

1637,My mom doesn’t get it.,"Just had a frustrating conversation with my mom about my new job which has been pretty bad so far. Some background, my mom is in her mid 60’s-fairly liberal and always has been but prides herself in her work ethic and having a “hustler” spirit. I’m 26 and just accepted a WFH job after about 8 months of being unemployed due to covid. I was venting to her about my new job situation (no training, getting blamed for things I didn’t do, low pay, expected to work after hours everyday etc.) She basically laughed in my face and called me lazy without saying the exact word. She thinks I’m entitled because I don’t want to work my life away. To be clear, I don’t mind working (although I would love to not work)—my goal however is to work for myself someday and to NOT work 40 hours a week. I told her how I think it’s bizarre (and sad) that my coworkers, some of which who have husbands/wives/kids etc, are always working late into the night and even waking up way before work to do more work. I told her how I refuse to do that (unless I absolutely had to, sometimes we have to work late/early, I don’t mind it being an occasional thing) and she called me entitled and said “are you special?” I’m hurt but more so annoyed that my mom, who I always thought was “down” and cool, is more of a bootlicker than I thought. She kept saying that I have to put in the grind to get to my end goal but what even is the end goal? To end up like my managers and coworkers who are doing work every night until midnight? I told her that there is no end goal or reward for me, but she just doesn’t get it. Anyone else have parents who don’t get it? My mom is from a very different generation, she was literally born in the 50’s and I was born in the mid 90’s LOL, so I get that, but still frustrating nonetheless.

1645,"Not one but TWO full time jobs, aren't I lucky?","First post here after working. It is so cathartic to see other people fed up with this shitty societies fetish with work.

So into the story we go,

I work at a Credit Union, and I have been here for 2 years. First year I was a teller and did the normal duties, but I was already suspicious about the work environment since I made all my coworkers mad because I actually used my sick days and time off. First red flag. So I decided to take a different position in the company. I now work the desk side at a much slower branch and work full time doing loans and opening accounts and the such. 

Since we are a slower branch in a pandemic, my Regional Managers thought it would be good idea to give us the Online Account Opening tasks as well. (second red flag) I thought it would be a short term thing, but no. It is now my full time duty on top of my current duties. 

In a pandemic were you can't really go into the branch, there are a LOT of applications. Of course they expect me to do this and my other job. It is a full time task and i have received 0 compensation for the extra work I have been doing. Me and my other coworker (there are only two that work this que) are being handed the work that was being done by 6 people. 

I only make $15.60 I do not get paid enough to keep up with this. 

I almost walked out today. They had a meeting where, of course, we are not hitting loan goals (surprise surprise, I am working two full time jobs, what one do you want me to do?). I just find this ridiculous and thought it would be a good story here. Maybe you can relate.

1646,I've been pretending to work for months.,"So last year I was moved to this boring ass department. It has a couple of areas, and in the area I'm in, there's only two of us. An old disgusting fucking and myself (F, 26yo with a degree).

The first months I was giving my 120% because I'm fucking dumb. My old coworker at first treated me ""nice"" and all, but I missed several red flags until I was done, realizing this fucker was treating me like his assistant and 3-4 months in, I told my boss about my discomfort, asked him if that was my role. Basically he said ""No, but suck it up."" Great! 

As the year passed by, I was completely distant with my coworker, barely acknowledged his existence. And started to warm up to my other coworkers, people closer to my age, without those disgusting ass habits of course. And then I started to play dumb at work, pretending I'm working when in fact I'm doing other shit. And honestly? I started pushing all the work to my coworker. I truly don't get paid for the shit I'm assigned, work under the fucking sun, nor to deal with his harrassment (which everyone is aware of, mind you! How is he here?), seeing how corrupt everything is, the responsabilities I have do not equal to my salary. 

Of course being a dumb ass anxious person I always have in the back of my mind that any day could be my last day here, especially because my coworker THRIVES on gossip, and I've heard him spreading little toxic bullshit about me aside from the fact that I don't help him. I wouldn't be surprised if the HR people have heard whatever.

And you know what? I don't care. If I get fired, they will pay me for whatever and I'm free. I don't give a shit about not having a back-up job offer. I've made my savings and I'm planning to go freelance. Which of course would be tragic and risky but again, idgaf. I'm DONE.

  
2021 rolls by, and I'm still pretending to work when I'm actually doing whatever else, including job-hunting (which I haven't had success since). At times of course I pipe in and ""work"", but most of the time I'm just using this place's Internet to research and prepare my portfolio and whatnot.

Today's paycheck day, and like i said, I'm always ""paranoid"" that I could not get it, meaning I've been ""let go"" or whatever the term is for getting fired.  
If I don't get a paycheck today, fine, it means it's over, saving me the time to quit.

I detest waking up every morning. I've been struggling with very bleak thoughts for almost a decate.  I used to love my hobbies but now all i want to do is sleep, unfortunately. 

I wouldn't know if i'm depressed, never been to a psychologist, nor I can afford them, and honestly? I'm not interested. I know what I want, and I want to quit this job and do my own thing.

1662,"Revolution ideas: cancel all labor in luxury goods and non essentials, everyone work less hours, and have workers collectively make decisions","Our current level of automation has made there way more than enough people than is needed to keep society functioning. We could easily give every working class individual reduced work hours, or allow seniors to stop working completely, and we wouldn't have to sacrifice our standards of living.

Instead, all our excess laborers must create luxury goods or provide non-essential services, whether they want to or not.

Currently, all people who don't own land or natural resources outright are effectively slaves to the land owning class and the luxury goods market.

It is true that the working class buys luxury goods as well, but if we took a vote, I'm guessing most people would prefer to get more time back in their days.

However, the costs of owning land (and other natural resources) and high rates of existing debt make it impossible for this to happen without basically having a revolution. So, I'm proposing that maybe our revolution should aim for the cancellation or strict regulation of all jobs creating luxury goods &amp; services.

Who decides what is essential or luxury? We decide democratically via vote by the working class. People could still own a business (and get rich from their inventions), however, the working class must collectively agree to make the specific product, and also must approve the real job duties and descriptions to ensure it doesn't require back-breaking or unethical work.

Think about all the random useless novelty and other crap that currently gets produced by laborers in sweatshops—this could be prevented.

People would get more time to spend either with their children, studying, or taking care of their home/community. Mental health would improve drastically.

I think this structure would integrate UBI, and it could help pave the way to completely abolishing exploitative labor.

(These thoughts popped into my head this morning, so I accept all your thoughts or comments on fatal flaws or other things that I didn't account for. I don't even know where to start on planning a revolution itself on a national or global scale, so I will leave that up to someone else, lol...)",False,mnli7e,LionBirb,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mnli7e/revolution_ideas_cancel_all_labor_in_luxury_goods/,7,1

1667,"The more I enjoy my days off, the more I just wanna quit.","I mean, the policies my workplace keeps making don't help either. We've been hammered where I work, several departments working 10-hour shifts day in day out PLUS Saturdays. Recently they changed the schedule to try to ""make things easier"" on us by designating an A Team and a B Team. A Team works 10s and B Team works Saturdays, alternating weeks. But unfortunately with that change came a revision to vacation time. Previously you used to be able to use just 4 hours to get out of a Saturday. Now you need to use **16 hours** to get out of it. To further rub salt in the wound, starting this coming Monday, they're changing the scheduling again. Now As and Bs work 10's ""as needed"" during any week and the only thing alternating now is the Saturdays.


I tell you, I've been on the threshold of quitting for so long now. Just last weekend I'd taken two days off to get a 4-day weekend. One of those days it was such a nice day I just walked around town. Over 10 miles on foot just sating my wanderlust and running errands. It felt amazing, my friends. I'd done this once before as well over Easter vacation. The more I do these things, the more I just wanna quit my job. Just for a year before coming back to the work force. I just can't bring myself to quit, though. I just haven't the gusto to do so, but I really wish I did. Hell, I wouldn't even wanna quit if I was doing just 40 hour weeks, no more no less. And doing my *regular job*, they've been shipping me out to other departments all over the building and it's just been incredibly stressful. I don't know what the days hold for me, I just walk in wondering what fresh Hell I get to experience that day.


It's hard, friends, very hard. Even to a point I've occasionally contemplated ""Is this even worth it? Having to do this for several decades before I can finally relax?"" Work inherently doesn't suck, but the abuse we get as workers in the USA just blows. I'm considering getting a job elsewhere that's nearly 50% less pay, but no overtime and regular hours, full-time with benefits. I'd have to cut back a little bit on spending, but it might be worth it to maintain my sanity.

I was browsing this sub last night and I should preface this with I think that I don't feel the same feelings as a lot of the people in this sub at all, but I love learning about different points of view so I would like to ask about how you would see the way I guess I feel about my personal work life.

I feel like I need to keep busy to be happy, and I get a lot of fulfillment from solving tough problems and helping my coworkers at work. 

Furthermore, I have a lot of appreciation for my boss who originally gave me the job a couple of years ago. He continues to do what he can to make sure I am taken care of by the company, for example; negotiating raises for me, doing his best to convince HR that I am a crucial team member and that I am worth bringing back every summer, always telling me about certifications and other things I can do to earn a larger salary after I graduate. 

I guess my question is are these feelings not logical? Is there something that I am missing that would change my point of view if I realized it? Am I a bootlicker?",False,mqyfx1,woolgatherer0142,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mqyfx1/help_me_understand_are_my_fond_feelings_towards/,16,1

1688,2 weeks in to my new job and the stress of it all is affecting every part of my day,"I know I should be grateful for getting a job after not working for the past year. Especially in times like these I should be happy but I am everything but. I'm at the 2 week mark of starting this new job and it's affected my sleep and any ounce of downtime I have. I can't relax at all because my mind is constantly thinking about all the overwhelming shit coming my way at work. I dread going to sleep knowing I have to wake up early to a bombardment of slack messages and webex meetings. I even have a coworker that tracks my status on slack and even sent me a message when he noticed I was idle on it for quite some time. When I spoke to my parents last night and confessed to how out of my element I am and how I am not enjoying myself at all they just told me to stick with it and it'll get better blah blah blah. I don't like how this job is making me feel mentally and I can't really just quit either because a good friend of mine helped me get this job. What I thought my job was going to be has now become something so much more involved and tedious and had I known that before, I wouldn't have bothered interviewing but now I'm in and can't really turn back without looking like a total idiot to friends and family.

1691,I walked out today and I just feel empty,"I thought I would have this feeling of weight off my shoulders but I just don’t feel anything. 

I wanted to put 2 weeks in a month ago, but I put 4 weeks in because my position won’t be super easy to replace and I knew they’d need time to find someone and I offered to help train them. I guess they waited too long to get the ball rolling and called me today asking if I could stay an additional two weeks to train the new person. 

I’m not sure why they waited so long. They tried to guilt trip telling me how much they’ve done for me and how they gave me xx amount of salary and got promotions over and over again very quickly. Making it seem like they had given me that stuff and not that I had earned it. I decided not to finish this last week out (I only had a couple days left) because I feel like they won’t give me a good reference anyway since I’m not bending over backwards for them at the last second so I just left.

I’m definitely taking a few weeks off before I do anything else because my mental health has deteriorated into mush... 50+ hr work weeks mostly on my feet, a schedule that takes up my whole day, getting calls and texts from employees or upper management constantly even when I put in vacation days to avoid it...I can’t do it.

At my current job, I'm in a supervisor position and I'm usually at the service desk. And my God, I hate it.

I have some asshole yell at me at least once a day over something I have no control over. Everyone tells me to not let the abuse get to me, but I'm a sensitive person. It hurts when others are rude to me, especially when it's over something minor like a dead plant. I'm so jealous of everyone that has gotten time off and unemployment because of the pandemic. I've just had to deal with everyone coming to the store in droves because they have time off to do projects. This experience has turned me into such a bitter and resentful person.

he had flexibility, and most importantly to him, he's never

1726,Fucking ridiculous,"Just went to a shift trial today and during the whole time I was behind because there was literally endless amounts of fucking dishes coming in. Apparently this is a slow day and I’m not getting hired because I was “too slow”. Motherfucking cunt you imbecile it is impossible to clean all those dishes within the timeframe you’re expecting me to. I don’t give a fuck that your last dishie was apparently amazing cause rn you’re hiring and I KNOW the goddamn turnover is incredibly high. And just because your last dishie was able to do it, doesn’t mean everyone can or will. Just because you can fucking overclock (overwork) your PC (workers) doesn’t mean you should. 

I pretty much had the dishwasher running every second. I was doing good tbh. I was constantly cleaning and putting more loads in, but more dirty dishes just keep piling up. Actually they don’t pile, they fucking poured like heavy rain man. I dumped like a whole bucket of utensils and by the time I cleaned them and organized them for the servers to take there’s literally another bucket full of utensils and not to mention the piles of plates, pots, glasses, etc. 

And their food tasted fucking awful. The marinara noodles they gave me tasted like half vomit and half marinara noodle. It wasn’t the worst thing I’ve ate, but honestly I’d rather find insects and eat them raw and I’m a vegan. 

Oh and I’ll be paid 3 weeks from now. Sigh. 

Oh and the same person that said I’m too slow was literally on his computer the entire time. woooooooow soo hard and so fast. 

The job paid $16 when min wage is $14. So they’re underpaying and overworking people, basically. That extra $2 is just for the boss to feel good.

Lately, everything has felt like too much. I can barely get out bed in the morning and I sleep as soon as I get home from work. So from 5 pm until 7 am. I’m still exhausted even with all the sleep.

I requested time off tomorrow for my mental health because I have been crying multiple times a day every day, feeling that everything is too much, put off my schoolwork to focus on my job, sleeping for too long, having no motivation to do anything and having panic attacks almost daily. I feel like I’m going to break. I’ve been thinking about sxlf harming again...

I told my boss I just haven’t been “feeling like myself” and asked for the day off for that and to catch up on coursework.. well it was denied

Because I had covid earlier this year and I used up all my sick days for covid. And apparently now I’ll need a doctors note if I want to take a day off. I feel like I’m being punished for being unwell.

They tell me they care and they want me to be at my best and take care of myself but they really don’t care. I felt like screaming today. I felt like telling them I want to hurt myself every day. That I feel like a failure every fucking day..

I have some asshole yell at me at least once a day over something I have no control over. Everyone tells me to not let the abuse get to me, but I'm a sensitive person. It hurts when others are rude to me, especially when it's over something minor like a dead plant. I'm so jealous of everyone that has gotten time off and unemployment because of the pandemic. I've just had to deal with everyone coming to the store in droves because they have time off to do projects. This experience has turned me into such a bitter and resentful person.

And even if let’s say the ideal society was created in the US, the economy is still global, companies will just shift their operations to other countries with minimal effort creating an even worse living standard (fyi I’m from Asia). The jobs I stated above are essentials, what about the jobs that aren’t but still require a high degree of education, like creating video games, entertainment services and many others, these only exist because there is a market for them, who’s gonna fund these projects considering AAA games cost upwards of hundreds of millions of dollars to create these days.",False,mnb27z,ATGr47,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mnb27z/whos_going_to_perform_high_skill_jobs_in_the/,24,1

That's right, this moron actually volunteered to give up their break. They were not even short staffed, but the employee felt guilty for having a break when only working (I think it was) 5 hours. Boss was more than willing to let them take one, but they felt too guilty to do so. 

Today took the cake, I was at Sam's renewing my membership when a manager came up and said they were having bad chest pains after lifting a box. Probably a pulled muscle, but they were also short of breath and other symptoms related to a minor heart attack.

The three other managers were literally begging her to leave and go to the ER, but I shit you not, she was more concerned about who ""would cover for her"" while she was in the hospital.

What the actual fuck? These people actually exist? I can guarantee you, if the shoe was on the other foot, the employer would not go out of their way for you at all and would probably have a replacement in under a week if you died.

I can't get over just how unholy and overly loyal these two employees (two different stores BTW) were.

1762,My permissions haven't been set after 5 months and now I can't perform the task my boss wants me to,"Worked at this company for just about 5 months and from week one I told them I didn't have permissions to do the daily task they wanted me to be apart of. They tweaked some stuff, told me I probably shouldn't have full permission yet and they needed to sort out the correct level. Fair enough. For the time being I need to use my coworkers override about 50-100 times a day, her login information is more sound in my brain than my own . It's annoying, but among the things that annoy me, having to do a task that makes  it take longer doesn't really affect me.


Now today, my boss has been hyping up this project for a couple months. He calls me and a coworker to get us set up. Gives us a pretty mediocre demonstration, I remind him my permissions still aren't set and he acts surprised despite mentioning it atleast once a week. Now I go to do the task and surprise I can't perform the task. I reach out to him, he tells me relog a few times and it's still not fixed. Now I'm waiting for someone else to reach out to actually get it fixed. I'm kind of doubting he'll actually have time today, but who knows I guess.


I know my boss wanted this done for Monday, but at this rate I'm making no progress today and need to add this to my dailies tomorrow.

1785,Safety culture is at war with productivity,"/begin rant

Canadian railway worker here. I work on a 10 man crew that fixes rail defects. I would like to think this is productive work that should be encouraged. We kinda play a major part in keeping North America's supply chain operating by keeping the train wheels facing in a downward direction. (down is good)

I operate heavy equipment that requires constant maintenance to function properly. This involves crawling under machines and wiggling into tight spaces on greasy equipment. 

Today is my first day back to work for a 9 day shift. As we have some new crew members, we have two extra safety officers on site today to ""make sure everybody is being safe.""

0600 - I drive to fuel pumps to fill my truck. Decide to change a wiper while filling fuel tanks. Safety dipshit sees me changing the wiper and asks what I am doing. I say ""changing a wiper."" He asks ""Oh, you're changing a wiper?""

Great start...

0700 - I arrive at work location and begin inspecting a machine that I will be operating today. Safety dipshit tells me to get out of the machine so he can show me pictures of an audit he performed on another crew. How is this relevant to me? Nobody knows... Maybe he wants to show off his new IPhone?

0725 - I am warming up the machine and functioning the hydraulics, checking for leaks and whatnot. Safety dipshit tells me to stop moving as there is a train passing by, 100 feet away from my machine. Super helpful... thanks... probably saved my life!

0730 - Safety dipshit begins taking pictures of two other contractors from ANOTHER COMPANY that we work with. They are a SEPARATE COMPANY with their OWN SAFETY PROGRAM and their OWN LIABILITY INSURANCE. Other contractors are confused and understandably a little pissed off.

0735 - I am familiarizing myself with the new machine and going through my checklists. Safety dipshit interrupts me to point out that the inspection tag on the fire extinguisher needs to be metal. I nod and go back to what I was doing. Safety dipshit interrupts me again to tell me he is going to order some metal tags. Fantastic. Good to know. Safety dipshit tells me how to put a mark or a dent on the monthly inspection tag for the fire extinguisher. He instructs me on how to use a nail to make a dent on the metal tag. Fascinating! 

0810 - I decide to grease a boom truck that I will also be operating this week. I shut off my truck and put wheel chocks under the tires, even though the brakes are set and I am on level ground. 

Safety dipshit walks past my tires with wheel chocks under them. He is standing next to a greasy rag and empty grease tube. I have a grease gun in my hand. He leans down and asks me what I am doing. I resist the urge to say ""kundalini yoga"" or ""baking a birthday cake"" and simply reply ""greasing my truck"". Safety dipshit feels the urge to ask, ""are you okay?"" Between gritted teeth, I reply ""yes, I'm fine."" Safety dipshit asks ""is your truck going to move?"" OMFG!!!!!

0817 - I crawl out from under my truck and safety dipshit races over to talk to me before I get a chance to put my chin diaper on, as I am wearing greasy nitrile gloves. He then proceeds to tell me about how I need to wear a mask if I am within 6 feet of another worker. This really happened.

0825 - I find out that safety dipshit #2 went into my truck while I was under it and began moving around my personal belongings to see if I had completed all my checklists and paperwork. I was literally COMPLETING ITEMS FROM THAT CHECKLIST while he was going through my truck. He didn't bother mentioning that he rummaged through my personal belongings.

0835 -  I am inspecting my truck. The nearest person is 75 feet away. Safety dipshit #2 sees that I am not wearing a mask and races over to tell me the exact same thing that safety dipshit # just told me. I need to wear a mask when I am within 6 feet of somebody. Thank you for racing over to give me shit for being compliant until you snuggled up next to me and made me non-compliant.

0910 - I have two hard hats. One is orange and has ear muffs and a face shield. The other is white and has nothing on it. I use the white one when the bulky orange one is a nuisance. Safety dipshit #2 reminds me that I can't wear a white one, as it is for supervisors. 

1015 - I have given up. I have tried taking the initiative. I have tried being proactive. I am now drinking coffee and playing on my phone. The safety dipshits have stopped all movement on site. Productivity for today is zero. 

This kind of bullshit is why production has left Canada. Crippling compliance, over-reaching safety, and over-the-top environmental regulations have made it unprofitable to invest in Canada. Commodities used to be the backbone of Canada. Now it's banking. The working class has been eviscerated.

We are held hostage by safety officers and our excessively litigious society. Workers live under constant threats of punishment for not knowing every nuance of the labour code. Every moron who does something stupid and likely lies about it ends up adding another rules for everybody to follow. 

In order to do my job, I need to be compliant with federal AND provincial transportation rules, hours of service requirements, covid rules, my company's procedures and requirements, the railway's rules, the municipality's rules, labour code, all while being courteous to landowners and other drivers. I also had to sign anti-harassment and bullying forms. If I actually dedicated myself to being 100% compliant, I couldn't actually legally work. 

For instance, wearing a company-supplied mask blows humid air onto my safety glasses and eliminates my ability to see. Exercising my right to refuse unsafe work under these conditions is technically possible, but I will likely be seen as a ""problem worker"" and will suddenly stop getting called to work, which is NOT actually the same thing as getting fired. 

Days like today make me want to go live in the woods. I am tired of this work culture. I am tired of Canada. I am tired of subjugation and compliance to useless safety dipshits who couldn't hack doing real work. I am tired of self-serving bureaucrats whose only function is to ensure their own job security.

Those who can't do, teach. Those who can't do or teach become safety officers.

No wonder China is eating our lunch.

So one day I had to attend an event where I had to play a game online with the teenagers. In the game a question along the likes of “‘get over it’ would be a ridiculous response to...”. Overwhelmed with the stress of making sure that I would be engaged” (I was given a sheet that would have measured my communication abilities, not easy thanks to my disability), and under stress of a timer, I ended up hastily saying something along the lines of “getting raped”.


I answered the question honestly with no ill-will, but thanks to my autistic natural lack of filter (I can’t properly apply social filters under pressure), what I ended up saying was not appropriate for teen spaces, and as a result I was fired, after just three weeks. And I was so happy about my life finally getting better. Now it’s back to indeed hell for me.

1789,Be Grateful I Let You Lick My Boots,"This is just a vent because there’s nothing else I can do. I’m tired of licking boots. 

I’m tired of being told that I should be grateful to work 40+ a week, to commute, to get sick in the office, to have shitty or no benefits, to be treated like crap by egomaniacal supervisors, to have an HR department that is my only resource for help but also completely against me in all things. 

I’m tired of being told that I’m entitled or selfish or naive or just spoiled because I’d rather do work that can 100% be done from home from home. Or because I’d rather work my mandatory 40 hours a week via 9 longer days with every other Friday off. 

I’m so sick of companies thinking that access to a shitty gym and an FMLA policy that allows me to use my OWN LEAVE for medical issues completely beyond my control without fear of being fired as quickly/transparently are enough to make up for how soul-sucking it all is. 

I want to spend time with my aging parents before they die. I want to enjoy my dogs’ short life spans. I want to walk outside and experience sunshine and wind, daily, and I’m appalled that that’s too much to ask. 

Let me work where I’m happier, healthier, and (all that matters to you) more productive. Please, this is all ridiculous enough as it is, but I guess you’ll never maintain this explorative POS system is you don’t make those who push against it feel like the actual scum of the earth.

1792,Life is a game,"Within this interactive game is a number of games you can play. The 9 to 5er, the entrepreneur, the entertainer to name a few. All these games require time and energy and some, a level of skill and currency. 

To win the game is to not have to play games for survival. This requires a certain amount of in game currency that for most players is out of reach. So they are forced to play until social security kicks in and subsidises their remaining game play. 

There are other games one may opt to play such as relationships and creating mini character versions of themselves. These games require a significant investment of time, energy and currency. 

Since time and energy is limited it may be wise to limit the amount of games one chooses to play. Collecting shiny objects may be tempting but these require time and energy to polish and maintain and can cut into your downtime as well as your currency reserves.

It may be wise to limit these objects and reduce the number of games you opt to play as the typical 9 to 5 is very time costly.

Save your 9 to 5 currency as every weeks worth saved is a week you dont have to play.  You may be able to buy yourself enough time to switch from one game to another. 

In the mean time try to enjoy your game play and keep the stakes low as possible to reduce stress. Also refrain from abusing your console.

1807,I am seriously debating quitting but need advice and support.,"I need to provide some pretext but I will make this as brief as possible. 

I've been self-employed since I was 16 years old, primarily selling on eBay.

I've worked retail and other jobs off and on since I moved to Iowa in 2017. 

I took a job March of last year because the pandemic fucked everything up. There was a two month period I had no income, because everything came to a halt. All the thrift stores closed due to the pandemic and not being essential. A lot of local auction companies never sold online and had to learn and invest in selling online.

So now it's April and I have 13 months at this place under my belt. But I ask myself every single day is it worth it?

Why? Because I'm on day 7 of a 10 day vacation, unpaid of course. 

I literally feel like I've been released from prison. I have so much less stress now it's unbelievable.

I have a lot of health conditions that has always made working for someone else absolutely suck. None of which are either severe enough or do not qualify for disability. But who wants that anyways? It does not pay jack shit. 

Imagine sleeping 10 hours one night but feeling like you got either an hour of sleep, or no sleep at all. That's pretty much 3-4 days out of every week for me.

I've had every test imaginable. Full MRI, thyroid levels, thyroid ultrasound, all kinds of blood and urine tests, nothing indicates why I'm always so tired and lacking energy. I do have sleep apnea and use a machine, but it only helps a little. I can literally drink an energy drink and fall asleep. 

So working a set schedule sucks ass. I've literally blanked out for a couple seconds while driving due to lack of sleep. Of course I get massive shit if I come to work tired. Even though I literally talk on a phone and don't sound tired in my voice. So it comes down to either driving to work exhausted and showing up, or not showing up and getting fired. 

But, I'm not lazy or one of those ""NEET"" people, I've literally been making money since legally able to. I just can't handle working for others.

It's not just having shitty health, I despise co-workers. They all have this fake ""buddy buddy"" persona and when you need to talk to them about something important but non-work related, they don't care. They are also very superficial and will run to the boss to narc if you say one tiny bad thing about your boss or company. I've never seen so many people walk on eggshells like I do with co-workers of any place I've worked. 

I also despise management, too. I'm always super polite and friendly with my supervisors or bosses, but I don't kiss ass. I'm not one of those chummy, sweet talk the boss types. I view my boss as another person, and give them as much respect as they give me. I don't fucking worship them or put them on a pedestal. But guess who never gets compliments, or gets in trouble for shit that other co-workers never get talked or reprimanded for? That's right, me. 

But, I have a few issues if I quit. For starters I feel like I'm letting down my parents. I know that sounds stupid, but I am close and have a strong relationship with my parents and telling them news like that is never easy. Now my parents are very understanding and won't do anything stupid like cut me off or quit talking to me for telling them I quit, but I still feel like they will be a bit disappointed in me.  But I live with my wife and pay the bills, my parents do not. I have to go to work, my parents do not. What I do with my life is my choice, but I still feel bad, ya know?

The other issue is qualifying for a mortgage. Credit unions and banks tend to laugh at self employed people which is quite stupid. I can get fired or laid off at anytime, but other than the two month freeze during the pandemic, I can make money no matter what. 

Lastly is retirement. My job chips in 30 cents of every dollar I put in retirement. You don't get that advantage when working for yourself. 

Otherwise I figure if I devote more time to my self employment, I can make up for what I would make working, maybe $100-$200 less per month, but not be ""maybe if I fall asleep this time I won't wake back up and not have to go to work"".

1814,"Don’t apply for that job, but why didn’t you apply for that job??","I’ll try and make this short. I had a lovely case of gaslighting from my boss. I’ve been trapped in the low administrative position for my department but I do a lot and have always had a lot of accolades. I asked about one of the other positions and if I should learn more and apply for it a long while back, and he gave me a weird look and said he didn’t think I was right for it. So when it came open, I didn’t bother applying. He asked me today (six months after he hired some other random dude who isn’t working out so well) why I didn’t apply for that position. I reminded him that he told me NOT to and he was like, *insert surprised pikachu face* “that doesn’t sound like something I’d say!” I was like, well, you did. And he denied it so I just said ok maybe it was a misunderstanding. I don’t care to argue about it. 

The kicker is: I applied for another department in the company because that supervisor encouraged me to and wants me over there. My boss has now lost several people in our department and is having a hard time hiring. He had previously told me anyone off the street could do my job but changed his tune in the past year or so.

1819,8 hr shifts are inhumane,"Yes I realize people work longer, regularly. But this week since we don't have any major profit boost-er...I mean ""holidays"" coming up, I have mostly 5 hour shifts this pay period. Which sucks for being paid hourly, but is also a godsend for my personal life. 

If you've never worked in food service or retail. 8 hour shifts suck. On your feet constantly, waiting on customers, cleaning, cooking, stocking. It's not always hard physical labor, but it sure is stressful because of the environment and expectations. 

It's so nice to not have to come home from an 8 hour shift only to have a little down time, usually filled with errands just to prepare yourself for the next 8 hour shift.

I realize part of the reason I hate waking up for work is that I'm nowhere near rested enough even with plenty of sleep. But today I'm done at 10pm and don't have to be back until 5pm the next day. It's honestly great. 

I'm sitting back, eating a sandwich, browsing reddit. Knowing I have to work, but it's not this looming sense of dread hanging over me. I had time to wake and fully prepare myself.

1829,Sick days.,"I work at a bakery. I bake stuff. And sell it. Disguised and paid as a cashier I am responsible for an entire shop on some days. *Wouldn't that make me a manager?* No, because otherwise they would have to pay me more. Also I am not allowed to eat anything without paying and have to throw 200-600€ worth of food in the trash by the end of each day... but that's another topic.

Currently we are understaffed because the bakery chain is slowly vanishing and stopped hiring new people. I wonder what could have led to this ^(\[...\]throw 200-600€ worth of food in the trash by the end of each day\[...\]). The branch manager (a cashier like us, just a slightly higher position... like a supervisor?) went on a one week vacation. On the FIRST day of her vacation she calls in sick... for the entire next week. No info, nothing, just that she's sick. That's fine.

After calling the higher district manager about this to see if we can find someone from another shop to help us out he starts crying about how he is already helping out in other bakeries despite it not being his job. *Poor soul had to serve people for a few days, what a pity*. 

Few days later turns out **he moved his vacation closer**, so now he's gone too!

After working 10-12h shifts to keep this bs bakery running, *knowing that in October this year we will all be laid off anyway*, the district manager comes back and has the audacity to thank us for our great work and that this company needs people like us. **I don't want a thank you**, I want a check that says ""*here, have 100€ for putting in so much effort""*. But instead I get to correct the time stamp paper because for someone reason on some days some working hours just... disappear. Like we are open until 20:00 but the clock checked me out at 19:22! Sure, I left and a ghost took over and finished the shift huh? Not like I always work overtime until 20:15 because we can't take out the cash register to start counting before 20:00. That's multiple hours you legaly don't get paid if you don't watch out.

&amp;#x200B;

So today I called in sick. My nose is running like crazy and I am for sure not going to work with food in this condition. Last thing we need is the health department giving us a visit, closing down the entire bakery. And after all it's my responsibility to not risk the health of our customers.

I had a digital appointment with my doctor and she told me to stay at home and minimize all contacts till Monday. If it doesn't get better I should do a quick Covid test.

So I call the district manager and **he actually tried to talk me out of calling in sick**. ""So you really want to call in sick because of a runny nose?"", ""it wouldn't be very collegial towards the others"" like??? Excuse me? Didn't you *desert* us while understaffed like a few weeks ago? And aren't you supposed to make sure proper hygiene is carried out in all the shops? That's straight up inconsiderate. I also had to inform the branch manager and she just send me a message saying **I should do the Covid test now so if it turns out negative I could still come in for TODAYS LATE SHIFT**. Besides the irony of ""*do as I say, not as I do""* this is just f up. A Covid test is not going to change the fact that I went through an entire toilet paper roll in one day just for my nose.

After ignoring that message for **four** minutes she is trying to **call** me. Nah, I ain't picking up. I'll just say I was taking a nap because guess what... I'm sick.

Sick and tired of how YOU should feel bad for being sick.

1869,I'm finally going to quit...,"I have struggled with this on a daily basis for years and I'm finally going to take the leap and quit my job. (overworked, uncaring and unhealthy call center environment.) 

I have no plan or idea of what to do after, but not because of a lack of trying. I have considered all of my options MANY times and each one is equally depressing and unappealing. (looking for a new job, going to college, being homeless, suicide.) 
*even though I may think about suicide I would never be able to. I could never abandon my loved ones, friends or family. But it doesn't mean that that thought isn't there.* 

I have put off quitting for so long now because I want to support myself and be responsible, but the cost on my mental and physical heath and happiness has become too great. I don't want to simply quit just to have free time and do nothing. But I also cannot just continue to work here just because I don't have a solution lined up. I've put this off for too long and I need to get out now regardless of if I have a plan or not. 

But this absolutely terrifies me. I know my limited options are not workable.. I don't know how I will survive. I don't know what to do... 

I have some savings, but I don't know how long that will last and I don't feel like I will find something that will work for me by the time my savings run out. I couldn't find a solution in the past years while trying during working so I'm not sure I will now. 

The only option that seems reasonable is to maybe work less, but then I would not qualify for benefits such as health insurance. So if I ever have an emergency I will either die or go into debt for the rest of my life.

I am so disgusted that every option seems so unhealthy and disrespectful to human life... It completely kills me inside. I just want an option where I can be productive and happy at the same time and it won't f*** me over in some way.

1881,Putting out a feeler - Would anyone be interested in code compliance general consultation?,"Lurker and first time poster here (on this account). This is something I've been thinking for about 2 years now because it hits close to home. My landlord has cut corners in my rental unit and has several state building code violations. From not having an operable window in the bedroom for egress (in case of fire), to not having GFCI outlets in the bathroom (for safety), I've made a list of these observations for when I move out. Normally, I'd let it slide if these issues were not truly a big deal but the issues I face truly are life safety concerns and affect my physical wellbeing. It got me thinking, I'm only fortunate to know of these issues because I'm a licensed architect. I know I can't be the only one with a landlord that has done stuff like this which is the reason for this post.

Would anyone be interested in a code compliance general consultation phone call? In the phone call we can go over what items may not be up to the building code.

1886,Going from working part-time to full-time (advice needed),"So, I’ve been working three days a week (25-30 hours) for the past month-and-a-half after being largely out of work for around ten months. So far, it’s going pretty well and I generally enjoy my job (accounting) and the people I work with. It was initially on an interim basis for tax season and I agreed to work three days, citing personal reasons and wanting to study for the CPA exam.

However, today, after telling me how much they like my work, they offered me a full-time position with more money and benefits (when I’m ready). Even without seeing the terms, it seems like a no-brainer to accept, as I’m currently just paid hourly.

My problem is that I do not do well personally when I work full-time and five days a week. Yes, professionally I can hack it but I’m miserable. I’m not the most efficient with my personal time unfortunately (moderate OCD) and I generally require a decent amount of alone time. I also do a very poor job of getting enough sleep at night when I’m working a lot, since I have so many interests and goals I’m going for that keep me up.

Even working just three days a week, I’m only able to average around 4-5 hours of sleep on work nights (I catch up the other days). I’ve also unfortunately gained about 8-10 pounds and though I’m not overweight, I’m not in the best of shape at this point. Obviously a lack of sleep and consuming caffeine has contributed to this.

I guess, in a nutshell, I’m asking for advice on handling this. I do enjoy my job and those I work with and I want to stay but going in five days a week just isn’t going to work well for me long-term (I’ve done this in the past at other jobs). I mentioned when they hired me initially that I could work more if I was able to do so remotely but they shot me down. The current situation is manageable, even if the early hours don’t work well for me, but anything more and I’m going to struggle.

Just why. 
So they make x300 my salary because 30 years ago they invested 200k and now are liable of the business?! 
Do they make x300 because they work x300 times harder than me?! I don't think so, I just see them chilling and doing literally NOTHING and posting it on Instagram. 
Cmon, they can't fool me.
They don't work x300 harder than me, they don't make deals with customers because they don't even know what the company can or can not do.

It's like if my work is benefiting someone or the community that motivates me, but as soon as money gets thrown into the mix it scares me.

Sometimes I'll have days where I only get tasks I fully know how to complete but most of the time it feels like I'm just fumbling through tasks trying to appease everyone and it's just impossible. I should be clear, no one yells at me or talks bad about me to me (yet). It just sucks to spend 9 hours a day doing something I feel like I'm not even good at. Sometimes I enjoy the IT aspects but that's trumped by the near constant feeling of inadequacy. Can't quit because I need the money, I don't really want to spend my free time applying to another job because I feel like it's all going to be the same and at least here I got management that doesn't yell or pressure me too much. Every day after work I can't help but feel like I'm just not getting it, I'll never care enough about this company to succeed.

While I'm not work free I have a very healthy work/life balance and live a decently comfortable life. I'm a temp, I started off doing non-skilled labor, did some work with electricians, currently in school for welding to become a welding temp. The temp life has its fair share of bullshit but it's best quality is that due to its nature I don't ever have the same boss for more than a few months and that there are breaks in between jobs. I tend to work 2-3 months at a time and take a month or two to live off my savings and unemployment before going back to work to re up on money. How I plan to move closer to being totally work-free is to trade cryptocurrencies and stocks untill I eventually have enough money to be able to take longer and longer breaks and so far, after some trial and error, I've ve found a system that works for me to make steady profits on crypto and that I can scale up with time.",False,ml4mg5,OpenUpYerMurderEyes,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ml4mg5/how_did_you_accomplish_a_workfreeworklite/,12,1

1909,Being an essential worker broke me,"I’m tired. Just. So tired.

Why, why am I still doing this? Why do I still drag myself out the door for a company that doesn’t care if I live or die?

I work for a popular grocery store chain, one with a reputation for standing by its workers. Before the shit storm that started with this pandemic, I would’ve agreed. We have pretty damn good health insurance, decent pay, and flexible hours. The people I work with are fun, and I consider many of them to be my friends. I gained a lot of confidence since starting there, and I considered it a positive influence in my life.

But I can’t anymore. They abandoned us.

It started small. First we weren’t allowed gloves on the register. Can’t have the customer thinking  we see them as dirty, or that we’re scared. I’ve seen coworkers sent home without pay after arguing with managers over this. Then the panic buying started. People reached over our heads, demanded more mere inches from our faces. Screaming. All of us, customers and employees, crammed in a small store with little space between. We were offered overtime instead of protection.

We weren’t allowed masks until several weeks passed. Anyone who wore one into work was expected to take it off before starting a shift. One of my coworkers would’ve been fired for wearing one all through their shifts if a state mandate hadn’t been implemented. They started cutting hours, and sending people home if we weren’t busy. Any time we missed had to be covered by our AR, or we weren’t paid for it.

Then came the issue of health insurance. It’s one of the biggest draws of working at this place. At first, things were okay. The company grandfathered in everyone into their insurance for the spring/summer measurement period. It was a huge relief for everyone. If we missed a few days due to cuts, it didn’t count against us... at the time. They didn’t carry it through to the second half of the year. Fall was a scramble for hours. I saw full timers who’ve been with the company 10+ lose their health insurance in the middle of a pandemic. It was soul crushing. This happened while hours were still being cut.

They tired to give us a “bonus” instead of putting money into our 401ks. The opted everyone into it, and encouraged us to take the money “if you really need it”. Tantalizing their already struggling work force with money that, if we take it, will harm our prospects of retirement in the long run while saving themselves millions. If you wanted that money to go into your 401k, you had to manually opt out of it.

There’s more. More personal stuff. The daily berating of customers who are sick of wearing masks. Sick of having to wait in a line outside the store. Sick of all the cleaning getting in the way of their shopping experience. Sick of us just trying to stay safe. Too many people think it’s okay to touch me on the job, to pull down their masks to talk to me. Yell at me for waiting outside just to find out their favorite product is out of stock. Or bringing their whole family just to get out of the house. 

I can tolerate a lot. If the company had chosen to help us get vaccinated, I could forgive a lot.

But they didn’t.

We’re on our own for appointments. I’d say at my store, less than half have had their first shots. We’ve been eligible since February, but it’s an absolute struggle to get an appointment.

They abandoned us.

But everyday I have to hear people around me talk about how great the company is. How wonderful. It feels like gaslighting. I’ve given up on talking to management about my concerns. They don’t care. About us, or the customer. All they care about is the bottom line.

1914,My therapist pushed me to get a regular job and I just-sigh-,"I was talking to my therapist today and mentioned one of the things causing me extra stress is money. Now for record: it always does. Unless I got 4 Digits on my account I worry - period. 
Rn I do good delivery for one of the popular apps. And im happy with it. I dont make much right now but I'm not doing it regularly at the moment. After spring break my kiddo starts school again so that when I'm going to buckle down and do it more. I also got accepted to a 2nd delivery app so I have more traffic.  
My therapist started pushing a traditional work with an insurance company with a 2 yr contract. 
I can't hold a traditional job for more than 3 months, 6 months IF Im lucky. Something about me just doesn't *function* to fit that mold. Plus, I strongly believe insurance is a predatory business game and I don't feel comfortable doing it.

1930,No way out,"I've been thinking a lot about how there really is no way out of the work mess by working.

Labor: Overworked and underpaid (if not in a union).  Actually can make good money for retirement depending on the industry/country but you can't do physical labor your whole life.  Injuries/sickness likely.

Literally anything that fulfills you or is 'fun': You'll be underpaid and overworked 100% of the time, especially if you're working for a charity or doing any type of art.  You also probably won't be doing the things you like to do most of the time.

Accountants: Overworked, your job is keeping other people rich and helping them pay less in taxes, making society worse over time.

Doctor: The doctor track could literally kill you as we saw last year.  The stress/odd hours and sleep deprivation will give you heart problems later in life.

Lawyer: Massively oversaturated market, 99% are underpaid paperwork hunters.

Stock trader: Your job is literally your life. Your best bet is to make enough to retire early because the average stock trading workload isn't sustainable into middle age.

Engineering/construction/design/programmers: Extremely boring but can actually can have a good work life balance, but the market is really oversaturated and office culture is toxic.  You might just barely be able to have some form of retirement, but you will have to work the full 40+ years and you don't know what will happen between then.

Entreprenaurship: You own your job but still basically have to work the same hours as everyone else in order to be successful, you're also really vulnerable to crises collapsing your business, which are becoming more frequent.

There is **nothing wrong** with wanting to live in a way that makes you comfortable, happy and of most benefit to those around you. Wanting to spend time with loved ones, learning, exercising, exploring, trying new things, relaxing and getting as much sleep as you need are signs of maturity, not immaturity. 

If we want to claim we live in a free country, we have to allow people to choose for themselves how they spend their time. Anything less is servitude, and honestly the fact that we have to explain to people that servitude is a bad thing gives me chills.

I got little sleep last night. I was busy so I ended up going to bed later than I wanted to. I came into work, 6 am, was only there for a week today. Was being trained and I had a hard time keeping my eyes open. I was told by the manager I can’t sleep. I’m not trying to sleep and I was literally trying to keep my eyes open. I want to learn but I am fucking tired so it’s hard to do that. I was accused of not engaging before and yes it is my fault because I did not put the effort into going to bed earlier. But today I tried my best and I have tried my best before when I was tired too. 

Then later, the trainer was busy helping out someone else while I waited. I was pulled aside by the hiring agency agent or whatever because I apparently don’t engage. Yet, what am I supposed to do if I’m waiting for my next instruction ffs? If I look away from the trainer for 2 seconds I get accused of not paying attention too! (bs) 

Then later comes the final nail in the coffin for me. The trainer was explaining/showing us how to read blueprints and I couldn’t hear her, so I told her that. She told me to come in closer to her to hear her so I did and I still couldn’t hear her and she starting talking even more quietly. She said “she didn’t want to yell”. I was leaning in and was like 4 feet away with my hand up to my ear to hear and still couldn’t decipher. Factories are loud. Speak up ffs. 

She asks me a question expecting a answer and I told her I didn’t know because I can’t hear. She walks away, sighs loudly, then comes back. Got a call when I came home that I was let go but they offered to train me in another department. Screw that, I do not want to see these people ever again. 

Being in a factory made me feel not much different from being the replacable parts like I was assembling. Yes, it was my fault and I fully admit that I should be doing better getting proper sleep.

1980,"Nostalgia, escapism, geek culture","I'm sure most of you have noticed a rise in a certain kind of consumer culture: the reenacting of the old, and the promise of awe and excitement, of entering a different world of purpose. This symptom of our times should not be treated as a mere ""extension of childhood"" in a condescending manner; or vilified as simple capitalist ""consumerism"". It is an anthropological crisis developing in front of us every day: people have lost hope in changing the world, apathy is on the rise, life has become atomized, self-indulging, coping. Going through the motions to get to the weekend.

So, whenever a different world is shown to us, we are drawn to it. The stories, the fauna, the characters, the civilizations, the technology or lack thereof. It all fascinates us. Collectively we nucleate as fans of certain shows, movies, games, books, etc. as, at the same time, our striving for something different and also our individualistic lifestyles. Escapism is so widespread because it tries to fill our yearning for purpose, and shows us a world where our existential problems would vanish (mainly a sense of disconnection, of uselessness, of submitting to the worthless rat-race). It gives us an adventure that we cannot live today without risking all that we have. Emotions, and experiences.

This happened to me with several media, novels, documentaries. Of course, there's always a romantic idealism, but maybe criticizing escapism as naive is even more naive than that. You can't expect us subjects of capitalism to have an objective sense of what our human existence could be like, or how much could it be improved in the spiritual sense, in our quest for purpose and belonging. If anything, we have to give more power to these visions, as they could tell us so much about our own oppression and the disenchantment of the modern capitalist world.",False,mm3o1j,Reject_Existence,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mm3o1j/nostalgia_escapism_geek_culture/,7,1

&gt;If we wait for the government it'll be too late, if we act as individuals it'll be too little but if we act as a community it might just be enough.

If you wait for the government to help you it might be too late and if we try to do things on our own it might not be enough, but only by acting as a community together can we achieve something great. Don't pull yourself up by your bootstraps, find communities that care about you and would help you and be with them. This may take the form of a family or good friends. But it can also take the form of workers or housing collapse. It might take the form of shared interest clubs or even after school programs.

Ask yourself, do these people really see you as a person or do they just see you as a utility that could be replaced? That's how you know you found the right to community and it certainly isn't going to be in your job. Corporations are not your friends even if they make things you like.

2018,"The sad thing is, there are so much jobs that could be really cool if it wasn't for our work culture","Construction work and craftman-jobs for example. I often hear that todays generation doesn't want to do physical jobs anymore, but the reality is, many young people would love to work with their own hands and actually see their accomplishment at the end of the day. What they don't want is constant stress, ridiculous hours and a work environment that is just outright toxic. 

Health care jobs: Helping people to get and stay healthy and helping then to live a good live? Count me in! 
Doing this for 10h daily under constant stress and a criminally low pay? 
Oh hell no! 

Office jobs: sitting in a cushy cube and doing a bit of paperwork doesn't sound that bad. But making these jobs artificially harder than they have to be via ridiculous office culture makes a cosy job to literal torture. 

God, i would even clean the streets and public buildings if it would be just for a few hours per week and if i could at least partially decide when i am going to do this.

If I did, I’d have to work full time(often more than 40 hours, far more if you include time getting ready for work etc), then when I get off work I’d have to study for an additional 2/3 hours. Like what kind of life is that man? You have virtually no time to yourself. To me it feels like your life is your career. 

Anyways, even if I were to do CPA and get it done, the money would obv be nice but also the job would come with more responsibility, even more work, more deadlines and more stress. I look at my seniors and I wouldn’t want to be in their shoes, you know? Some of them are working until late at night during month ends. 

Anyways, I’ve given myself a time frame of 6 months to see if accounting is something I really want to pursue. Sigh. Do wish I had better guidance and mentorship in my life when I was growing up

I have severe social anxiety and depression for which I take medication for.

Thing is, this job is stress free. I don’t really have to talk to people. It’s five minutes away from home.

To be fair, most of the time it's not a big deal because I can ask a coworker and even though I hate it, the task gets accomplished and I learn something. But as time goes on, it becomes more and more irratating. I've been here about 5 months and still feel like I don't really know shit. I'm able to do the basic tasks they've shown me, but the pieces haven't really clicked yet.


It really doesn't help when my boss will give me an assignment, say we need to meet to discuss it and then proceed to be so busy that it's a challenge to find a free point on his calendar. Then when the time comes, it's a garuanteed he'll be at least 5 minutes late or cancel last minute. My permissions and access still aren't set correctly and at the point where I'm going to just do my work, not stress at all and see where that lands me.

2048,Cryptocurrency investing (long because I can’t sum up how much this has changed my life),"Seen someone else post about investing in cryptocurrency and I left a comment telling people about a group that provides education as well as calls, either buying and holding over a long period (weeks or months) and then margin trading for shorter term.

Comment I left was

 “100% agree with this. My family raised me with the ethos of “if something seems too good to be true, that’s because it is”. I’m 26 and so far that’s held true, except for my cryptocurrency journey. Bought a few thousand XRP in 2017, clueless about crypto basically, then at the beginning of February I joined cryptowzrd. I’m not going to bullshit you here, the initial sign up fee may seem expensive, but holy fuck I made my money back within DAYS. This dude Billy is a literal wizard with market analysis, tells you what to do and all you’ve gotta do is follow instructions and the money comes. 

I work for the NHS in the UK so work may not be as bad as people working for private companies etc, but it’s honestly being life changing since getting involved with the community. 

https://cryptowzrd.com?sca_ref=708866.eI7wKwwTdY

I urge anyone to check it out, because me and my family, my friends and their families are seriously financially comfortable now. People in the group have paid off mortgages, even bought houses, it’s insane even with any tax you’ve gotta pay”

I’m not going to bullshit y’all, if I read this as you probably are now I’d think it was a scam or some shit, but I fucking hate capitalism and how society operates, it’s changed my life in a few months, and there’s so much more financial freedom to be earned. I’d love nothing better than to bring this to people’s attention and help them towards being financially free, having the time for the rest of their life not squandered for corporations that are destroying people and the planet.

2050,"The relief I felt seeing how many people are subbed to something like this, wow. Hello my people!!!","Anti-work is something I have been preaching for years, but have only recently been able to embrace. I come from a very low, low middle class family. Meaning I would not overall say I grew up poor, but had periods where we were poor and some where we were doing pretty well. I have very young parents for my age and have watched them struggle, work their ass off to save up enough to both start a business and buy a house, then get destroyed by the real estate bubble pop, and by awful small town politics affecting their business and ability to get permits. My whole life all I have wanted for them is to able to rest and enjoy themselves. My father especially (not that mom worked less, she was the ""homemaker"".) Everyone's dad is the most hardworking dad, but this man...wow. He needs a break. 

Then there's me, who went off to college at a time when my parents were really hurting financially. I had to work 40+ hours a week on top of an engineering curriculum, to not just pay my own bills and rent but at times help with my parents and my terminally ill grandfather. Long story short I burned out by 2nd semester junior year. All that work for no degree. I'll get it someday, but ive made my peace with that one. 

I spent the next 4 years doing anything I could for money. Shit jobs like security, being a subject for clinical trials, hell I was even an escort for a short stint before it just became too depressing. Point is my whole life I have never known financial security. All I have ever known is work, no time for individuality and pursuing my dreams. But always had this burning feeling that this can't be the only path in life. 

Recently I learned a ton about investing and got lucky with a couple moves (yes one of them was gamestop, also blackberry and some weed stocks). Unfortunately I didn't walk away with as much as I could have, but enough to coast on for a good few years and have no major worries about income. And it has COMPLETELY changed my outlook on life, on my self. My loved ones are all wondering what big thing I'll do next. Meanwhile I just want to live alone in the woods and be at peace. With that said I am not ""out of the woods"" yet, and know I have to make moves and investments to preserve this way of life in the long run, but ive made massive strides and am so relieved about it. I can finally invest in myself, my interests, and the ways I want to make this world a better place by the time I exit.

I dont have much of a point to leave you with, and sorry for the length, I just wanted to express my joy in finding a community that knows exactly how I feel and I don't have to feel ashamed or lazy for not wanting to keep oiling this fucking stupid machine we all keep running. 
Obviously most of us need to work to get to a good jump-off point. But hell even that sentiment has problems. Way of the world I guess. 

Any way, thanks for reading if you made it this far. I dont have many real life connections left so I mean it, thanks.

So here are jobs that aren't for me:

1. I think driving jobs, but I'm still deciding on how I feel about this, I might completely, completely take it back. Seems like tons of freedom depending. Depending. I don't think trucking would be a good fit for me personally but yeah
2. warehouse jobs basically as a whole as a weakling and someone who gets migraines sometimes, wimpy though that may sound. When I work retail in jobs where I need to walk miles and miles and miles my ankles kinda hurt a bit and I'd rather avoid that
3. Corporate cafeteria jobs where for min wage you have to serve at the very least many dozens and more like way more than that. Equitable distribution of work is my whole thing, I'm not anti-productivity or success lmfao I'm anti-making someone else a lot of money
4. Pretty much any job where you have to wear a uniform
5. Any job where the manager's a dick and is either being a total dick or literally isn't clear whatsoever about what it is they're trying to communicate or ask you to do. Like they're like ""You're doing bad"" but absolutely cannot explain themselves further. I might add folks that are nazis but occasional phone use but phones aren't ALL that interesting to me anyway so idk

2074,"""Thats just how its always been.""","I started working part time when i was 15 and full time as soon as i turned 18.

I remember thinking I hated working, despised it even, getting up and ridiculous times and working on some mundane task that could either be done a different way to be made easier or done in a smaller time frame with the same result.
Then I'd get home after 8 hours of crap and be so burnt out that I'd either sleep of have no interest in doing any hobbies, rinse and repeat for 5 days a week.

Im now 27, and the thing is I figured out it wasn't ""working"" as a whole I hated, it was just the constant day in day out working life.
I hated working for a company, a company that makes millions while the working class gets paid barely a living wage and just expects you to keep pushing on.

I would try to have this conversation with anybody and they'll all more or less say the same thing ""thats how it's always been"" working has ""always been like that"" and the only thing that pops into my head is ""why?"" Better yet, why should it be?

So let me get this straight: I have to work multiple hours a day for 5 or 6 days a week while some rich fuck that probably hasn't worked a full time job in their life just earns more money than I'll ever see by doing nothing?

I read it was estimated that Elon Musk makes $2400 a second.... A. Fucking. Second!
I dont care if you're the queen of England nobody deserves to make more money a second than a normal average person can make in 2 weeks of working full time if even!
While over employers like Jeff Bazos makes billions and treats Amazon workers like crap!

The system needs to change.

I remember when Covid first hit and companies were shitting bricks left right and centre because their was no way they could work from home (even before covid) then they had no choice and boom... it worked out.

All this time I've been asking myself ""what's wrong with me"". Why don't I care to impress anyone anymore? Why don't I want to do my work? And besides that obvious, ever-pressing apathy that comes with your work being ignored (which again is wholly my fault and a vicious cycle because I never get anything FINISHED...) I simply realised today that the reason I haven't been striving for more and killing myself the way I usually would be is because I'm...happy.

I'm 29/F, gay, live alone in a little bachelor pad where no one bothers me, and that's honestly a life closest to my deepest values and desires - and that's why it's been a struggle to strive for more. I can barely bother with the headache. I'm not rich, I have dreams, there are things I absolutely COULD work harder for, but like on a base happiness level with all the things I can control, I've reached a level of contentment that makes striving for anything else literally a risk. Or a bother.

Sure, I could try and get out there, get a girlfriend...but if it doesn't happen, meh.

I could try and get richer but I'd have to work harder and I just like my bottom of the barrel but adequate life...so, meh. 

I could try and travel but like if I don't it'd still be okay, so meh.

I could work out and become a monster being but I'm in pretty good shape as it is right now an am so bored of long term goals, so meh.

I don't really have any friends or family or crushes I need to impress and as nice as those things would be to have, I'm perfectly happy being a hermit and love my own space.

I don't have any enemies to defeat because I feel I live a better life than all of them as it is, how I am right now, genuinely. It's not my best life but at least I don't have any problems, currently.

...So maybe this is my best life?

Sounds selfish, I know. I used to be the ""save the world"" type but it just got boring and old and other people's cynicism have gotten to me. I used to try to sell my art but it was too much work trying to beg people to see what I see, to beg people to enjoy something ffs, so I just create for myself now. Maybe I'll become one of those hidden gems who gains posthumous success for their art when they die because that seems to be the only time people want to take notice. I'm tired of yelling at the top of my lungs for unity and compassion and philanthropy and have people look at you like you have two heads. Over it.

I think I've peaked and I'm cool with that, haha. There's no resentment, just peace. As long as I can just survive and afford my basics, I'm sweet. If I can't I'll just get another job, or become a prostitute, or just die, lol there's literally no reason to worry and the worrying was making me ill. I don't care about ""OMG TIKTOK MAKE £30 MORE PER HOUR REDDIT FINANCIAL FREEDOM"" Bla bla. I could just be burntout but I don't think so, this has been going on for a while.

2088,How I made it out of the system,"I'm going to keep this short - just suffice to say I've been an unhappy cog in the machine for 20+ years.

I discovered investing about 4 years ago and I am retiring a little later this year - I'll live off the interest - I won't be rich, I'll have to live frugally (around 40k a year for the first few years until I build the nest egg).  Full disclosure though - I inherited my house (it's nothing great but I didn't have to buy it and that's a massive expense for most people).

The stock market is kept intentionally overwhelming and confusing to deter average people - I started learning how to invest from the book 'The Intelligent Investor' and with $400 I got into the market.  I read every book I could find about investing, learned options, built up to 25k, and started day trading.

There are a ton of resources out there for new investors learning the ropes.  I never invested more than 1% of my total pool, I've never YOLO'd into a position hoping to get rich off one trade, I just played the odds, learned how to read charts, do my own due diligence, and learn who not to listen to.

I'm not saying this will work for everyone - but with time, effort, and patience it can work for most people.  It's not ideal - it's stressful at times - and it's not what I consider 'fun' (apart from winning trades) but it has given me my life back and as of August, I will answer to no one anymore. 

It's going to be a long time before work is eliminated - but you can help yourself in the meantime - and you don't need a lot to do it.  Just stay away from no commission brokers like Robinhood and stay away from YOLO plays and you can pull this off as well.  I was completely financially illiterate 5 years ago - credit score in the 500s, didn't understand good vs bad debt, compounded interest etc - our school systems are set up to keep you in your place.  Having money in the bank gives you confidence and improves every aspect of your life - yes, it's absolute bullshit that's what it takes but it's better for the most part than being homeless or not having any options.

2094,New to sub but Anti(useless)work most of my life.,"Hi everyone. I just found this subreddit today and am happy to find a community of people who share my thoughts about how crazy the modern work world is and how valuable our time on this earth is. I thought I'd share my experiences and difficulties and hope they help someone.

I am 34 living in the USA. When I was in elementary school, I only learned English from school while my parents spoke to me in two non-English languages. I was consistently getting below average scores on standardized tests and my teacher thought I was retarded, as anyone would be if they only had US public school to teach them. One day I decided to get a kid's novel I could hardly read, work through it myself for a few weeks, and by the time I was done, I was finally able to read most English books with good fluency. It also taught me a lifelong lesson of teaching myself from books.

Since I was 13, I didn't want to do meaningless work that didn't actually help people. In the early 2000s, I read books from the 1950s warning of politicians leading the USA into its current economic situation and I couldn't deny that was the direction we were going. I was aware of the transfer of industry from the USA to Asian countries and that automation would obsolete jobs.

During high school, I was tired of the public education propaganda, and I was already learning the things I needed from books at local libraries. I would skip classes, go to the library or outside school, and went through more of the textbooks than I would sitting in class. I wanted to homeschool but my parents wouldn't let me, so I had to wait until I was 16, the legal age to decide for myself to homeschool in the state I lived in. This caused a lot problems in my Asian family. Some were neutral or supportive, some said that I was no longer family.

While homeschooling, I still worked hard to go through the textbooks I needed to read, but it gave me the freedom to learn when and where I wanted to, whether library, outside, or at home. And I had a lot more time to learn new things and pursue my hobbies. I really appreciated how I was in control of my own time, and my time didn't get wasted on things like going to and from school, pointless class activities, waiting on classes to start or end, lunch, or physical education.

I did well on my GED and SAT tests and got into a good engineering school. Anyone thinking about homeschooling but are hesitant to because you think it may hinder getting into a good college, please know that many homeschoolers do get into good colleges. What matters to them is whether you can demonstrate adequate proficiency and are prepared.

College was less retarded than public school, and good for the people who can put up with it and find their dream jobs. I dropped out after working at a commercial solar PV installation company. I learned to design PV installation layouts and install solar panels on the job site. I eventually worked full time but we have an understanding that I can come and go as I like. Right now I am taking a long break from my day job and working for an open source project, and learning programming because I would like to contribute code to the open source ecosystem, in the hopes that someday we can have a humane UBI system based on open source software.

I live frugally and have taken long periods of time off from work to just spend time on my hobbies, learn new things, and try different work that interests me. I am not rich, but I take care of my health and am time rich. I don't waste my money on materialistic goods, and I find my time well-spent working on things I care about. At the age of 34, looking back I may not have gotten on the career path to make millions like some people around me, but I feel like I have been semi-retired since 16, only doing work that I find enriching, taking plenty of time to explore the things that interest me, and most importantly, pursuing the things my heart tells me to.",False,mkc3vx,EpicMichaelFreeman,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mkc3vx/new_to_sub_but_antiuselesswork_most_of_my_life/,2,1

2099,Sick of the obsession with productivity and perfection,"The corporate world went downhill as soon as companies started religiously focusing on productivity and employee outputs. All this stuff straight out of a Harvard MBA, things like KPIs, Lean Sigma, this corporate bullshit where they take concepts from manufacturing and apply them to people. 

Except it doesn't work like that because these metrics are simple and don't account for so much so it's easy to bias them. Management reducing staff may increase their KPIs and the bean counters will praise them for reducing expenses; but all it's doing is putting more pressure on the existing employees. Longer hours, more work, more stress, more phonecalls, more emails, more shit to deal with. They wonder why there's so many big fuck ups and it's because employees have too much on their plate to deal with; even if they don't mess up they just burn out and wind up in the hands of the mental health industry. That's the problem with being cheap, you pay more in the end. 

But this illness is spreading faster than COVID. Jobs are becoming more and more scarce as a result of automation, offshoring and reducing employees to save money (and management looks good). Jobs being scarce is putting fear in everyone who wants a lifestyle above poverty level. Workers are now so scared they're endlessly trying to be productive in their lives; not because they really want to but because they want/need to impress hiring managers in the future. 

Those of you who went to college/university would've seen people doing all these extra-curriculars, leadership roles, volunteering; not because they truly wanted to do it but because they want to impress hiring managers. You see them on Linkedin using bullshit corporate lingos like ""motivated self starter"" and ""devoted to self improvement"". They sound and look like dogs doing any trick for a treat. I can't fault them because anyone who's desperate will do anything for their own survival. Employers see this and use it to fuel their superiority complex and narcissism; they have all the power so it makes them feel big. 

Just endless ass-kissing just for a fucking shit job you don't even want to be at.

Paying attention is often difficult for me, i'm very forgetful, and doing things when i'm not interested in them is very difficult for me. And at times, i can't even do things i want to do. The other day i spent six hours trying to start drawing, yet i was always doing anything else, even when i wanted to draw. I was never bad at school, but i had memory issues and studying was difficult, because i wasn't interested in doing it. Right now i'm studying animation and game development, and actually like school at times. 

Yet i still have trouble doing assignments that require me to think a lot - i procrastinate doing them for as long as i can. I still can't always start doing things even when i want to. Even when i like school, it's enough of a struggle to me. 

I can't work at a job if it doesn't interest me 100%. A couple of years ago i had a week-long job at a store because of school, an easy job where i only had to put things on shelves for around six hours a day. I was only able to do that work for two hours on the first day and then never came back. I just physically and mentally couldn't do the job. Everyone thinks i'm just lazy, but i'm really trying.

I think of how much time I spent gaining new skills in high school and really had a rich and meaningful life. Aside from school, I was working as a prep cook for a local nursing home and making time to write music and young adult fiction. I look back on how things were then and they were generally pretty great. 

So here I am now. I'm good at what I do for work, I don't hate it, and I can pay my bills. But when I'm not doing that, I find doing anything else to be difficult. Sitting down at the piano is a chore, I haven't written any fiction in years, and though my kitchen life is still pretty healthy, I have dozens of projects on my to-do list that are continuing to pile up.

2127,After reading a disturbing story about Toronto poverty I'm now completely convinced the government is trying to murder its poor,"The story is on the OCAP website (an anti poverty organization). I have stayed up all night in horror after reading this worried about my options. I knew there has been years of austerity but I've never read of anything like this before. This is truly a new age we've entered in the step the governments take to kill off their citizens. 

Anyway, what they were saying is just how the Toronto city officials had fought back on the idea of 24 hour warming shelters for homeless women and children. Women and children are being pushed out on the street to die. There are no shelter spots left (they gave the true stats, not the fake ones). There was more discussion on the true level of unemployment and how the government (provincial and federal) through Ontario and Canada has given false statistics about just how dire the unemployment crisis truly is (and this was pre covid). 

There is literally no way to survive this if you're working class. You can go to school, collect debt and never be guaranteed a job despite your best efforts. The little ''survival jobs'' are now impossible to get and won't pay the exorbitant cost of rent in most Canadian cities and towns. You can try to get a room but you'd be surprised how much that costs (as high as 1600 in someones basement in Toronto). If you go to a shelter it's 100% full. Even if you're a woman with a child (which used to be priority years back - most homeless out on the street were single males). 

In a country like Canada it's more than easy enough to succumb to the elements (extreme cold). This goes beyond austerity, this is all by design and it's at the point of murder now. A decade back it was more of a neglect on the pat of the government and you could still get by with extreme budgeting and long hours at work on your own.

I'm in Gen Z and I can't even fucking relax without feeling pressured to try and make an income somehow. I now work a flexible job and only work a few days out of the week, but I always feel like I need to make even more money. I always feel pressured to get a side hustle to make extra income by older people. It's always,"" HEY! YOU KNOW YOU COULD GET A FOLLOWING ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND MAKE MONEY!"" Like it's a simple and easy process.

I've been homeless before and that experienced traumatized me because I was exploited and basically told that I wasn't worth anything and that I must be mentally ill because I didn't have a job. 

I'm in therapy, but I don't think my therapist could help me with how I'm feeling about capitalism. It's very depressing. I may sound cynical, but it just showed me how evil people can get when they have the option to take advantage of someone that's not financial stable because most people will take that opportunity to take advantage of that person and say they were doing you a favor.

I know there's nothing I can do about it, but I'm just tired. No amount of weed or alcohol can make me feel better. 

I live in the US and I want to travel to see if I like any other country enough to move,but of course I can't fucking travel without making and saving a lot of money which would require me to pick up an extra job. 

I'm tired of hearing about money all of the time and people bragging about how their making money during a pandemic looking down on people who lost their jobs.

I’ve built up enough savings and have paid off enough stuff that I can still keep my head above water if I work part time. All I want out of life is to have the time and energy to read and learn more—that’s really it! I don’t need anything but a car, apartment, electricity, and books, which I’m fortunate enough to have. But working full time, along with all the frequent and radical changes the company I work for has made during COVID (including going from over 100 staff to now about 50), has really burnt me out. I don’t know how much I can keep doing it. Add to the mix that for the past few years I’ve been trying to work my way through school class by class without going into astronomical debt... I just feel like it’d b good to take some damn time off from full time work. I should be able to do it without totally burning through my savings, so I’ll still have a bit of a safety net. 

I guess I’d rather be broke as shit with more free time and less stress than work my life away for a few extra bucks and benefits. Is it worth going part time with something easier do you think?

v @AxG6BK mon to & capitalism questions and discussion + am + 1

BoComments
we
An | be fired for wearing something the boss does not like?

| want to start by promoting a discussion about employment at-will in the United States.

Employment at-will is a concept | had a hard time with in my was. | now see that its a vital
characteristic of a successful society. Of your boss rates the color blue and you wear a blue shirt, you
can be fired. You might think this is insanity - but you have the same rights. Of you think his red shirt is
nasty, you can march right up to him and quit.

Employment at-will is the mechanism that self regulates your salary. You present an employer your
skill and merits and they decide how much they are worth. Of you have enough of these things you will
not be fired because you are valuable and finding valuable people is hard. Of you are not compensated
enough it is your will to find more profitable employment.

There seems to be some strange idea that employers are members of some sort of elite patriarch and
the people they hire are expendable leggings that do the same work. The opposite if usually the case
- Employers look for people that have the characteristics they need to make the organization profit.
Profit is not an evil thing, it is needed to keep the cash flowing to all employees.

Employment at-will is a great thing. One should not confuse this with being fired or not hired for
discrimination of immutable characteristics like skin color or sex. There are laws in the USA that forbid
this.

Then I grew up and went to work in retail. I found out that as we opened up shopping on Sundays and holidays, I could never count on any specific day off. In fact, if there was a holiday I wanted to spend with my family, I usually got scheduled on it. I had to fight managers tooth and nail to spend time with my kids on holidays.

I realize now I was played by capitalism and the shiny stuff they dangled in front of my stupid self to demand that everything be open on Sundays. I never thought of the workers who lost that one day they could count on to spend any way they wanted. I miss those Blue Laws. We need Blue Laws without the enforced religion.

2161,New to sub but Anti(useless)work most of my life.," Hi everyone. I just found this subreddit today and am happy to find a community of people who share my thoughts about how crazy the modern work world is and how valuable our time on this earth is. I thought I'd share my experiences and difficulties and hope they help someone.

I am 34 living in the USA. When I was in elementary school, I only learned English from school while my parents spoke to me in two non-English languages. I was consistently getting below average scores on standardized tests and my teacher thought I had mental problems, as anyone would be if they only had US public school to teach them. One day I decided to get a kid's novel I could hardly read, work through it myself for a few weeks, and by the time I was done, I was finally able to read most English books with good fluency. It also taught me a lifelong lesson of teaching myself from books.

Since I was 13, I didn't want to do meaningless work that didn't actually help people. In the early 2000s, I read books from the 1950s warning of politicians leading the USA into its current economic situation and I couldn't deny that was the direction we were going. I was aware of the transfer of industry from the USA to Asian countries and that automation would obsolete jobs.

During high school, I was tired of the public education propaganda, and I was already learning the things I needed from books at local libraries. I would skip classes, go to the library or outside school, and went through more of the textbooks than I would sitting in class. I wanted to homeschool but my parents wouldn't let me, so I had to wait until I was 16, the legal age to decide for myself to homeschool in the state I lived in. This caused a lot problems in my Asian family. Some were neutral or supportive, some said that I was no longer family.

While homeschooling, I still worked hard to go through the textbooks I needed to read, but it gave me the freedom to learn when and where I wanted to, whether library, outside, or at home. And I had a lot more time to learn new things and pursue my hobbies. I really appreciated how I was in control of my own time, and my time didn't get wasted on things like going to and from school, pointless class activities, waiting on classes to start or end, lunch, or physical education.

I did well on my GED and SAT tests and got into a good engineering school. Anyone thinking about homeschooling but are hesitant to because you think it may hinder getting into a good college, please know that many homeschoolers do get into good colleges. What matters to them is whether you can demonstrate adequate proficiency and are prepared.

College was more tolerable than public school, and good for the people who can put up with it and find their dream jobs. I dropped out after working at a commercial solar PV installation company. I learned to design PV installation layouts and install solar panels on the job site. I eventually worked full time but we have an understanding that I can come and go as I like. Right now I am taking a long break from my day job and working for an open source project, and learning programming because I would like to contribute code to the open source ecosystem, in the hopes that someday we can have a humane UBI system based on open source software.

I live frugally and have taken long periods of time off from work to just spend time on my hobbies, learn new things, and try different work that interests me. I am not rich, but I take care of my health and am time rich. I don't waste my money on materialistic goods, and I find my time well-spent working on things I care about. At the age of 34, looking back I may not have gotten on the career path to make millions like some people around me, but I feel like I have been semi-retired since 16, only doing work that I find enriching, taking plenty of time to explore the things that interest me, and most importantly, pursuing the things my heart tells me to.",False,mkcgf3,EpicMichaelFreeman,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mkcgf3/new_to_sub_but_antiuselesswork_most_of_my_life/,0,1

I live down the street from Echo Park in Los Angeles CA and I'm tired of the dehumanization of the homeless. I saw on the news a few days ago that the SWAT team was sent to clear the homeless out of the park. 

The comment section on this youtube video is absolutely atrocious. So many idiots, who could also easily end up homeless themselves, are vilifying homeless folks saying that they are all on drugs or stupid and that's why they deserve to be homeless. I am in the comment section replying to each stupid comment that's dehumanizing the homeless but it's overwhelming. There are way too many morons in the world who still think homelessness is largely the fault of the individual. Sure there are homeless folks on drugs and who poo and pee where they want, but all homeless people aren't like that, and just because there are homeless people like that, it doesn't change the fact that as long as there is the commodification of housing then there will ALWAYS be homelessness. Society is a Pyramid Scheme and THAT is why homeless exists. So many folks ignore this fact it's disturbing. 

Folks who dehumanize the homeless are so quick to bitch about ""mUh TaX dOlLaRs"" going towards helping their fellow citizen, but they don't care that their tax dollars go towards wars, bank bailouts and paying off the national debt.

2168,The Black Hole Of Material Consumption,"You know, when I look around a lot of reddit posts and threads, I notice a similar theme where most people feel they are winning at life simply by accumulating more material wealth.

A lot of the discussion is around how to invest better, have more money, have nicer things, etc.

I realize it is this very topic that makes me very unhappy and miserable.

I simply want to make the point that life isn't just about accumulating material things. Some of us are not materialistic people, and so we do not have the same greed of others when it comes to maximizing wealth.

For me, I have the (material) stuff I wanted. I sit here thinking about what I can buy to make myself happier and realize it doesn't work like that. There really isn't ""stuff"" that would change my mental state anymore.

I'm the type of person who can drive a cheap car, and live in a small studio or one bedroom apartment and it is enough. What is annoying about this world to me is the constant pressure for people to do ""better"" than that or ""attain"" more.

I think for the people that can buy happiness by owning Tesla cars and 5 bedroom homes, great go for it and spend decades to get there. For me, I realize I could care less about these things. I don't have many friends and I'm not trying to impress others since I know I will always lose in that game.

I guess what I am trying to say is - I encourage others to not feel bad about their own situation because the culture we live in tries to force you to feel inadequate no matter what you have. If you are like me - and you don't get your happiness from owning expensive things - don't let the toxic culture make you feel inadequate and unworthy for not wanting what you don't need.",False,mk2gcx,Pessimist001,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mk2gcx/the_black_hole_of_material_consumption/,6,5

I love this sub a lot and I feel like I'm among friends when i browse. To be clear, I know work is all a big fucking sham. 

I left my job a few months ago. I quit because I was on the verge of a fucking breakdown like so many of us are... anyway, I felt like I would never achieve anything. just worthless. The demands kept piling up and new responsibilites that were feeling well outside of my area were creeping in. Annual pay was 35k and bumped to 39k after 6 months. 

I quit and took a break to sooth my poor brain. Sadly I can not be unemployed much longer and I'm currently job hunting (for something part time so that I can have just little a bit of my life, as a treat). 

ANYWAY, while searching all these job sites and stuff I was curious to see if they were ever going to hire my replacement. They finally had a posting for my replacement and It was 20-30k more than what I made there and the position had wayyyy more qualifications than when I applied/got hired. Same responsiblities that I had. 

I'm feeling a lot right now. Validated, but pretty upset... I constantly felt like I wasnt good/smart/skilled/whatever enough the entire time i was there. I got a lot of feedback from my boss and ""growth opportunities"". Failure fucks me up so hard. I was bound to fail from the start because I was never meant to be in that position (despite the fact I was the perfect match for the original job posting/position).

I just want to enjoy my life. I can't be dicked around like this. I wish I didnt need to go back to work. things have really brightened up for me since leaving.

Repeat. 

Seriously, our lives literally revolve around our work. The stress, the deadlines and worst of all the financial pressure that if you lose this job or quit for a while or whatever, you literally won’t be able to survive. How fucked up is that?

Then to make things even worse, if you’re in North America you get a lousy two fucking weeks off. Wtf does one even do in that? You can’t explore the country, never mind the world. 

Honestly man, I can’t just do this for years on end until I’m old. Really need to figure a way out. 

Just had a 3 day weekend. I wish they’d just be a little more humane and fucking make that shift permanent already. Why is it that the more advanced technology gets, the more we have to work? How does that make sense? Couldn’t even fully enjoy it because returning to work and the tasks I have to do are always on the back of my mind. Also, I’m often thinking about making the most of this current moment during weekends etc to ensure I don’t waste it lol. 

Finally, what just adds insult to injury is ducking inflation and the decline of our purchasing power over the decades. It’s so fucking hard for young adults to get by nowadays without rich parents.

2197,"Even my boomer dad (57M Vietnamese), who've reached FI, believes that people shouldn't be working a 9-5.","My dad grew up in poverty (he and his parents were farmers) and was one of the HARDEST working man you could come across. Just to list a few things:

* Even when he was in elementary, he had to wake up at 4AM to help my grandpa with farm works.
* At the age of 7, he learned to cook, cleaning, doing laundry... to help with house chores.
* During his teenage age, to earn some money, he'd go catch frogs, toads at 9PM in the middle of the fields.
* And he was still working, he always woke up at 5:30 AM since the company he worked was very far away and arrive at home at 6PM the earliest. Due some circumstance during that time, that was his ""best choice"" so nothing he couldn't do about it.
* From a small factory with just only 4 workers, he turned it into a big one with 400 employees.
* Got cancer in 2007 and beaten it in 2010.
* After years of tirelessly working and savings, he built a small apartment with 10 units on his own lands. He then retired early and now just enjoys his new life in the fullest (going to the gym everyday, having barbecue every weekend...)

After knowing my dad, you might think he would be one of the kind who constantly make complains about how ""young'uns have it easy these day yet they complain too much"". But NO, he outright said ""People work to live, not live to work"" when I told him how westerners still ""complain"" about the 9-5 working hours. He stated there're much more to life then just working, one should have enough time to take care of themselves AND their family, and neither should be sacrificed for work. In fact, when my dad got promoted to Director and managed to get more time, he'd go home earlier to cook me dinners, taking the family out for dinners... He didn't aim for ""successfulness"" but the happiness of his family.

My dad has been through a lot of bullshits and believe that it'd be great if others could AVOID them, not suffering like how he did. One of them was working crazy hours in exchange of his health.

2198,Do people realize how serious this is. How the hell do you have children rn and feel safe and ok about their future. What the hell.,"For anyone who thinks we must all be forced to work:

The truth is most people’s jobs are BS and are going to get automated. I don’t think you realize that there are A LOT of people on the planet who didn’t ask to be born and it’s getting to the point where half of them are not needed for society to function or for resources to be allocated. 

That’s the part you’re missing. There’s literally no reason everyone in retail and at McDonald’s isn’t fired right now other than it would cause complete utter pandemonium, if the powers that be do it over night everybody would freak out. So they’re taking their time. That’s the terrifying secret. There are so many of us, most of us aren’t needed.


you either a) straight up put a cap on how many children people can have with some sort of dystopian list of adults who quality to begin with

B)literally let half of humanity starve

C)admit that half of the population doesn’t need to do anything for everything to function. And that the idea that if jobs aren’t required for food and for shelter that nobody would ever do anything useful again- you admit that that’s very short sited and indicative of someone with no understanding of society, class dynamics and who does what jobs and why and how they got their jobs. 

Because the truth is that the jobs that will remain useful ARE DONE BY PEOPLE WHO DO NOT NEED TO WORK TO LIVE/SURVIVE ANYWAYS. Most of the time if you’re in engineering school and can afford the masters it’s because you come from a family that can support you while you study in the field (most*** please don’t a start straw man with an inspiring story). This is the hard hard truth. In about 100 years, which is actually a really short time, nobody’s gonna care about a welder. Nobody’s gonna care about the guy that’s in a crane fixing the electricity poll. They’re working on replacing everything done with hands with technology more every year.

If people are innately lazy and no one will ever do anything to progress again then why is that most people who study to become doctors, successful lawyers, accomplished scientists, accomplished art directors (you know, people who make 100+g a year and call the shots, make the intellectual decisions, not the physical work...the jobs that will actually last) .....why are most of them from families that will give them trust funds when mom and dad die? 

Because people don’t make or study or do things if they don’t have the threat of death? Look at the investment class. Their kids go to RISD (expensive and elite af )  to learn about industrial design...because why not? And half of them don’t get jobs in after...because they literally don’t need to get a job to live.

I’m not sure if you have seen how the investment class lives and I’m not sure if you’ve absorbed that the elite, who get to study at the best schools and then sit in apartments that cost 4,000 a month without having to work, would kill themselves if they had to work 60 hours a week as a nurse or a teacher because if they didn’t study those fields they wouldn’t have another chance at survival (if you’re middle class and you go to school for anything other than nursing or teaching for the next 10 years...good luck).

The other 80% are nice people just trying to make a living. They are great, I take unscheduled phone calls just so I can talk to them b/c I truly want to connect with them and help them out since I am the expert with our software.

It's sunny outside, birds are chirping and squirrels are squirrelling and I want to go to the park and play disc golf.  
I don't want to spend my extra hours hustling for extra money but my wages don't keep up with the rising costs of living. I can't buy a house or even rent a house, I am here in my apartment that I am thankful for but my family and I live on top of each other. We could use more space but we literally can't afford more space.  


Is this the dilemma? Work so much to afford more but don't have time to enjoy the people you surround your self with? 

I work my job, I work my side hustle to build savings, I partially home school my kids and make food for my family b/c I want to but that is all I have time for.   
If I choose to drop my side hustle, then we have no saving, no way to build for the future but I have my free time to enjoy things like riding my bike, kayaking with my family, disc golfing with my friends.

2222,The major problem in this country is GREED.,"It all boils down to that simple word. Greed. It's why our domestic businesses don't and won't pay us enough to survive. It's why the rich don't want to pay taxes and are reluctant to help others build wealth. It's why apartment rent is higher than a mortgage, but it's easier to sign a one year lease for $1400/month for a two bedroom apartment but you basically need to have PERFECT credit and zero debt to sign a 20-30 year mortgage paying that same $1400/month for a 4 bedroom townhouse. It's why Capitalists call us lazy when we rally for higher wages and more government programs to help the poor and struggling. They claim we just want a handout and they don't wanna be the ones opening their wallets and purses to fund our need for food, shelter, and medical care. That's OUR problem..that's OUR fault. 

This country and the machines that power it are fueled by greed. And if you favor morality, ethics, unity, solidarity, progressive thinking, changes that actually HELP people, and a genuine goodwill towards you and your fellow man (or woman)...you are seen as out of touch.  And that's a major problem.

I'm 21m and before this I had only worked in other jobs but more operationally like server, deliveries, etc. Those jobs sucked but at least I was moving around in open air and hours passed by fast.
But now I got hired in January to do a job that I didn't hate so much but still didn't want to do ( I mean I want to just lie in a beach and enjoy my life not work away my best years). Anyway, immediately I was transferred to another department due to covid needs and they told me I was going to be there for like half a year or so. 

My job in this new department is basically and I'm not kidding to copy and paste. I feel like it is something that could be done by a 7 years old kid. I only copy and paste. The good thing is that it is not mandatory to work from the office so I always work from home and that the work is project based.
So let's say I get a 3 projects per week and they have to be completed. As soon as they are completed I can chill.

I thought I was going to be happy based on that because I am.waking up late, like I have to start at 8 but wake up at 8 put myself online on teams and go back to sleep until the morning meeting at 9:30 and I most of the times answer from my phone without camera and still in bed.

The problem is that my job is so boring that I just cannot do.it with out a distraction so for something it could take me 4 h I take 8 or something but because most of the times I'm.not working, I am with my phone or watching Netflix or something.
Other times I try to get everything done fast and I get many errors that I have to wait for other departments to fix and while all that I do nothing ( because I'm.not willing to ask for extra work.im.not stupid) but maybe they end up fixing the error on Wednesday at 12 and that project is due by 18 and I have to work my ass off with a lot of stress because somebody didn't do their work on time ( I always turn everything on time)

2230,Our tax structure is the biggest middle finger to the working class.,"There are many subtle, more egregious, signs that the US doesn't care about its working class, but the most obvious is the tax structure.  The best part is, that it's largely not talked about.  

&amp;#x200B;

When politicians ramble on about taxing the rich, they always talk about people *earning* $400K+ a year.  This actually refers to a specific group of high income people, doctors, lawyers, engineers, and other high salary professionals.  Interestingly enough, the overlap between the truly wealthy and the highly paid professional class is not nearly as large as most people think, and yet, these professionals usually pay the highest effective tax rate out of anyone.  

  
The truly wealthy are typically asset holders: people with property, stock, bonds, or businesses, and their *earned* income usually doesn't exceed $150K, yet they are the ones making millions / year in *capital gains* income.  

&amp;#x200B;

For perspective, the top marginal tax rate on earned income is 37% compared to the capital gains top rate of only 20% (a rate surpassed by your average factory worker).  This doesn't even account for the fact that wage earners pay for medicare, social security, and a host of other payroll taxes that capital gains related income is shielded from.  This points to the government wanting to help the capital class, while punishing the working class.  This is what we should be upset about, and this is why the wealthy don't really pay their fair share.  My view is that if anything, earned income should be taxed more favorably on the basis that someone is literally trading their life for money, whereas an investor is only trading the risk of financial loss for money.",False,mklwcs,No_Butterscotch9760,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mklwcs/our_tax_structure_is_the_biggest_middle_finger_to/,15,1

of keunkopussirotta

I've come to the realization that the reason why | end up in so many
arguments online is because of one specific cultural difference:
Americans apparently think that working and complaining are
mutually exclusive.

Finnish people work and complain. They do them both at the same
time. Is a matter of fact, if doing something unpleasant isn't
unpleasant enough to make you complain while doing it, is it even
worth doing?

used to work in this factory, and the factory work fucking sucked. It
the punch clock at 5:48 of, waiting to clock in for morning shift, |
could ask a co-worker how he's doing, and the answer could very
likely be something along the lines of ‘well, | didn't die in my sleep so
I'm here, but I'm not awake enough yet to be sure whether I'm happy
about it’, and it's like aye, that's valid.

It wouldn't have crossed my mind to ask “then why don't you go
home? why don't you just get a better job if you hate it here?’, or get
personally insulted, like ""well what do you want ~*me*~ to do about
it?’, like bad moods are always someone's personal fault.

Life is simply Not Run sometimes. It's often nobody's fault. And it
doesn't feel nice when things are like that. And it's not a tabor to
acknowledge that. The way | was raised, ""I am in a situation and this
situation Tucking Sucks"" is a perfectly acceptable way to word a
request for advice on how to fix it.

Well...one of the sister locations near by closed their doors and we took on some of their employees. Now we can do a split shift. But I still have to work 12 hours a day. They STILL won't hire someone to work in my area, even during the split shift. They even told me they can't hire someone to just work in my area when they do for EVERY OTHER AREA. Since things have to keep moving in my area, I STILL have to work 12 hours a day. It's not seven days a week anymore, but I'm the only one doing it.

I am TERRIFIED when another employee sets foot in the building because if one speck of dust is out of place, I’m going to be berated for it when Vanessa pulls out her microscope to find it. 

I’m not even allowed to learn and grow at a relatively good pace because when I do make small mistakes that are easily fixable with a little encouragement and constructive criticism, I can count on getting a passive aggressive letter. I can count on being torn to pieces even if what I’ve done wrong was just something [redacted] made up or if I wasn’t able to fix someone else’s mistake before she returns. 

I don’t have problems with anyone. Never. I haven’t been targeted like this since I was a hairy, pizza faced 3rd grader. I tried to handle these issues on my own. I really did.

Dear My,
When a girl gets her first period at the age of 12, she's

getting biological ready to be pregnant later in her
life.

His, however, does not mean -

1) she needs to get pregnant right away

2) she is emotional/biological ready to get
pregnant

Of you are destined to become the greatest writer in
the world, it does not mean you are supposed to be
that ‘today’.

Maybe today you just need to focus on your day job
during the working hours, and then study and practice
more writing.

Very incident has its own time :)

Old on. He patient. Deep doing what you're supposed
to be doing ‘at this moment’.

2256,Let's play Work™ with friends and family - A thought experiment,"1) Gather your friends and/or family. Tell them you're going to play a game, and that they can opt-out whenever they want to.

2) Proceed to appropriate their belongings. It's part of the game, you see, everyone playing gives a certain person possession of their properties and personal belongings, just for the fun of it, so that the game gets exciting and thrill-inducing.

3) Tell them they can use their belongings all they want in exchange for doing something for you, this exchange lasting as long as you want, preferably several hours a day of helping you with your own personal projects. If they don't want to help you, don't give them access to their belongings. If they don't want to play anymore, you get to keep everything anyway.

4) ???

5) Achieve your personal goals at the expense of threatening others with dispossession.

Sounds familiar? It should. In the real world, workers and other dispossessed people have given all they had to a proprietary class that profits and enjoys the fruits of their labour. If the lower classes don't want to work or can't pay back enough value to them in compensation, the proprietary class takes it all back.

2281,How David Bowie's death made me want to quit working.,"David Bowie died in 2016.  He was 69.  I was never a huge fan of Bowie but I respected his career.  He'd been famous my entire life.  When I was a kid my sister had a poster of him on her wall.

Then he died.  Cancer.  All the money, all the fame, everything to live for.  That's on top of decades of cancer research and his doctors were probably the best money could buy.  And they were possibly fans of his.  But there he is, dead at 69.

I live in the UK.  I'm due to retire at 67.  If Bowie can die at 69, I can definitely die at 69.  Sure I never did the drugs and smoking that he did but equally I'm just a counter-culture slacker from South London and my death won't mean anything.

So I might get two years away from this bullshit working life?  You young'uns coming up might need to work to 70 or even later.  Honestly, you'll feel being 40.  I can only imagine what 50 and 60 feel like.  

Getting up at 6:45am to get to the office when I'm 60?  I've not got that in me.

Anyway, a few days later I went up to a director in work and said 'Hey, you're loaded.  What do you do with your money?' and he was pretty cool about it.  Taught me a bit about getting a private pension and investing in a stocks and shares ISA.  I think in the US they are 401Ks and Roth IRAs or something.

That was four years ago and I'm aiming to retire at 55 or sooner.  I'm aiming to get just enough money to quit the life and then spend the rest of my days baking, playing guitar, playing videogames, doing yoga and maybe getting a dog.

That might sound like quitting the rat race but it sounds like heaven to me when compared to having to put on a tie, go into the office and listen to Joanne from HR or whoever go on about having to take her kids to swimming classes on Saturday mornings or some shit.",False,miq4w2,judgedeathfiles,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/miq4w2/how_david_bowies_death_made_me_want_to_quit/,19,1

2314,Thoughts on shared housing,"Isn’t it strange how if you have a mental or physical disorder and is exempt from working you will likely be placed in your own apartment or house via social housing help (at least this is the case many places in Europe). Thus it must somehow be considered a human right to have your own private home.

Yet the people who actually work hard are forced into the private housing sector. Most can’t even afford to rent a private apartment but have to share with x number of flatmates. Alternatively, if you’re lucky enough to be able to afford your own place you will likely be paying half your salary or more to a greedy landlord.

Don’t get me wrong, I am all in favour for social housing. I have friends that have their own private apartment without working a day in their life because they have genuine issues. That’s all great. But where is the housing help for us workers? In fact you are punished for having a relatively good job. You earn “too much” to get any housing help from the state.

Yet the housing market is so disgustingly overpriced that many can’t even get a mortgage. And rents are going up and up. I’m fed up with the lack of regulations in the private housing market.

My partner and I are both therapists, and we began working at a community mental health center in rural Montana in September. While I can say we both enjoy working with this population (impoverished, severe mental illness, rampant substance misuse), the organization is absolute dogshit. They have each of us doing 3 separate jobs (when we signed up for 1), and when asked to do more, my partner said not until you remove one of my other responsibilities - the COO immediately changed her body language from happy to cold and distant. Both of our supervisors have quit within 3 months, for working over 80 hours a week! When my supervisor quit, they opened up 3 positions to replace him. Fucking heinous.

With all this, I can't bear to think that I am going to leave my patients without a therapist - many of them have experienced exactly this. A therapist comes and goes, often with no notice to them. I will at least tell them, but I cannot bear to stay here much longer.

And the thing is, I just got into a PhD program. I know I have to go. I know it's the best thing for me. I know getting out of this toxic work environment is the best thing for both me and my partner. And I still feel guilty for leaving these patients without the care they so desperately need.

On September 30, 1911, the police arrested him for vandalism. He justified refusal of work and he thought, in his personal philosophy of life, that he has the right to expropriate from the rich people what he needed for his daily survival, and using force wasn't a problem for him.
In 1914, he began to write for anarchist papers.He was drafted in 1912 but quickly discharged for unknown causes. As the Great War approached he deserted his regiment on April 26, 1918 and was sentenced to death by a military tribunal for desertion and high treason on October 31.

2332,I just got terminated by my new job that I just started 2 months ago and found this group,"Hello people ;)

First of all, I thorouhgly read FAQ and understood the ethos of this group.

Although most people don't question modern slavery, it is refreshing to encounter "" thinkers"" with thought provoking ideas.

I worked so hard to keep this customer service agent role at Swedish on line casino company, under Urkranian female boss who said they would train me and it was ok to not have any prior experience as customer service or game industry.

I performed under stress of handling muptiple chats as a newbie. I never took small breaks except for my lunch break  ( I was glued to my laptop 7 hours to show dilligence ) and did everything or more than I could possibly do to learn new gig.  All my efforts was all in vain.  I was informed yesterday with vague reason how ""I don't seem to fit into this role""  so they decided not to extend my contract as a permanent employee.

There are endless supply of people who is willing to take this kind of role that pays under 40k and I understand that they want someone who can learn and be perfect in 1 month but I guess I didn't meet their unrealistic expectation.

I feel that most jobs just pay you enough to live, not to thrive, but most of us have to take that option just to survive.

Thankfully, I have a partner who is in top earning bracket so I don't have to worry about the basic necessities of life but I really wanted to make my own income so can spend on my hobbies which fulfill my life. I am not that type to just live in complacency because you have a successful husband. But at the same time, I am tired of going in and out of revolving door of shitty jobs with ruthless bosses during the last several years.

To elaborate, I am an immigrant from Asia. I was earning 100 k in 2006 in a coporate world and I saved up money to come to study.  Ever since then I never recovered career wise even after completeting useless degree (lol)  

Additionally, I don't seem to pass interviews on certain roles because of my accent. ( speculative but very plausible)

A question:  Can you suggest what I should do with my life with all the time I have  ? I obviously will now have a lot of free time because I will be unemployed with monthly passive income of $ 800 I get from my property in Asia. I am childfree and 48 .

Many would suggest  to "" get some coding license"" etc but I don't know if that is one solution fits for all career path either.

2335,what should i do?,"*TL;DR: I don't want to work, but if I have to I want to work stress free and for max 3 days a week. what should/could I do?*

hi, i'm probably not the first person to ask this here, but i feel like this is the place where people understand what i'm going through. I don't want to work, but in order to have a house and _eat_ i in a capitalist society i kinda have to. And i mean im okay with working (though for max 3 days a week), but i can't seem to find something i'm okay with doing.

so a little about me, i'm in my mid-twenties and i live in the eu (so im sorry if i make some spelling errors). I like making art and music, sometimes i do a little photoshopping or video editing. I'm not particularly specialized or highly skilled in anything and i don't have any carreer ambition, and I'm pretty lazy (which more people should openly be able to be, imo). But I'm a creative person who just likes to make or do whatever I want whenever I want.

I've been unemployed for the past year, which was really boring because of the pandemic and i had to move back to my parents'. I have a bachelors degree in media, but i wasn't really a good student so i'm not really an academic. I worked at a broadcasting station for a couple of months before the pandemic, but the stressiness of the whole thing made me realize i don't want to do that lol. So, after a year of unemployment i finally got hired somewhere (i knew it wouldn't nessessarily make me happy or anything, but at least it's something new). So now i manage the social media for a non-profit organization. It's not where 'my heart is' or anything, but at least it's something I can do and where people actually wanted to hire me. But now after some weeks working there I realized: oh right, i don't like work! I don't like stress, I don't like responsibilities, I don't like dealing with people all the time, I don't like working in an office (although most of the time I work from home, which im actually quite okay with), and I definitely don't like working 5 days a week (and I MOST DEFINITELY don't like being ""on"" all the time cause social media go on 24/7). If this is what the next 50(?) years of my life are going to look like, I'm not sure if I can handle that.

I've been dealing with depression and anxiety now and then, but I find my stress levels shooting up when having to deal with work related responsibilities. Even in my dreams I'm anxious about my to-do's and dealing with people i'm not comfortable with. Lately I'm thinking of moving to another country, like that's going to help. But I feel like I could do better and try to be happy in one way or another.

Now, I know how priviliged I am, growing up in one of the world's richest countries, not really having to struggle through life. But I kinda feel like I deserve to live stress free. I also feel like I don't owe this society (which I don't like) anything. Sure, i'll work a couple of days a week to make money, but the rest of my time i don't wanna think about work. I wanna do my own little projects, or read, or watch series, or get a dog and go on hikes with them. Or do nothing at all, as long as it's my choice.

So, my question basically is, how can I make money (in an ethical way)? Stress free, responsibility free, not more than 3 days a week. Some place that doesn't hurt other people or animals. Is this a reachable goal within a capitalist society? I just wanna exist in peace, is that too much to ask?

I'm sorry for the long text. If you made it this far, thanks for reading my concerns.",False,mih1hi,throwaway98457308457,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mih1hi/what_should_i_do/,5,1

I just worry about money all the time and how I'll afford to live, and why I even exist. Doing anything that's not work makes me feel guilty or anxious, like I should be working to make money instead. Even though I know that's stupid. I feel guilt for having mental issues, because that impedes my ability to be ""successful"" and ""normal"". I feel guilt and shame for being poor and not having a college degree, even though I know it's stupid and illogical to feel this way. I dropped out of college because, again, anxiety about money and the costs. I save as much money as I can. I have so much anxiety about money I'm afraid to spend it on anything but the bare minimum.

2338,Life is a joke.,"Your born. You spend 3/4 of your life working. Then you die. Everyone who could get the day off comes to your funeral. Then goes back to work the next day. And your forgotten. 

The only way to not enter this cycle is to be born to wealthy parents. Alternatively you can win the lottery as soon as your legally able to play. 

Some start a business that becomes successful but that too is a lottery as 98 percent of business fail. 

You can go to a top university if your lucky to get in and maybe get a top job if your lucky enough so you can pay off that mountain of student debt. 

Or maybe your lucky and your parents footed the bill.

For most people  the only realistic options are work 9 to 5 till 65 or refuse and accept being homeless and try to make the best of it. 

The punchline in the end is that everyone dies and none of it matters. So is one supposed to do? 

Whatever you want. Accept life is a lottery system and have a good laugh. Dont take it seriously and definitely dont work yourself to death to make someone else richer.

2346,In absolute disbelief. Was I tricked?!,"Got laid off and lucky to find another job within two weeks. Started the new job on Monday. The new job was in my same field but a different sub field of what I normally do that I wasn't familiar with and they knew this. From my first day something felt off. My old office wasn't perfect but seemed amazing compared to this place. The computers were practically falling apart on windows server 2008 and the software was probably 20 years old and made tasks that were simple at my old job nearly impossible to the point of frustration and anxiety. My boss was training me and some things I totally understood but other things not so much. I wasn't doing very well with her because I felt like she expected me to know everything despite it being my first week.

I trained with my coworker yesterday and we did pretty good and she was very nice so I felt like we were getting somewhere. My boss was pretty critical and never really gave any positive reinforcement whereas my coworker would when I did something right. My boss was strange in the way that sometimes she was really nice and other times she was cold and not understanding. Today it got worse because she let me work on my own which I was starting to feel great and confident with and we were going to go over the accounts I worked. I did some correctly but others incorrectly and I noticed I didn't get bad anxiety unless I was training with my boss. It almost felt like I was being gaslit because no one except my coworker gave positive reinforcement to the point I started doubting my abilities and if I even knew my career to begin with it was that bad.

Today came to a head when she told me she can see I'm struggling and stressed out and said there's another job in the same department that would be much better for me which made me feel hopeful. We tried training again but at that point I was so anxious I couldn't focus or retain anything and ended up in tears. We sat in her office and talked and she was super kind and empathetic and told me she got it and if I wanted the other job I should go for it so I said yes. Which made me think she really liked me and believed in me because if she didn't she would have just let me go. The other job was in a different department so she had to speak with the manager there. 

She comes out of her office sighing later I think ""Oh maybe she's just stressed."" She says let's go talk to the other manager. I get excited say ok cool. We walk in and I get a weird feeling. The other manager says ""I think you'd be better fit for this type of position blah blah."" So me being naive I say ""Oh you mean the position my boss told me about?"" ""No you're fired."" ""But Boss told me there was this job that would be great for me and that we would be able to do that."" ""Well we already interviewed two candidates and there's an internal one we're going to hire and they get preference. -shrug-""

At this point I'm basically shaking in tears grabbing my things to leave and absolutely stunned. I'm having trouble figuring what happened. My boss basically made it sound like I had the new job. Was this some kind of sick trick between the two of them? Or did my boss try to genuinely convince the other boss of my abilities and the other boss was just a bitch? I was shocked because I was showing effort and trying really hard and it was my FOURTH DAY! I'm not sure if their expectations were unrealistic but I've never EVER had a job that I was fired for over this let alone fired at all. I'm very angry and still having trouble making sense of the situation and what exactly happened because it appears I was fired for absolutely no reason. If I showed up drunk to work I'd get it but I was on time every day and generally a good worker and got along with everyone...sorry if this is a novel I just really felt like I would be heard here and wanted your guys' perspectives.",False,midgzf,ans97,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/midgzf/in_absolute_disbelief_was_i_tricked/,14,1

Why can’t jobs hire enough people to support the needs of the company? I’m tired of these organizations pretending that they can’t. I honestly feel that they purposely understaff just so they can see how they can maximize productivity with as less people as possible. And that makes me very sad.

I was already antiwork/anticapitalist before reading [this book](https://libcom.org/files/__Debt__The_First_5_000_Years.pdf) but man, it sure felt good to have an engaging anthropologist present extensive research on how right I am!

The book's thesis is that money (in the form we recognize today) has always been sustained through violence/coercion, and traces how this coercion combined with other historical factors to promote the ""moralization of debt"", i.e., the notion that being in debt is a moral failing, which the working class the world over has internalized to the point that very few people (present company excepted) are questioning the fact that they're supposed to surrender their freedom to the whims of some capitalist to earn the privilege of survival and social acceptance.

You arrive 15 minutes before your centre opens to make sure everything is ready to go. You
make it your responsibility to order the first cappuccino of the day at the bar and make your
round through the business club to make sure all lights are turned on and the place looks tidy.

Slowly, the first members start to arrive and one of them asks you for the changed iii code.
Afterwards, while digging through your email, a guest walks in and says she’s coming to
provide training in one of the meeting rooms. You check the meeting room agenda and notice
that almost all of the meeting rooms will be occupied today. You take her to the right meeting
room, but you find out that our watering partner forgot to put coffee in the room and make
sure that this is still done.

Bit later, a member asks you if his mail has already arrived; he’s expecting a really important
letter. Later that morning, the mail comes in and you put it in the corresponding mailboxes -
and send an email to the member that came by earlier, saying that his mail arrived and that
it's waiting for him in his mailbox.

After a hectic morning, it’s time for lunch. You grab a homemade soup and a healthy salad
together with your favourite colleagues in the restaurant.

After lunch, you sit down with the Community Manager to discuss the organisation of next
week's summer event. However, he mentions that one of the members just had a baby. You
take it upon yourself to organise an act of kindness from Paces, and to congratulate the
parents of the new-born. Once you're done with ordering, a guest pips by to sign up for a
membership. Because your Tales colleague isn’t available right now, you help the guest with
the online registration. Once the registration is done, you immediately hook her up with a
badge (and immediately arrange one for the new employee on the th floor who just remained
you as well).

I’ve worked my ass off for the company with little to no raises and been very productive receiving entire stock trucks alone with carton counts upwards to the 400 area. Earlier this year, I had a mini stroke at work for a week, tongue was numb on the right side and I was consistently dizzy. As it turns out, there was a cyst pushing on my brain stem and compressing nerves in my head behind my brain and underneath it. I went thru my sick time, of course which made sense, but then I had to use my saved vacation time if I wanted to get paid for the time I missed after the ONE week of pay from sick time. I was out for about a month and a half due to the surgery and recovering (which was not a vacation in any way shape or form, it was one of the harder times of my life) and I didn’t get paid for basically an entire month.

This is not a good faith/equitable market.

Fuck this system.

2414,"15 minute breaks ""isn't fair"" according my management.","At my job there are 4-10 shifts and 5-8 shifts.  I used to do the 5-8 but my team was forced to move to 4-10 because people weren't coming into work and thought this shift would get more people to come in.  I was annoyed because I had the opening shift and would get off at 1:30pm which gave me the entire afternoon to have a life and work on my hobbies.  Not only that but they gave us less than a week notice of the shift change, so screw you if you had a second job or had a kid to pick up after work I guess.

Yes, getting an extra day off is nice but I used to be able to work out, cook healthy meals, spend time on my hobbies and play video games with my friends all in one day and didn't have to deal with the rush hour traffic going home.  I feel like my free time has been significantly cut because I'm too exhausted after the long shifts and there's less time to do anything.  

But that's not the worst of it.

On the 5-8 shifts we'd get two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch.  It used to be a 45 minute lunch but the trade off is we got to leave 15 minutes earlier so I was fine with it.  When we moved to 4-10 we got three 10 minute breaks.  The idea is both shifts should only get 30 minute of break time each day, but 10 minutes is barely enough time to do anything and when you're doing a 10 hour shift of customer service at a call center you really need time to recharge.  Not only that, but since both shifts are working 40 hours a week total, and each day is only 30 minutes of break, the 5-8 shift people are getting an extra 30 minutes of break per 40 hour work week that we aren't.

I figured getting two 15 minute breaks and a 10 minute break for the last one would be a reasonable compromise, so I brought it up to management.  She was surprisingly receptive and agreed that 10 minutes was too short for a break, but then asked me if in exchange for the 15 minute breaks if we'd be willing to stay an additional 10 minutes.

Um, excuse me?  

Apparently the reason for her question was to be ""fair"" to the people working 5-8s that only get 30 minutes of break during the day.  Despite our much longer shift, getting more break time wouldn't be fair.  I brought up that they get an extra 30 minutes of break per week that we don't and she said she'd ""think about it.""

What is there to think about?  You know and agree that 10 minute breaks isn't long enough.  It's an easy enough problem to fix.  Just fix it!  When I was working 5-8s I just assumed people on the 4-10 shifts got three 15 minute breaks and I didn't feel like that was unfair.  When I worked at other places that did 4-10s I'd get three 15 minutes.  My friends who do 4-10s get 15 minute breaks, but no, apparently it's ""not fair"" where I work.",False,mhtktb,fromalicewithmalice,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mhtktb/15_minute_breaks_isnt_fair_according_my_management/,7,1

2419,Americans fetishize jobs to a religious degree.,"[This article posted on the new jersey reddit](https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/2021/04/02/nj-gov-phil-murphy-tax-breaks-companies-leave-georgia/4850716001/) has gotten some predictable liberal discourse around some drama with Georgia becoming fascist, so everyone wants to waste their time high fiving eachother over pointless gotcha moral victories.

However the second part of the article, where our Governor is planning on handing out tax breaks in an already expensive state to live, is what worries me.  Americans rarely use more than one brain cell for economic analysis, and all of the comments are shit like ""these tax breaks won't cost us anything because these companies wouldn't be coming here without the tax breaks, they're bringing jobs and more business to local economies"".

This makes me seethe, because if someone actually gave this situation more than 2 seconds of thought they would realize this is bullshit.  There is no such thing as a free tax break, there is no such thing as a cost free business moving in.  There is this brain damage where americans imagine ""jobs"" as something being worth ""infinity"" dollars, this is how they think of jobs when they aren't thinking, it is literally a religion.  With equal religious fervor they only think of companies as something that only costs ""positive"" dollars, they can't imagine that a company would be worth more than it costs in tax breaks to bring them in, it's blasphemous to even consider this.  

But if someone actually works for a company they are costly, they are costly to people not in the company and people outside, in the community.  These companies still use public infrastructure.  At the very least they are using our roads and public schools and education for a lower cost than anyone living here, not to mention all the other breaks they can negotiate down the line.  Once a company moves into a new area with their tax breaks, they have a huge advantage against the local companies, in essence turning locals into second class citizens.  You only reap the benefits of tax breaks if you work for one of these companies or have resigned yourself to some vague economic benefit that is really just the result of people paying more taxes overall.  A tax break literally means these companies are paying less in taxes, they are paying less into all of the social services you depend on, which means you, an actual tax payer, are now subsidizing all of the damage they are doing to your area, in social services, in infrastructure, and in your environment.",False,mj6k31,capnbarky,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mj6k31/americans_fetishize_jobs_to_a_religious_degree/,21,1

2422,Choosing my health over my job,"Gonna try and keep things as short as I can here. I work at a startup in NYC that has, for the past two and a half years, been taking advantage of my work. They hired me as a contractor to edit videos before shifting me into customer support 6 months later and let me rot there for over a year as a contractor. Then, when an investor asked why I wasn't an employee, they hired me \*just\* as I got sick with a viral infection. Now, 9 months later, I'm still chronically ill and struggle to get through the workday, to my jobs frustration. My direct supervisor micromanages me and conveniently forgets that I'm still ill and can't work as well, messaging me on slack after business hours *regularly* until I answer and somewhat regularly gives me extended projects (video related) that aren't tied to my now explicitly customer service job to get done that results in crunch time, extra work, and can get cancelled/reworked entirely at the last minute.  On top of that, he regularly tries to *do* my customer service, or get other team members to do it, which leads to organizational issues and incorrect answers for clients, which leads to more work for me.  


And now, after almost a year of being regularly stuck in bed feeling sick from stress and my viral infection, I'm choosing health. If things do not get better and he does not heed my hints/warnings that I am overworked, I will be leaving this job in the next month or two, hopefully eligible to collect unemployment in my home state so that I can focus on my body healing/shaking this infection. My boss and direct supervisor should know better, as they ask how my health is almost every week and regularly pretend to care and claim that I can ""take some time off"" as needed, yet continue to push and prod me into bedrest.   


So I'm picking my health. From now until then, as I have for the past week or two after an especially bad crash from my boss overstressing me with extra work, I will work from 9:30-5:30 and not a second more. I will take my lunch everyday at the same time and not eat at my desk (working from home) and I will not be accepting any additional work, because I have been used by this company like a tool and repeatedly asked/had it implied that I should work later and after hours a bit. And I simply won't do that. And if they fire me before these two months are up, awesome. I'll get severance and collect unemployment, because I'm just following my contract with the job.",False,miqhe1,NewWavePlethora,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/miqhe1/choosing_my_health_over_my_job/,3,1
