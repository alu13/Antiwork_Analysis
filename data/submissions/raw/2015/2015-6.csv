33,Reworking the antiwork subreddit! (User feedback appreciated!),"So user waldyrious and I have been going back and forth for a little over a few weeks (very leisurely, don't worry :P) and we're trying to come up with a better sidebar for this forum. And in general we'd like to see the forum improved.

tl;dr, we want this subreddit to have a great sidebar that'll include the best selections of anti-work stuff, be nice looking and anything else you guys think should be in there!

We also want to work on a Wiki and a FAQ built into it. I may incorporate some of the questions that I got in my AMA thread from a few months ago. But if you think of any yourself, don't hesitate to add them!

And although, as an anarchist, I don't agree with the idea of a Basic Income (that's a topic for another thread) I like how the sidebar for r/basicincome looks a lot. So maybe something modeled (read: not an exact copy per se) of that?

I'm very new to Reddit and don't often go to other subreddits so if you know of other places that have awesome sidebars, feel free to mention it!

The Wiki would also be open-source and always open to modifications. If folks are abusive or misleading stuff gets on there it may be deleted by Yours Truly or another mod or (and this is much more likely) will be brought up to the individual who did the edit first to see what's what.
