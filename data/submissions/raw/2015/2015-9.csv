7,Taking advantage of zero hours contracts.,"I recently took a zero hours cleaning job from a temp agency. We're cleaning a massive block of flats and the company is desperate for all the workers they can get. I didn't feel like going into work yesterday or today, so I didn't. I can go back to work on Monday and they won't fire me because they need all the pairs of hands they can get. Sharing this to say even if you feel like a bit of a waste don't be afraid to take advantage of/disregard your bosses when they need you more than you need them.

27,"Trying to get unemployment for a good reason, but I have some questions.","Currently employed full time at a company for about a year now, and I really want to take a break for a month or two to get my certifications and get a better job. But i need time for that and just really need a fucking break from working like a slave.

So I am on my last strike as well, for calling out when I dont have any sick days left. 2 Written warnings.. so if i get another one im out.
My questions:
- Do I have to get fired in order to file for unemployment?
- If they fire you, do you have to get fired for a specific reason?
