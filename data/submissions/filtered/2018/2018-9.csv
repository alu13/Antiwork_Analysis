0,I quit my job.,i got out  i quit   i m following up on my previous post s update  i finally quit my job    it was a difficult past year and a half in it  i should ve earlier than i did  but i pushed myself through it thinking i could make it work  i was in sales  the company wasn t bad at all  the position was  it was soul-sucking calling clients constantly with little to no return  the only reason i hung on was the stable paycheck and my manager s desire to coach my through it and put me in a position that he thought would fit me better   the second position i was in turned out to be even worse than my first  i had no superiors who were fake  passive-aggressive  and expected me to know what to do with little instruction  i lasted in the role before i brought up to my manager that i finally want to put in my two weeks  notice  he said he was disappointed  but he understood  and that i d be missed  i was a bit sad too  it s difficult to leave an environment you ve been in for over a year  my manager told me there was no need for me to stay any longer  and that i was free to go that day  i went around to my old sales team  and the few people i d gotten close to that were in the office that day to say goodbye   i was shaking and my heart was beating fast when i finally left the office  i had never done anything like this before  could i really be doing this  i thought to myself  i got on the bus back home and sat in a daze  still comprehending what had happened and what i had finally done  i was free  no more waking up during the night stressed  no more strict schedules  no more meetings that go on for hours  talk of budgets and expenses and new clients  all the things i couldn t give less of a damn about  i had no more obligations  i was finally out     it s only been 2 days now  but i m so less stressed  i used to have a habit of grinding my teeth whenever i was stressed  even when i wasn t at work  even when i was going about my day  that seems to have disappeared  i no longer have random bouts of anxiety  or feelings of dread and apprehension about the upcoming week because i no longer to go back to the position i was in  i will continue with my serving position on wednesday  and the following week i ll begin nannying full time  the thought of seeing those children again smiling puts a smile on my face    to those of you who are struggling to get out of your position  i assure you that one day you will find alternate means to sustain yourself and you will get out  even if it doesn t seem like there s hope  find something to hold onto until you reach the end of the tunnel  in your darkest days  remember the things that bring you contentment  remember your purpose and passion  and then go off and find yourself a life worth living  ,9cdb8h

2,"(rant) Interviewers need to stop asking people ""Why do you want to work here?""",don't flatter yourselves  no matter what anybody says in an interview  99  of the population gets a job for one reason and one reason only  money   if they don't say that  then they lied to you  plain and simple  nobody  wants  to work for you  if you don't believe me  then tell all of the employees that they can stay but will no longer paid  watch how quickly they all leave you   i don't care about your  vision  or your company  i don't have an ounce of loyalty or allegiance for you or anybody here  and i never will  because i know that and at the end of the day  i'm simply viewed as a tool there  i'll be cut off with no hesitation if it profits the company more  or actually for any reason whatsoever  and you know what  i'm cool with that  i'll play the role  amp  be your tool when i'm there to get my money  but drop this bullshit  company spirit  idea    i give my loyalty to the people who actually care about me as a person  and accept me for my faults  not some bullshit company whose sole purpose is to use me  don't make me laugh    ,9e1a1p

4,Would you date a workaholic?,just a general question for all of you  would you date an individual who obsessed over a job   lived to work  constantly talked about it  defined themselves and others through jobs  etc    i'm curious to hear the opinions on this    i personally would never do it  ever  i want to be with somebody who actually has a life  sounds harsh  but i'm being honest  if you only feel worthy and satisfied with life when you're being used as a tool another pair of hands  then try to define yourself by something you only do to make some money  then proceed to apply those poisonous ideals on other people   i don't even want to be around you  let alone date you     i'd be with somebody who realizes their life doesn't revolve around a job  and that it's just a temporary burden that we gotta put up with to make some   simple as that  they would know that their real life takes place outside of that workplace and realize that it always comes first  they wouldn't dwell on anything that happened there or allow it to affect them or their peace of mind  i could say more lol but i'll leave it at that for now    what about you guys gals  ,9h1dk9

6,"For those who feel like jobs are consuming their lives and taking their identity, please read this.", i'm gonna get a little personal here guys  but i think highly of this sub and its members  so i don't mind it  trust me  i know how much it sucks  i also used to feel like you    feeling like you're nothing but a tool in life and that nobody actually cares about you   feeling like when you go home  you're just on a  extended break  and that your job is your real home  constantly feeling like you don't really mean much in the grand scheme of things and that you constantly need to stress yourself out to gain a manager supervisor's approval   the only point in my life i have ever been depressed was when i thought like that  it lasted for about 1 5 years  i was suffering  but i managed to become myself again  break myself out of that bullshit state of mind  and reclaim my life and hold onto it stronger than i ever have before  i wanted to share my strategies for how i accomplished this  i really hope this can help somebody out there as well      1  first and foremost  the most important thing that must be done is you need to strengthen your mind  constantly think deeply about topics that never really sat well with you  stop taking things at face value and letting people tell you the way things  should be  think for yourself  put serious thought into things     2  separate    imo  you should never reveal or talk about any details about your real life in a workplace  put on a mask  metaphorically speaking  every single time you're there   be nice  amp  respectful sure  but do not get close with the managers  supervisors  coworkers  nobody  don't ever let them think they really know you  and don't ever think they're truly your friends  b c they're not  no matter what they say  your real friends don't only view you as a tool to get a job done  and won't toss you out if you're no longer of use to them  your real friends don't need to fucking pay you for coming to spend time with them  the moment you start getting close  amp  personal in a workplace is the moment you begin mixing  amp  giving your life to a job  and that is something that must never happen  this brings me to my next point  just get your money  and get the hell out of there    3  never view your life and a job as one    this is how you lose sight of who you really are  this is when managers and coworkers begin trying to subtly make advances to take more  amp  more advantage of you  they know that the job is all you think about  all you care about  it's your life  so  they'll begin putting you through more  amp  more bullshit and expecting more from you because they know you're less likely to leave     4  never grow  attached  to any job   for anything concerning a workplace  put all of your feelings on hold  completely detach yourself from it and don't let any experiences there intrude on your real life or your real feelings  of course appear as if you're a  motivated  proud employee  but this is where your mask comes in  realize all of that is bullshit and just do the job the best you can and get out of there  simple as that  honestly  the worst they can tell you is to not come again     and there's a lot of jobs out here  never feel like you're absolutely chained to a job and that it's part of your identity  if you do that  this'll also cause you to lose sight of yourself  amp  what your life really is     5  realize  amp  know who you are    sounds simple right  you'd be surprised on how many adults out here don't really know themselves  it's the same people who say  if i didn't work  i would be sooo bored  nobody needs that much free time   sad  so so sad   you gotta realize what you love in life  what brings you joy  what do you truly care about  what are your passions  what are your hobbies  what brings you peace  and makes your life into  your life    reconnect with real friends  or make new ones  what have you always wanted to learn how to do  go learn    these are crucial questions that we all must know  because this is what our lives really are  this is what defines us  not what we'd only do to make some money  that's ridiculous  don't put your life in the backseat because of a job  ever  don't make your whole life revolve around a job and make it the center of everything  i get that you need money  but just think of a job as a temporary burden that you gotta put up with for a few hours  that's it  get your money  leave   and always focus on your life and all the things you truly care about without someone needing to pay you to    6  when you're not at that job  never let it invade your mind    don't think about what happened there that day  don't dread being fired or worry yourself sick  don't blame yourself for anything that happened there when you know you did your best or it was a mistake  don't mentally associate anything with that job  for example  associating one of your favorite songs with it and as a result each time you hear that song you get upset  don't ever feel like you're owned by it  don't dwell on it  and erase any thoughts about it that you may have  at the end of the day  we're all going to jobs just to make money  so keep it as simple as that  don't see it as more than a way than to just make some money  i'm not saying you should do shitty on purpose or whatever  but i am saying that you need to remember a job is just a job  never let it get to you    7  work less if you'll still have enough money   stop letting people tell you the  all normal people work 40  hours a week  bullshit  it's garbage  you do what you want you to do  you're just as much of an adult as those zombies are  i'd argue you're actually more of an adult since you can actually think for yourself  i personally only do 24 and will only go above that if i or my family urgently needs money  the moment someone tries tellong you that a job should be a core component of your life and the center of everything  pay them no mind  they're probably the same people who see incredible videos on the internet of people having unbelievable talents and say  they have too much time on their hands  get a real job    a job doesn't define you unless you let it  which i would highly advise people to not do  because an environment where you're only seen as a tool  and only valued for your monetary output for a company who doesn't truly care about you is not the type of place you want to make define you  be defined by how you treat others in your community  your friends  your family   be defined by your personality  your values   amp  what you're passionate about              ,9esq0x
7,[Serious] How do you do it?,i'm talking about the constant grinding  sleeping little hours  making ends just barely meet  etc  i'm 22  with no work experience and studying a career i love  but i know the rest of my life will be spent working for others that i don't care about nor care about me  in some badly paid position  if i even get a job in the field i like  or something else that i didn0t study for and pays the bare minimum  this doesn't bring any happiness and there is no gold pot on the other side  i'm carrying on for the ones i love  for the experiences i want to have  loving relationships  good friends  travelling  learning things  etc  but it all seems to be impossible once the real grinding starts   i'm curious  how do people manage to work 8-12 hours a day just to get by  plus manage their lives  i'm just studying and i'm exhausted  can't do anything after uni which is only 4 hours per day  this makes me very nervous  also i'm anxious about the new work ethic you're required to have  not only you have to work a certain time  but you're expected to like it  to help the company state  to be the best employee and to constantly compete with your peers  i can't handle it now where i see myself competing with everyone else in my classes   greetings and have a nice day ,9hef1d
8,Link to an archive of The Idler?,i am assuming many people have heard of the idler  a  magazine  that was focused on the concept of a life of enjoyment in idle with it's basis in anarchist anti-work  but the mag was generally about just fucking kicking it and hanging out  not about theory  i am looking for any online repository of the entire run  anyone know of one ,9hxwhp
9,Uggh found this on r/GetMotivated,   stop looking for the  right  career  and start looking for a job  any job  forget about what you like  focus on what's available  met yourself hired  how up early  stay late  volunteer for the scut work  become  indispensable  you can always quit later  and be no worse off than you are today  but don t  waste another year looking for a career that doesn't exist  and most of all  stop worrying about your happiness  happiness does not come from a job  it comes from knowing what you truly value  and behaving in a way that's consistent with those beliefs    like owe    ,9irptx
10,The type of work nobody wants to pay for...,any volunteer work or free community service or even when you work for yourself by cleaning your home  i consider that to be work that is self rewarding  needed  and the type that doesn't generate revenue for anyone  driving around poor parts of town you can see much of this work doesn't get done  tall grass  homeless  run down buildings  ect  i think that entrepreneurs should offer to pay for these types of jobs to kick start the notion that a little kindness can make the world a better place  and possibly empathy  if an entrepreneur started a charity company to pay people in poor areas to cut grass  care for homeless  maintain buildings  or anything beneficial to people that isn't normally available to the poor   although i don't think anything significant will change in my lifetime  i'd like to think that we're on our way to a brighter future  but it seems to me that humanity has to learn a tough lesson about what money does to people  too bad the idea of money has already corrupted us all like cancer  money is just a tool to keep us separated    everyday i dream of being able to work only for the benefit of myself and my community  and not the selling of my only resource  time  for a life of scraping by    ,9je583
11,Anyone else see it as wrong to bring kids into the world where they will be forced to work for most of their lives?,i'm an antinatalist for many reasons  but one of the core ones is the compulsory nature of work  none of us were given a choice or gave our actual consent to be doing this  that decision was made for us by our parents  i see this as a great moral wrong and refuse to place this burden on anyone else by reproducing  in the future we may reach a post-work world but i will not subject anyone to its pursuit because a  that would be using someone else only as a means to an end and b  there is no guarantee this world will ever be achieved ,9gbpbc
12,"Started out a cynic, graduated to anarchist, then I found this fantastic sub",for the better part of the last decade i have been more and more interested in anarchism  one thing that always bothered me though  was that almost all anarchists append  communist  or  socialist  to their political leanings  i have no issue with communist or socialist ideas explicitly  but i always wondered why there was such an obsession with work  production  wages etc  last week i heard bob black's abolition of work and i was blown away  he put it so concisely  better than i ever could have  and just a few minutes ago  i curiously looked at all the related subs in  r debateanarchism and here it was  that sub i've been looking for for years   i'm probably gonna spend the rest of the day trying to sponge up all the top posts here  you folks know what's up ,9fwooe
13,Question for people on this sub...,i typically agree with all the ideas put forth on this sub about how the current economic system forces a large number of people into an overbearing and monotonous job and how this is largely unnecessary   however  i m curious as to what individuals in this sub are doing to counteract that  in other words  what actions are you taking to lessen the weight of this workforce expectation on yourself   how do you make your money currently  and what lifestyle do you live outside of that which can be supported by whatever job you are doing   i m curious to see as i support your ideas but don t really know how to start to apply them to myself   ,9gatm5

15,This is a joke right?,i m sure this subreddit is a joke  but i ve seen crazier things on reddit  please tell me you do not actually believe that  life is too much work  and that you want to sit on your ass all day while we  the taxpayers  pays you  ,9k19ry
16,"Question for my fellow r/antiwork members, why'd you decide to join this sub?",i'm curious to hear all of the answers  personally  i decided to join because i eventually realized how fucked up this was  selling my life to people who really don't even care about me  being seen as some disposable tool  not having a true identity  making a job the center of my life  and losing sight of my life  i said  no  this is not what life is  and began to journey to reclaim everything  i was curious to see if there were any others who felt the same way  so i made a reddit  posted a thread on r findareddit titled something like  sub for people who realize life doesn't revolve around a job  and the rest is history     what about you ,9k2uro
17,The first step in fixing a problem is admitting we have one,when people find out i'm against capitalism  they usually assume that i'm a marx loving communist and then they say shit like  yeah  but venezuela  or  but human nature    i'm not a communist  if anything i'm a hippie with  anarchist tendencies  and i'm unhappy with the current system  the point is  i don't have to be anything  i'm simply  not  a fan of wage-slavery under capitalism  the first step in fixing a problem is admitting we have one  i made that first step  don't ask me about details on how communism deals with x    i guess what i'm trying to say is  you don't need a lable  don't let people drag you into a convoluted discussion about ideologies  where they expect you to have a plan solution for every aspect of any alternative of capitalism  some of them just want to win an argument  they bring up venezuela and then reinforce their love for capitalism  it's totally fair to simply be against work  r antiwork  or against consumerism  r anticonsumption  r minimalism  or against destroying the environment  r zerowaste  r environment  or against centralized power structures  r rad decentralization  etc    how do we fix the world   one particular ideology   i don't know  but i'm sure we can figure it out ,9jvir8

19,Something I whipped up real quick for our sub...,   on    would you still  go to the job if they didn pay you   need to pay you to do things you truly loved   love something if you wouldn't  i  when why do you say you love your  because   love my job     ,9iyh9d
20,"As a society, we need to change the meaning of the phrase ""What do you do?""",i'm so tired of the first question people ask of somebody being where they go to make some money  as if that defines them in any way  the vast majority of individuals wouldn't keep going to a workplace if they suddenly stopped getting paid for it  meaning this isn't really who they are  so why the hell does this society care so much about it     when i was a junior in high school  my economics professor told our class something i will never forget  since i was only 16 at the time what he said kind of went over my head  but now that i'm a bit older  his words really resonate with me     he said something along the lines of    when i was in the military and stationed in europe  i met a gentleman and had a conversation with him  i asked him 'what do you do '  and he told me 'i enjoy skiing  going fishing  and going on jogs'    i was puzzled  so then i told him    'oh no no  i meant where do you work '  he told me he worked at a bank  but then he also told me 'why does it matter where i work  when you ask somebody what they do  they should tell you what they enjoy doing in life  what they're passionate about ' and that really got me thinking about our own society and whether we focus on work too much    god  i miss you mr  e   he's one of the reasons i chose economics as my major in college   ,9fybgk
