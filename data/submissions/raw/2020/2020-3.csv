0,Using capitalism in a world affected by climate change.,"We are witnessing the response of our society in capitalism to Coronavirus, and we see how poorly it is serving us.

Other actors with his background were easily worth millions. But Verne, because of his natural-born short stature, had all the odds stacked against him, and even though he was loved by millions, couldn't get out of financial hardships.

37,I work at a grocery store and these past few weeks have been torture,"I’ve been seeing lots of posts on reddit about how we’re now realizing that these mundane jobs are the backbone of America, and how the essential employees are very brave. 

I don’t think I’m “brave”. My bills and rent payments are not stopping. I fucking WISH I could quarantine but I have no choice. I have 40 hours of PTO that I could use, but a week isn’t gonna do shit. The situation is getting progressively worse. Part time employees are calling left and right to tell us they won’t be back to work until further notice. Everyone is scared and our manpower is dwindling fast. No one that I work with has gotten the virus yet, but if one of us were to test positive it would be game over. 

Customers are constantly thanking me for continuing to work, which is nice, but also...I never had a choice!! We were all just thrown into this. It was literally 0-100 overnight. One day, the store made 30k which is an average weekday for us. The next day, we made 150k! We do not have the staff to accommodate such an enormous spike, and especially not now since they’re all starting to call out. 

I wish I had an alternative to pay my bills. I want to stay home so badly and abandon this burning ship. It’s the panic buyers and the elderly who are constantly coming in and stocking up on more shit. I don’t get it. Y’all weren’t spending hundreds of dollars on groceries before, so why now?! I haven’t been buying any more than I normally would and I’m doing A-okay. If you have kids I can understand why you’d buy extra stuff, but if not, you have no excuse. All you’re doing is putting a strain on everything. 

Seriously. Go out once a week, spend $100 tops on groceries (if you’re single), and go home. I see soooo many regulars who still shop every day because they don’t want to disrupt their daily routine. You deserve a kick in the nuts if that sounds like you. 

P.S. you wanna know what really kills me? I now need to wake up early on my days off to buy my groceries. If I want to get stuff after finishing my shift, everything is already picked through and we get the scraps. The people you’re calling brave need to eat and wipe their asses too.

38,How to keep staying in mental ressistance state?,"Resistance is the mental state. Those words resonated with me when I found this link in antiwork section - [The Matrix](https://web.archive.org/web/20061120123840/https://jdoe.freeshell.org/howtos/ExitTheMatrix/ar01s02.html)

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed they way my mind dulls after forced subordination at 

place I'm doing my trade time for money. It's like at first you come 

and see all through the bullshit - the real view, through your own eyes.

After a while it somehow gets into you and your mind submits, you start

to have a fear - emotional dependency based on how your superior views you.  
Start to loose your sharpness, googles of bullshit your rebellious attitude, yourself.  


&amp;#x200B;

All the tricks bosses use to keep the spirit servile - saying that you ain't 

gonna find better job. The power displacement feeling in job interviews - where

might-be/future boss displays his power via subtle things. The taboo topic - that 

somehow its forbidden asking about wage. The feeling that you somehow owe your 

boss unpaid after hours. When you refuse - its like a matrix glitch, the tension in the

air and pressure to conform.

&amp;#x200B;

I was being able to stay mentally free for a while. Even being in a workplace. 

That's not paranoia - but somehow they sense it and pounce on it even if you work good.

For example talking to a common programmer colleague about starting my own business, being

met with line - 'Don't be stupid, ain't gonna work you don't know shit', came from the boss.  
Its like - the game of sucking your self esteem so you have nowhere to go except him.  


&amp;#x200B;

Another example: service in the military. Saw the colleagues transformation process: from human to a drone.Tried to keep mental freedom there - a lot of books, that reflect the view which I saw. Kafka was my friend.I tried to keep the freedom vibe via communicating with my colleagues. Talking about themes related to outside world and post military plan. Its like my boss sensed this 'insubordination'. Even it was not forbidden to talk while working(no officially forbidden themes also) - he said to me, those words:

""I will order you to carry bag and you will carry it"". Between the lines: Don't forget that you are still slave.

My mother told about her boss berating all workers in the meeting telling - you are too old to work not for me.

My point is that resistance starts from the mind. When you start resists you see all invisible jails more easily. This war is invisible - they infect your mind with memes, slogans buzzword, till there is none left of real you. Its like its required for you not to even work, but to be dominated spiritually also.

Basically I'm asking how to keep sharp self esteem in the workplace reality.Deeply I'm asking how to not to forget you are in the matrix and keep your awareness above this mental soul sucking swamp.",False,fpui7w,deformless,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/fpui7w/how_to_keep_staying_in_mental_ressistance_state/,4,1

47,"Ctrl+V'ing a rant I just went on elsewhere, about companies taking advantage of WFH during COVID-19.","This pandemic is a chance to prove how valuable working from home truly can be. However, I've noticed many companies taking advantage of it. In my experience, since employees are all at their new ""place of work"" 24/7, we can be contacted at any time. We have no commute, so there's more time to work. We can't go anywhere or do anything, so we have no excuse not to work, in my company's eyes.

My workload has been steadily increasing for the past 6-7 months, even while working from home. My current workload justifies about 80-90 hours a week right now. And they don't offer OT pay.

I had a hard enough time separating my work life and personal life before all this, and it's obviously only gotten worse the past two weeks. My boss contacts me all hours of the day, expecting me to be working. If I get everything done that's expected of me in 40-50 hours a week, I'm happy and my bosses are happy. But even working inappropriate amounts of OT the past few weeks, I've fallen behind.

I feel guilty every time I take a break and ignore calls/emails, but I'm not going to let my company take advantage of me. I've decided to cut my time off at 60 hours a week, which even then is 20 hours too many. If that's not good enough, then there are plenty of people looking for jobs right now that they should hire to help me out.

If nothing else, COVID-19 is a great chance to prove how viable WFH can be. (I also acknowledge that 40 hrs of OT is better than no job or income at all.) But I'm noticing companies are doing what they can to take advantage of this pandemic as well as their employees, and we need to be careful to not let it spiral out of control and not let them use this to squeeze out everything they can from us.

That's the end of my rant, but I'm posting here because I'm curious if others are seeing similar attitudes from their employers. I also want to note that I'm very grateful I still have a job and I don't take it lightly. I live with others who weren't as fortunate.

58,On NonCompete's General Strike (A Commentary),,False,fsbc68,thisismybreadaccount,https://youtu.be/F7FMx-gQEHA,0,1
59,Random Rant About A Company,"TL;DR extremely uncomfortable and toxic working environment due to extremely RUDE and arrogant employers who don't communicate with employees, they only state their demands but never listen. They also comment inappropriate things about their employees. Read: WORKPLACE ABUSE by the employers themselves.

Note: There is a number of fake 4-5 star reviews about this company (Advance Infosys Sdn Bhd) on other websites, they might have been posted by their close friends and/or relatives, or clients/other parties so that they get discounts for the provided services.

The employers are overly rude and arrogant, they have no respect for anybody whom they consider ""inferior"" which is practically everybody who doesn't match them in wealth and influence. They also never ever said sorry when they made mistakes (but never failed to accuse everyone else), which they do all the time due to their own lack of even the slightest effort to listen or try to understand the problems when told by employees). At work, if they're present, they often abuse employees (say derogatory things about them, often on problems that they themselves caused), and they're often the main cause of problems for everyone (they're this company's bottleneck). Outside of work, they always try to micromanage their employees, often harassing and monitoring them and pestering them in the group chats.

Furthermore, they are either quite incompetent or constantly distracted by something that's not related to work as they aren't even able to setup their software properly, calculate properly or fill out forms properly, often doing their work with lots of mistakes. Then they would scream and insult employees whenever their own mistakes impacted them.

There are two bosses, Ooi and Lock.

The older one is extremely absent-minded, often can't remember the things he said and the things and the mistakes he did, yet he often, without any hesitation, accuses others of those mistakes he made himself. It is impossible to talk to him because he doesn't communicate, he only screams or states sternly about his demands like a child even though he's in his 60s.

The younger one is always very unreasonable and can't stick to his words, so anything he says can't be taken seriously. One moment he says A, then right after he changes his mind. Despite this, he is extremely quick to accuse employees for not being able to cope with his indecisiveness.

Adding to all this, is that during the movement control order to prevent or slow down the spread of COVID-19, both of them are still pestering so many of their employees to work on-site despite the dangers. AFAIK, a few of their employees ACTUALLY WENT TO WORK at the office during the MCO!

It would seem that they do not care about the lives of their employees at all.

Complaints about them and even police reports have been lodged to the authorities. Despite all this, they're still unrepentant and show no signs of remorse.

This includes Nurses. They make more than poverty wages, but most of that goes to rent, car leases, bills, etc.. they actually don't have a whole lot of disposable income for the most part. Most of them cannot afford taking a month or two off work. Also many of them are stuck in contracts that would ruin them if they tried staying home.

Some of us are heroes, but most of us are not. We're just stuck in lives of forced daily servitude under the threat of homelessness and hunger.

74,The Current Situation,"Greetings All,

Things have changed for all of us quite a bit over the last couple months, and I just wanted to post a couple thoughts that can be taken with a grain of salt. 

This whole situation is going to get worse than it is now before it gets any better. Everyone is getting antsy about jump-starting the economy, and when people panic, they make mistakes. 

Considering that testing is not available everywhere, and (anecdote time!) I know of two people personally that have symptoms but were just told to quarantine and were not given tests. This means that the count for the number of cases is likely lower than it should be, and nobody is following up with their points of contact. I cannot imagine that’s making this situation better.

Misinformation campaigns are allegedly underway from Russia (surprise!) and probably others in an effort to create fear and panic. And it works very well because of our innate biological and psychological traits. It plays right into our weaknesses as people: we will believe something if it aligns more with our own personal viewpoints, we will dismiss or be outraged when they don’t, we won’t admit if we were wrong and double down on our viewpoint, and we will casually spread this information because we want to connect.

To sum that up: panic about the economy, a lack of accurate data and widespread misinformation campaigns will keep this crisis a crisis longer than it needs to be.

I hope everyone is healthy and stays safe. I know I’m luckier than most right now (wfh) but I will do what I can in this crisis to help those in need. I plan on donating some of the stimulus check (assuming we get one) to my local food bank, and I’m setting aside the rest to give to friends and family in need.",False,fpc45b,JohnJonJaunJahn,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/fpc45b/the_current_situation/,0,1

78,"Social drag in relationship after ""waking up"".","Like many, the system was not kind to me. Years of overworking and being under-rewarded, and harassed out of my last job, and so on.

I'm a woman in tech and I'm more qualified than my partner and have more experience but he's a dude. He gets doors opened for him just by existing. We could walk into a room and both announce we're software developers and nothing else, no further information, and inevitably people will come up to him and talk to him about tech and ask him to do jobs for them. I get crickets.

I could go on about this but let me just say the difference in how he's treated in the tech world vs how I'm treated in the tech world is like night and day. The system works for him because it was made for him.

So, because the scales have fallen from my eyes already, I just do my work and then focus more on my life outside of work. I invested my time in hobbies, organising events, socialising, reading, learning. He just comes home from work and works or studies for work. Then he'll just talk about work or money.

And it's really boring. There's a social drag here between us because I've moved on.

I also dislike that when we were both like this we barely cooked properly and we rarely socialised, we just vegetated. Now he gets the best of both worlds because he invests in all his work while I'm the one who learned how to cook actual dinners, I push the social events on him, and I force us to get out of the house and do activities. He doesn't have to exert any mental energy of creating a life outside of work and he gets it.

He's definitely never going to be anti-work because it works so well for him, so I can't change him. Is there anyone else in this situation that has coping mechanisms besides 1) zoning out when he talks about money again or 2) asking him directly to stop talking about his work and his money leading to a small argument because I ""don't support him"".",False,fpa7x4,judgemycomposure,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/fpa7x4/social_drag_in_relationship_after_waking_up/,1,1

But with every other store on our downtown strip closed, it is a little annoying that we are still open despite the drop in sales. He has cut our hours a little but mine are the same. I am usually kept past my shift also because the owner waits until then to show me things and I have been kept there for up to an hour past my shift.

Anyway, yesterday wasn't a great day. I was there alone for the first time and made some mistakes. I felt embarrassed and irritated and this morning I woke up knowing that I need a mental health day. We all do sometimes. Especially having a mental illness, it's important to take care of that (I have bipolar 2 and ADD). Unfortunately my boss is pretty conservative and I didn't feel comfortable telling him that I need a mental health day, so I lied and told him that I have an ear infection and need to visit a doctor. I feel guilty for lying, even though I think every employee is entitled to sick leave, especially right now during this worldwide health crisis.

94,The winners of the coronavirus.,"The working class is getting screwed. Retirement funds are plummeting, jobs where people made decent money are laying them off, the government is not testing or helping anyone outside of a 1200$ bailout, and people who are trying to get unemployment have to work low paying ""essential jobs"" just to keep it. 

Meanwhile, the airlines and military industries are getting billion dollar bailouts, stocks are dropping which is leading many companies to buy-back their stock for a 40% gain, and the business loans is going to generate a lot of money to the banks.

If my prediction is correct, I can see this tanking of the economy to work in Goldman Sachs favor by accumulate dirt cheap shares and a possible bank bailout provided from U.S. Treasury Steven Mnuchin, the retired Chief Information Officer for Goldman.

105,I probably wouldn't be so anti-work if things were always like this,"Like most people with office jobs, I've been working from home in quarantine for a couple weeks now. Being able to work from home (even just part time) has always been a dream of mine. I feel selfish saying it but it's kind of awesome.The problem is I work in automotive/mechanical engineering where remote working is rarely seen as being feasible (even if it totally is for most jobs).

My mental health is so much better. My baseline stress levels finally feel normal again. I am naturally introverted so having to fake it and pretend to be happy and social 9 hours a day is absolutely exhausting and I feel like I'm constantly teetering on the edge of burnout as a result. I'm the kind of person who would vouch for higher cubicle walls made of concrete so I can get some fucking peace and quiet and just do my thing. I like my space and privacy, and I work much more effectively that way. I feel like I actually have enough time for chores and errands, and still have enough time left in the day to enjoy.

What frustrates me most is I know I can't reveal this to my employer unless I want to be first in line for the next layoff. In all of our conference calls someone usually mentions how they hate working from home, they are bored, and they can't wait to get back in the office, even though the same people will admit that their jobs have not been a impacted at all from having to work remotely. Heaven forbid I suggest an idea to my employer that would benefit my mental health, overall morale, appreciation of the company and not affect my productivity solely for the reason it opposes the company's belief that more hours in the office = more productivity.

I understand the necessity of being in the office *sometimes* and at times for my position it's highly beneficial and convenient. In fact I occasionally  find those days enjoyable depending on what I have going on. But for most day to day work it's just a lot of answering emails and calls. I think even having one remote working day a week would do wonders for my stress levels and work/life balance. But I dare not ask for this since it would be seen as blasphemy.

I almost wish this didn't happen because I feel so spoiled right now and I know this won't last, nor will it change my company's corporate culture. I feel this will be the last time I get to feel relatively ""stress free"" until I either retire or die (and I'll probably die first).

I wish more positions could be tailored toward people's varying working styles and personalities. You're a chatty Cathy and socializing motivates you and stimulates your work? Great, feel free to come in 5, 6 or 7 days a week. You get burned out being around people or have a long commute, or maybe you have a project that needs a lot of focus and you get distracted by other people bothering you constantly in the office? Okay, just work from home and get your stuff done, and maybe come in for important meetings or when necessary.

I don't know the point of this post. I'm just frustrated that for once I feel stable mentally and my energy levels are better than they have ever been. As a result I actually feel guilty because I feel like I am expected to feel burnt out and constantly stressed, as if I am a worthless employee unless I feel like I am making significant sacrifices for my company. I feel like I don't deserve to feel this good and enjoy my life this much.

TL;DR: I've been a lot happier since working from home and even though I'm super anti-corporate culture, I am still brainwashed enough to the point that I feel spoiled  working remotely and like I don't deserve to feel this content.",False,fratd9,PurposelessPenguin,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/fratd9/i_probably_wouldnt_be_so_antiwork_if_things_were/,9,4

Stop shopping at Publix, if you can.

No hazard pay, no actual bonus (I guess $100 in gift cards to my own fucking company should be enough, eh?), nothing.

So my bf and I were planning on moving out of town, I let my boss know that and he moved the girl below me up, and hired a replacement for her. I am still management but the idea was everyone would be trained by the time I left, and then I would either leave or at least step down. Our planned move date was next month, and that’s not happening now due to the COVID situation.

Now, the girl who took my place left suddenly due to personal reasons, and she and I were the only people who know how to do payroll and the schedule. The new girl who took the position below me hadn’t been taught yet. My boss asked me to step back up and I told him no.

So now I’m stuck in limbo, management when I didn’t want to be, and the only one who can do payroll and the schedule. 

However, I’m higher risk for COVID to affect me, and the longer time goes on the more concerned I’m becoming. My boss has laid people off because there’s just not hours to go around, and I want to ask to be laid off. I want to quarantine at home until this is over.

I worry he won’t lay me off, I’m concerned he’ll say I’m too important. The thing is, I would like to avoid outright quitting if I can help it, I don’t want to go without an income indefinitely. I could make it a month or two from my savings, but then I would be really hurting. And the job market seems tedious at best right now and in the future.

I want to tell him that by the end of the next scheduled week (4/11) I want to have the new girl trained on payroll and schedule, and I be laid off. The sooner the better. I’m 1000% willing to be available by phone or face time to help her if she needs it. My next best offer is to be on unpaid leave, and clock in remotely when it’s time to do payroll and the schedule and do it at home.

I’m going to attempt to unionize for hazard pay, and get fired without cause, so I too can collect that sweet money for not risking my life like the rest of you!

When I get my sweet unemployment dollars do I have to accept any work? Or can it just be in my field? Because I will definitely be blackballed for attempted unionization... Which is fine I’ll just use the promised 39 weeks of total benefits to work on my Nurse Practitioner degree.

My plan really feels full proof except I’m not sure if I have to accept any job because it’s suck to suddenly have to live on a minimum wage salary (normal benefits in my State look like 800ish a week for me without stimi).

I don't care if John here worked for me 20 years and was loyal. I don't give a fuck. Noone does. Let's buy him some cheap shit, take a photo with him and put it on our HR newsletter and LinkedIn for some cheap PR. If he disappeared over night I wouldn't even notice.

1. You are irreplaceable.
2. And you are aware of it.

We are not one family. That's just cheap psychological bullshit to keep you working for some ""higher cause."" I employ other psychological tactics to keep costs low and keep you somewhat motivated.

I am well aware of the fact we can never be one team. Because my motivations are completely different to yours. My job is to trick you into thinking that. That's it. I confiscate your work and give you cash for it. No matter how much I give you, unless you are a simpleton, this will scar your soul.

150,Stressed out about losing my job can someone help me please.,"So Ive been working in retail since the 12th this month.

I've only just got my first pay.

The issue is I've never technically been employed. I did some temp work when I was 18 but didn't fill out the time sheets right, so never got payed. I wasn't even going to bother going to the interview I had failed so many at the time I thought there was no chance and I just got a job as a dishwasher anyway (never managed to work a day there before everything went tits up). I just thought that not going might affect my welfare as it breaks the rules and I don't want to get it all stopped. Not giving a fuck about the job was great though, I breezed through the interview process and found it really easy. 

I used the temporary work as employment history and used some random woman I found on my emails from the company as a reference.

The problem is since I've never been payed I've been put on emergency tax basically pointing out to my employer I don't have a tax code cause I've never worked. and on top of that I haven't received my uniform yet even though others who started after me have received their uniform.

I know the head office is behind with the checks because I started work without any right to work documents. And they only sent off my documents to be checked a week or two after I began work.

If they bother checking past employement and references I will lose my job and it will be impossible to find another one because of the current situation.

hopelessness or starvation. they need to be
fairly compensated for the risk they’re taking
and an extra two dollars an hour, or for
increased wages to only kick in if they opt to
overcome isn’t enough. like, grocer store
workers and other “essential” retail workers
should be appreciated but that appreciation
needs to be TANGIBLE. and working right now
should be voluntary. when well-off people make
posts about the grocer store workers are
heroes, it just comes across that they’re
grateful there are still people around to wait on
them and they’re purposefully overlooking the
fact that the “sacrifice” essential retail workers
are making is coerced.

179,Van Gogh was anti-work.,"For most his life all he spent his time doing was painting, even though he didn't really make any money off it.  While alive he only sold like 1 painting, and it's said that his brother who supported him financially sent one of his friends to buy it to make Van Gogh feel better. People only started paying attention to his art after he died. These days just one of his paintings costs millions of dollars, and I just read that one of those paintings was stolen from a dutch museum the other day.

His story inspired me to write a song because I can relate to it seeing as I spend my time writing songs no one listens to instead of going to work, and I'd like to think that when I die more people will listen.

202,The problem with anti-work.,"Well, there's not too many problems with this sub. I mean, it's got great memes, and i'm sure all of you are very nice. But, unfortunately, a majority of the people in here are heavily indebted to the system in exchange for their lifestyles. This places them in a position where, although they would like to quit their job, they cant. How can you quit your job when you have a family to feed, or you're going to lose your house? That's not practical, right? 

So, most people on this group are against work, but this conflicts with the fact that their way of life requires work for them to maintain what we will refer to as 'values.' Your values are things that are important to you, and can be objects, people, ideas, ect. Money maintains most of our personal values, and money has also been implemented as the surrogate provider for most our our basic security values such as food, shelter, warmth, and water. 

Money, that we get from working, provides us with the means to sustain values that we have acquired. A family eating is a value; an insurance payment on your new 2015 tundra is a value; new strings for a guitar or a dime sack of weed are values, ect. To sustain these values requires that you must work for them, because money is the method you have been given to maintain these things you care about. Without money, we lose the ability to maintain values, and this is all very woven into our system. 

If there was a problem with this sub, it would be that most of us who have joined it are caught up in trying to maintain our values. In doing so, it has turned us into work-slaves. Our prescribed/suggested way of life is hardly free; everything has been reduced to you exchanging your hours for the ability to maintain or obtain that which is valued by you. We likely would have opted for independence from this system had we been offered a real understanding of social conditioning and the implications of social learning theory, but, we were not, and so now we work.

   Main take away is, if you haven't already chosen expensive values and want to live freely, then choose what you will need to sustain EXTREMELY carefully. Our society insists that having children, or we should go to school regardless of the debt, or a buy a new 2020 lease, but if you wish to live freely, these will almost definitely work against that goal. Most of the people on this sub are so far into trying to sustain such a large list of values, that it is impossible for them to just 'walk away' from their perceived obligations. The money is no longer an option for those people; they must make it, or they lose what is important to them. 

It's true that most of us are enslaved not by work, but 'by the need to maintain values which require money to maintain.' Humans have a tendency--and this is not always the case-- to tell others to do as they have done, almost like they're trying to see validation of their actions in other people. Do not fall for this. Use critical thinking to make your own decisions, and realize that if you're not careful, your list of values that require money and time to maintain will grow out of control. Going with the grain is expensive, and comes with a steep price. Be VERY careful with what you choose to value, because every single thing you must maintain owns a little piece of you, and if you rack up too much too quick, that's it.

203,"I'm currently fighting my job that is using a loophole to stay operating as an ""essential business"" and taking almost no safety precautions for their employees","I am an employee of Kraftmaid Cabinetry, parent company Cabinet Works Group, in Middlefield, OH, and I and many others feel that they are using a loophole to stay operating during this crisis while taking little precautions for their employees.  First off they are having more than 10 people in a work area at a time within 6 feet of each other.  They had one cleaning crew going around and wiping down areas where people rarely go and avoiding areas that are heavily trafficked.  This cleaning crew was also absent last week after they suspended their attendence policy. 

Two specific examples of direct employee endangerment I can personally attest to are as follows.  One, an employee who was not feeling well told his supervisor and was told they were dehydrated, given a cup of water and sent back to work.  Another employee rode into work with someone with a temperature of 102 who was sent home, but she was allowed to continue working.

They are not taking temperatures at the door either, just telling us to do it at home.  They have a couple things of hand sanitizer and seemingly random containers of Clorox wipes around.  I also witnessed an employee ask for wipes from a supervisor and be ignored, where she then had to go find them herself.

I have been debating with employees on their social media accounts, have reached out to the Governor of Ohio through multiple avenues, and also contacted a few news outlets.  I have received support from many of my fellow workers and also pushback from others, and I will continue fighting.",False,fnow4x,dalarro,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/fnow4x/im_currently_fighting_my_job_that_is_using_a/,0,1

226,We need to create a realistic plan of action!,"I know there are talks of strikes on 4/1 to show our growing frustration with the current system but it is not enough. For decades we have been ignored, conditioned to the point of brainwashing, discriminated against, looked down on, and subjugated. Now is the time for change. The world is not the same place that it was a week ago and it won't be the same this time next week. By the time this pandemic is over the world will never go back to the way that it was. It is very likely that many of our career politicians will die from this virus which will weaken the power structures that have been forcing us down since my parents were children. It provides us with a new opportunity to change those systems and for young, progressive people to move into those power vacuums. 

As many of you have posted the rapid changes made it unmistakably clear that the 1% do not care about us. Our elected leaders knew about this for months and kept quiet about it, telling the public that it did not pose a serious threat to the public while at the same time using their insider knowledge to sell their stocks and profit off of this global crisis. Right now, as I am typing this Congress is bickering and squabbling over our lives and our futures. President Trump in his recent tweets has made it clear that he is willing to sacrifice the lives of the American people in order to preserve the wealth that he and his cronies and hoarded while millions of working class people lose their jobs with no safety nets to help them. Major corporations are forcing their employees to work despite the pandemic, risking lives for the sake of profit.

We have been so angry for so long. We have been so oppressed for so long. Now is the time to do something about it. There are 100,000 people in this subreddit alone and there are more than think and feel the same way we do. Let's use this time to demand and force permanent change that creates a better world so every single person on this planet and work towards the greater good.

Changes I am proposing:

* Repeal all legislation that considers corporations as people
* Comprehensive tax reform that raises taxes on all billionaires and their companies, with crippling fines for using off shore companies
* Stricter insider trading laws and minimum 15 year prison sentences for anyone that uses knowledge not available to the general public to profit off of disasters
* Universal healthcare
* UBI - Should probably be determined by current income and cost of living for your geographic location
* Expanded unemployment and social welfare programs
* Better pay and working conditions for all employees, with a particular focus on the following: healthcare workers, retail and food service employees, truck drivers, warehouse &amp; distribution employees, municipal employees including but not limited to: water and waste management, garbage men
* Reevaluation of current voting laws to make sure that they are nondiscriminatory for all eligible groups

Feel free to add any more in the comments or further details on how we can accomplish this. I'm serious guys. People across the Internet have been calling for a revolution for years.

250,Why Bosses Suck: the Use of Knowledge in the Workplace," 

During his life, economist/philosopher F.A. Hayek was concerned about socialism. Born in 1899, he grew up seeing the economic chaos that resulted from World War I- and the central planning which was adopted as a solution. The Weimar Republic, which ruled Germany from 1918 to 1933, had become infamous for its hyper-inflationary policies which caused people to bring wheelbarrows full of money to buy a single loaf of bread- or to burn the money in fireplaces just to stay warm for a night. Hayek, who grew up in Austria, could not have failed to notice this. Studying at the University of Vienna in the early 1920s and working with fellow economist Ludvig von Mises helped shape Hayek’s thought process to be distrustful of government planning while seeing free enterprise in a favorable light.

Thus it was that, in 1945, when Hayek wrote “The Use of Knowledge in Society” for *The American Economic Review* journal, he was by then focused on proving that that socialism didn’t work while suggesting that leaving business up to businessmen- rather than politicians who knew nothing about the enterprises they sought to regulate- would be more beneficial to society as a whole. Couched in well-written, expressive, erudite language, Hayek basically gave government socialists a slap on the wrist.

However, he was so enamored of private business as being a savior and edifier of humanity that he failed to take his unique ideas as far as he could. In the article, Hayek suggests that those who know any situation best ought to be the ones who make decisions about how to handle it. He uses the example of tin production. Certainly, it may safely be asserted that most politicians don’t know how to run a tin factory or a mine designed to extract tin from the ground. What Hayek failed to mention, much less understand, is that not only do company owners have unique knowledge which allows them to more profitably run their business, but that employees- even entry-level employees- have unique knowledge that allows them to complete their tasks in an efficient, productive manner.

This, of course, only applies to company employees who have been with the company long enough to learn how to become a better worker. This is another way of saying, “[practice makes perfect](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2372732215624708).” The important point to note here is that employees will teach themselves the best way to complete a task without having been told what they are supposed to do- provided that they have the mental capacity to do so. They are also more familiar than their bosses with how other departments they work with may screw up and how to get around such situations. 

Eventually, over the course of time, the employee becomes more knowledgeable about the job he’s working. He is better able to formulate solutions, to offer advice on how to increase efficiency. The boss, manager, supervisor, or whatever authority, is often likely to reject such advice due to a combination of hubris and overwork. [When bosses are overworked, they treat employees less fairly](https://hbr.org/2018/06/research-when-managers-are-overworked-they-treat-employees-less-fairly)\- simply because they don’t have the time to acquaint themselves with the particular circumstances that each employee faces. When this happens, production declines, the workplace becomes a bad place to be.

Bosses who are perceived as being incompetent are ultimately the ones who are least acquainted with the particular knowledge that each employee gains during the course of their employment. While there are some bosses out there who are absolutely toxic individuals, there are others who are not. Those who are not toxic, who strive to be nice, may nevertheless lose the respect of their employees if they fail to notice or completely ignore what people around them have to say. Bosses who want to want to act in a fair manner may instead act in an unfair manner by enabling that one bad department or person to continually screw up without any consequences. No matter how much of a nice person they are, no matter how well they actually behave, such bosses can nevertheless garner the ire of their employees by simply not knowing how to rectify a situation- something that seems blatantly obvious to those who experience it on a daily basis.

What’s worse, upper management types don’t even seem to understand that the dynamic between boss and employee ends up breaking on a daily basis. Rather, they’d rather blame the boss’s [personal failings](https://dougthorpe.com/5-reasons-why-bad-bosses-suck-so-bad/) as to why he’s not doing well with his employees. There doesn’t appear to be any self-critical analysis that I’ve seen suggesting that some authority ought to be delegated, or that asking one human being responsible for an entire department to do everything limits that person’s ability to make calm, rational decisions that help the company as a whole.

Rather, overworked bosses (and even those who are not) tend to focus on task completion. That’s what they’ve been put in charge to ensure, after all. They haven’t been given a mission statement demanding increased efficiency. Rather, all upper management- a group of people who is even further disconnected from the daily experience of the average employee- focuses on numbers, on production figures, on profits. Many such people are unable to see that, rather than hiring organizational development consultants, [such as these people](http://www.od-consultants.com/), to tell them how to operate their business better, they need only go on the floor and ask their employees what needs to change in order for greater efficiency to be obtained.

An organizational development consultant is basically a scammer who uses silly buzzwords and fancy pie charts and graphs to justify their salaries. They dress up in nice suits to convey the notion that they know what they are talking about it (in fact, the acquisition of knowledge does not depend on how well-dressed someone is). They seem to have all the answers. But this is only because their purpose is to gather information that bosses at all levels of authority have neglected to gain on their own. They then help develop a specifically tailored game plan for how the company can improve. The fact that companies so often fail to do this on their own- especially when they stand to make more money after having done it- suggests that bosses just downright suck. Seen in this light, they are closer to production facilitators rather than catalysts for growth and positive change.

All they would have to do to make their company better would be to listen to what each employee has to say. Not every employee will be right. Not every one will have a good idea. There will be some employees mixed in who are just punching time cards each day without any interest on helping out anyone but themselves. Yet there will be honest, motivated individuals mixed in. If such individuals are ignored, they will go elsewhere- sooner or later. Under these circumstances, stagnation not only becomes possible, but probable.

Rather than the savior and edifier of human society that Hayek envisioned in the previous century, it becomes clear that, while offering a better alternative to government-sponsored socialism or communism, private enterprise nevertheless tends to centralize power and authority in the hands of a few who ignore the local knowledge that could best help their companies progress. Had Hayek worked in a European factory for half of his life rather than for various think tanks and universities, he may have discovered this on own. Ironically enough, he did not possess the local knowledge needed to know how the local knowledge problem was being ignored on a daily basis in capitalist enterprises everywhere.",False,fmi6jj,WinterTrabex,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/fmi6jj/why_bosses_suck_the_use_of_knowledge_in_the/,6,1

American? Seriously, you need to start being proud of yourselves and
your country. Any people would kill to be an American and enjoy the
things you moan about

Why do we complain so much? I'll tell you why: Giving in
the united states is supreme tucked up cause we're
one of the richest, most powerful juggernauts on the
planet, but your average citizen has relatively
infinitesimal access to that wealth and power, and very
little they can do to improve things.

Being poor in the of still makes you rich by some
global standards, but often times The American
Experience is like..... you’re a passenger locked in the
baggage hold of a very long train that’s going very fast.
And the people driving the train are running it off the
rails and shouting CHOO CHOO MOTHERFUCKERS
CHOO CHOOOOOOO0OO as they thoughtlessly
bulldog this train through everything in its path. You
want very badly to get off the train or bludgeon the
conductors with a crowder, because you don’t like
where it’s going, but you're handcuffed in a suffer bag
and the conductors have barricaded themselves in the
engine cars with all the food, medicine, and tools that
could be used to help you out.

And UNDERSTANDABLY the rest of the world is like
“That the FUCK is wrong with that train??? It must be
stopped! There are so many people on the train why is
nobody breaking into the conductor’s booth and
stopping it??!” But most of us are just squirming for
basic survival in the last few cars while millionaires sit on
top of the train smiling anyone brave enough to crawl up
from the cargo hold, all while shouting that you're lucky
to be on such a luxurious, successful train at all.

Alright tenants, listen up.

Are you out of a job due to COVID-19? Of so, the first
thing you need to do is figure out if your local courts
have shut down their civil pockets (in all likelihood
they probably have).

Of your civil courts aren't shut down, then you're shit
out of luck.

Of your civil courts are shut down, then proceed.
Simply put, your landlord can't event you without an
election order, and election orders are granted only
through civil courts. Without a civil court to hear your
landlord's motion to event, they can't legally event you.

Now, | know there's going to be some landlords that
come in here saying: ""of CAN STILL FORCIBLY
EVICT YOU WITH A PRIVATE COMPANY'"""" Of your
landlord tries that, be sure to verbally resist them,
video tape it, and then sue their masses off for
wrongfully existing you during the COVID-19 crisis
without an election order. There will be loads of
attorneys ready to leap on the opportunity of using
the fuckface landlords that force out their tenants
during a crisis, and no jury will feel sympathy for
them.

Do any of you know of ways to make money on your own?

Seriously, all the rich people keep some sort of a secret because they don't want competition. I want passive income. Even just a measly $5 a week would be enough of a motivator for me to keep pushing forwards. It's hard to become self employed when you start with nothing, and you see all this advice but nothing works right away, so you wonder if you're just wasting your time.

Give me the secret sauce, seriously.

They will be educated by businesses, matched to jobs by businesses from an early age, which will be subsidized by loans from business to be paid back to business.

349,We should begin creating an antiwork policies,"What I am talking of is replacements to a market economies and capitalism. We probably should use this opportunity the Corona Virus has given to restructure the current power structure so that we don't do unnecessary work and if some one is not working, they still could have the right to their living (food and shelter).  


One current thing that I am seeing is that the current system of Capitalism and Market economics has policies and well structured arguments (hmm well structured is the wrong word, but let's say it has convinced people). I think we should try to build replaceable policies.   


I am also feeling that the primary indoctrination which causes us to not see the root problem comes from our education system. For example our education system, which is currently very competitive should change. It can be more collaborative. Because it is competitive, we come to believe this lie (make assumptions since the time to take in knowledge is very time consuming) that if we are better at school we should get better pay. At the same time we believe that CEOs have better education than us therefore they should have more value than us because of these assumptions. I am sure everyone here has already had those assumptions broken, but I guess the antiwork movement has to go mainstream. Otherwise these power structures will remain the same even though the corona virus has shown us these power structures are mere assumptions.   


I am not well versed in economics or anything like that but maybe we should seriously start thinking about bringing these things into action.   


The thing that is poisonous about this system is that it is a carrot stick kind of system and of course a pyramid system (which I think many are aware of). This perpetuates the lie that ""Oh he is poor because he is stupid "". Having been to 3 different countries with different grading mechanisms, I have to say that through this my assumptions have been challenged.   


Probably all of you are already aware that this current economic slavery has roots in imperialism and it has been a way to hide them from the guillotine of the common man. Previously we knew the aristocrats and the rich, now they are hidden.   


But now with the corona virus, the value of money has been challenged. It has no intrinsic value except that the rest of the community has accepted it. Kinda like facebook, there is a demand for a certain currency in your community and there is trust. We are not making this work to the benefit of common man. 

We might also have to think about establishing companies working under the anti-work philosophy. By creating actualized versions of working anti-work examples, we might be able to bring about actual change.  
I know this is very fucking vague right now. I just want to say that we should do something very serious about this, so that everyone all over the world has a right to food and shelter and other things.

and demanded all the socialist policy ballots be made permanent. i mean,

we sure dont want those permanently, do we? i mean, even tramp is already
talking about em. the caries part is they wouldn even have to use
violence, or force, or take to the streets risking contracting the virus, maybe
just not going to work might work. it sure seems like if could happen at any

363,UPS Working During Quarantine,So I work at a package delivery facility shipping packages via air. Few days ago my lead supervisor came up to us to tell us what will be happening. He starts off saying he is gathering us in small groups to spread the news because we aren’t allowed to have our big group meetings anymore. They announced that our company is a necessity during these times so we are instructed to continue our operation. As he is talking more and more people start to gather in the room until it is basically a big group meeting. Someone asks if we will be given anything for sanitation and the answer is no as of now. Our building is small and you pretty much have to touch multiple people to get anywhere because the work area is so narrow. After he finishes talking he coughs and then touches his face.....

Even if you can afford your rent or

the most vulnerable will be safer.

1. Write an open letter declaring
that you + others aren’t going to pay.

2. Create an online hut where people

and groups can sign on to the letter.
Google Forms or Docs is a good way to do this.

3. Share the letter far and wide.

A Facebook group called “Went Strike [Your City]”
is a Good way to reach people. Of there’s a local
mutual aid org on of, ask them to start the group.

  
  

4. Met up legal support and coordinate

Today, we get our daily email and I notice that the team's productivity has essentially doubled since we were all forced to work from home due to COVID-19.
For months we had been begging leadership to let us work from home because every single thing we do is web based and there is no reason why we need to sit in a dingy, moldy office for 8/9 hours a day. We have been told that the client doesn't want us to work from home because they feel it is a distraction. However, It is literally a health hazard to go to work due there being mold in the air vents and walls. Many complaints have been made but nothing has been done about it. I also don't work for a small company either, it's a multi-billion dollar company with offices all over the world. There is NO reason why they can't afford to just replace the entire system.

This feels like abandonment.  It's not like my job is that of a repetitive paper pushing.  It's meaningful and necessary.  My coworkers are great.  My boss isn't an asshole.  But I left anyways.  I'm dealing with a lot of guilt for it.  I'm a piece of shit, basically.

393,Working from home this week has made me realise just how much busy work we do in our jobz and how much we pretend to work,"Title says it all and I am sure others have had the same experience.

Yesterday I did virtually nothing. I spend 30 minutes actually working, an hour and a half on calls (just listening) and the other 6 hours of my workday I spent watching youtube videos and dicking around on reddit.

I work in corporate IT and I know for a fact that one of my 3 immediate colleagues also did nothing yesterday. The other two have a little more on their plate, but I know that they still spent at least half the day idle... both of them signed off early (which they never do in the office).

Without our boss breathing down our necks my team is taking it easy, but here's the weird thing: there's no consequences at all. 

You would expect that a sudden lack in busyness would mean that all kinds of shit would pile up and all of our projects would fall apart.  But that's not happening at all. The necessary work is still being done and our projects are still moving forward as normal. 

It doesn't make sense... at the office everyone buzzes around like anxious bees, but now we are working like 2 or 3 hours a day and we're getting the same result. 

My only conclusion is that we only ever work 2 or 3 hours a day, even in the office. The remainder is simply busy work and pretending. 

Seems very pointless to me for people to spend all day at work and then do nothing, but I see now that that is the reality.

I am hoping we can continue to WFH after this blows over but at the same time I'm doubtful. Most people work in sales, and much fewer deals are coming in now. I foresee that the company will blame the sales staff saying they were lazy at home and need to be supervised. The real reason is of course that clients don't want to commit in this time of uncertainty.

In fact I'm sure being at home is not stopping sales. They are paid very little and work on commission. They basically cannot survive without commission...

416,SHOCKING NEWS: Business that rhymes with Clam’s Club doesn’t care about their employees.,"My mom who has no immune system was told not to wear her mask I gave her because it “makes the members uncomfortable”. She’s 45, t2 diabetic, and suffers from a decent size of pre existing medical disorders thanks to my shitty abusive “dad”. Her pain management says her body age is 65. Apparently she’s okay enough to work because she can stand for 6 hours a day and not be in complete crippling pain but whatever. Her doctors vouch for her disability but it’s never been approved because she forces herself to work and be in constant pain.

I finally broke through to her today and told her she needs to just stay home. They won’t care when she dies, they’ll be more upset she caused them an inconvenience, etc. She finally listened after I told her I’m going on a hunger strike until she stops.
I’m so happy the half a million dollar profit in one day is worth more than a life that’s someone mom, daughter, sister, and best friend. I’m so beyond disgusted. She’s dedicated TWENTY YEARS of her life to this place and they just don’t care. 
When did it get like this? Why is money so important to these people? I could lose the only important person in my life because they were too selfish. I’m an adult but what if I was back to being a defenseless child with only one parent?

424,Feeling Inadequate Because I Always Hated Work! You?,"I'm an old woman now and retired. I'm shit poor because I was always pretty useless at holding down jobs. I just hated everything about it - mostly. There were some jobs that were tolerable - dealing games in casinos, hotel front desk, some that were terrible like working for corporations - headhunting CEOs, sales rep b2b, etc, and still others which were nerve racking - editor, programmer, web designer, decorator, etc. 

I would try something for two or three years, and I would generally be good and top of the producers, etc. But I never fitted in. I hated the gossip, the sexual harassment, the power plays, the lack of ethics. I just couldn't make myself be part of that. And I hated the constant pressure to do better and better. No matter how far ahead I was, the bosses always wanted to more. And the pressure killed me.

By the time I was in my mid-40s, I dropped out (and 10 years later I discovered I had Aspergers). I've been poor ever since.

Without the help of some relatives I would be out on the streets. I do have a small income from things I do, but not much.

Here's the thing. Strange as it may seem, I work all the time - at the things I love - writing, creating, 'making people think,' and more. 

But I feel stupid and inadequate and unhappy all the time because society judges me because I have no money. I also feel stupid and inadequate because I have to ask for help and I hate it. When you ask people and organisations for help, they treat you like dirt and they strip you of your dignity.

My daughter referred me to this thread. She said I might feel better if I realized how many other people didn't particularly like work.

So I want to ask you some things.

1. Did you continue to work even when you hated it? How did you manage?

2. If you dropped out, how have you managed to support yourself.

3. Do you feel inadequate because you've never succeeded at work?

451,WFH experiences,"First off, I am ""studying from home"", not working, but my parents are and we are all 3 in different levels of our apartment (basement, living room and my bedroom) working independently and ""sharing lunch break"" etc. in our kitchen.

This should be the norm. I will obviously not live at my parents' home after my studies are done, perhaps sooner, but as for my parents, they should have this situation normally.

My dad is sent on expensive, hotel travels with his job just for ""seminars"". This rounds up to a shitload of money every year, and are hardly work-related.

Both of them have an office environment where they get more interrupted by others, mostly of social, non-work-related matters, as opposed to the solid 2-5 hours of uninterrupted work they get from home.

As well as just in general working better from home, they also save time in the form of travelling to work, save expenses, and save for routine and repetition.

When I say this should be the norm, I mean that (office) worker's should have gatherings, meetups and events, but that should be sporadical, and general workflow should be from home.

This will cause for some people to be in a situation where they constantly have work in their free time, as they can at any moment open their PC and ""just fix something"", but this could be modernized by law to help oppose, for the future of the normal workplace, and I believe it is neccessary to transition to make this change nonetheless.

With my parents' WFH, I have never seen them this content and at-ease with life.

There are negative aspects with WFH, but it is in majority an improvement.

I believe a normalization of Working From Home would be the first step towards freedom of self, removing the chains of an office space.

Now this obviously doesn't apply for a lot of jobs that aren't office jobs. These are just some initial observations and thoughts I made about the matter.",False,fkcqcy,yung_pupper,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/fkcqcy/wfh_experiences/,0,2

460,Its Happening,"What a difference a couple months make.

Prior to that we were living our life accordingly, we had no choice. We were conditioned,  our societal behaviour ingrained in us from birth. A working society where the majority of the workers were living from pay cheque to pay cheque in order to keep the bills paid, a roof over thier heads, and food on the table.Accumulation of stuff equated to wealth. 

That's the way its supposed to be. It keeps the capitalistic society running like a fine tuned engine. We are simply the grease to the machine.  Money is the fuel. Eventually social anxiety and hopelessness is the end result. Another by - product looks like it could be image unconsciousness. Just check out the vanity posts. 
Markets tank, socialism creeps in to muddy the grease. Or to enhance its performance depending on how you see it. This is usually when peak democratic capitalist society comes to a grinding halt.

Remember that last sentence.

This was the trajectory society was on. Like it or not. Just not knowing how to enact that change. It had to get better,  right?
Socialism scares the  hell out of Democratic Capitalism.

Then the Pandemic arrived. Things changed.

In a few short months, weeks even, the Pandemic  modified our social behavior patterns like nothing we have ever experienced before. 200 years of societal behaviour evolution, altered beyond recognition in days. On a global scale. A behaviour that goes against all of our standard norms; social interaction, large gathering places, world travel, and physical contact that up until now humanity belived it had to have to survive.

We may have been wrong in making that assumption. I really hope so.

The Pandemic erased all of that. We are now forced into isolation, no physical contact, no large gatherings, no walking the dog, or talking to the neighbor over the fence. This goes against everything we are. Seemingly an overnight 180 degree turn in the expectation of our societies behaviour. Literally days.

It got worse.

World wide death, uncertainty, panic, closure of  borders, schools and non essential businesses, travel bans, and overwhelmed Medicare systems, and financial markets tank. Currency devalues as its the perfect delivery system for a Pandemic. Touch it and it could kill you. Online businesses soar. Our infrastructure was not designed for this. 

As a result we now see large progressive cities becoming ghost towns. Martial Law is right around the corner. This makes it harder to spend our hard earned cash. Remember that is the only way capitalism survives.  No fuel for the machine.The Pandemic is not just effecting our social behaviour. It is threatening the capitalism model as we know it. This is usually when the the peak democratic capitalist society comes to a grinding halt. Sound familiar.

Governments cant stop a Pandemic, history shows us this.

Governments first response is to soothe anxiety and avoid panic of the people.  Inevitably changing tactics only when they realize that the Pandemic is spreading regardless of their efforts. Too little too late. Again, history has many illustrations of this. 

Good News. 

There was a slow shift to get away from the normal rat race anyway. Our existing model wasn't sustainable.  Younger generations had that figured out long ago. Social media was already becoming the communication system of choice, alowing us to communicate in real time and without  borders. Online shopping, home delivery services, and the ability to work from home and avoid the 5 day a week standard procedure. The overwhelming desire for healthcare which the Pandemic has proven is woefully inadequate. This was going to be a slow process. It's hard to change overnight, and involves  painful job re-creation, and older societal generations must literally die off before the majority of the population can embrace it. Harsh for a free society.Great for a Pandemic.

This Pandemic is painful, as a society, as a human race. I know I'm living it. 

So, save your money or dont, invest your money or dont, sell your stuff or dont. It won't matter, this Pandemic may have not only triggered the end of the Peak capitalistic society model, it may have shown use what we can accomplish on the other side to make our society more livable.The society goes on. The sun  is coming up tomorrow like it did yesterday, and the day before.

For levity, look no further than Hollywood. At two quotes that are more appropriate now than they have ever been.

Since my classes were cancelled last minute this morning and I already was at home, I figured I would do my regular full-time job from home. I was given the tools I needed the day prior and the laptop was all set so I was fully prepared to work on some things. 

I emailed my manager, letting her know that I was going to try to WFH and see how it goes since I'm generally always at the office. I did mention that it was only for today just to test things out. I got started on a few things and about an hour went by before I got a response from my manager:

""We are not allowing our employees to work from home at the moment unless they have a really valid reason to do so. I was told by the HR manager that you need to be at the office right now if you want to be paid, otherwise you are going to be considered absent.""

What the fuck? So you provide everything to us ""in case"" we need to WFH? What exactly are you waiting for? More deaths? More people with symptoms? More risks to spread this fucking virus? Our government already strongly advised that we WFH if possible. It is possible in my case, so why wouldn't I give it a go? Especially since a lot of people at the office are already working from home (but I guess having children at home is considered a valid reason).

I was so fucking pissed off and I thought it was so insulting. I don't feel safe and I don't feel like I'm making others safe by physically showing up to work.

472,How do I tell my company to shut down?,"3 weeks ago I started this job at a local carwash. At the start of this week about 1/3 of our team was put in quarantine, so I'm working six days in a row now about 9 to 10 hrs a day, already doing lots of things beyond my responsibility as our manager is also sick.

Basically the board refuses to shut the company down. Since most people don't go to work and the weather is getting better, we are fucking packed. So many people come in to wash their car, as if it is a way to spend leasure time and get out of the house
. It is a very high risk situation considering the spread of the virus, and our country is already increasing in infections massively.

We take cash, we take cards and we don't have time to clean or swap gloves in between transactions. Besides some coworkers are neglilent with hygene and precautions. We have DYI vacuum cleaners and washing stations where dozens of people each day use the same handles without gloves, etc.

It is impossible to exclude any spread, and that for such a dumb and irrelevant service.

All,

You have heard me say many times that your
locality is the most important thing you have on
the phone.

People feed off how you sound. Of you sound
depressed, nervous, or sad, they will feel the same
way.

I listened to several of your recording today and
the person on the other end of the phone

would think the world is coming to an end. Some of
you are agreeing to everything they say about the
uncertainty of what is going to happen and then at
the end, you say something like oh, by the way, do
you want to spend some money?

Even if this is how you really feel you can't sound
like that. You should be beat about the future
and having a way that can help them after this is
over.

 

Of you can't do that PLEASE STOP making calls and
go lock yourself up in a room for the next 2
months. He will let you out when it's over.

Strong salespeople make it through times like this
and weak ones don't, which are you?

519,"After being asked to WORK FROM HOME, I had no idea how I would stay productive but the Pomodoro Technique was the hack during this time","So working from home can be a very interesting experience. There are countless distractions and it can pretty hard to get in the headspace to actually do the work

During this time that we are all social distancing and working from home, everything that is happening in the world can make it tough to focus. I just kept finding it hard to even start the work that I was supposed to and ultimately ended up procrastinating for far too long.

So I tried using the classic Pomodoro Technique. Some of you may know this, but its principles of using quick bursts of output and regular intervals were exactly what I needed given the environment that many of us are working in.

My simple process was

* Choose a task
* Set the Pomodoro to 25 minutes
* Work on the task until the Pomodoro rings
* When the timer rings, take a short break (5 mins)
* After 4 “Pomodoros”, take a longer break (15-30)

This was so so helpful to me and I think that this indefinite time being spent at home can actually be put to good use now.

529,Manager Dangling Carrots - And Wanting Free Work - What To Do?,"So, I walked into a nearby gym, spoke to the assistant manager and offered to write blog posts, after seeing a posting online they had on indeed looking for a full-time blogger. Mind you, I called in advance and was instructed to come in and ask to see a manager, etc. I did this for the side income I needed to invest in my blog. 

**Day 1(Friday):**

The Asst manager there says ""cool! the manager is busy, can you wait a bit""

me: \*Waits for 1 hour\*

Asst Manager: "" Well, she's to busy to see you and I don't wanna waste your time, can you come back on Wednesday""

**Here are some red flags he said**

""Also, the owner is old school, he still believes in flyers, but I can convince him""  - ""Come in on Monday, we'll be working alongside together anyways"" - ""Can you do social media stuff to?"" - Even though social media wasn't in the job post.

I suggest I bring samples, I also say I need 20$/hr, and this includes web design, social media, and blog posting. This is the financial equivalent of an ""unskilled"" worker getting paid in trident layers etc. 

**Day 2:(Monday)**

I come with some pretty decent social media samples that I photoshopped and a blog post. Equivalent to three hours work. Work that was super impressive for a boomer. However, it didn't take that long for me because that's my skill. Think of it like how it takes the average runner 5 hours to run a marathon, but an olympian can do it in only 2.

So, I show him some 5-star samples and even do some consulting, etc. He says that I will be meeting up with the manager on Wednesday.

Later in the day, he talked about needing to update his gyms hours and he needed a simple flyer, which I did as a show of good faith. It was simple to copy-paste word editing and formatting, but I still did most of the work.

Every day he says that he's putting in a good word for me to the manager.

**Day 3: (Tuesday)**

On Day 3 he texts me to call him, I call him. He talks about the managers love what I've been doing etc. Then he tells me that They won't be coming in because they're old and paranoid of the coronavirus. But he also needs me to update another flyer - So far **I still haven't made a dime yet.**

Then, he tells me that he is understaffed and would like me to work the ""front desk"" and answer calls, do sales, etc. This is temporary because some of his staff are high-risk for coronavirus(e.g respiratory issues, old age). But still hasn't even paid me a dime yet. I stupidly agreed to start tomorrow at 9 am to increase my chances of sealing the deal.

He keeps complimenting me and sweet-talking me but I don't give a rats ass. I also forgot to ask him what my compensation will be when I work at the front desk. Because I previously told him that I want 20$ per hour.

He only told me that I would get commission and that's all. But guess what? These guys are struggling to get customers and that's why they need a guy like me in the first place. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary:**

\-Gave Free Work

\-Keeps dangling carrot, and postponing a meeting with the manager for my actual job I applied for

\-Wants me to work a different job then I applied

\-Afraid he won't give me the same compensation for the different job

**Day 4: Wednesday(TODAY) TBD**

I'll make an update if you want. 

\--------

**My Question**

Even though I previously agreed to come in yesterday. Would I be an asshole if I changed my mind? If I called in advance and asked if he was going to bring my paperwork to get paid upon the first day, then if he doesn't, I refuse to come into work.

Because if I decide to quit the day after, I still want to get paid for the first day I actually work, which will be later today.

I honestly was desperate, because I lost some clients due to the corona, but I feel like I'm being taken advantage of. I already gave them technically over 5 hours of FREE WORK.

P.S. Hate to toot my own horn, I'm talented and hardworking for my age, but also young and look that way. late teens to early twenties. Which might be the reason why he thinks he can ""screw"" me.

Take pictures/video of everything!

- lack of sanitation supplies, soap, people coughing, if you have a thermometer and a willing coworker (or yourself) record your temps in the photo/video
- forward/print/screenshot emails saying that you're required to work, etc, save everything they send or tell you about coronavirus. Try to always only communicate with them in a format you can save and document.

536,Society 2.2 Automation. Perfect for a Pandemic.,"Pandemics kill Humans. Not Robots.

Perhaps the Pandemic has not only changed our global social behaviour regardless of government. It's also shown us that we should value people over money. This could be an the end of  all those low paying jobs that barely got people by.  Month to month was reality. That percentage of the world worker bees were growing rapidly. Slave labour. Debt ridden workers, for Capitalism. Pre Pandemic. 

Humans work for money.

Robots work for free.

This one,  like all the other changes,  dropped on us by the Pandemic. This one seems to really  fit the new global social behaviour. Any company in the ""people to people business"" is laying off, closing down for an undetermined time, or simply going bankrupt. As a global society.

A rapid, and drastic global behaviour modification is requiring us to keep up as a species. We've never been in this position before. Cabin fever, is now standard procedure, worldwide.

This was happening regardless. Just at a slower pace. 

Those jobs were killing people. Killing their will to continue.
Many needed two, or more. More time working, for money. Less time doing anything other than working. Life was supposed to get easier. Now might be that opportunity.  Drones were step one. 

Don't build cars, or airplanes.People cant travel. 
Don't build buildings, people cant gather.

Open free spaces, large park like areas. That might be acceptable in a Pandemic. Great for the planet, which is great for us; the people. That sounds good anytime. That's the point. New priorities, for a new global social behavioir as a species. This could be good.

Build devices that can assist our new global social behaviour modification.  If not during a global pandemic, when science fiction? That's now.  A global Pandemic made us behave differently as a species. Overnight. Globally.

Automation might be one of the industries that could not only thrive, but work for us, instead of us working for money.

Money that cant stop a Pandemic.
People stop a Pandemic.

It's not for everyone, but I like it better that way. I have pretty bad social anxiety, so to deal with the idiotic crowd on a daily basis, especially with all this coronavirus crap feeding into their worst fears, is not something worth breaking my back for.

Anyway, I was just getting ready to get some sleep around noon, when I got a message from my boss saying that the guy who was supposed to be in didn't show up and is not answering calls. I was asked to come and stay until the shift was over. I thought about it, but decided not to answer. It's just minimum wage, and you're really just a number.

There are other employees who could easily work those opposite hours. I didn't want to complicate my sleep patterns. It's just not worth it. I know I'm a good worker and deserve flexibility. I've been with this company for a whole year, and I've NEVER missed any scheduled shifts. I haven't formally been written up, either.

Was I in the right to ignore this text message? I know we're short on people at the moment, but management has all the power to hire more workers to meet their needs.

The owner of the shop works there with us six days out of the week, doing all the same stuff as us on top of extra she has to do for being the owner. She is kind and generous. Because of the panic of the virus, business has dropped significantly. She had to cut some of my hours. Last night I spoke to her and she sounded distraught, though she said she was trying to stay optimistic. ""I don't have a huge backup of money like other businesses,"" she told me. ""This is all I have."" She gestured to the shop. 

I don't want to have to get a job at big corp just to survive. I want to stay here. But now I'm scared. I dropped out of university (I was only an English major, anyway...) due to the ridiculousness that is the system even though I had made Dean's List. (I'm going to write something about my experience someday soon.) I don't want big corp to be the only way to survive but it always looks that way, and I feel like I can't complain to people because I just always get, ""That's just the way life is, kiddo""... 

I finally find a job I love but I can't survive on it because the world is set up stupid. I was already in a situation where I probably would need to get a second job because just the way the store is I couldn't get full time hours always. I actually like working part time because I like more free time to write, read, work on personal projects, see friends... but because of ""the way life is"" I have to give 80% of my time to work, and even when I find something I actually enjoy, it isn't good enough. I don't get full time, I don't make much over minimum wage.

I guess this is a sadpost... but I found this sub last night and I'm happy to find people who share my same values. Ever since I was 18 (ten years ago agh) I've been spouting, ""I hate working!!"" and when I worked at Starbucks at 19 and dealt with some bullshit there I wrote in a poem, ""No company will control me."" I've been trying to live with these ideals for a long time. That's why I chose to work at this shop, and I feel lucky that I was even hired because it's not easy to get into small places like this. I just wish I could thrive working there, instead of struggling financially forever and feeling not good enough.

I guess I wanna say... During the midst of all this panic and confusion... remember the small businesses. The local places run by people in your community.

Short story is during a time where business are closing for public good and people are encouraged to stay home, both my company and its parent company have been mum on the issue. For our companies employees who visit homes, they are to ask if someone is sick inside and leave if there is... that’s it. Rest is business as usual.

My job is not going to peoples homes and businesses, it’s sitting in a call center. A giant room with 100+ cubicles. Open air and people have complained about the air filtration here for years, well before the Covis scare. The best my company offered was providing non-paid leave time if you are sick or self quarantined and... wait for it...

Jeans days ALL WEEK!!! Woo Hoo Reddit, I’m allowed to where jeans to an office job where no one will see me besides my coworkers. Having to do SLIGHTLY less laundry certainly offsets the corporations willingness to bet with MY and my coworkers health... so their phones could be answered. 

Funny part is, before the new parent company took over 3 years back, 1/5 of the staff was work at home. New parent company doesn’t believe in work at home and sold the equipment necessary (laptops and VPN service needed for my specific industry) so it’s no longer possible for them to do work from home.

597,Family stuck in propaganda. I can’t escape.,"So I (soon to graduate university student, only went because winning a trophy for my mother seemed better than implied homelessness) basically expressed to my mother and sister (college aged) that the idea of having a 9-5(6 nowadays) is bothersome to me, and when it became apparent that I hate school and working (nothing but papers and deadlines), they went with “but what would you do all day?”, and I couldn’t give an answer since I knew that “hobbies” would have earned derision for my apparent laziness. Then my sister started with the “if you work hard, you can have freedom” and “just work harder” and before even questioning how we turned out so different, she started going on about how her friend started a hair reviewing channel reviewing sponsored wigs from China on YouTube 2 years ago as a high school senior and had 100k now and made enough money to buy her own Mercedes. She praised her friend for having the “work ethic” (which, given the evidence of min wage laborers that work all day, makes it clear that “work ethic” is doublespeak for money-making ability) and said that she might be able try something like that in YouTube too and buy her own Mercedes. I tried to tell her about all the factors that she would need to even stand a chance (consistent uploading and editing, parents who wouldn’t try pressuring her to get a job since successful YouTubing nowadays is a full time job) but it was completely disregarded. She then went on about other side hustles I could try (completely ignoring my counter arguments about needing marketable business ideas, investment capital, free time, or a combination of the three)

When my sister was done lecturing me, my mother then asked me to come home from school since I had the opportunity (virus closing schools) but I refused because my home environment, while not directly abusive anymore, makes me uncomfortable since I don’t like being around the people who live there.

Am I crazy for not having this “work ethic”? Do I really have no options if I want to avoid homelessness? I’m not even asking to improve my standard of living, is having the opportunity to maintain it (a small dorm-like room with internet access) really that much to ask for? Especially when many other students in my school (especially international) are born with much more than that that they will have access too even out of graduation.

609,Office jobs red flags,"I see a lot of posts about people moving from catering or customer service to their first office job and thinking it'll be all dandy. Obviously they can Google red flags but I've learned a few myself that aren't as commonly discussed:

1. If the bosses are all older men. Doesn't even matter which color. This is an old boys club and they will stick to their backward ""bootstrap"" ways no matter what.

2. If your supervisor or manager has direct stake in the company. This is usually true for smaller partnerships. Your performance will directly affect their profits so they will breathe down your neck, whereas if you have a salaried manager it's more likely they don't care bc their salary is the same no matter what you do.

3. If they literally tell you red flags in the interview. Yes interviews are a farce with rehearsed answers and questions. However if someone repeatedly asks how you deal with conflict or stress, there will be conflict or stress. Nope outta there.

4. If they guilt trip you about discussing salary. It's borderline if not entirely illegal and proves they *know* they're underpaying you, and are worried they won't get away with it.

5. If there is a high turnover in the role. Speaks for itself. Question why all those other guys left.

Also random tips:

You are being exploited no matter what. However these jobs don't allow unions and you must be your own union. Always negotiate. Always push back.

Gossiping isn't as bad as people say. It's not necessarily true they're gossiping about you too. Sometimes humans need something to bond over. As long as it's not cruel or damaging, fine to engage to make the day go by faster and find someone who will have your back.

I'm talking to people on the phone who are angry about coronavirus. I'm 2 days behind on my actual work because my co-worker was out yesterday and I was covering for her. I still am barely scraping by, because my pay is the same (I'm trying to make this new position a stepping stone to something with hopefully more pay, just could not handle my other job anymore and this was the quickest solution).

So, I work for a university checking to make sure students have taken the correct courses for their degrees and then posting degrees as well.  My university has gone to remote learning to protect the students and faculty, but the rest of us are still expected to be in the office as usual.  There have been zero precautions set in place for us except for having janitors clean doorknobs.  

I, and many other coworkers, feel this shows a deep lack of caring about our wellbeing.  They are not putting in place any work from home options even for those of us who very easily could. Even though public health experts have asked companies to allow employees to work from home and hundreds of companies are now doing so, the administration at my university appears to be choosing to ignore this.  

They did say if we are feeling sick to not come to work and that we would be allowed to use our sick leave time with no problem.  I am not feeling sick physically but all of this is wearing on me mentally.  I want to keep working but I also want to protect myself and my husband by limiting exposure to potential infection.  I don't want to have to use leave time, of which I have very little, or go into leave without pay status to do so.

Providing monetary value to someone else is totally different than pursuing your own passions and interests. It feels pretty hopeless writing this and I've went back and forth between acknowledging the problem or just using forms of escapism to not think about it.

I've tried looking through most degree options and jobs available near by and none of it appeals to me at all. I spend most of my free time playing guitar/piano and video games but I'm trying to reduce the amount of gaming I do. Please don't tell me to just stop being ""lazy"" or the ""that's life"" advice because it really does not help at all. Also I think I'm a relatively happy person and I know that I don't have depression so it's not that. I'm interested in other things in life but a career is not one of them. 

tl:dr - I'm struggling with the concept of pursuing a career and I've never had any interest in going to school or getting a job.

First ever shift and I got put on tills, mostly by myself for a lot of it.

They said everyone has to start somewhere and were talking to me hoping I was doing fine. Then the woman supervisor went home and I was on the till by myself as the day went on and especially past 5 customers were all cunts, apart from the people wearing uniforms of other stores as they were all friendly and a GP receptionist who assured me she knew what I was going through. I got called a retard and a twat because someone's chewing gum didn't discount right and I had to wait for a manger to check everything, which took maybe 1 minute at most but this was a 15 minute wait and was a piss take according to him. All of this over maybe 50p at most. Cuntsomers would know that you are only allowed to buy two packs of paracetamol by law so would try and put packs at the beginning of their shopping and at the end, when I was on autopilot mode scanning everything I wouldnt notice I had scanned the paracetamol until I got to more packs and then told them I could only sell two packs, cuntsomers would always want the packs I had yet to scan and I couldn't sell them it without voiding the packs I had already scanned which required a manager to void items as I had no authority to void items which would take time to call management down... Its fucking paracetamol like just use the packs I have already scanned and you clearly know you are only allowed two otherwise you would have put them together you cunts.

646,"on the concept of ""real jobs""","using an alt/throwaway for privacy reasons.

howdy comrades, I [24M] am closing in on 3 years removed from college with a degree in marketing. after graduation I took 6 months off to travel and spend some time with my then S/O since I attended community college and I had no debt. I started driving rideshare part time as a means of generating some income while having the flexibility to attend interviews. 

anyways, I did that for 2 years, sent hundreds if not thousands of resumes, got interviews at no more than 5 employers in that span of time, and never landed anything. had experience, had a good resume, I thought I had checked all the boxes. I was actually so fucking depressed because I thought I was just a failure or there was something wrong with me. all the boomers in my family constantly asking about my employment status, offering up gems like; ""try delivering your resumes in person to stand out"", and ""don't worry, a lot of your problems will be solved once you land a 'real job'"". 

Are you fucking insane? Are we living on the same planet? This shit feels like The Truman Show where everybody is absolutely batshit fucking loony about the problems facing our generation and even more batshit loony about how to 'solve' those problems. How the fuck is me toling away for 50 hours a week for 50 years for some already rich fucker going to solve anything? Eventually I just came to the conclusion that these people are so far up their own asses that any non traditional argument  about jobs/the job market/work in general will fall on deaf ears and you'll here the same tidbits from them time and time again.

I stopped sending resumes. I started enjoying working 20-30 hours a week at my not real job for ok pay because of the independence it offered me. I started making music and having enough time to persue things I wouldn't have the time for had I started in a more traditional post graduate role. I'm probably making a mistake, since I still live with my folks, but for now my job is ""real"" enough for me and right now, while my body is still functioning, the time is worth more than the money.

And indeed you see to many people and not just kids and teens, but even adults, think that being a professional MMA fighter would be a fun job or assume just because you love eating cheeseburgers you can make a career at food eating contests, etc.

Recently I attempted to go pro at Magic The Gathering. I used to always beat my friends as well as other random people at bars and restaurants in betting matches and win big bucks. I won a small local tournament earlier this year so I decided I would go pro. But when I started this month I was getting my but whooped against even bottom tier ranking pro players and even amateur tournies that are above the ones I used to win at the local level. I practically lost all my gambling money and a large chunk of reserve cash I put specifically for this career on a rainy day.

In addition I never thought how stressful and hard stuff I used to do such as organizing my magic deck could be when your paycheck is dependent on it. And I'm so surprised how even the worst of the worst players at upper level amateur contests and professional gambling and dueling can be! Every trick I used that easily won me cash against friends and other people in my local neighborhood was easily countered and I could not develop any new strategy. In addition even just buying the equipment to keep up with the recent trends is extremely expensive.

So I am curious if anyone here ever tried to go pro at their favorite hobbies and backed out instead for an easy secure job or college like I did with Magic? Why do so many people especially commentators giving advice think that not only will you excel at something you love if you work at it for a living, but you will still easily stay in said career despite failures and setbacks simply because you love the job?

Its repeated so often in the media and by commentators that you'd think its a guaranteed formula! But I learned first hand the hard way even the bottom levels of professionalism of your favorite hobby is so difficult you might end up hating the hobby (which I actually did with Magic after I decided to abandon pro gaming for almost a month until my sister convinced me to start playing with her again).

Has anyone here tried to go for the NBA or become a professional martial artist or played at esports as a pro gamer or other stuff you had a passion for as an amateur and backed out because of the shock of how hard a career is? Even going as far as temporarily abandoning the hobby because you grown to hate it for a while after attempting to go pro with it and seeing how much of a pain in the but doing your hobby is when you work at it for a living and not just for fun and games?

672,Idea for Direct Action for the Environment," 

Okay, so, I have an idea for the ways in which we could prevent horrible megacorps and/or companies from making profits off of selling products which harm the environment. 

What if, rather than steal, or commit some kind of vandalism (to the products in stores), all of us, instead, went around and hid them across the store (in hardtofind, unexpected, hardtoreach places)? 

For instance, I have found, in my current life, that the oil companies Chevron, Shell, and ExxonMobil are fucking up the planet, as well as making it harder for ME to get a job (I'll go into more detail in that if you want me to), 

and so, I was thinking of going around Walmart and going over to the automotive/oil side, and hiding their products across the store, or moving their products in one of Walmart's big, shopping carts from one end of the store to another, 

in other words, 

where effectively misplacing or hiding the product will cause the people, who normally go over to them, in their spot of the store, to go, ""Oh, they're not here"", and for Walmart and the oil companies to go ""Why are we not making a profit off of these products, we put them in the stores""?

We NEED to put aside the discourse and start taking Direct Action against our current dystopia. 

. 

It's nonviolent, too, so it seems like it should be appealing.

The night before a day off is better
than the actual day off.

The night before a day off is better than the
actual day off. It gives you a better chance

to relax knowing that you don't have to do
anything the next day. During the actual day
off, there's always that feeling that you'll have
to get back to work/school, which makes it
less relaxing. By best sleep always comes the
night before my off day.

675,Why do I have to feel guilty for being sick and requesting days off from work?,"I work with the public. I am Asian. There have been at least 5 confirmed cases of coronavirus where I live.

I've already asked for 3 days off. I'm about to ask for the 4th day. The second time I asked for a day off, I received a curt, two-word text back that made me feel very guilty. I was so disappointed because I was hoping for encouragement or affirmation that it would be fine. I spent the day on my bed sick, anxious, and then cried at some point.

Fast-forward to right now. I still feel sick. I've already composed my third apology text requesting another day off. And I'm so nervous about it. I've prepared to bring some desserts to work to make it up.

But I'm just so damn resentful that I have to feel this guilty and nervous about being sick. Pre-coronavirus, I would have worked after one day off. In the first 3 months at my job, I made it work at my sickest because I was afraid of the judgment. I was having horrible coughing fits in front of people, not being able to breathe, etc.

I'm not going to abuse my body like that anymore, especially during this coronavirus madness.

681,Office jobs red flags,"I see a lot of posts about people moving from catering or customer service to their first office job and thinking it'll be all dandy. Obviously they can Google red flags but I've learned a few myself that aren't as commonly discussed:

1. If the bosses are all older men. Doesn't even matter which color. This is an old boys club and they will stick to their backward ""bootstrap"" ways no matter what.

2. If your supervisor or manager has direct stake in the company. This is usually true for smaller partnerships. Your performance will directly affect their profits so they will breathe down your neck, whereas if you have a salaried manager it's more likely they don't care bc their salary is the same no matter what you do.

3. If they literally tell you red flags in the interview. Yes interviews are a farce with rehearsed answers and questions. However if someone repeatedly asks how you deal with conflict or stress, there will be conflict or stress. Nope outta there.

4. If they guilt trip you about discussing salary. It's borderline if not entirely illegal and proves they *know* they're underpaying you, and are worried they won't get away with it.

5. If there is a high turnover in the role. Speaks for itself. Question why all those other guys left.

Also random tips:

You are being exploited no matter what. However these jobs don't allow unions and you must be your own union. Always negotiate. Always push back.

Gossiping isn't as bad as people say. It's not necessarily true they're gossiping about you too. Sometimes humans need something to bond over. As long as it's not cruel or damaging, fine to engage to make the day go by faster and find someone who will have your back.

690,a little rant on shopping etc,"for the love of all that is holy, we need to make a huge effort to stop blaming others for the state of the world and begin to change it by our own everyday choices. (well, not stopping to blame everyone, many corporates are predators who literally are at fault, learning about humanity and using that knowledge to rob us)

im sitting here, depressed, overweight (0% body shaming in this statement, im just annoyed that nestle built this body and not excercise and normal fucking food..), and overwhelmed, yet again, that life need to be better than this late stage capitalism.

i need to make better choices. you do too. it's tiresome to feel myself opposing big data with a fire, yet consuming meat, interior design shit, books i dont read etc etc. its also tireing to see my vegan friends shopping clothes and tech and ""cute things"" like there's no tomorrow. and my conservative friends sneering at those trying to make an effort, or not wanting to take in where the world is actually heading.

the world is so so beautiful. there is so much kindness in place, when we have the strength to bring it out of the world at least. we cannot buy into the forces who tell us there is no future. there is! we are talking globally, sharing ideas from what works in other places, and feel within ourselves which ideas truly improves a society and by encouraging each other we can slowly build a better world.

i want to stop being annoyed at others for making less than perfect choices, and instead focus on making my own choices as good as i can, and with a kind voice forgive myself when the predatory forces steer me in a bad direction. and i would love if the general public tone changed as well. we are so many being tricked by bad systems, we need to unite and not cast blame among eachother. actually not even focus on blame at all. just to live a more sustainable life ourselves, and take great pleasure from that, without fooling ourselves we're better than anyone and negatively comparing our efforts with others (we all struggle and it's never ever shown how much, never)

when we stop consuming things, stop blaming other individuals (including ourselves) for being flawed, and instead start to understand that we are all so so simular and equally unique, and that our happiness will always depend on others and the world around us.. then we know how much better earth, us, would feel. always filled with struggles, of course, but struggles that we're maybe slightly more designed to handle than the soul crushing one of being a rusty screw in a polluted wheel. where most of the grease and care is divided on a selected few.

it's ridiculous, and just not true, to frame the narrative that those few screws deserved nearly all the grease. wouldn't the system run better if we made sure all screws had enough grease? 

i wish that those who have a lot would see that they will always burn if the world around them does, but that would be the simple solution, to whish that someone else does the hard work. if i start seeing where i can improve, it's something. it's literally everything, in my tiny tiny world. and it's one way which would undoubtly bring a brighter future, if lots of tiny worlds improved.",False,fi61cq,61855415136151852251,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/fi61cq/a_little_rant_on_shopping_etc/,1,1

731,I'm trying to take a medical leave from my job and HR outed me,"Over the last several months, my mental health has taken a nose dive. I'm not going to kill myself, but I am definitely not well, and it is very clear that a lot of that has to do with my job. I won't get into the details, but my therapist suggested the idea of a medical leave, so I decided to contact HR to request information. In that email, I specifically said I hadn't spoken to my supervisor about this issue, and would appreciate the matter being kept quiet until I was able to review the information and decide if I wanted to take a leave. 

This morning I arrived in the office to an email containing the information I'd requested, with the Director of my department CCed. Immediately I had to do damage control. Now it looks like I was hiding this from them, and that I was trying to take a leave at an objectively busy time in our office without providing any notice. I don't even know for sure if I will be taking the leave yet, and had planned on notifying them in my own way once I had everything in order. I hadn't notified management because I didn't want to make something out of potentially nothing. 

I contacted HR to let them know I was upset about this, to which they said ""it's policy"". That's fine, and I respect that, but it blows my mind that they chose to not acknowledge my request for privacy at all. I would be significantly less upset if they had told me they couldn't maintain my privacy. I gave them that feedback, and then they stopped replying. 

What the fuck is the point of HR? What is the point of trying to care for yourself in a work environment when it obviously doesn't fucking matter? I probably won't take the leave now, and will probably be under (admittedly unintentional) scrutiny at work as a result of them outing me.",False,fe4ktw,courtneat,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/fe4ktw/im_trying_to_take_a_medical_leave_from_my_job_and/,4,1

Talking with him about it is useless. I get that it's the system but because we don't want to starve I've told him to feedback about the overwork and if they don't change, he should leave the job. He ""feels guilty he's letting the company down"". Every time a co-worker leaves the others get a small promotion. It absolutely does not cover the amount of extra work he does. He's been so proud lately because they ""promoted"" him to team lead without a pay rise. Dude doesn't get they're taking advantage of him.

I've encouraged him to go to therapy. The therapist wrote a note that he *must* not work that much ot anymore because it is damaging his health and prescribed him anti depressants. His work gave him a week off! But now it's back to the same hours.

Basically my bf thinks it's an amazing opportunity and he's so grateful and says he love making more money from ot. He somehow suppresses the stress vomiting and depression and break down of relationships. He's a husk of the man he used to be. He doesn't laugh anymore.

I can't say too much antiwork stuff too him bc he finds me ""lazy"" when I say I wouldn't work if I didn't have to.

My job takes 11 hours of my life daily with commute included and all my energy. When i return i am a wreck, cant do anything because i have no energy left, i mostly laid down 2 hours after i came home at last weeks. It was similiar before but drugs masked these feelings. 

Now i see no choice but return to meds and to be honest if it was not for the work that leeched all my energy and time i would never return to them. At some extended periods of vacations i had off from work i have no problem.

744,i'm gonna hate my new job,"today i started a week long orientation for my new job installing/troubleshooting satellite tv products, and there's already a bunch of red flags

the trainer (let's call him brandon) started with having us do a cringey icebreaker exercise where we talked about what super powers we wish we had and what ""spirit animals"" we identify with (as though we ever contemplate such questions). pretty standard corporate bs so far, but later he went on this weird tangent and talked about how proud he is of his grown son having ""such a strong work ethic"" as to ask brandon permission to use his own vacation days. even worse, brandon praised some unpaid employee for ""taking initiative, and without even being asked"" writing a portion of our instructional materials ""on his own time, without compensation""

but to be honest, that's not even the worst part

part of the job is up-selling (or cross-selling, to be pedantic) products to our customers, and brandon was very insistent that we're not to ""discriminate against poor customers."" he gave an anecdote about how he once sold $900 of tv wall mounts and sound bars to a customer who couldn't pay her water bill and whose roof was literally caving in. ""if customers can't manage their money, that's their problem, not yours""

751,An aspect of capitalism I don't see discussed enough: Capitalistic doctrine is genetic supremacy.,"The mythos of capitalism, regardless of how much it actually operates this way, is that the more capable a person is of providing a service which is useful to the economy, the more they will be rewarded for doing so. While there is absolutely a large aspect of luck and class advantage that this explanation doesn't address, this is the stated goal, and there are a few small ways in which capitalism achieves it, at least in that a person who wants to do economically valued labor is more likely to be rewarded than a person who doesn't.

However, I want to point out something about the usage of ""capable"" and ""economically valued"".

The elephant is the room when talking about people's capability to provide labor is that not everyone actually has the same capabilities. People are born with genetic-related disabilities, and disabilities are not the only disparity in ability that exists between people which can be seeded before birth. While it's far harder to measure the exact differences in capabilities between individuals without something so obvious as a disability to point them out due to the endless well of other factors at play (I also would rather this not be measured, as it's info that could only realistically be used for evil), we do at least know that nature plays a significant role in how a person's behaviors and abilities develop. The reality is that we just don't know how big this factor is, but we know it exists to some degree. Even if you take the stance that everyone who doesn't have a clear disability is on even footing genetically, the issue still remains of that subsection of people who aren't.

The problem herein is that the extension of this logic is that some people, by circumstance of birth, are more capable of being useful to a capitalistic economy than others are, regardless of what context you put them in. This means that by arguing that a person *should* be rewarded for being able to contribute to the economy, a person is also arguing, by logical extension, that some people are simply inherently deserving of a better life than others.

While support programs for people with disabilities raise the floor for the most adversely affected by this reality somewhat, they don't put them on even footing with others, and they don't address the core of the issue: A capitalistic society believes that they deserve less than others do, simply for existing. That's the reality. One cannot argue for capitalism without accepting that they are arguing this.",False,feqdlk,Party_Wagon,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/feqdlk/an_aspect_of_capitalism_i_dont_see_discussed/,5,1

773,"The secret behind ""Career consultants"" who get their clients their ideal dream job which isn't minimum wage slavery","You may have saw these people. They claim that if you hire them , they will teach you all the interview techniques and preparation to help you get very high paying jobs at the best firms like Google, McKinsey or Goldman Sachs.

Surprisingly they're not scams! You see genuine people with success stories.

But I'll tell you the real secret to them. 

Pre-selection

Look at the actual background of their clients who suceeded. I noticed almost all of them had ideal backgrounds. Very high gpa, scholarships, good internships, usually strong subject major etc. 

In other words these guys were already 80-90% on track to succeed anyway. These consultants take them in, add maybe 5% and claim them as a success story.

So basically why these consultants are successful is because they deliberately target ""safe"" and established "" clients"" who were going to succeed anyway.

So if you're not in the top 1% sorry but I guess dreams are only reserved for those people.

778,"Reason 676,975","By Paul Roberts
Seattle Times business reporter
The last few days have been nerve-cracking for Retro driver Arshpreet High.

When he drives the Number 3 or 4 routes, his bus passes close to three major
medical centers on First Will. Any of his passengers are medical patients.

“He get all kinds of people and we have no idea what they have,” said High,
27. “Yeah, I’m scared.” Of he and other drivers come down with COVID-19, the
illness caused by the coronavirus, he added, “how are people going to get to
work?”

High isn’t the only one asking that question.

In Wednesday, King County began advising companies to let employees work
remote to reduce the risk of workplace transmission of the virus.

But that’s not an option for those with jobs entailing lots of public
interaction, including transit and delivery drivers, airport security workers,
retail clerks and flight attendants. These workers are finding themselves,
often unhappily, on the front lines of the COVID-19 outbreak.

“They can work from home — we don’t have that option,” Isaiah Suarez,
assistant manager at the Walgreens on Penny May, said of the workers at
companies that have urged employees to avoid the office.

Adding to his uneasy, several of his recent customers have been openly
sneering or coughing in the store, but have seemed largely unconcerned

about how that affects the store’s staff. “I don’t think people are really
considering us,” he said.

783,A vent about my Senior year of High School,"So today I feel like total shit, mostly because of all the work piling up on me since I'm in the middle of my second semester of senior year. I would consider myself a perfectionist, which isn't a good thing at all. Because of this, I want to get every assignment to be perfect in every way, which conflicts with the ""lazy"" part of me that wants to do something more relaxing. Even though I'm proud of something once I finish it, I wonder if it's worth all the heartache just for a number that ""has meaning"". Not to mention all the time I waste doing an assignment, when I could do something else. The funny thing is that once I have free time, I rarely do the things I feel like I should be doing. I just end up playing video games, watching youtube videos, or making art instead of reading books or articles that I been meaning to read for a while now. The only exception to this is whenever I hang out with my friends or family, who I appreciate having around me. Also, I do like doing those 3 things I mentioned before- playing video games, watching youtube videos, or making art- but only sometimes, as my enjoyment of them varies each day.

When I criticized the new policy, I was shocked to hear so many people defended the company. One person even compared customers to, I kid you not, gods. And this person meant it. 

Often, they said that this new system was not that bad becuase they hold or have held jobs that were similarly punishing or worse. Instead of becoming enraged over the fact that this unfairness is spread throughout their lives, they have become acclimated to the injustice. This shit is keeping me up at night.

803,I figured out why I'm so tired after work,"All day at work I'm thinking about all the fun things I could do when I get home. And every day I get home from work and do none of them. Why? Because I'm so god damn tired. 

And why am I so tired?

Because last night, when I got home from work at 7:30 at night, I wanted to do something, something creative. Cook a meal, play some music, write or read, anything. However I was too tired to do anything but sit on the couch and watch Netflix.

Now, most days at my job aren't very taxing. In fact, some days I spend most of the time sitting on my ass. Problem is, i was up until 3am last night watching Netflix, and had to get up at 5am to get to work by 7am. Sat there, occasionally performed some mundane task for ten hours, and began the hour and a half commute back home. Walking in the door just a little before 7pm I'm overwhelmed with exhaustion and, once again, sit my ass on the couch and watch Netflix. Maybe I play some Xbox, or watch a couple YouTube videos. But none of the fun things I wanted to do when I was at work. And of course this goes on until 1, 2, 3am again, since I feel like I haven't had any free time and need to get it now.... And the cycle continues. 

Get home from work, try to make up for the 14hrs I just spent there, stay up too late, tired AF the next day, so I get home after 14hrs and get nothing done, stay up too late, on and on and on and on. Then the weekend comes and I lay in bed all day and do nothing but sleep, because I slept a total of 8hrs over the course of the week. Then Monday comes, and I want to drive my car into a wall instead of go to work. 

On and on and on and on....

So what, you ask, is the secret to not being tired after work? Go to bed as soon as you get home.

824,My Way Out,"I think most of us have a goal, it's not entirely to not work at all, probably more to just dictate *when* they work. Like, to determine their salary based on how much they want to work at any given point; to set your own hours WITHOUT money dictating how much of your time is taken from you.  
  
So luckily I'm only 19, and have decided on my way out (assuming that I continue thinking the way I am currently).  
  
My neighbor is a self-employed plumber. Not gonna ramble here. He has 4 daughters in college, a new Escalade, a corvette, and paying for all his insurance, bills etc etc, with enough leftover that he can justify going to a diner every morning for breakfast. I've heard he makes somewhere around $275,000 a year  
  
I got a job in the trades about 7 months ago and am currently at $16/hr (which is awesome), and realize that there is work everywhere in this field. Enough to work for yourself. I don't want 275,000 a year. Fuck, I don't want 4 kids and brand new vehicles.  
  
Imagine after say, 10 years doing this work I currently do (I'll use my employment for free schooling and experience), I'll be good enough to do this on my own. I'll be 30. I could replace someone's outdoor unit and charge them 3,000 for it. That's one fucking day of work! Not even, that's a half day! I'll do their indoor handler and get another 3,000. Might take two days, and profit somewhere around 3,000-4,500? That's not unrealistic at all, if you know what I do for a living. I wouldn't mind at ALL doing that 3 times a month. Work 72 days a year and make probably 100 grand a year? 
  
I guess that's my way out. Put the hours in now, learn, be a good employee. When I know enough... bail tf out. I could work 4 days a month and pull in 7,000. then at that point, I have I guess 4 manditory days of work and if I can bid the jobs and feel like working more, I can do it (because I'll get bored I'm sure)",False,fg4jz1,GODSandSHITHEADS,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/fg4jz1/my_way_out/,1,1

862,desperate for change,"I'm barely hanging by a thread at this point. I've been unemployed for quite a few months now and it's ruining me. I took a break from work but I've realized there is no way out and my generalized anxiety hinders me in ways unimaginable. So far I've only been called for one interview and they haven't contacted me since. And this was a job I applied for experience in my chosen field but only pays $20-30 a day. I only found out about the pay on the day of the interview and knew there was no way I could accept an offer like that anyway. Is this what a college education gets you in America? 

It hurts to know that this is just the beginning since I'm still new to the workforce and have so much life ahead of me. I don't look forward to life the same way I used to before the academic and financial pressures I've endured throughout high school. I don't last longer at a job for more than 4 months at a time and it's starting to show on my resume. I want to die during moments like these. What is the point of all this suffering and toiling for a degree only to walk out of university unemployed and a husk of my former self.

I don't know which steps to take next, I've been working fast food and retail for so many years now and I'm dead tired of it all. I don't want to go back to that kinda life again...I was hoping things would improve after graduating from uni but it seems a degree only made things worse by setting the bar even higher for myself. 

I've always pushed for excellence in myself whether at school, uni, or the workplace but now I'm past the point of no return. I hate society with every fiber of my being sometimes, but I know everyone is just as much a victim as I am. And I think this is largely due to social alienation my whole life. I've never been tied to any community and grew apart from extended family. My childhood was traumatic and I still can't get over it. As a result, I've been struggling with severe depression and social anxiety since I was 15. It only adds to the weight upon my shoulders... and this is one of the main reasons why I can't stay in these jobs for too long. 

People fill me with dread and I cannot fathom an existence where I have to work a till and make small talk with people 8+ hours a day five days a week any longer than I already have endured. I know that's highly anti-social behavior and I've been confronted so many times for not wearing a plastered smile on my face at all times but it hurts to smile. It hurts to talk and to reach out for help when you're certain you don't deserve anything good in this life.

I wish I was more sociable and inviting and charismatic but I'm none of those things and never will be. What a wretched existence I've found myself in. But no use pitying myself, it's never going to get me anywhere. I just wish there was an alternative but no. For as long as we're alive in this world, capitalism will prevail as the dominant economic system around the world and it's truly disheartening.

I don't believe I should be voicing my opinions at all on here but I wanted to do something to end all this suffering, and no I don't mean suicide but direct action against all the big employers and corporations.

876,"Relatively new to the sub, my thoughts &amp; observations, etc.","After having been put through the mill by three previous employers and had to leave either by choice or by force because they either carried out immoral/illegal practices or allowed a toxic work environments to manifest, I have for the last 10 months relegated myself to caring for my immediate next-of-kin who both struggle with different disabilities while claiming the relevant welfare with respect to my caring commitments to cover my living expenses, and I kinda like it better this way - it's not without its drawbacks, but at least I'm not dealing with corporate bullshit on a daily basis. 

I eventually found myself gravitating to towards this sub because its ideals and what it stood for appeal strongly to me after being on the receiving end of various forms of corporate malice during my time in the workplace - including, but not limited to; being a victim of corporate surveillance prior to EU privacy laws (I'm in the UK for context), personal attacks, psychological abuse, being overworked, being underpaid, being undervalued, being undermined, and being underappreciated. 

On Monday morning, I had to go out of the house as I had some personal matters to attend to. As this was during 'rush hour', I could not help but sneer at all the worker ants/cockroaches/rats ensnared in this trap are in hurry to get to their to 9-5s, which most of them probably hate. All of these people who are so inured to the system need to have the wool pulled from over their eyes, but this is not going to be easy with the multiple levels of indoctrination that are in place to keep them in line, in check, and in compliance unquestioningly - including, but not limited to exposure to mass media and propaganda.

With regards to the ongoing Coronavirus outbreak, I'm hoping that it will be enough to cause substantial damage to the capitalist system (we've already seen stocks take a nosedive) and help shatter the illusion and idealism that society under a capitalism system is perfect and not without faults, along with all of the other lies we've been told (a rising tide lifts all boats, *trick*le-down economics, etc). Coronavirus also has the potential to be a double-edged sword for humanity itself - the downside is that people are going to die (the pro-capitalist boomers being the largest at-risk demographic), and no one with a sane mind is denying this inevitability. The upside is that humanity has the potential to come out the other side far stronger and better than before. Lastly, humanity is long overdue an outbreak to thin the herd.

From my perspective at least, the line between 80s soviet communism and capitalism is slowly beginning to blur. They exhibit disturbingly similar characteristics, with greedy elites at the top dictating the well-being and the lives of those less fortunate. HBO's Chernobyl goes in to detail regarding this, so one could argue that they are both as bad as each other - and either the way the game is rigged. Two sides of the same coin, with humanity's freedom or servitude hinging on either side of the coin, if you will.

I don't understand why modern day society is so frightened of the word *socialism*. Both the words society and socialism share the same etymology or root word (*For Andrew Vincent, ""\[t\]he word 'socialism' finds its root in the Latin sociare, which means to combine or to share. The related, more technical term in Roman and then medieval law was societas. This latter word could mean companionship and fellowship as well as the more legalistic idea of a consensual contract between freemen"".* \~ Wikipedia) How has this honestly not occurred to people sooner? My guess would be that it's owing to decades of indoctrination in the education system, and then being further dumbed down by mass media specifically catered to appeal to the lowest common denominator (looking directly at you with a death glare, Murdoch).",False,fgf8wz,darkmessenger84,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/fgf8wz/relatively_new_to_the_sub_my_thoughts/,0,1

My least favorite things about working in an office are:

\- Really poor indoor air quality. It is so stuffy and hard to breathe, it even makes it hard for me to think. I have to go to another floor in order to ""get some fresh air.""

\- Having to hear other people's conversations when I'm trying to concentrate (like giggling, non-work conversations, people on teleconference calls where they speak really loudly)

\- Being 'observed' for 8.5 hours. Every time someone walks past my cube, they look in to see if I'm there. It weirds me out and makes it hard for me to focus.

\- No natural light. 

\- Sharing same space with coworkers with questionable hygiene. 

\- Being in a confined space with people coughing and sneezing all day long for years on end.

\- Having to see the same people year after year, all day long. Sure, they're fine people, but I...don't need to see them that much. And I'm sure they feel the same way about me. It's weird, because I spend nearly all my time around them but they're not my ""friends"" or ""family.""

893,What to do if you're suicidal due to work?,"Sooo I've had mental health issues my whole life. And I've also worked nonstop my whole life. My parents were broke and uneducated and I had 3 other brothers. I'm not trying to get sympathy or something from people. I just want to rant and you guys make me feel not alone here. My mental health has been getting worse and worse and I am frequently suicidal now and all around in a horrible place. I've also had some really tragic life shit happen recently on top of it. The reason I'm posting this here is I just need a fucking break from working. 

It's not that I'm lazy. I'm an extremely passionate and driven person. All I want to do is help people when I work. I took a job at Goodwill for a while to see if I'd feel that way. Nope. Awful fucking company. It seems like in order to work in any of the areas I'd like to I should reasonably require training (I have strange interests, I'm leaning toward becoming a Buddhist Chaplain for hospitals/army). I can do incredibly emotionally taxing and difficult work and feel energized by it. When people go through rough stuff I know I can be there for them and could imagine myself doing it all day long. My point in sharing that is I know I can give the world something valuable, I'm just not there right now mentally financially or physically. I'm not lazy!

I have a new job working at a glorified call center for property management companies across the United States. It pays better than most around here. Full time, bonuses, benefits. I even work from home! The issue is that the job itself is fucking TERRIBLE. They only give you about 20 seconds between wrapping up a call and finishing the details of your ""guest card"" and it is back to fucking back 8 hours a day seven days a week. For me with my mental health problems it has been absolutely torturous. I have myself in worse condition than ever after a shift.

It’s also sad that I work for a sister company so I get to work alongside people making double what I do doing easier jobs, also the company my employer works for didn’t hire me when I moved here so now I’m working for that same company through another company. So I’ve been doing this for 5 years and am just stuck in life and at age 40 right now so trying to find a new “good” job is much more difficult.

I was married and had a house kids and car then my wife decided she liked another guy at work and wanted somthing new so she threw away 11 years of marriage which almost blindsided me.  Although her doing this and having kids is one of the main reasons I’m so stuck now.  I had to move back in with my parents because rent is way to high for me to pay especially when you add child support and car insurance. I still pay rent to my parents but it’s way smaller then if I rented elsewhere also I don’t need to worrry about utilities and don’t usually have to buy food.  

It just sucks that even working a normal job I can’t actually live and am terrified of the next decade as one of my parents just hit 70.

I don’t mind the posts about complaining about the 9-5 life because that’s also related

But now, almost every post that gets to the top is about having this hate and bitterness towards rich people. How is that related? On top of that, more people whine about how little money they make than talking about how to get away from work life. 

This sub isn’t even about being poor. People who make 150k+ also have the same feelings about work that a minimum wage worker does.

And worst of all, the people who complain about being poor will hold anyone accountable except for themselves. It’s ridiculous. No doubt there are a lot of inequalities in wealth and opportunity, but thinking that it’s impossible to move up in life is absurd. I see comments blaming the government for not teaching financial or family planning and that’s why people become poor. Seriously? The example they used is that someone leasing a car doesn’t know that 9 times out of 10 it’s a bad idea, but they weren’t taught interest rates. Seriously? We’re going to blame the government for something like that? Anyone can fucking learn about it online. Anyone old enough to buy or lease a car should know that. The information is not secret. But fuck holding ourselves accountable, it’s everyone’s fault but ours. 

The example they gave was that when the government reaches financial planning, people benefit. Well... yeah, the government could also install sprinklers on every single lawn in the country and grass would benefit. But does that mean if my grass dies then I should blame the government for not watering it for me? No. I could’ve just watered it myself.

I work with the most typical Boomer ever, who's retired but just works for something to do. I got into a conversation with him about how much I don't enjoy work and he said I might just be undisciplined and lazy. Like, I do more work than him on a typical day, but I'm lazy because I hate it? Anyway, I asked to have my hours cut to part time. Right now, it's just one extra day off a week, and I'm working on getting a business license so that I can pursue personal training, which is what I'm certified in. As soon as my store hires another part timer, I'm cutting my hours back to 3 days a week. By then my business set up will be out of the way and I might have a few clients. I also do henna tattoos and am planning on doing them at my local farmers market every weekend as soon as June rolls around. What I'm hoping is that I can save a good amount of money to get me through the winter months with the henna tats (I average $30 an hour on the days I have my booth open), and that I can build up a good base clientele to have personal training as my main source of income.

910,Can boring office jobs be better for your mental health?,"So I was always under the impression that I could never work in a boring desk job and had to do something creative that I love.

Well, now I’m 24 years old and I’ve done the creative jobs I so call “love” and was miserable in them all. On paper they sound amazing, but in practise they make me never want to work again. 

I’m at the point now where I think I’ve wasted all my time in college doing a degree and a masters just to find myself wanting a boring office job where I can run out the door at 5pm and not think of work.

I hate the thought of wasting 8 hours a day doing something boring and thought if I’m going to be spending 40 hours a week of my life doing something, it may as well be something that has meaning. 

BUT - if the jobs I think I want are affecting my mental health, is a boring desk job the solution? I like the idea of having good colleagues, decent working hours and no stress when it hits 5pm. I think as well there’s something good about being in a place where everyone claims they hate the job but in reality everyone knows it’s actually fine and a decent company to work for. (It’s like we’re all in this together kind of attitude lol) I hate when people pretend they love their job and you feel like the only one who hates it. 

I always see people on this sub saying that they hate their 9-5 desk jobs so much as they’re so boring, am I crazy for now wanting one?

911,What is your ideal life?,"I don't hate my job but I do hate my life. I'm living the dream of working remotely with no commute as well as a really great team and management. But I'm in crushing debt and I failed college twice. So now I'm doing 3 jobs while also studying for university for the 3rd time.

I'm just so absolutely crushed by this debt. Not only that, I've come to know that my parents have had some shit luck with money and my mom is terrible at financial planning so I'll have to spend my life paying for my parents retirement on top of my existing debt.

The only thing which keeps me from killing myself is spirituality and my friends. Life is not all terrible, but this absolute dogshit of a grind where we have to constantly keep working just to be alive is so cruel. So many can't even appreciate and enjoy life because of poverty and bad luck.

Which is why I fantasize about my ideal life. I want to live in harmony with nature, somewhere in the mountains with a small community of people. I want to work with my community to help us as a collective, be it farming or hunting or chopping wood or whatever. I want to go on a spiritual journey with my community and discover the wonderful nature of the universe. This kind of life is hard, I'm aware. Communities like this Don't have the conveniences and riches we do.

But I'm tired of this convenient and comfortable life. It's boring. It's mundane. There is no sense of adventure and no sense of community in large cities. I love art, music, culture, people among many things that makes me think life is worth living. I actively try and pursue these hobbies and forms of art and they help keep me sane.

917,Should I quit?,"Here is a short summary of my life right now. I am 27(F) still living with her parents finishing my Psychology degree (will be done next year where I would need to do an internship with another psychologist). I am currently working at a office job that makes me miserable and pays me minimum wage. I am lucky seeing as I only work from Monday to Thursday from 8 to 4 (with an hour lunch break), where a lot of my coworkers work the whole week until 5.

Here follows some of the problems of the job:

Paying minimum wage, while expecting maximum effort, with no prospects of promotion or increase of wages.

No benefits because we do not work 40 hours a week (going home early on Fridays).

Giving us less vacation days by forcing us to take them when the building is closed anyway in December.

Had no sanitary bins until today (03/03/2020).

Terrible management and cheap product because too stingy to use more money.

Bosses get enough money to send two children to university, while anyone else cannot live on their own and need to live with their parents.

I would like to quit my job seeing as I do not feel the mental strain it is placing on me is worth it. The work is boring and I am merely making other people very rich. However, seeing as I am still living with my parents their opinion is important seeing as I see them every day and it is never nice to live in a home where someone is disappointed in you. My mother is very much against the idea (keep in mind she is one of those people who works overtime with no compensation and is fine with it, where as I merely see a job as a way to not starve to death and would never do something like that without compensation. Finding another job will be very difficult seeing as I live in a country with a very high unemployment and I live in a small town that just does not have a lot of jobs. I believe that once I have my degree next year I should be able to get a job easier, and I cannot stay at my job anyway because I would not be able to take care of myself anyway, so finding another job is important.

I thought that working to make the world better would lead me to feel passionate about a job. All that it has done is make me feel cynical, disgusted by the rich, and completely burnt out.

Non-profits rely on your kindness to a cause so that they can give you lesser pay. They rely on your commitment to the mission so that they can overwork you, too.

Most donors at the top of the food chain donate for the tax break and the opportunity to get their name on something stupid. You don't have to work for them directly -- They own you.

Executive Directors are in the business of sales. Almost every ED I've encountered has been a snake that changes into a smarmy kiss ass as soon as a millionaire takes out their wallet.

With the way that Super Tuesday is turning out, I caution you if you're thinking about joining this industry to combat all the bullshit you see in the world. The only way to combat bullshit is by changing the national culture and political system. We're not there yet.  

This is the only plan I have left:
• Work for a for-profit company that offers standard hours and a medical care plan. Fuck whatever retirement package they offer, the world is burning.
• Keep a low profile, do what I'm told, leave on time.
• Quit buying shit I don't need to alleviate the pain of existence. Live within my means.
• Seek quality time with family and friends but balance it with alone time.
• Find a hobby that puts me in a state of flow.

924,Doing the simple time math on having a full time job and what it means for free time (unacceptable),"I work from 9-5. 

I wake up at 7 am to get ready and go for the commute to work.

I arrive home at 6 pm from my commute back from work.

I have finished preparing, eating and cleaning up after dinner at 7 pm.

Now I go to the gym from 8 pm till 9 pm and arrive back home at 9:30 pm.

In order to get enough sleep I need to be in bed by 11 pm if I want my 8 hours of sleep cause I'm getting up at 7 am.

So someone who works a full time job with a reasonably short commute and a single gym routine for health and well being outside the gym - essentially ends up with a maximum of an hour and a half of free time during the day on a typical work week.

Now I know that SOME people genuinely enjoy their work and some find fulfillment and subjective meaning in it and they like it and feel pride in it etc. but at the end of the day whether that is 50 percent of the adult human population or 5 percent of the population is ultimately very hard to ever prove - because there are people who indeed CLAIM to 'love their job' but to some extent that is a coping mechanism in many cases I would think. 

Better to tell yourself and others that you love/like your job than to admit that you are forced to doing something that you honestly find rather unpleasant for the majority of your waking hours  in life and the only alternative is starvation on the street - therefore many likely convince others and themselves that they love or at least somewhat like their jobs, despite it perhaps not being completely true.

I get that things aren't black and white, life is full of gray area and many nuances. Back before the existence of money and agriculture and civilization and division of labor etc. humans like other animals had to roam around the wild to find food - and the failure to do so, or not being succesful in doing so meant starvation and death. So it's not ONLY due to money and society and ""the evil rich men who control everything"" or whatever cliche. It's also just... Biological life that quite fundamentally is a ruthless asshole. 

But to me - ever since I was 10 years old and gradually started getting a sense of how the world worked for adults I was baffled about the whole forced labor for income paradigm where your right to life, shelter and food came down to earning money through submission to work. It always depressed me and horrified me. 

Later in my teens I got into The Venus Project and The Zeitgeist Movement and philosophers like Alan Watts and many others talking about automating the vast majority of human labor and entirely doing away with this arbitrary man made invention called 'Money'. They would talk about how through technology and rational scientific application of sane solutions to poverty and food production and distribution - overcoming many of these fundamental problems of scarcity, competition and human misery and drudgery would be entirely possible from a strictly technical point of view, even decades ago.

Here I am turning 30 soon and still utterly and completely horrified and sad and angry and depressed with how human society works in terms of money and jobs and all the insincerity, pretense, manipulation, exploitation and fundamental idiocy surrounding this elaborate fiction of money and the made up economy based on nonsensicality. 

Most of us are going places we don't want to go to, to do things we don't want to do, for many hours a day, for reasons we don't believe in, with people we don't want to be around..... All to be allowed to be alive. 

That is to say - we do shit we hate in order for us to go on..... doing things we hate! Such is life.

I think it to be rational and sane and valid and reasonable to want to commit suicide considering this laughably insane and atrocious state of affairs that many view as normality. 

And I have thought like this for 2 decades now, I fundamentally despise that we HAVE to work to be allowed to be alive and I do NOT think that ""it has to be that way - you need to sell phone subscriptions or sell television sets in exchange for being allowed to eat"" most actual modern labor is NOT rational or sane or pragmatically necessary or overall a positive contribution to life. 

Is it possible from a technical point of view to use the best of science and technology to automate the vast majority of  &gt;&gt;necessary&lt;&lt;  labor and set humanity free to live our finite lives as we please without being forced to work our short lives away in exchange for a pay check? 

And is it possible to clothe, house, feed, educate and provide medical care etc. for literally every single human being on planet earth through mostly technical automated means in 2020 if that was indeed the explicit clear aim of modern civilization? 

If not, then just get back to work or starve I guess, and all you people who claim to love your jobs: Let me see you do it full time for a few years consistently in the complete absence of junk food, cigarettes, alcohol, coffee etc. to numb your authentic feelings of misery and despair.",False,fbyu85,Waja_wurr90,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/fbyu85/doing_the_simple_time_math_on_having_a_full_time/,24,1

3. There’s a reward for who generates the most sales, I made the most and he gave it to someone else

4. Finally and most importantly, a paycheck from him bounced and he blamed it on my bank, which is absurd.

It is for all these reasons I quit my job today. I think if I’m going to work minimum wage I can find a place that respects their employees &amp; can actually produce a paycheck.

941,Corrupt Corowkers,"I work in tech support. Its been over a year now and I still don't know what I am doing or how to solve the calls by myself. I am the only one in my office who knows the product. Not even my manager knows it. I was appointed a 'senior' tech support rep to help me when I first started. They were supposed to look over my tickets each day and do callbacks and help me. They looked over my tickets for one day and I never heard from them again. When I message them they often take hours to answer me and when I ask them to do callsbacks they straight up ignore me.

Now I have never learned how to do the job all of the way for myself and nobody answers me when I ask questions. When customers call in some of the seniors 'forget' to make tickets for them so I am stuck helping when they call back in pissed. The seniors have access to the phone queues so they can take themselves out of certain queues when they don't feel like getting any çalls. (I don't have any proof of this yet but I am sure they are doing it) 

They also are able to delete messages between them and I so I can't take them to management. I learned this the hard way and I had to start screenshotting everything. I 'caught' one of them lying before and screenshotted it and put it in one of the tickets when a customer was mad at me just to cover my ass so it wasn't my fault. But they must have only got a slap on the wrist or something and since then they have been deleting tons of our past conversations. So now I am screenshotting everything immediately

Half of our team is seniors and they are all so corrupt. But they are immune and can get away with this shit because they have been there so long (8-15) years. This is my first job out of college, I am super suicidal, and this job has made me lose faith in humanity. I can see why people lose their shit and just start shooting up workplaces. Wtf is wrong with this world.

I know we aren't supposed to get mad at our fellow coworkers but when they underhandedly lie, delete conversations, and put shit on me to make me look bad. I am going to get pissed.

""Why didn't you ask me?"" ""You should have known. It's your fault"". It was also my fault when the secretaries made a mistake.  Suddenly he took all my tasks away and then complained I did nothing. Belittled me in front of co-workers about how slow I was (was slowed down due to senior members of staff needing to talk to me). Eventually he made me sit directly in front of him to supervise me. I left and I'd like to say never looked back but actually I cannot find closure. I think of this man all day - what was up with him? Why did he do that to me? He crushed me slowly.

Every single morning I turn my car over at 7:53am. I work less than four minutes from work with traffic. I usually clock in between 7:58 and 7:59:30 at the absolute latest. I go home for my hour lunch. The second I press the button to clock out for lunch I set a 50 minute timer on my phone. When that timer goes over I dawdle for a few minutes and then head back. Every single day I clock back in from lunch between 58 and 59 minutes after I clocked out. At my shift end time, I clock out no later than 5:02. I have only clocked out after 5:02 one time in the last month since I accepted this position. That’s a MAX total of 6 minutes per day, 30 minutes per week, 60 minutes per pay period. At my pay grade that’s two fucking dollars a day. Is $20 going to cripple a soulless corporation? Is that $20 going to impact a millions these land sharks make every single month by charging over 12,000 people who are underpaid and spending at least half of their monthly income for bullshit hole-in-the-wall dumps worth $400/month (but are actually $1,350) at the very most?

I'm nearly 30 years old but have no (formal) job experience since I come from a complicated family situation and I've been struggling with depression and ADHD all my life. I tried to go through uni until recently, when I finally had to quit because I couldn't make it work in my circumstances and it was only worsening my mental health. Then I met my current partner, and came from a small rural town to the biggest city in my country that's (supposedly) brimming with jobs, to live with him and away from my toxic family hoping to find whatever job I could do and live in peace. Of course that's turning out to not be possible for me either. It's already been a year since I'm here, living off what little savings I had till now because I couldn't find a single fucking part-time job where they'd hire a career-less 30 year old. Only fast food and that only lasted me a month since ""I wasn't fast enough in the kitchen"". I'm functional, capable of physical work and pretty sociable despite my illness, I don't even talk about my mental health when applying because I know that's an instant reject, but an empty resume at my age is an instant reject anyway. What I'm supposed to do, then? Today I told my partner that this month's rent is all I have left after a year. A whole fucking year trying. He broke down crying, said he doesn't want me to leave. I don't want to leave either since I don't really know where I would have it better. It broke my heart. And it isn't even my fault, is it? I feel so powerless. I'm a somewhat skilled artist and do commissioned work here and there but that doesn't give me enough to live either. I dream of a life in which it does. I look for part-time jobs because I know full-time will absolutely obliterate my mental health like uni did, but people react to it like I'm being picky and not willing to ""make real effort"".

I don’t think this is how far society can advance, tons of people having to suffer to make someone rich who doesn’t care for his employees unless they’re up in the ladder right with them, where employees are thrown to side and seen as being disposable if you don’t want to work through hell for little to no pay. 

That said, I have noticed an alarming amount of people who are slipping into this ideal of extreme socialism or even communism and as great as that would be, it would only bring about a disaster. These ideas are absolutely amazing, great theories that can save so many peoples lives and better humanity as a whole. However, they are just that. Ideas and theories that sound great, but time and time again when they’ve been put to the test, it only creates even more suffering than what we currently have now with capitalism. Such ideas will only work in an ideal society and sadly, we are very far from that world. 

Reality is cruel and there will always be someone seeking power for themselves and not for anyone else. Although we all share a common interest/goal, we need to be a little more realistic and not leap over boundaries which we cannot reach to hope. Please try to remember that the step to a better society starts slowly, gradually growing. an instant jump from capitalism to communism or a similar ideal could lead to disaster and ruin economy’s. I guess what I want to say is that some people here are seeming to become very extreme in their beliefs and the sub as a whole looks as if it is continuing to grow in that direction. 

We can do better than what we are at now. I agree the amount of work we do is absurd, they are people literally dying of exhaustion and being overworked. But we mustn’t abolish what we worked for and learn to keep our minds levelheaded and clear.

They've hurt me, they've hurt my family. They've allowed teenagers to take pictures of my body parts (that were well covered up by, you know, proper clothing. I just had the audacity to exist and be standing I guess) without consequence. I've been verbally abused and harassed. I've been used and taken for granted. Part of this is me being stupid enough to believe I was working for some greater good but I'm not that stupid anymore. 

I had reached the point where it was either leave and make drastic changes or commit suicide. My psychologist diagnosed me with CPTSD based on a number of events surrounding and related to my place of work. My union has been absolutely useless in this regard and I certainly can't afford a lawyer or anything, so the only way I can really make them ""pay"" for a lifelong injury like this is to leave them in the lurch, which I am absolutely going to do. The timing will be perfect.

I figured if I was willing to die, I should be willing to make a big change (which is still kind of scary) and at least see if it helps make life more bearable. I mean, suicide is always there, and maybe I'll be happier 600 miles away working at retail or a pet store rather than a cog in a broken bureaucratic system. Stranger things have happened. 

I'm not even going to give them the satisfaction of knowing how they broke me. I'm just going to submit a standard 2 weeks notice and disappear, so I'm going to write what I really want to say: 

Fuck all of you. None of you give a shit about anyone but yourselves. You're all hypocritical liars who have treated me like shit for years just because I'm different. I'm sure I'm going to hell but you'll be there too. Nobody deserves the curse of working here, which is why you are already scraping the bottom of the barrel to try to fill positions in this shithole.

984,"As a Marxist (Neo-Trotskyite), journeyman Silicon Valley technologist and intentional empath that was raised in a fundamentalist Christian cult, the following content constitutes my ideas as to what compels work and the suffering of work in our lives . (Part 1 - Religion)","1. Religion
  A. [Prosperity Theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperity_theology)
     i. Prosperity theology is a tract of evangelical Christianity spread by people like Pat Robinson and Joel Osteen that says that life (God) will reward those (in a [deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism) way) that work sufficiently hard or are sufficiently ""good"" in such a way that they will not suffer economic disenfranchisement.
     ii.) I find that this paradigm, the actual effective reality of individuals toiling under the dynamic, is most aptly summed up in the implications raised by the words (""arbeit macht frei"")[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbeit_macht_frei]. Pastors operating under this doctrine actually have the gall to go to communities where (in my specific case) the average income was $17k/yr and tell individuals living in an environment of innate socioeconomic disenfranchisement and irrelevance that the reason they are poor is because they drink and fornicate and do not love God enough. Regardless of your individual beliefs (which I do not seek to take from you and actually just hope enable you to be a kinder and happier person), this is a cruelty that we ignore out of what I think is kindness. Criticizing and attacking religion is in many ways an attack on the spirit of the poor and I am sensitive to that. However, the fact that this is the case is something intentioned by the parties that benefit from the dynamic existing at all. This being the Republican party, the vague shapeless face of the anti-intellectualism movement (alternative medicine, antivax, flat earth, the cult of memes that attacks the very definition of what a fact is that can most be most simply qualified as existing in abundance around Donald Trump, the Republican Party's rejection of science at any point of convenience), and corporations that actively prey on the innate vulnerability of the working class for labor.
     iii.) God existing at all forces a dynamic where we apply intent and dignity to the phenomenology of poverty. This is used to ensure the preservation of a underclass that can be the fuel for the comfort of the ruling class. I don't mean to make all of these posts just be an endless allusion to scifi and history, but this dynamic is most fully explored in ('Brave New World')[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World] with its (epsilon's)[https://study.com/academy/lesson/epsilon-in-brave-new-world.html]. This slave class creates the basement of experience that acts as reinforcement of the value of the pleasure experienced by the other classes. If you were to poll the poorest people in this country, the bulk of them would tell you that they believe in god. It's funny how piety, the hope of salvation, is only so often seen in the poor. I'll talk about this more in a future segment of this series, but I am very confident in stating that the bulk of us are oppressed because we feel bad at some level for just wanting to do what we want with our only shot at existing. Or at least that is why I am learning programming so as to have as not miserable a job as possible and reject the capitalist institution at every opportunity. 

  B. Death Apologia 
    i. Death apologia can most easily be summed up as any formal defense of death as a necessary component of life. As someone that worked at a (Y Combinator)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator] biotech startup (albeit only as a fundraiser) for four years and who also identifies as a (transhumanist)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism], I quite happily reject the necessity of death. It might necessitate us changing the way/frequency that people reproduce (and doing so might require a greater degree of democracy and agency afforded to the individual we have now), the way that we use resources, and a renegotiation of economic systems, but reality is such that we're well on our way to solving the mechanisms of death and halting the syndrome of it in most humans. 
    ii. We might (re: probably) not see it in our lifetime, but the (technological singularity)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity] is coming. Whether it be (artificial intelligence)[https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/ai-automation-and-the-future-of-work-ten-things-to-solve-for#part2] or (synthetic biology)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_biology], we are nearing the end of material and energy scarcity (which I am going to cover in a future installment of this series) and must begin to prepare for it now. Capitalism is such that we *will* see arguments calling for the intrinsic necessity of scarcity. Without scarcity, what will the wealthy judge their fortunes by? 
    iii. To invoke a personal story as evidence of this dynamic, I would like to point out that my pastor grandmother has been waiting to die since she was about fifty years old. She fundamentally believes that life in the now, what we and most rationalist thinkers would call her one shot at existing at all, is all window dressing for an eternity spent in worship at the feet of some highly fetishized god. She has not savored one moment of her life without feeling sorry for not appreciating the hereafter enough. It's one of the most tragic things I've ever encountered. As I write this, I cannot think to call it anything other than eldritch or an aberration. For no reason other than her class and the region that she was born into, she has effectively wasted her one shot at existing wishing for the hereafter. Please empathize with the fact that this is a delusion and something that she would have been much better for to be cured of years ago. As it stands, the symbiote has become the host and vice versa. She is mostly religion at this point, her sanity sinking into a stew of delusions that she will never emerge from. Even as I stress constantly the necessity of freedom of religion as a consequence of the pursuit of liberty I recoil from the heinous effect of it in the individual. We talk with horror as to the effects of meth, but ignore the effect of nonsensical faith in the unknown. If I am wrong, I'll see you all in hell. However, if I am right as I think I am, I don't even get that. We stop existing the second we're dead and warm and I think it enriches the experience of life in general to speak of it so freely. 

To cap this off: It is important that we start to examine the institutions that oppress our most vulnerable as these are the institutions that are going to rebel against the destruction of work for everyone in the wake of the decline of scarcity. This being something that I am going to cover in the next few days, I'm going to leave you off with a couple of posits. 

Do you gain peace by embracing this life as your one shot? If not, does that scare you?

2.Never “go the extra mile” or put in “extra hours” without demanding fair compensation.  
 

3.Always make it appear that you are going the extra mile, especially when you are not.  
 

4.Never participate in “mandatory fun” like  company picnics, softball leagues, etc. — especially on your own time! —  unless you would genuinely enjoy the activity.  
 

5.Never report a shoplifter or anyone who  is fleecing the company unless not doing so would actively endanger your  wellbeing or the wellbeing of a fellow worker.  
 

6.Conceal the mistakes and transgressions  of coworkers whenever possible, unless their mistakes are actively  hurting you or other workers.  
 

7A.Do not concern yourself with anything  that is hindering the profits of the company. You aren’t being fairly  paid, so it’s literally none of your business.  
 

7B. If your employer is truly horrible,  it’s okay to do direct acts of sabotage, slowdowns, and other such acts  of resistance against them! Just be extremely careful and thoughtful  about how you go about it so as not to endanger or harm yourself or  coworkers.  
 

8.If customers are working class, treat  them with dignity and respect and put their needs before the needs of  the company. Give them good service, help them find discounts and good  deals, or simply be honest with them if they are getting a bad deal.  
 

9.If customers are of the capitalist class,  never go out of your way to serve them. They may see you as a mere  servant, but you must never see yourself that way. If you make  commission on sales, then squeeze as much as you can from them!  
 

10. Always steal office supplies.

a great deal of time away from her work area?

1034,I don`t know what to do,"Hi,  
I\`m brazilian (sorry for the grammar) and wanted to get this off my chest...

I live near the biggest city of my country (São Paulo) but my family is poor and mostly uneducated. Work is the condition of surviving, you know? My grandparetns are 80+ years old and still work (grandmother sells chocolate on the streets and grandfather is a construction worker). They live with us.  
My parents are municipal teachers and i\`m lucky to have a good education.

Sorry for the huge intro, but here\`s the thing:  
I want to be a photographer. I took online courses, read a lot on the local library, bought a camera 4 years ago and just fell in love.

I\`m 23 now and the last 2 years have been rough. I was depressed, could\`t leave my bed, work, hang out or anything... you know, the whole package. Got hospitalized and since this event i\`m getting better.  
But the thing is I can\`t live wanting so bad to be a photographer and having to dedicate myself to a shitty job. This makes me feel bad and useless. Trust me, I just can\`t. I have ideas, goals but can\`t do anything because my head is so full of problems and worries from money making.

&amp;#x200B;

So I came to conclusion,  
I need to decide... to take the plunge and accept a miserable life as a artist or to abaddon my goals as a non-commercial photographer.  
And I don\`t know what to do.  
i\`m scared of both possible outcomes.

""Dependence on the object of desire 'money' is the bedrock of employees' enlistment, the knowledged purpose of all work contracts, and the backdrop of menace known to the employee as much as to the employer. ""he setting-in-motin of employed bodies 'in the service of...' takes its energy from the fixation of the conatus-desire on the money object, of which capitalist structures have established the emplover as the sole provider. If the primary meaning of domination consists in one agent's having to pass through another to access the object of desire, then evidently the employment relation is a relation of domination. But, first, the intensity of domination is directly proportional to the intensity of the desire of the dominated over which the dominator has control. And second, once primitive accumulation created the structural conditions for radical material heteronomy - which all the subsequent evolution of capitalism seeks to further deepen money accedes to the top of the hierarchy of objects of desire-interest; it is the one object on which the pursuit of all other desires depends including non-material ones. ""The first premise of all human existence and, therefore, of all history, [is) the premise, namely, that men must be in a position to live in order to be able to ""make history"" But life involves before everything else eating and drinking, a habitation, clothing and many other things.""

At first I loved telling people I was a finance trainee but it was a seriously boring job, Where most of what I was doing was bullshit that would only help the rich exploit more people. It's a weird dynamic to see how companies fuck people over while also working for a company.

So I guess people here were right. She never intended to take me on full time and was just sending me on an impossible tasks so I could fail and prove her right.

2nd is that I really hate wageslaving. You're not supposed to love your job but at least demonstrate a slight interest in it or you won't go far. I realized no matter how I tried, deep down I hated all these bullshit processes and procedures and knew that this was an example of bullshit jobs.

My Q4 goals? Pay down all of this medical debt. Find a way to better afford my cost of living. Keep my father in law alive for a few more years so he can enjoy his time left with family. Find ways to still feel like a human being, and be a good husband and friend to my wife.

The actual goals I fucking care about in life are being eroded away by work. I dont give a fuck if my closed call percentage was higher than last year, or if I finished a bunch of extra projects that I dont get paid more for.

But I cant say any of this. If the people I worked under heard my truth escape my brain theyd look down on me even more. I'd have even less opportunities to move up. I'm already paid a decent amount, but it's still not enough to stem the anxiety. Its not enough to help me sleep at night. 

I want to be free to wander. To create. To explore. The only thing keeping me from jumping in traffic, or living life as a wandering vagabond is my wife.  I dont blame her for any of this. It's not her fault I was born a slave to an open air prison.

I could write endlessly about how bad it was, but take my word for it, my old job was everything this sub loathes. So after quitting, I finally found a job at a really cool tech company. They touted a very progressive work culture, pay was good, all that shit. Get this, they had me install a mandatory program on my computer that tracks time, takes webcam shots of me all throughout the day, takes screenshots of my computer activity, rates my keystrokes and mouse movement, and that information is used in my monthly performance reviews which determine pay raises and everything. The worst part is I can't afford to quit, and as we all know it is SO hard to find a decent job. I should have known this job was too good to be true. I'm now stuck in an equally bad prison as the one before. The company morale is terrible also. Just think about it for a moment, a few minutes go by, and in that time a webcam picture is taken, multiple screenshots are taken, and you have to make sure you are typing and clicking. It's terrible. Also, I haven't even mentioned the worst part yet! They basically created a work around for the overtime law. So, a really intriguing part of this job was that it was salary. Well, with this program, you also have to clock in and out and the screenshots and stuff only happen when you're clocked in. If you need to get up to go to the bathroom you have to clock out or it will notice your inactivity and deduct 15 minutes as a penalty. If you exceed the two 10 minute allotted breaks for the day, your paycheck gets deducted however many minutes you ""missed"". So for 7 hours and 40 minutes I have to be completely alert or my salary turns into hourly.

1076,I want a raise,"Over the past few months my job has been shit. I work in the business office and answer phones all day and help clients schedule appointments, etc. In December a new person started and she has not been a good worker (side note: she is friends with the boss.) She rarely shows up and never communicates when she will be late or when she can't come in. Including myself, there are three other people on my team who do the same work. We are all burnt out. We have to cover her shifts constantly and work 12 hour days when she doesn't show up. Every day is basically a waiting game to see if we get the ""privilege"" to work either 8 or 12 hours. She would have been fired the last time she did not show with no communication, but she claimed it was due to a mental health disability so she did not get fired. I kind of like my job, but I really like my team (excluding the girl who started in December), so I don't want to leave and find other work. 

I make the bare minimum and I struggle to pay my mortgage and bills. Since I have been working more lately and showing my team and manager that I am consistent and dependable, I deserve a raise.

1077,"""Just get a better job"" is a lie-- not even NASA was good enough","Its not you. Its the system. There is no skill or worth. No rhyme or reason. Only luck and who you know, or dare I say... who you blow. Through out my 20s I've learned that only people who lie and cheat and are generally horrible ""make it"".

I was told so many times by older friends that I had to pull myself up to better myself. I fell for it in a lot of ways. At the time I was in borderline poverty. My family helped with a lot of our bills. Food stamps, stripping to make ends meet cause nowhere would hire me, working housekeeping and even running a kiddie train at a dead mall (was a blow to my self worth since I just graduated college).

So I did it. Despite dealing with a life changing disease, I went back to school for aerospace to become a technician. I even got an internship working at the space center. I thought that ""I did it"", whatever that meant. Went from the confused and depressed and not-wanting-to-do-this stripper to legit putting my hand on a god dang rocket booster (it was an inert test piece, but still)

Its not me. Its not my fault the company I'm with totally low balled me with $18 an hour which still isnt enough to afford life alone... the kicker is I even work often 6 days a week (they really want us to do 7 but I've managed to dance around that). I didnt sign up for health insurance wither because I need every penny and didnt start putting anything into 401k until 6 months in. 
 
You could be a literal damn rocket scientist but still not make enough money and be told ""go better yourself"". Its a freaking scam.

It doesnt really get better. It can and it does... what I am doing now is still a far cry and more comfortable than stripping (granted strippers are making way more freakin money than me) or say like a retail or fast food job from hell... but it never truly gets better.

I will never be secure or safe in a job due to my illness. I'm nearing 30 and my family still has to help me with bills. No matter how fancy the job, its still dangled like a carrot everyday and threatened. You are still replaceable. 

Rent and home prices are unobtainable. HUNDREDS of people are applying to every single job that's posted, both aerospace and nonaerospace. Even desk jobs that pay nothing ($10-15 an hour) have hundreds of applicants.

 You need at least 3 different resumes that all lie to pray one of them aligns with the job you're applying for. Because if I use my aerospace resume for somewhere else which I have been doing, you are ""way too smart"", employers wonder wtf are you doing and why are are you applying here... hard pass. Next. 

You could work on one of the world's most seemingly important projects and still deemed as not worthwhile. 

I've seen people lie about their products, use people, lie about having degrees/make up degrees, get raises after stealing...

If the most important internet system is going up into space and I'm handling equipment worth millions of dollars, arent I worth more than $18 an hour? We all look down on teachers, housekeepers/cleaners, food store employees, fast food workers and tell them to ""go better themselves"", meanwhile we offer to pay them next to nothing. So now they go to school for possibly hundreds or thousands in debt to scrape up a few measily more bucks at a higher skilled job that still won't be able to help you pay for basic bills/necessities? 
ITS A SCAM. 

What is the point. 

Its difficult for me to save. My bank account is always hovering at the same amount. I'm literally fucking stuck. Now I've been thinking about going back to school again for a BA because I've heard/know that SOME technical writers make $30-50 an hour but... its reminding me of every single time I went back to school thinking I would come out better on the other side and not be in poverty and be able to pay all of my bills, right?

Right...?

1093,Quitting the job I just started,"So a couple of weeks ago I was hired to be a cashier at a large retailer and these have truly been the most miserable weeks of my life thus far.

I had intended for this to just be a small gig to make a little spending money while I finish school, but the demands of this job have left me with very little time and energy for my studies. I applied for it thinking it was going to be a part-time role since it was listed as such, but the turnover rate is so high for new hires here and the store's been so criminally understaffed that I have been scheduled for full-time hours these past weeks and for the upcoming weeks. I honestly wish I had quit during the first week along with the half the others in my training batch, but as this was my first job I was scared of this shit coming back to bite me if ever I needed another job in the future, so I decided to tough it out for just a month and submit my two weeks' then.  

I really don't think I can stand working here for that much longer though. Customer service is the shittiest and most exhausting acting gig out there. I hate the expectation that I have to smile and remain friendly with people that are being rude as fuck to me often for things that are outside of my control. Granted, I'm a lot slower to ring people up because this is my first time doing this sort of thing. But people getting pissed at me over store policy, the prices of their items, their year-old coupons not working, their card getting declined, etc? Holy fuck I did not think it were possible for me to hate entitled middle-aged/old people any more than I did prior to starting this job. I really don't get paid enough to put up with this shit. There are so many other things I have to rant about but I really don't want this post to get too long.

 My grades have already slipped significantly because the hours are so long and the work is so mind-numbing that I'm just too fucking exhausted both physically and mentally to do anything once I come home after a shift. The only times I really have the will to do anything are during my two (split) days off, wherein I spend the entire day just catching up to school, running errands, and fulfilling miscellaneous other responsibilities outside of work, so I really can't even consider those ""days off"" per se. I just hate that I've been pretty much forced to prioritize this job over my education, and I don't even *need* it because I still live with my parents and they've been kind enough to cover the costs of my needs. Again, I just wanted the job so that I could have some spending money for going out with friends and other frivolous shit I don't want my parents to have to pay for. I no longer have the time to go out and the money feels so pyrrhic that I don't even want to spend it anymore so what even is the point now.

I feel so drained and also am getting very anxious about my grades getting worse. I already have my two weeks' notice written up and I had originally intended to submit it a couple days ago. Honestly I kind of want to just say fuck the two weeks and quit immediately without notice, but I don't want my coworkers to have to suffer for it, especially with the store being as consistently understaffed as it is. 

The thing is though is that there was a problem with my direct deposit and I still haven't gotten paid for this last pay period. I'm trying to work with one of my managers to resolve it and I feel like it would be awkward to submit my notice before that happens. Hopefully it gets resolved today because I really don't want to put it off any longer. The mere thought of giving any more of my time to this company is genuinely making me want to kill myself. If this gets drawn out any longer would it be fine to just submit a one week notice?",False,fde6wa,aleat0ire,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/fde6wa/quitting_the_job_i_just_started/,6,1
