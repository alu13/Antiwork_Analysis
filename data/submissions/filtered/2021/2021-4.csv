1,Employers are wannabe slave-holders,is an employer  why shouldn't   be able to hire tens for free   that the fuck else are they going to do during the summer months   he hiring them for free  and maybe me receiving a spend from the government for doing so  means that   am keeping tens off the street  keeps the crime rate down and prevents drug addition in the future   luck this shit  these kiss are also getting experience   am fucking education them out of of pocket  y v yes    was fined today for not paying my staff a wage  and   am fucking passed   is    note m51 it share ,n1fl4h
2,Am I wrong?,am i wrong for wanting a more fair work life balance  am i wrong for wanting to contribute to society only if i get treated fairly in the process and get paid enough money to pay my bills  am i wrong for not wanting to live in stress my whole goddamn life working my bones to the grave while not enjoying my life because it's all consumed by work  am i wrong for fearing that my entire life will be revolved around trying to compete in this rat race just to literally have basic human needs such as shelter  food  water etc    am i wrong for thinking that jobs need to be kinder and more empathetic to employees who work minimum wage  am i wrong for wanting people to live stress-free and happy  am i wrong for thinking that people deserve to get paid enough to pay their bills   why the actual fuck does any of this need to be a debate  no wonder why depression and suicide rates are going up  people telling me that i am wrong for questioning the system that we're dealt  i am willing to work  i am willing to contribute to society  as long as we're all treated equally and fairly   the thing is  i'd be willing to meet halfway with the people who disagree with me  this world does need workers  but jesus christ stop twisting everything i say out of context  it's okay to work as long as the  work  isn't the only thing we have to literally survive on the planet    let's say that someone loses their job  or your business fails  leaving you bankrupt and homeless  so now you have no shelter  food or water  so what the fuck  you did everything right but now you have nothing and could possibly starve to death    or let's say someone with mental illness is struggling and can't keep a job  so now that person has the stress of needing to keep a job and maintain a positive mindset through it or else they'd lose it  which leads them to instability    this is what i'm talking about   i just want some changes to the work system  we shouldn't have to work to live  anything else would literally be society saying  oh you're not doing this  ok you die then  but no people always twist what i say and be like  you're entitled and lazy  or some crap  i even try to be respectful but some people on here just insult me or call me a baby or something  i am done  i just needed to say this ,n1hoap
3,Lost confidence,so it's become pretty clear that i've lost confidence in myself  i have stopped taking risks and it's making it difficult for me to get out of my current job  my employer is toxic and i've let it drag me down  unfortunately  i guess acknowledging that is a positive step  but are there therapists or something that can help with that  like wendy rhoades in billions kind of  idk  i just think i need help getting my confidence back,n1uh6o
4,I don't get antiwork,you're not forced to work for someone else your entire life  you have the option of becoming your own boss  starting your own business etc  yeah 99  of us aren't born into wealth like a lot of rich people  but that doesn't mean we can't work a blue collar job and eventually transition into becoming our own bosses if we're financially literate    if you make the decision to work for someone else your entire life  that's your mistake    i don't know what you guys want  no work  then what  you get to live for free ,n1udwu
5,Work ethics have created a toxic culture., the customer is always right  is the entire  or at least the biggest  reason why  karens  exist  customers treat employees like shit because business owners and managers encourage it  this puffs up their egos  and bit by bit  poisons the fabric of society  respect is a two-way street  rude pieces of shit aren t worth doing business with ,n1m9br
6,Why don't place put their actual WAGE on the ad?,local retirement home is hiring and took out a full half page add on the front   boasts a  new competitive hourly starting wage but the hourly wage is nowhere on the ad   if the wage is missing  that tells me the pay is shit   would a landlord advertise an apartment and not put the rent amount  of course not ,n1enz7
7,Had the worst interview of my life,i am currently looking for a career change so i've been applying to jobs online  a few days ago  i got a linkedin request from the ceo of a marketing company to interview via zoom  when i was applying for this position i was not sure if i was qualified enough  but i figured i'd throw my hat in the ring anyways   the interview starts off pretty normal  he asks me to share a little about myself  i share that i have prior experience in one industry but am looking to transition those skills into a new field  he then said that they may be able to offer me an internship  not what i applied for  but then backpedaled and said it wasn't going to work out  i've never had anything like this happen  it was almost as though they didn't even look at my resume before wasting both of our times and arranging an interview  this entire system is so fucked  interviewing for jobs makes me feel fucking pathetic anymore ,n19wo7
8,Cynicism,i see a lot of cynicism on this sub along the lines of  everything is hopeless   i'm shitbagged and jaded  i'm just to here to complain etc   to be succinct  i disagree with the negativity   between this sub  anti-capitalism  late stage capitalism  bernie sanders warren yang supporters  artists and people who just hate work but don't know how to accurately describe there feelings yet  lol  there are many people in the world who think like we do   many people who like many on this sub dream of a day when life can be about more than just  productivity   side rant  fuck lorne michaels for booking elon musk for this week   and kudos to aidy bryant for the shade   comedy is my favorite form of art and just because i like saying it fuck elon musk   anyway  keep ya heads up kings and queens  all is not hopeless  all is not lost  continue to find meaningful work  continue to volunteer  continue to try to find enjoyment out of life   i was still pretty young in 2016 but i think of this as being the first year in recent memory progressive politics became mainstream thanks to bernie sanders  my hero  so take the fact that progressive policies have become more and more mainstream as another positive ,n1i7fr

12,"What is the idea of ""antiwork""?",honest question  how does antiwork work  im just confused what people want who are  antiwork  i'm assuming that it doesn't mean that people do no work because we still need things  is it against current state of employment  or is it that they want to implement a new system to produce goods  i would appreciate an explanation  thanks ,n1fx33
13,"For each soldier deployed to an illegal offensive war (Afghanistan, Vietnam, Iraq) we need to deploy the son of a family that earns 200k+ a year to fight boots on the ground",it seems to me that the military industrial complex has for far too long taken advantage of the fact that they can lure poor kids for a meager salary and the hope of a college tuition and send them to die in some unforgiving desert for financial incentive  it seems to me that it s more than reasonable that for each soldier sent  the other must be the son of a rich person who goes to war boots on the ground  eventually that ll start affecting the elites that run the cartel that has perpetrated these inhumanities ,n165w7

17,Lunch Breaks UGGHH,i hate unpaid lunch breaks  those 30 mandated minutes unpaid annoy me  i never want to work a job like that  i cant relax in those 30 minutes because i am watching the clock  i eat in like 15 to 20 minutes max  so what do i do with that extra time  i would hate having an hour of unpaid lunch  like where i live  it takes 20 minutes just to get to my destination  then 20 minutes back  i can not go to a dentist appointment in that time  i can't go to the bank in that time  what do people do with that hour  luckily i have a job where i can eat whenever i want  i was annoyed one day at work from dealing with all the customers  so i decided to eat  as i began to eat  i get a customer asking me to do something for them  i made them wait 20 minutes for me to finish my food    what does everyone else on slow days do  like some days for me  i do not see a paying customer for days on end  so i just read  watch youtube netflix  sleep  play games  do homework  once i drove 40 minutes one way to get my laptop back from the repair shop  and this was all on the clock  paid for    why do companies waste peoples time not paying them ,n1hr97
18,I was Terminated from Appen for questioning unpaid work,if your unfamiliar with appen  they are a company like lionbridge that does online work for social media companies and amazon  i was not paid from one of my projects and it took over a month to get a response about it  i was upset because the person said we are not doing anything about it  later i get an email saying i'm terminated from appen  this honestly was one of the worst things i've experienced because i have done nothing wrong except argue about my hours  there is nothing i can do because i'm a contract worker ,n1hoit
19,My boss just gave the most fucked reason for taking away my day off., well you're not doing anything then  on my day off  anyway    fucking wow  i don't think there's any clearer way of saying  you time off and how you choose to spend it has no value unless you're using it to work more for me    my bosses have been taking my days off away from me willy-nilly and normally i'm super understanding that sometimes extra work piles on and they need to call me in to full in the gaps that leaves  but its becoming increasingly frequent and it's really pissing me right the fuck off  and this bullshit  justification  is the snapping point    i shouldn't need some  big event  to justify my scheduled fucking days off  i could spend the day naked and jerking off to hentai and guess what  thats my fucking time to spend  i shouldn't need to defend or justify not wanting to give up my scheduled days off ,n1bf77

22,"The eight-hour workday started its life as a socialist dream.

Fuck both of you.",work to live  don't live to work  it's sickening how much of our lives are spent earning dimes a day while corporations make thousands - millions a day  america's work culture is disgusting and disgraceful  especially when folks who work double the 40 hour work week often barely make enough to get by  and all it takes is one bad medical aliment to completely destroy your finical stability for the rest of your life     amp x200b   i'm not a religious man  but these  big pharma conglomerates  politicians and modern day slave driving corporations  truly deserve to be in the deepest most sadistic pits of hell ,n1z2e1

25,I quit my job today,after suffering for months with anxiety and taking 2 weeks off due to stress  not being able to enjoy my time off  waking up early with my heart racing and always worrying about the next problem that was going to come up  i have finally handed in my notice    i have no idea what i m going to do after but i m excited to see what happens  hopefully it will be for the best  all i know is that i couldn t continue on with what work was doing to me   i m still waiting to hear back when my last day will be but i have a 3 month notice period  part of me wants another 3 months pay and another just wants this to be over so i can finally relax   i have a feeling they re going to reduce the notice i need to give but will probably mean i miss out on 2 3 months of pay  i will most likely try and stick out 3 months doing the bare minimum and get the money    i m 24 and dread to think of living life stuck in an office job doing the same mindless tasks everyday  think i ll get out and explore a bit,n1s07t

28,Working part time only? Is it feasible?,obviously it s going to depend on budgeting and stuff for the short term  but i m talking long term  i ve heard ppl suggest fire to me  but to be honest i m not really interested in working super hard full time or taking my chances on the stock market  i come from a lower class upbringing so i don t have any parents seed money or any sort of trust or inheritance coming my way  is paying into the 401k and working worth it  basically just looking for the pros and cons of part time vs full time  rn i m still insured until my dad but when the time comes i ll just not have insurance or something idk  that s why i m here bc i feel so drained and miserable working full time no matter what i do  i m really reaching the end of my rope  40 hours is too much  20-30 would be preferable ,n1y0ku
29,I don't consider non-workers to be fundamentally driven by laziness in the modern era,it's true that work is great if it has purpose and contributes to society  the problem is that these days the workers are exploited whilst billionaires siphon up the funds and people are obliged to take menial jobs that are basically useless other than to funnel money up to these exploitative billionaires  even jobs that are valid and honourable like being a doctor or carpenter are cheapened by how many people make money off of bullshit    additionally  if somebody is miserable or suffering from something  you can call them lazy for not working if you wish  but the truth is in many instances they're borderline suicidal and not necessarily thinking about whether or not they contribute to society  which would be an undue demand upon an already vulnerable mind  i saw a picture of a young guy who had hung himself because he was unable to find a job  it's pretty sick to imagine people calling him a 'dosser' prior to his death  but that's the mentality some people seem to roll with    i can understand the validity of honest work but i can also understand alienation to the point where honest work seems unfairly futile  the system is fucked - work isn't the problem  work is fantastic and life-affirming when it's worthwhile  but the jobs themselves definitely are not  i am more sympathetic to people who are on benefits because of this but i think they should all aim to find a genuine  fulfilling job and do their best to try to find it    people will call this left-wing and maybe it technically is but to me it just seems like basic common sense and an understanding and respect of human psychology  if everybody could find work that seemed to genuinely make the world and the lives of others better without making physiologically destructive demands whilst paying a fair and healthy salary  this sub wouldn't exist ,n15fd4
30,Quick little post about me (who f*king cares),i quit my job a few months ago  did absolutely nothing for a couple months  it was nice    now  i m struggling to pay bills on time simply due to discipline  that s it  everything else in life is going better    oddly enough aside from late payments  having no set  gig economy work schedule  and generally not having a purpose or direction in life  i feel like more of an adult than i did with a full time job as a supervisor for a fortune 100 company   ,n1eff5

33,Everyone's Career Should Mimic Athletes,i personally feel like everyone should have the same type of career as an athlete   in school  you learn the minimum to get by and spend most of your time outside of school working on your one sport   you become the best you can at that sport by having people encourage you and help you along the way   through high school and college you continue to take basic classes while practicing your sport and busting your butt to do the best you can   outside of college you perform and train to be the best you can for about 10-15 years   and then in your early to mid 30s you are able to retire   i absolutely hate it's just considered normal now to go to school for 16ish years  then work for 40  years   work steals the best years of your life  and also the best hours of those years   i'm sick of doing all the  right  things to only see youtubers and athletes make millions and be able to quit whenever they want ,n1a0px

38,I need to get into the mentality that it's okay to leave my job,i've been at the job for nearly three years  however two of those years were broken due to working on a master's degree  since finishing i've been working with the company for a year straight now    the company has changed a lot since i started  plus in the last year i'm working for a different department with a completely different management  i don't have a lot of experience in the field outside of this company so i wasn't sure about general pay and work etc  i get  15 per hour in a junior civil engineer consultant role with a master's degree  the pay is also salary so no ot is paid    in the last year i've notice more and more of my co-workers hand in their notice  it's getting to the stage where i'm almost getting weekly emails about someone leaving  a project manager that i got along with rang me a while back saying they're going to leave soon and said that a few others are too  he told me he called to properly say goodbye and didn't want to do that through an email since we always got along but it did feel like they were warning me that things might get rough since more were leaving    the reason why i initially started looking elsewhere was simply down to the fact i didn't enjoy the work at all  during the search i realised that i wasn't being paid very well for my job  even as a junior  and could do better elsewhere too  another issue i've been having is that since the workload has grown exponentially  i've been given work completely out of my depth with no help at all  i've been told by co-workers that the work i have is senior level and it's also not in the same field of work as my educational background    when i asked for any help or advice i was told to look up the legal standards and read previous projects to get an idea  everything was foreign to me so i struggled but somehow i am managing to get through the work  my mental health took a toll with the amount of work i needed to keep up with and everytime i asked for help from my supervisor my messages were either ignored or i was told to ask someone else  usually i was told to ask a co-worker who is still learning english and struggles to explain things simply for help    after a short search a few companies reached out to me offering to talk about where i want to go with my career  one place is even offering me a 30  wage rise and a good few other perks  i'm very close to taking on an offer but now i'm sitting here feeling bad for me team  they're struggling to meet deadlines and things are getting worse as others are leaving  i don't want to screw over my team anymore and cause them extra stress  many of us are already pulling weekends to make deadlines ,n1eo55

48,"The Rich's ""lifestyle"" portion of wealth accumulation is a red herring.",yesterday i made a comment about my boss who is on the lowest  lowest end of what can be called  the rich  which for me is around a net worth of about  10m  i shared that the working class thinks that life is more like what they know  payday loans  rent-to-owns  vape shops and people spinning signs on the corner   i shared about my boss's  and his wife  18 000 sq ft home  with the theater room  basketball court  home gym  theater room and other amenities you'd expect with such a home  his four nice to luxury vehicles  no super cars his expensive and nice coach motorhome and one of the nicest freshwater boats you can buy  cost more than my house   and remember  he's just barely at the stage you can call  the rich  he's in the low double digit millions rich   none of that is new information to you   here's the new perspective   the houses only get so big  and at that point  you can no longer see the abundance  you need to imagine an imaginary column of wealth that is accumulating with zero material representation   your community looks around and says - the rich houses aren't growing  they're just there  and there are so many more regular folks  we can't go after the rich  we have to find a way to fend for ourselves   after all  their homes in these fancy areas are big  but they aren't expanding   well yeah  because there's only so much milk the rich can drink  and so ridiculous a house can be   after they have the nice house - all the rest of the wealth you never see   you just see one rich house  and many many many apartments and homes  and there's only so much flaunting   the wealth is invisible to the communities   so when i made a comment about how many boss has such nice stuff - it's not the nice stuff that i should really be pointing out to you   it's that from this point forward  his accumulation of wealth will be beyond your ability to perceive  forever  it will now just be an abstract number to you  and you will not see it as real   the absolute insane amount of wealth in this country is not visible to you  not from even from a spy satellite   it's in investments and ownership and bank accounts and you're not going to get triggered against it  because we focus so much on what our eyes can see   every future dollar my boss earns will not have to go to any of the luxuries because he's got them all   and now we'll see how the lifestyle of the rich is actually just a starting place - and that the real wealth comes after those expenses are done   now the real accumulation of wealth begins ,n22ghw

69,Quitting Via 8'x2' Banner: What Should It Say??,this is a long story  started my job in 2018 as an accounting manager for an organization that does 200 mil in revenue  but only has an accounting team of 6 because the benefits and pay were amazing  i was younger than the children of the people i manage which made for an awkward hard time to start because the group i was walking in to had all been working with each other for decades and they do not like change  everything was fine  usual manageable office politics   then my husband lost his job   then the pandemic hit   then my husband suddenly lost the ability to walk  ms attack- was put on chemo-like treatments that wipe his immune system and cost 200k year   i was sent home for wearing a mask into the office and involuntarily put on leave that ate up all my sick and vacation time i had saved up while they decided what to do with me because the governor of my state started to shut things down   including offices   they decided the hr and accounting teams were  essential workers   we are not and can do 99  of our jobs from home besides mail scanning and check printing  so after my leave was over they said come back into the office or quit   had no other option  needed the health insurance    when i returned everyone suddenly hated me  ignored me despite being their boss  were mean  snide comments and low key insults galore   my boss had used that time to scape goat me into the bad guy so everyone wouldn't be mad at her for making them continue to come into the office  still sans masks   one of my employees travels for christmas  his wife tests positive for covid-19 upon return  which has a 20  chance of killing my husband  the hr manager takes his premature negative test the day they returned and says that he is clear to come back into the office monday  thankfully he wakes up with a sniffle and gets another test  this time positive  i find out this happened the following wednesday  and they wouldn't have told me of the risk had he actually come in   showed up  worked overtime  unpaid  i'm salaried  really tried to turn things around and play politics and be super nice and helpful to everyone   get payroll to review 7 months later  guess who got bonuses  everyone in the department except for me  guess who got raises  everyone in the department besides me   spend 5 months finding a better job  now i am starting a business with a former professor and will be able to work from home   now comes the good part    i had to wait until this next monday to quit to not have a gap in insurance coverage  so i did not give my two weeks because i wasn't willing to risk them firing me on the spot  at-will employment state    i have always wanted an epic quitting story  i have landed on having an 8 foot by 2 foot banner made which is less than a hundred bucks and i have a change jar for only stupid fun shit that will cover the cost    what should it say  i wanted it to serve as my resignation letter and i'm not going to need a reference from this place  that bridge had been burned months ago   tldr  treated like crap  covid-19 office outbreak could have killed my husband  what should i put on the 8 foot banner i plan to have made to announce me quitting   thanks reddit ,n18rdd
70,A Personal Story: The 30 Year Crisis, amp x200b   the average human being lives to be 79 years old in the united states of america  i am a 30-year-old male  the average male human being lives to be 76 years old in the united states  and the average female gets an extra five years at 81 years old  i do not want to work a job for thirty years and retire at the ripe age of 60  i want to retire by the time i am 40 years old and live on the rest of my life doing what makes me happy    after i completed my research essay on the future of cryptocurrency  i asked myself why i was so interested in this subject  the answer came down to my mortality  i know i have a limited amount of time on earth  and i do not want to waste a second of it  i constantly remind myself of my own pending death as a way of motivation  i have friends that ignore their mortality and ignore the statistics on health and disease  their approach reminds me of an  ignorance is bliss approach    i have a tattoo scheduled next week to get the words  memento mori  on my chest  memento mori is latin for  remember you must die  the phrase  memento mori  the usage of this phrase was traced back to the ancient rome time period where slaves would whisper this phrase to one another to uplift spirits due to the back living conditions and the continual reign of the current generals enslaving them    i want to make every hour of everyday count for something because i do not have an unlimited supply of life hours  i did some deep reflection into my life path and have concluded that i do not want to work until i am 65 years old to  retire  if i stay at my current employer  i can cut that figure from 65 to possibly 57 years old  i do not want to retire at 57  there are several issues with retiring at 57 years old  the number one issue is i will be fifty-seven years old  at 57 who is to know the condition of my health  mobility  and current risks of disease and cancer at that age  i do not want to take that risk to begin  living in retirement  at that age  the second issue is that the average lifespan after retirement from the stress-ridden job that i am at now is 6 months of life after retirement  this is sad because many correction officers work their whole life looking towards retirement  however  they forget to take care of their health and stress levels along this journey  hypertension is a silent killer because an individual can look and feel completely normal and never know they have a ticking bomb inside of their chest that is fueled by stress  working in a prison where you are constantly monitoring human beings that have committed felonious crimes can be stressful  especially considering these human beings tend to not be the best at following rules or getting along with one another    i have worked as a city police officer  a deputy  a correction officer  waiter  home improvement sales and more  i have concluded that all jobs get boring to me  this is an opinion of course  however  i have identified that working a typical job does not make me happy  my personal identified  meaning of life  has always been  stay as happy as long and as often as possible  to achieve this  i want to retire by the age of 40 years old  let me rephrase that sentence to be more accurate  i want to be done working full time by the time i am 40 years old  i want to achieve a mass of wealth which i have calculated to be 9 million dollars so i can do this  if this comes to be not possible by the 40-year-old date  then i will have created a few streams of passive income by this date and work part time  the goal is to do what makes me happy  what makes me happy is running  exercising  doing  new things  meeting new people  competing  and traveling    the reason i am so attracted to the new york stock exchange and the cryptocurrency market is for the possibilities of one dollar becoming ten dollars  i understand the more you invest is the more you can make  or lose  i am now thirty years old  and i am facing the barrel of thirty more years of work if i think like a typical american  i do not have children nor a mortgage  i have flexibility in the way i can live my life and manage my meager income  i will never accumulate 9 million dollars by working in a prison setting or any other typical job by the time i am 40 years old  the key to an early  retirement  is to invest my money into smart investments  i have a buddy named  robert  who has made  165 000 in the last four months by investing some of the money he makes at  25 00 an hour into the cryptocurrency market  it would have taken me 3 years of working full time in the same job as robert to accumulate those funds  that means 3 years of working and not spending a penny  robert did not work overtime and sacrifice his free-time and every waking moment by trading 60-minute intervals of his life into united states dollars  the most valuable thing i have is time  i do not want to continue to trade my time for paper money  there are too many things on this earth that i want to see and that i want to do  every minute counts    the cryptocurrency market is an investment that comes with risk just like any other investment  this paper served as an insight into how i think about my life  and why i am attracted to investing my money into the cryptocurrency market and stock market  this paper is not intended as investment advice  rather it serves as a person sharing their strategy on squeezing as much juice out of life as possible  thank you for reading this narrative     i have included one picture of me posing as my fear   i have included another picture of me serving my identified meaning of life  being happy ,n185al

132,Is a change coming?,i have always despised how we have to give up so much of our lives for a corporation that doesn't care about us  but for some reason  i've recently felt like a change is coming  and that corporations can no longer conduct business the way they have been   nowadays  in america at least  there have been numerous issues when it comes to employment  15 dollar minimum wage was recently passed  companies are struggling with what they call a  labor shortage  many people  due to the recent quarantine  have found the time to pursue their own interests and are much happier with their lives  i continue to hear stories from blue collar workers about the frustration they are feeling with the expectations put on them throughout the pandemic  all of this gives me some hope that the current capitalist system is breaking   companies are now inflicting extra burdens on their employees to make up for the lost revenue from covid  i myself have worked for the same company for 5 years  with promotions in title  but no raise in my pay  i still only get 2 weeks of vacation time per year  no sick days either  these workload burdens are now far more visible with the strain we've all had to endure  and people are definitely on edge due to these expectations  i feel like the dam is about to break  too many people are overworked and underappreciated  and have the wherewithal to actually see it now that enough of us have been crushed and stepped on by our employers   does anyone else feel a change in the winds  or am i being naively optimistic   people seem to be cracking  and these companies are going to have to deal with it one way or another ,n0rh8a

136,Middle Management Destroyed my outlook,full disclosure for this throwaway account  i make good money at a growing company  by all outward measures my career is going great and i'm ahead of the curve  in retrospect this is what i've been working for  it's not that i don't sympathize with this subreddit but i can say i've always  drank the kool-aid  at work  lean certifications  i have them  management seminars trainings  attended them  patrick lencioni books  read them  i have to say though that taking a risk and moving across the country for a job was a massive fucking mistake  i work in biotech and have always had a passion for what i do  starting out as a low level manufacturing technician i've always told myself that no matter how much my day sucks at least at the other end of it was a person who might be cancer free  or have their sight restored  or some other amazing feat of medical science  i still believe that  because it is true  but fuck middle management and it's bloated  bullshit effect on prices and my staff   in spite of the  mission  i fucking hate my companies leadership  during my time in my current role i have kept tabs on how much product we've produced and tried to focus my team on how many lives they possibly have saved  whereas finance and the ceo only want to talk about how much goddamn money we make per week month quarter year  i knowingly pushed my team to work 7 days a week with only 5 day a week staffing for literally months to meet demands for a critical project  i don't regret it  because i know it saved lives  but goddamn would it be nice to have my team recognized beyond some extra money and a weak  thank you  for the fact that we made revenue for the quarter  or alternatively  you know  authorize the correct fucking head count  stop asking for what can be made with x number of headcount then expect 50  more than that  the game is fucking retarded    i was brought in partly because i know  how to handle millennials  but i am a fucking millennial  if there's one thing i know is that i'm telling the truth when i say what it's going to take to do a task  there's no fluff  i know my generations work ethic and what we can do  my team hasn't ever wavered from what i would expect  but the asshats above me think i'm padding the numbers and only provide a fraction of the ask then flip their shit when things don't go how they expect  for me  i keep calm and explain why they fucked up  but for my team it's hell  they want to do the right thing and take it personally when we don't stay on track with projections because they know that a batch lost delayed is a treatment lost delayed  in other words they fucking care about the right things   i realize i'm fortunate to be where i am and i feel like a prick when i ask people for more when i know they're giving all they can  the stress of getting fucking chewed out every day about it makes me physically ill even before i get out of bed  the whole goddamn system is fucked and it only serves to leverage people's good will and  mission  oriented work ethic to enrich dirt-bag investors looking for a buyout  at the end of the day though  let's be real  i've been bought  my family will be well off assuming i can continue pushing people to do more with less  i hate myself for having the ability to do that even though  after you factor out cost  it's for a good cause   roast me if you want  i'm part of the problem  the choice is between my kids and you though  and i'll chose my kids every time  i hate myself for making healthcare more expensive but if that means my kids don't have to take on debt like i did i'll do that for them  this whole system is a zero sum game and i guess i'm winning despite wanting to literally vomit every day  i won't make myself a martyr and put in jeopardy my kids future  i'll keep cracking the whip and manipulating people into working more  here we are  welcome to life in 2021 ,n0yo9i

141,Seems pretty fucked up that business are allowed to be considered profitable while paying minimum or below minimum wage.,i have this thought a lot and people always say i m weird for thinking this way    why is it that the bottom line of your company can be scraped and scrounged and underpaid while the higher ups are paid well  the building is well maintained and rent is always paid up  why is a business allowed to even exist before properly allocating an above-minimum wage to their employees  why is minimum wage considered a high bar  why should you be allowed to start a business if you can t be bothered to consider paying your employees more than the literal bottom-of-the-barrel dollars that are leftover after everything else    i think businesses should be required  by law  to prove they are able to pay at least x 5 of the state s minimum wage to all employees as well as general operating costs before being considered a viable  profitable business ,mzzq7k

145,PSA: You don't have to be anti-capitalist to be anti-work,we all know that capitalism is leading to more automation  this is good because it means humanity will one day be free from work  when this happens  we will have achieved post-scarcity  we all agree this is where we're heading   but when everything is automated and no one has jobs  how will people buy things  this is where we start disagreeing   there's various schools of thought  but i'd like to explain how capitalists view post scarcity   when adjusted for inflation  the cost of almost everything is decreasing over time thanks to market competition and more automation  as the cost to produce a good or service approaches 0  so does the price  and when the price of a product is 0  you won't need money to buy it  that product will then be  post-scarce  at this point  does it matter if the factory that produced this good for free is privately owned  post-scarcity-capitalists argue that if capitalism can achieve post-scarcity  capitalism can maintain post scarcity   that's the essence of post-scarcity capitalism  there's a lot more to it than that to cover the various edges cases such as how property taxes prevent a good or service from reach a 0 cost of production  but this is just a summary ,n0lbik

179,"I got into journalism because I thought a whole bunch of people should hear my opinions, and now I'm afraid to express them, lest they stop me from getting a job",it was spring 1998  and i was rather sick of how the media were portraying affirmative action  not in the direction i now view it  and that remains the most execrable 50 inches i've written   i branched out into page design and copyediting very quickly at my college paper  while getting one's opinion printed 15 000 times was fun  i remained a columnist as i went from designer to opinion editor to managing editor  framing societal discussion  through heds  story selection and placement  quickly became more appealing   i was a computer science major at the time  but it was two days into training on newspaper design that i realized i didn't want to go there  sure  one can change the world with the right few lines of code  but it was more efficient in the '90s to go the route of changing the system from within   it likely didn't hurt that i was fucking my editor within a week   those clich s  yeah   they're there for a reason   i have zero net worth as a result of that single decision  layoffs were frequent  and i was too na ve to see that this was an accelerating trend  not something that was going to go away  i was young and believed my calling would always be there for me   if you've read my prior posts  you know that i finally achieved some semblance of stability  at the expense of being forced up the corporate ladder    if you take nothing else away from this  remember  most of the people trying to change the world in journalism are the ones at the ground level  some mean well and get fucked   the titular issue i now find myself in is the exact set of skills and characteristics that allowed me to start a career sans degree 20 years ago  with more than a few awards  now holds me back  truth  idealism  looking out for that one person ill-treated by authorities  i never changed politics on the state level or higher  but i did change parking regulations at my university  and a few other things  but this isn't a humble-brag post   management doesn't that 20 years in  hell   they didn't even like my automation work because it rocked the system   about which  the system is designed to reward conformity  which is why you see so many journalists end up in pr or working for officials  we're told to pay our dues with a later payout expectation  when some of us actually got into the field to effect positive change   in 2003  some 18 months into my professional career  it's good to have a former senator own your paper in some cases  i had the opportunity to spend an evening on the desk at  the washington post  i don't recall whether it was before or after changing a1  i suspect  before  that i was talking with the ame news and asked him if he missed just being a copyed  there was a fraction of a second where his face admitted what he couldn't   i leave it as an exercise for the reader to determine what that was ,n0w01e

192,Tired of the Anxiety and Just Not Knowing,i am working it 18 hour at a primarily family run business  i got this job just a little over 5 months ago and it's been a central point of my anxiety since  day one they didn't have my wfh set up and my boss had forgotten it was my first day  hiring process is a shit show  watch a bunch of videos but they don't really have too much in mind for me  slowly my boss gives me a few pretty meaningless easy tasks and some daily stuff  during this time ive been mentioning to him that i feel like i'm struggling to understand a lot of things about the business but that just makes him insist that i need to work more and get familiarity  fair enough    what he really meant was   i'm going to give you work that is going to be challenging and i will not be around very much  if at all to help  you should be asking your coworkers and if they don't know or can't help you're shit out of luck  i mean it's not an unusual approach but man i feel so stuck  the most recent thing that got me fed up is a managerial report  it started off with me just clicking the button and emailing the report  but at one point it stopped reporting correctly  i've been sending this report to the president of another location so he calls me up and starts talking about the report and of course i have no clue what he's even talking about  this goes on for a few minutes i apologize a few hundred times and go on with my day  my boss ends up  helping  me fix the report  tell me what to type with minimal explanation    since then that report has gone to shit  i feel like the manager is just looking for little inaccuracies to make me stress  but i also doubt he has the time for that  so a few times a week he will say something is up with the report that needs fixing then once that is fixed  it's another thing  they are typically small issues  but i have so little understanding that it takes me atleast an hour each time  and then that just makes me feel guilty  that it's taking me so much time  so i'll spend the majority of my day just panicking more or less      at this point i don't know what to do  i wish i could tell my boss to fuck off and collect unemployment for a month or two to find something else but it's looking increasingly unlikely  i don't know what i want to do  i want to think i still enjoy technology  but it's really not enjoyable to be pushed my businessmen who i know don't care about me   every week i just try to get through the week so my anxiety will calm down and i can have an appetite again  i really just need a hug  it doesn't even make me feel any better than a lot of it professionals struggle with this  just makes me feel like doomed to live the rest of my life like this unless i switch fields ,mzyazn
193,Am I wrong for wanting an alternative?,i am halfway through my yearly internship for a public office  i have no holidays or sick days and i have never missed a day so far because i would have to work an extra day to get those hours back  my paycheck is 400 bucks per month but i get paid only once every 3 months so technically it's 1200 bucks and they technically still haven't payed me one extra month of work i did  my job is boring and stupid  i have been asked to do pointless stuff such as cleaning up my boss' desk or reorganizing all of his cables but most of the time i'm revising useless files on excel or organizing zoom meetings  i am not allowed to complain about how much i hate this because my family keeps yelling at me i should be thankful for the opportunity or better yet   be happy i get payed to do nothing    what i want to do with my life is be a freelance illustrator like my ex art academy friends are doing  making a living as independent individuals and pursuing their passion  it works for them  but not for me  because according to my family i cannot do as i please  they treat me as if i was a kid or something  not a man in his late 20s   the funny thing is  i don't want to straight up quit working  i just want to do it at my own rules  i ask you  am i being spoiled and ungrateful for wanting this or really the few out there who make it are an exception and most of us cannot escape this rat race ,n0ainc

196,The perpetual discomfort zone,how did entire generations of people get indoctrinated with the idea that when they feel comfortable  something is wrong  and that only when they are making a proactive choice to be uncomfortable is everything ok   i mean  i know  it's a rhetorical question  but it's also a question i feel like screaming from the rooftops   feeling comfortable is the best thing in the world  robbing people of one of life's few pleasures by telling them they should be fearful if they dare to enjoy a moment of non-pain is gaslighting on an unprecedented scale   oh  but if you rest for a moment  little johnny next door might get ahead  goes the message  because  obviously  everyone is in perpetual competition  there is no one you can trust not to stab you in the back and solidarity is not only a thing of the past but the loser in the battle against capitalist success at any cost and history has already been rewritten to pretend it never existed   what are we doing  what will it take for us to realize that when we get out there and grind ourselves into early retirement due to sickness in our 40s to turn little johnny's unwise decision to have rest and recreation into our own career victory  we are simultaneously doing the exact same thing to ourselves - because when we do it  he starts doing it  when he starts doing it  we do it harder  when we're both doing it  the idea catches on and soon the world is doing it  and no nobody can rest even if they want to   we're doing it to ourselves   stop    who moved my cheese -style  you shouldn't expect shit to stay the same -cum- you shouldn't expect a company not to try and fuck with a deal you've already agreed -cum- when shit doesn't stay the same it's on you to tap your own resources to adapt to it  is the training department's  remember those  way of externalizing the costs of marketplace agility onto its own employees  the same way unpaid internships are about externalizing the costs of training new hires and young apprentice intake rather than investing in staff  because that way you can ax them when they start to get a bit old and start to break after the years you've overworked them without losing the investment you now didn't make in the first place   and if any of them are bold enough to leave because of your inferior working conditions  your investment doesn't walk out the door with them because you conned them into funding the education they needed to do the skilled work you depend on all by themselves  congratulations  you have now eliminated the business costs  and consequences  of overworking staff with zero regard for health and safety  and of treating them like shit along the way   it's a fucking scam   and it's not going to stop by itself ,n0ddlc

225,Work stress so bad causing daily mental breakdowns and sleep deprivation, i ve been working through a major life for the last few weeks  breaking up with a life partner - together 12 years and living together 5 of those   on top of the personal stress of breaking up and moving during covid  my performance at work has been poor   despite repeated attempts to correct bad behaviors with the support of my company and manager  my performance has not improved and i am experiencing nearly daily mental breakdowns and anxiety panic attacks   i am also not able to sleep for more than 3-4 fitful hours a night   at this stage i strongly believe quitting will be to the benefit of everyone   i won t experience the intense stress and anxiety just the thought of logging on to my work station brings and my company can get someone in to do my role with more consistency and success than i     i don t have another job lined up but i am applying to other roles and have a few initial discussions lined up   am i making the wrong decision in resigning from my current job effective immediately ,n0x0ut

228,I made a list of Antiwork Tips &amp; Tricks based on my most miserable days of work. Hope it helps make your days better :), long post but i appreciate those who read     core belief  - you are always expendable in a job  as soon as you inconvenience the smoothness of the capitalist money machine  you ll be replaced  always remember this when making any decision regarding work  and consider the worth of the choice     golden rule  - this has been mentioned a lot  but i ll still repeat it  do the bare minimum for the longest amount of time that is acceptable to keep you earning your paychecks  while trying not to screw over your coworkers  don t push it to the point you re fired  but don t be afraid to try it out to make your workdays more bearable  after all  a  job  is just a middle man between your work and your reward  a middle man that screws you over  you never see the true fruits of your labor because it all goes to the rich and they throw the apple cores  banana peels  etc  back to you    tips  amp  tricks   these are just things that i ve noticed throughout some of my working days that have helped me survive mentally  it s not to make you like work  it s made to help relieve the soul crushing stress of it  what has worked for me may not work for you  and vice versa  this is intended to help get you through your working days until you re ready to start living off grid  or whatever ways you intend on living as far away from the system as possible    1  always  stimulate your mind before work  or even during the first 30 minutes of your shift if you have a job where you don t get screamed at for pulling out your phone  this means skipping out on that 5-10 minute morning stress fap  try not to do the same exact things during your morning routine  instead  try spending 5-10 minutes learning about something new  basically  introduce yourself to something that you can think about for the rest of the day  this could be literally anything  learn about investing  learn about subjects you were always interested in as a kid  it could even be related to video games  think about strategies you can use to beat that boss you re still stuck on because it keeps dealing 1000 damage to you near the end of the battle    2  this coincides with  1  never focus fully on the work at your job  this is something i ve been doing even back when i worked at fast food  i would always be focusing on personal things   how am i going to beat yukiko s boss fight later tonight   what should be the next special thing i do for my girlfriend   i wonder how much extra money i should save for the modifications on our camper van  always keep positive  thought provoking ideas running through your head at every point possible  especially during the brain dead rush hours  it keeps my brain more focused on the good things outside of my job  even though i have severe depression and have been through some of the worst shit imaginable as a kid  child abuse  molested  bullying for years  etc  there s things i ve learned to see positively outside of work  i know firsthand it s possible to be negative your whole life  hating the planet and everything on it  and still learn to see the positives and mature mentally     3   always  prioritize personal things while at work at any point possible in a manner that doesn t put you at risk of being fired  you know where this post you re reading is being made  a car wash  i m clocked in  prioritizing writing this list over my work while listening to persona music  i have 4 cars waiting outside  i don t care  unless they re customer cars  in which case i work a little faster because i don t want to inconvenience them  you know what else i ve done  spent 30 whole minutes doing research on things i was thinking of investing in while clocked in  ate my lunch while clocked in  made most of my antiwork posts while clocked in  fuck  i played skyrim so long on my switch one day that i went from level 10 to level 17 uninterrupted while clocked in  played smash bros with some childhood friends while clocked in  fuck  i ll even admit i masturbated in the bathroom  cleaned up of course  while clocked in one day because i finished my book and was bored    4  say  no  more often   hey jim  can you come in today   no  but thanks for offering  the second part is obviously fake  but if you have an off day  just say no  you don t have to explain yourself  you were scheduled for an off day  fuck them  enjoy your humanity and your free time     5  try to make your call ins before or after an off day  and do it when you can  afford  it  if you did it every time you simply  wanted  to  you d be doing it every week and get fired  having multiple days off back to back is fucking euphoric  in the case of people like me  you d be getting 3 off days back to back  the best excuse i ve been able to find for calling in so far has been bad diarrhea  example   hey  i m not going to be able to make it in today  i woke up with really bad diarrhea and i ve been stuck on the toilet for 30 minutes this morning  you might also want to add that you re feeling feverish     6  for every minute you spend  actually  using the bathroom  spend an additional minute using your phone  if someone comes into the bathroom and actually needs to use it  if you have limited stalls  of course be polite and get out  but otherwise  enjoy the extra few moments of taking back your time     7  this is specifically for fast food jobs  and it s limited to the devices you have  in most of them  they typically force you to use headsets  mandatory for the drive through cashiers  and it s like 50 50 mandatory for the food workers  if you re a food worker  what i personally did at my fast food jobs is go to the bathroom shortly after putting on a headset  hang it around my neck as i m walking to the bathroom  and then slipping in an airpod before i go back to work and turning on shuffle music with the headset at low volume and covering the airpod  it s risky depending on your location and the behavior of the management there  so this is one that i m not  telling  you to start doing  it s an idea i m offering  and it s up to you to decide if the risk would be worth it and if you want to do it or not  an earbud obviously wouldn t work - the wire would give it away  so you d need any kind of wireless earbud     8  take antiwork breaks  come to this reddit and just vent about things and rant about your job  for me  it helps me a lot mentally and improves my mood the rest of the day  i do it all the time while clocked in  literally earning money while shit talking your job    9  this is for outside of work  your  free time  as they call it  even though you don t get much of it  it can get really hard to actually enjoy your literal human existence when you re slaving away 40  hours a week  and can even make you anhedonic  anhedonia was another factor that lead to my first suicide attempt  and i suffered from it for a long time  but i eventually started learning how to combat it after recovering    a  sounds cliche  but try new things and find new hobbies  this is coming from a person who was starting to believe the whole world was meaningless  there really is something out there for everyone  for me  i started finding a huge interest in learning how to cook  trying new recipes  and trying new food or new variations on old foods almost all the time  also  reading    b  if the things you re doing are starting to seem boring  or you feel yourself losing interest  move to something new  sometimes i ll be at my house playing a game and find myself thinking that i m only playing it to pass the time  when this happens  i save and close it and move to another game  i do this to try to find the right game for my current mood where i can get invested in the story  atmosphere  character development  etc  and am fully enjoying it rather than to just  fill the void  sometimes  i can t find the right game  or none of my games sound good at the moment  what i do then is turn off my console pc  and go for a bike ride or drive around and relax listening to music  if i have extra gas money  then come home and cook something    aaaaand that s it for now  if i think of more i ll add it in the comments  thanks for reading  remember  think of the future  think of the returns on your investments  think of the days you ll be ready to go off-grid  for those that don t want to resort to off-grid  think of the days ahead when enough of us wake up and revolt worldwide for better conditions and compensation for workers  we are the lifeblood of these companies after all ,n0ime7

252,Performance Review Knocked Some Sense Into Me,i've been browsing this sub for a while and always agreed with the general sentiment  admittedly i was thinking all this while still saying 'i love my job'  well  after my most recent performance review at work  i realized it's all a fuckin scam    --  had a normal performance review with hr  honestly  i am doing excellent in this position  i am literally the only person in my role  i am highly educated  experienced  and have glowing reviews from upper management  this is also a well established ngo with good income  so  ofc  i want to get a raise to match my output    during the meeting management straight up said 'there is no monetary raise for this position' when i asked about career progression  keep in mind we live in a high col area and i'm already making below the current minimum average for my city in my particular field too    i was then also told  'this role is one of the only full time positions in the company' and 'so many other part time employees would kill to have a full time role like yours '    to be clear  in my country full time positions are  legally mandated  in which the company must pay an employee's healthcare  pension  and unemployment  it is also a bit difficult to fire a full time person  part time workers must enroll in national healthcare pension and pay out of pocket  however  full time positions are the norm even in ngos    then to make it super obvious that i am valued  when i asked about hr providing me goals to better commit to the company  they said 'we would like you to create brand guidelines for the entire company to make us more cohesive'  this was then quickly followed by  'for example  if someone were to step into your role how would they get started'   so essentially  i'm lucky to have a full time position because if they  legally could  they wouldn't give a fuck about me and easily replace me with a starving part time worker   ever since that review i've been putting in the same amount of effort that they pay me for  fuck all yall ,n0nxim
253,Can bosses and coworkers gaslight you?,not a rhetorical question  i genuinely don't know  i worked for a local restaurant during the pandemic and at first it seemed great  they projected that the staff was a family and since we only had seven workers it seemed cool  especially because my boss would work along side me during my shifts    but as things went on the staff got bigger and somehow no work was getting done  i was a cook  but i was also a server and bagger  and a dish washer and deep cleaner  the worst was that i would come in three hours early just to get a head start on my prep  i either had to come in early or leave late because my boss complained that i wasn't doing my job  they said i had an attitude problem and my boss cut an entire work day out of my schedule  cutting my already minimum wage pay in half because i would miss the day i worked the most hours   my last there i had a 1 on 1 with my boss and he said that my assistant manger  who also was a cookb and a friend from high school  could do all this easily and that he didn't understand my problem  he said he cut my hours for my mental health and that i seemed different from when i joined the  team  a coworker said similar things when i tried discussing it with him during closing and he said that i was just imagining the issues    i am nothing familiar with the term gaslighting or any form of manipulation  intentional or not  but i know when i put my two weeks in for this job i felt terrible  i would wake up dreading my day to come  think terrible thoughts all shift long  and fight the urge to cry on the way home  but i still felt like i let down my coworkers and boss because i thought we were all friends  i put my two weeks in on the first day of my shift and was told i may lose a day or two in the coming weeks to train another person  but after that week i was removed from schedule    i just found this thread and it validated the thought that is haunting me right now  is it supposed to be this hard  am just a lazy  arrogant,n0qd4z

256,I consistently feel guilty about leaving at 5pm with WFH,i feel like i have an issue where i genuinely care too much about my job despite being provided with evidence that i am highly replaceable  this doesn't necessarily mean that i'm out here busting my ass at work  but does make me feel some level of anxiety for not working as hard as i possibly can    i've always been work from home at this job  got hired during pandemic and they haven't mentioned going back for my team yet  when i was hired  i was told that i work  like 8-5  there's an hour lunch in there  which i typically send stressing if someone is trying to reach me  now i work from home so i really haven't talked to many of my coworkers extensively  the main person i've talked to is an older woman  jan  jans worked here for 20 years and worked from home before pandemic because of family illness  she's also the only other hourly employee that i'm aware of at my level  now she takes naps on her lunch and then just worked until she's tired and i'm starting to feel like the same is expected of me  no one ourwordly says it  but i kind of always feel like more can be done and my employer won't be satisfied until everything is done which is unachievable goal for multiple reasons     really not sure how to sit with this because i don't want to be working until 7 or 8 every night  but also i want to not feel useless at work because i feel like long term that will lead to more fulfillment than doing the minimum  it feels like there is no compassion  no one wants to hear if i'm having a rough time recently they just want more work done  i've thought about just shifting my mindset to completely on the grind during the week and not even attempt to enjoy myself  but that really doesn't feel like a way i want to live  although possible ,n0naqz

270,Being abused at work,tw  antisemitism  neo-nazis  abuse  let me know if there s anything else i missed  i don t even know where to start    i m 26 and a public librarian  i have a master s in library and information science  with a concentration in archives  i graduated from my master program in december and was hired full-time with benefits as a library assistant  a paraprofessional role which doesn t even requite a master s degree  in early march  it s a 30 mile commute on a busy interstate  60 miles in aggregate every day  this job pays poverty wages  but i m lucky that i got this job at all  especially a full-time one with benefits   my manager is functionally illiterate and is a neo-nazi  she sobbed and threw a hissy fit when i was hired because she didn t want to work with a lesbian jew  she had a literal tantrum in the library  sobbing hysterically and rolling on the floor  still  despite this  the supervisors still put me under her  from the first moment i started this fucking job  this woman has been peddling her alt-right ideals  trying to force me to read mein kampf not once but twice because i m  jewish and will understand  she has also told me how she wants a turning point usa chapter in the library and how george floyd died of a meth overdose  this was all in my first hour of employment  by the way   then  the abuse got worse   she would trap me and continue pushing her alt-right beliefs down my fucking throat  trying to force me to comply  she told me how she wants to  take down  our branch manager  a black woman  she used me as her therapist and told me every single triggering detail about her life  like  i asked her a week after i started work how her weekend was and her response was to tell me about this duper triggering thing which happened to her  no provocation whatsoever  when my jaw fell open  she continued and gave me explicit details as to this event   this all culminated in her forcing me at work to read this batshit fucking  diary novel she s been writing about how jesus and the archangels love her and all want to fuck her and she is g-d s special child and has been put on this earth to root out demons  aka anyone who disagrees with her  it s also all about her divorce and how she abused her husband and how his mental illness is  demonic  she stands over me as i am forced to read this at work or else she ll give me a bad review   i am at my wit s end   finally  with support from a coworker friend  i reported what was happening to admin  they said that they ve wanted my manager gone for a long time since she is terrible at her job and cannot spell or write and she s the head of the children s department  they told me that they wanted me to become manager  flat out   anyway   since we re county employees  this had to go to hr  they tried to rework the schedule so i wouldn t be near this white supremacist  but before i submitted my report i had to be  on our last day together  she tried to force me to look up christian lit for this man who refused to wear a mask in the library  she also refuses to wear a mask  even though the desk where i was working does not do reference at all  she wants to convert me   anyway  hr refused to fire her since  of course  this woman s family has millions and their own private jet  though this woman can barely fucking write at all  she had her sister  a lawyer  write her rebuttal for her for hr and because this is a conservative as fuck county  they were sympathetic to my manager  we had a fucking lgbtq  bulletin up in the library and one person complained so the county commissioner threatened to fire the entire library unless we took it down  but this woman trapping a jew in her office and demanding that she reads mein kampf  that s fine   my manager was demoted and moved to another library in the county  but she s still there and i ll still have to see her   the branch manager now loves me and tells me that she still wants me to be manager  but it the optics don t  look good  and my former manager may fucking lose it if she finds out    i ve only been at this job a month btw    anyway  my local county suddenly has 34 vacancies in its library due to bad management but it pays double what i m making right now and i need to get out of here  i d be going from one abusive s h ituation to another  though  but  i can t leave because then i forfeit health insurance and my income  i wish i could be unemployed right now and just take time before a new job but i can t  i can t  i also may still become the manager  i have no fucking idea   oh  and the best part  the library is about to open full time again even though the only people who come in are antimaskers for the most part  the county just doesn t want us to stay home and be safe   my mental health is so shot  this has been literally a traumatizing experience for me  i was already anti-work but i felt so lucky to have found a job in my field and i do love my job and my coworkers so  so much  genuinely  but  i can t even leave for my own mental health  i have to maybe find another job to get out of here  and the only viable jobs right now are ones that also have horrendous management   i just want out  i want to feel safe  even with my former manager no longer at our library  having her still in the system makes me frightened beyond measure  i m an out lesbian too and i live with my partner of many years  who is masculine  i m very petite and feminine  i m frightened for my girlfriend s safety  too  this is so intense that i even had to take my address off of official work documents so my manager wouldn t find them and sic some sort of alt right group on us   i hate this  i just want out  but leaving means no health insurance during a pandemic  leaving means no income  fuck ,mzreur

309,We live in an era of absurd ambitions,i ve been reading  a job to love  to figure out what i m going to do with my life  no answers  but the book does make an excellent point that stuck with me our modern expectations of success are historically  weirdly inaccurate   to quote    modernity never ceases to emphasize that success could  somehow  one day be ours  yet there is unwitting  exhausting cruelty in this narrative the data is clear that only a very few of us will succeed  and yet  despite all the evidence modernity  has made the ideal the norm and internalized the burdens of failure   those who work in predictions have a rule for guessing outcomes   the first step is to get a baseline range of results based on similar cases  the baseline for estimating the likelihood of success  for most of us  comes from media that only shows us success stories  as opposed to  as the book points out  greek tragedies from eras past   for more sanity  we should recalibrate  remember most people in the world are just as frustrated as we are  savor small wins much more  and of course work much less ,mztzk6

339,The story of John Henry has become capitalist propaganda and kind of racist but we can save it,now i know the origins of this story comes from the actual workers on the rail road and it has been used as communist propaganda to glorify the time before industrialization  i get that  i did my research before posting  but now  in the modern context the classical story of john henry has some serious problems with it  in the end it's the story of a big strong black man who is really good at manual labor and wants to do a dangerous  back breaking work for white people and died fighting to keep performing this godawful job once a safer and more efficient way to do this job was invented  again  i understand that when it was first created it was essentially a protest against these terrible working conditions and how once the workers were no longer needed they were tossed aside  but now it has been fully consumed by the capitalist system and remade to fit their needs   however  i don't think john henry should just be abandoned  but it needs to be reworked as it have multiple times in the past in order to fit the needs of the present  instead of being proud of his work henry should hate it and resent that he and his fellow workers have to do it  often under threats of violence  so in response henry designs the steam drill in order to reduce the amount of work people have to do  but he realizes that he can't just give the company he works for this invention because they will just abandonee his fellow workers to poverty  but while henry tries to figure out a plan to make sure his invention actually improves the lives of workers  a class traitor steals his design and sells it to the company with no strings attached  seeing this and hoping to save the lively hoods of his fellow workers  henry challenges the class traitor to the famous contest  only this time henry deliberately causes a cave-in in order to destroy his drill    so what do you think  do i have point  or am i full of shit  should the story of john henry be changed  and if so how do you think it should be changed ,mz6mif

351,How to accept my minor role in the work place?,i've posted a lot here recently so apologies if certain themes are repeated  i got hired as an it worker about 5 months ago  i work from home and make just under 40k a year  going into this i was fresh out of school and very much not convinced i was the correct applicant for the position  but here i am 5 months in and still feeling a lot of those concerns    i don't think i'm necessarily a lazy worker  if i feel like i can complete the task and it's urgent it will get done  as of the last couple weeks though i've been falling into a lazy pattern and it's hard for me to tell how i should feel about it  i feel like many on this sub will commend me for doing little work  but it feels like shit  i dread getting up in the morning because the anxiety of uncertainty crushes me  maybe my boss will ask me to a do a task i can complete today or maybe he'll just ask for some random fucko shit because he heard about and thought it be good to implement with no more thought  currently i'm kind of just doing what i can and feeling bad when i can't  and i feel like it's not really sustainable  i'm trying to learn as much as i can  but without a mentor it quickly turns into googling and looking through old cold    i don't really want to quit because i think most jobs are like this  inside it specifically i really doubt that i am going to find something stress free ,mz2lwk
352,"""Your subordinate tells me there isn't much work to do...""",yes  i know  and in true r antiwork spirit i told subordinate to specifically avoid saying shit like that because i know for a fact they don't wanna work and i don't either  anyway  now i get to rearrange the shelves  awesome   listen  i know all this supply chain stuff goes over your  my boss  not you  dear reader  head  but whether or not you choose to believe it   there are slow days  your philosophies of  oh there's always  something  to do  is a  dumb as hell and b  only applicable to higher-level staff- you know  folks like yourself you dish out the tasks   it's not my  or my staff's  fault the door to the one work area was locked and i have no key   it's not my  or my staff's  fault we didn't receive a shipment of books to our library that day   we were adequately staffed  and sometimes that means not everyone is working  that's what a workplace is  supposed  to look like  and i would hope that a group of progressive-minded librarians  working in a public library  would understand that   but no  that progressivism vanishes the moment the higher-paid librarians need something from us   workplaces are all cesspools ,mz0h55

357,When ppl ask me what my politics are,  donotresearch       whether for a religious or secular goal  suffering is thought to constitute a necessary rite of passage  people must endure through work before they can receive wages  they must prove their worthless before the eyes of capital his thinking has an obvious theological basis - where suffering is thought to be not only meaningful  but in fact the very condition of meaning  a life without suffering is seen as frivolous and meaningless  his position must be rejected as a holder from a now- transcend stage of human history  the drive to make suffering meaningful may have had some functional logic in times when poverty  illness and starvation were necessary features of existence  but we should reject this logic today and recognise that we have moved beyond the need to ground meaning in suffering  work  and the suffering that accompanies it  should not be glorified                                                                                     ,myo9ep

361,FastFood/Restaurants fail to retain workers...Boomers most affected/“Biden to Blame” (Rant),     tldr at the end   so most people here may be aware that fast food places and restaurants are failing to hire and keep workers it s so bad  businesses have been temporarily shutting down and the local panda express we just got can not open because no one wants to work for them lol i saw this coming and me and my inner circle have been talking about this happening for months before news broke  how did we know about this months ahead  simple  i work in the gig industry so i m always browsing subs from fast food places and restaurants where i deliver food from and you can really see how employees have felt about their work places during covid also help wanted signs everywhere at this point      so what s going on  recently  many news outlets have been reporting on this issue and let s just say  many older folks have gave their input on this situation  now tell me  how do you tell me you re american without saying you are  oh i know  go on a facebook rant about how you can t get your big mac and fries now because millennials don t want to work fast food anymore  no seriously  hundreds of facebook comments i ve been reading from boomers calling us  entitled  lazy  no good generation  all because we don t want to work fast food  and as i was telling my friend months ago   look bro  society needs us lower class workers  you know they can t survive without fast food  groceries  food delivery  etc  remember the garbage men protests of yesteryear  and now we are seeing fed up boomers who are mad because we don t want these jobs anymore because they can t get their whopper while yelling at the employees for taking too long       so who s to blame  i ve had the answer to this for months as i saw this coming  but apparently folks  biden is to blame  oh yeah  you heard me right  i m not even a guy that s into politics and i can tell you how bullshit this is from a galaxy away  all of these comments i ve seen blaming biden for extending unemployment which is  why people don t want to work fast food anymore  i don t doubt that people are misusing unemployment  but the rise of people quitting fast food jobs has been rapidly rising over the pandemic  so this was inevitable and to come and restaurants were having issues to keep workers months ago  even before biden  oh yes  blame it on politics for the reason why people don t want to work fast food anymore            here s what s really going on  i ve gone through sub reddit after sub reddit of retail stores and restaurants over the past couple of months due to the gig work i do  i always like to see the employee side of things when it comes to the businesses i deliver from to see how i can understand them better and to make my job easier with them and i ve come to a conclusion you all know the answer to fuck it-  corporations are to blame  yeah we all saw this coming  but surely it can t be that bad  right  well  reading employee stories over the pandemic have made me realize something  that employees have been treated like garbage beings over the pandemic and i ll explain      the pandemic was the catalyst in the relationship between corporations and workers  we all know that before the pandemic  these places treated their workers like shit here in america  but the corporations under the pandemic made people get treated like the scum of the earth and opened the eyes for many many people       it all started at the beginning of the pandemic  fast food sales doubled and tripled as many people were now ordering online due to the pandemic  what happens when sales double and triple  that must mean that work load doubles and triples too  with all of this new found pressure being put onto fast food workers  while they are understaffed  workers were given too much work with not enough workers many of whom had to deal with managers yelling at them for not being able to complete impossible rates and customers being angry too  do you really expect 3 chipotle workers to make 100 items in less than 10 minutes  not even a joke r chipotle subreddit confirms      next came the  covid pay  fiasco  many restaurants at first refused to up pay on employees making  7 25 during the pandemic  even when profits soared through to the moon   as a worker  hearing that you got to work in a business that s thriving due to a pandemic  and making you do mandatory overtime and not making more  you re gonna feel like shit bro  not only as a worker do you have to deal with a pandemic and transmission of the virus due to contact in drive thru with thousands of customers  but your job calls you a  essential hero  but won t pay you like one plus too much mandatory overtime for  7 25  hell no  when these places finally upped pay  it still wasn t enough     after the covid pay issue  managers had gone to the next level of bullshittery  suddenly  covid was striking many fast food employees across the country one by one by one so what are you supposed to do about this considering your whole kitchen crew are potentially infected  force your workers to come in yes you heard me  many and i mean many managers verbally threatened their employees if they didn t come in if they had covid  their reasoning was  unless you feel sick or show symptoms  you gotta come in cause we re understaffed  that s how you know you re really american lol  oh  your mother you live with got covid  too bad  your manager told you that if you quarantine you re fired  go ahead and search reddit and see how many stories you come across like this     workers by this point are fed up  but it can t get worse  can it  oh yea we can  the next issue is regarding  essential employee  or as i call it   the most americanest lie established  imagine  you work at a ice cream shop at the beginning of the pandemic and you don t close down apparently you re  an essential worker  ice cream tho  ice cream isn t essential for survival and apparently many places of business like gamestop came up with bullshit reasons for why they are essential  don t get me started on the fact that the mattress job i used to work at during the pandemic  forged a tennessee official signature  just to lie to the government about being  essential  so they wouldn t close down  and they got caught and have been fined but ironically  the mattress job has a policy on it s wall about being loyal to god and the bible  so you sell video games during the pandemic-essential  heard you sell boba te-essential  we all are essential       finally on our list  we have the  essential hero  lie that was sold by corporate america  to the american people  brought to you by  the same people who make children pay for their lunch because food brands control kids  lunch and need to make a buck off of elementary kids  not even a lie  it s damn true  anyways  over the pandemic  to really keep employees  corporations ran ads calling their workers  heroes  to increase workplace morale and to make workers feel like they belong  however  with the multiple other events happening in the paragraphs above  that unfortunately did not work to keep workers instead this backfired  shocking videos and stories came out about the horrible treatment of so called heroes because people treated fast food workers even worse during the pandemic hell  the whole  essential hero  thing goes way further than you think  when americans think about the term  hero  they think about someone who will put up with all bullshit and never give up so when americans  especially older ones who grew up on comic book superman  hear about fast food employees uh i mean heroes giving up and quitting their jobs  those american people began to view these former workers as scum of the earth because in the time they grew up  if a hero were to give up  that hero was suddenly a horrible no good person to which they associate these  essential heroes with  so now   you a former fast food employee who quit their job during the pandemic because they mistreated you like scum  are now seen as scum by older generations for quitting   and ironically  these same older generations say  fast food isn t a real job  well if it isn t a real job  why call millennials lazy for not wanting to work fast food  they re lazy for not wanting to work  non real jobs  huh  aren t you guys the same people who said  well if you don t like it  find a better paying job  which millennials did take your advice and now you guys are mad about it  lol   tldr  corporations sold the american people lies about employees being  essential heroes  but not wanting to pay anything more than minimum  same fast food places were forcing workers to come in if they had covid while treating them even worse during the pandemic  fast food places nearly tripled in orders but did not have enough staff  which caused extreme pressure and workers working nearly 14  hours in many cases and greatly increased stress  many americans in turn assaulted and harassed workers because food was taking too long when they expect 100 chipotle items to be done in 10 minutes  not exaggerating  managers treated employees worse and fast food workers were being treated to inhumane levels  fast food workers toon the boomer s advice on  finding better paying jobs  and now boomers are mad because no one will make their big mac anymore,mzn2cu
362,The power structure of jobs are quite similar to dictatorships,i've been trying to figure out why i've always been struggling at work  and i think that might be it    we may be living in democracies  but jobs are basically privatized dictatorships with the only difference being that instead of being executed for disobeying the supreme leader  people get fired    seriously  i can't think of a time where i have less control over my life  the fact that i've grown up makes matters even worse because one of the best things of being an adult  if there is any  is to be in charge  however  it seems that i could bargain with bosses less than i could bargain with my parents as a kid  and with my teachers as a student    does it get better as i gain seniority  or is this a built-in feature of corporations ,mywc9x

365,Rant - empathetic people get the shaft in the workforce,in my personal experience  and through observations of other  empathetic people  i've become very disheartened  i've spent almost 15 years in management and other leadership roles  and in every case i've seen myself and other empathetic people shuffled to the side because our focus was on our people more than the short-term company gains   more broadly  if you do a google search for best careers for empaths  the lists you get back are full of service jobs  teaching  school counselor  etc  all of which are pretty low paying  especially if you're talking about someone looking to exit the corporate sector   rarely you can find highly empathetic senior leaders and company leaders  often because they helped build the company in the first place  but in my experience most people welcomed into upper leadership put the short-term bottom line before their employees   the thing is  outsiders to this sub will read that and think i have no idea how business works  except i do  i just reject the idea that it has to work that way  dan price is a great example of a highly empathetic leader who puts his employees first  but he built that company and maintained his leadership  i can't imagine that any company i've ever worked for would hire someone like dan into senior leadership  much less as ceo   sorry for the rant  i'm so tired having maybe a couple hours where i'm not eaten up by stress  wake up and immediate anxiety knowing i have go do something i hate  and currently can't find something i enjoy that can pay the bills  anxious all day  finally after dinner it starts to subside  but then a couple hours before bed time knowing i have to do it all again kicks things back into gear   i like working  i don't mind working for someone else  but i want to be valued as a person and for the strengths i bring to the team  not whether or not i can make the company the most amount of money possible ,mzspb0

386,“They’re desperate for workers you should apply”,i m so tired of this narrative  i get i  need  a job  but if the place is already understaffed why would i want to work there  my dad sends me links to apply places his friends recommend that they can get me into and every time it s  they re 3 months behind  you can start right away  in an industry i have no experience in where i m going to be under constant stress to get things done because they can t keep themselves staffed  where s the appeal in that  i just want to help people in a dynamic environment that keeps me engaged  why is that so hard to find  i m so tired   endrant,mz6hpt
387,"u/KatnissXcis says, ""You're not a great individualist if you rely on the exploitation of others, you're a leech.""", this may be surprising but this is how i understand individualism  to me you're not a great individualist if you rely on the exploitation of others  you're a leech who most likely lacks the necessary skills to provide for yourself  and if your slaves were to become individualists you'd most likely     die   if you are a capitalist supporter  you're probably not a true individualist by action of exploitation ,mzgsao
388,I hate businesses operating with little to no regard for covid while my industry is still in shambles,prior to the pandemic i was a freelance musician in austin  tx  i moved there after the ringling brothers circus closed in 2017  i had been touring with them in the band prior to moving there  was on an insane grind for two years getting established in the scene in austin  by april 2019 i finally had enough teaching and playing work to leave my pt job  amp  freelance full time  working insanely hard  both in jobs  amp  practicing  was what got me to that point    by the end of 2019 i was living the life  more gigs than i could handle  i was actually having to pass some along to other players  life was great    when the pandemic hit i couldn't get through unemployment  couldn't afford to stay in austin with no gigs  so i left  now i'm in the midwest making  16 hr as an assistant manager at a trampoline park and hate it     16 hr isn't shit  after taxes it comes to just under  2k mo  that literally leaves me nothing after i pay bills and buy groceries  the owners are booking around 20 birthday parties every saturday  won't let us enforce masks  capacity limits are a joke  and it kills me    it kills me places like this can operate with virtually no restrictions  yet my entire industry is still in shambles  i'm so pissed the life i had worked so hard to build for myself has been stripped due to things completely out my control for the second time  the first being the circus closing  i was planning on doing that gig until retirement    my boss at the park asked me if i enjoyed my  fat check  the other day  because the owners were in hawaii on vacation  amp  didn't get my direct deposit info on time  so i had to wait another two weeks to get paid  i laughed in their face and told them i used to make that in a week    i hate everything about this country  it's disgusting how little people are expected to get by on  i'm not antiwork  i'm anti bullshit wages  forget  15 minimum wage  that doesn't let you get ahead at all  anyone who thinks that's enough should foad    i can't transition to a heavy online presence because that requires gear that requires money  and at my current rate  i literally never have enough left over to get what i need to get started    my only silver lining is that i have opportunities to audition for doctoral programs for fall '22  but even then  unless i get a tuition waiver and teaching assistantship  i won't be able to afford to attend  i'm trying desperately to save money but at my current pay it's literally impossible to do    i feel trapped  betrayed  hopeless  desperate  and broken  my main reason for wanting to get a doctorate is so i can get hired as a professor in a developed nation that actually takes care of its people  i hate this country ,mz2bri

390,I'm tired of the DEI theater,possibly us-centric  but not sure   dei   diversity  equity  and inclusion  is a crucial concept that has become a meaningless buzzword  i work at two different nonprofits and they are both constantly talking about promoting dei  yet they abuse their workers  which includes bipoc  we're asked to set personal dei related goals  when we have no power over company policy  dealing with this constant hypocrisy tires me out  i'd prefer it if the people in management just admitted that they were depraved individuals who don't give a shit ,mzc83c
391,always a double standard to be had.,i work a bullshit job which deals with very deadline-driven deliverables  ever since i started here i've been told by my boss and senior team member to work around other people's time constraints  for example   this person's going on vacation  make sure to get their required information before they leave  this person's traveling all day  make sure to only call them after they've arrived at their destination  this person won't be able to get you what you need until the end of the work day  make sure to work all night on your own time to get their stuff ready for the next morning   meanwhile  i bought a flight out of town several weeks ago  which my team already knows about  a project just came up today  its deadline is smack in the middle of my flight  i told them i'd like to get this project done a couple hours early so that it will already be submitted by the time i leave for the airport  which i didn't think would be a problem  instead of replying  oh  we'll make sure to work around your constraints and finish our portion of the project early to accommodate you  they gave me looks of disgust and confusion and said  why can't you just reschedule your flight   fuck this place lol,mzs7og

395,"My Department had an All-Hands video conference, a part of which was dedicated to what each of us enjoyed most about working from home for the past year.",only the 20  who worked out of corporate hq have been working from home    the rest of us have been at our facilities five days a week the entire time    many of us got covid because of it    one nearly died  and an employee from another plant did die    so we got to sit there ant listen for over a half hour while our lazy  unhelpful  over-paid counterparts got to gush about how great it is to be able to start dinner during your meetings  and just walk away from the computer at 5pm  and how much more time they get to spend with their families    and how they have finally had time to work out in the mornings  or on their lunch breaks    the c-level dept  head even gushed about how great it has been to be able to travel  and work online from various locations     and 80  of his employees were listening to it all  wearing the cheap surgical masks he had so graciously provided them to wear every working day  and finally understand exactly how little any of them mattered to their bosses ,mzvklv
396,How do I stop getting everyone's work when people retire?,let me preface this by i'm stuck here   as much as i hate it here there really isn't anything better given my age and place in life   i manage a super busy small office of 12 it's pure chaos and i can barely support myself on what i make   my boss makes  75k and they created my position to do 90  of his job   no i do not want his job   ever   it's bad enough at my level but it's worse at his   at least i can go home at 5pm he gets calls at all hours from people above him   he's one of those kiss ass charming bullies so he gets away with everything   i am not like that   i'd rather be poor than be him   there is another manager here and because i'm stupid i know more about her job than i should   in a year my boss and the other manager are going to retire   tag i'm it   if i don't come up with a game plan now my life is going to get a whole lot worse   i've been here 2 years and i took on additional work and today i gave it all back   that is step one   how do i start setting up my life so i'm not stuck doing their jobs because i stupidly showed them that i'm good at what i do ,mz4u03

399,Overworked and underpaid. Story of our lives.,i work in the public sector and have witnessed some horrendous behaviour and treatment from my employer  i'm flabbergasted by self absorbed egomaniacs who become managers and  leaders  it's truly disheartening to see people get treated like shit and i need to vent  i apologize for this lengthy post    our boss is a self absorbed  racist  thinks they are woke but really not  and treats their employees with utter disrespect  we've had high turnover in our department ever since our boss started  unusual in our field since most employees stay for a long time    the quickest someone has left was 2 weeks after they joined the job  we've had people who've worked there for years transfer to other positions or departments just to avoid our insane boss  my boss has their favorites but talks shit about everyone behind their back  every conversation you have with them is negative bullshit about work  their employees  or some drama between other higher ups or even their family members  it's honestly mentally tiring to have a conversation with them when they are talking shit about their own employees to you  when i am also their employee    my boss brings their pet employee   a part timer  very young lower level employee  with them to their house to run personal errands which i personally believe is a huge breach of ethics due to the age and power imbalance  boss makes this pet employee  mow their lawn  build furniture  help them move  takes them to run personal errands - one time which made that pet employee late to work because they were both running a personal errand together  my boss has been grooming this pet employee since it's their first real job and has basically been manipulating them into  becoming their lackey  now this pet employee sees boss' toxic behaviour as normal workplace behaviour  she excuses my bosses toxic behaviour as them having a bad day or saying they just have a lot on their plate  i have bad days too but i don't treat people like shit  it's frustrating because boss had treated me like shit some days and this pet employee excuses their behaviour when directly witnessing this shit  boss also tells this pet employee about all the interoffice bs   workplace problems  and personal confidential info  so this pet employee tells me this shit before anyone else even knows - i e  like when a employee is leaving a job  huge breach of company regulations   it's crazy how much bullshit my boss gets away with  funny thing is that boss was mad at pet employee one time and started talking shit about her to me  if she only knew    employees have complained but my boss was bragging to me one day about how hr sided with them  how is that something to brag about  it's honestly infuriating how people can get away with treating people like this  boss has said racist shit to me about other races and has made offhanded comments about my race and culture  i'm poc  i've brushed it off as ignorance but my boss is seriously a racist prick after i witnessed them making blatant racist and ageist remarks about white women  hypocritical bc they are white and middle aged  my boss is a loud  braggadocios blobfish who doesn't think before they speak and says the most ignorant comments  well apparently higher ups noticed and my boss started to complain about how they have to take more sensitivity training  the most infuriating thing is seeing them treat others like shit  i wish i can stand up and say what they are doing is wrong but at the end of the day it's easier to replace a lower level employee   i've stayed and witnessed the most insane bullshit from this birdpecked brainturd  i'm also overqualified and severely underpaid  but due to covid  job hunting has been hard  i accepted this job since it was my first real job and i liked that i was helping otherd  i love my job but this toxic work culture has made me hate what i do  my boss' toxic behaviour has also affected my confidence and mental health  i've started having anxiety attacks which i've never experienced before starting this job  i dread going into work everyday  the customers i see every day make up for that ,mymav2
400,Need advice on being talked to for comments, warning  wall of text   i was called into a meeting today regarding 2 comments i said during lunch time that the higher ups deemed 'unacceptable'  one of my comments were i was telling my co-workers how i was asking one of managers what i needed to know which task to prioritize  but i guess how i worded it when i was telling my co-workers the story was 'unacceptable'  i even  clarified with the high ups what i meant and what i actually said to the manager  they still said what i commented was 'unacceptable'   the other comment was i said i not gonna plan to work overtime after busy season  we already been pulling ot for several months now  their response was them giving me a lecture as to why certain task were assigned to me and even the other department and the reason why everyone is working all this overtime is so no one needs need to work till 7-8pm to pick up the slack  i already knew this  i don't need to be reminded  however  the whole reason why we are in this position is because they didn't hire enough ppl and we have had crazy turn over   but they were saying my comments will create a negative work environment  but in reality it's already happened i'm just opinions as senior who has been for many years now    i left the meeting just saying i understand but i also didn't apologize to them  however this conversation made my blood boil after thinking it over because it felt like what commented was twisted in the way i looked bad  and even though i tried to clarify what i meant  they still deemed it unacceptable    do you guys think i should escalate this incident to the owner of the company  thoughts are appreciated ,mys7qd
401,I HATE THIS FUCKING DAY,it's monday eve  my entire fucking work week starts all over again in just a few hours  mondays are the worst day for me  i know i'm not the only one     i just found this thread tonight  so i can spare my best friend this conversation that we have every sunday night hell everyday really  i think about work even when i'm not doing it because i know  it's coming    so it's beyond the 40 miserable hours a week at this point    i work in customer service  and i cannot stand  people  it's funny bc i never said that before i had a job  i am very introverted  small talk and the tons of unnecessary team meetings we have makes me want to jump out of my skin    the only thing that holds me together is  i'm not talking on the phone anymore  thank god  i do emails  i'm good at my job  and finally got another well-deserved raise    i thought that would give me some my fire to just bear this a bit longer   i was totally damn wrong    i have tried everything  online store  virtual assisting  youtube  baking  marketing  coding  graphic design and so fourth  nothing fits  that's not even counting the actual jobs i have had and hated before    i just don't want to dread waking up each day  it's just a terrible way to live considering we only have but so much time    i was watching someone and this girl said  this is your passion  i've heard that before of course  but it really hit me tonight    like wait  there's people who actually like what they do    they don't spend five days a week dreaming of a completely different reality  or looking up articles on what do to when you hate your job  articles that they already know by heart    they are so damn lucky    i just want to actually enjoy my life and not be homeless  that's it    but if i don't clock in  homeless it is  i also have family members that depend on me   i'm right back where i started    i love creative writing though i do that happily for free  maybe i can do that and get paid for it  people enjoy the chapters i share with them  i have got to figure something out    so sorry if this was all over the place  just venting ,myljc3

405,What should I do?,sorry if it doesn t relate to this subreddit but i kinda feel it does   i m currently 23 years old and i work as an electrical engineer  which i don t like and wanna do something about it  i wanna accomplish something by my 25th birthday so i won t have to wake up everyday and feeling like shit and sad that i didn t die in my sleep because now i have to go to work    i m very good at playing video games  fps to be specific  and i always wanted to upload videos on youtube and make living out of it  my friends always used to tell me that i should try record my gameplay and upload it on youtube since i can get some clips etc  honestly to me it s sounds like a dream where you do something you enjoy and also get paid for it   at the same time i also got some programming knowledge so that s another thing i can do  but i don t really have any passion for it  it s just something that i at least can tolerate doing    so the point is i don t really know what to chose and  spend 1-2 years to master and and make living out of it  i really wanna try the youtube thing but i believe it s very hard to succeed at it even if you got something to show  a lot of people also do this as well  at the same time programming is gonna be easier since i got engineering degree and junior level of knowledge  but i m still gonna end up like a typical wage slave that have to work from 9 to 5  i can t do both since i only got 5 hours of free time after work and because of that i won t be able to master both things   thank you in advance for your help ,mz4sbd

409,Family trying to guilt me because I won't work for less than unemployment.,i make 1 5x my weekly wage on unemployment than i did working full time pre-covid  i moved back home and my family passive aggressively says i need to get a job to better save to move out  it's not that i do not want to work  and trust me i am searching for jobs and apartments  but they don't understand me when i say i do not see the value in working 40  hours for less money than i do sitting at home collecting unemployment  i'm making more money for less work  that's the logical answer is it not ,mylniu
410,Maybe we should just accept that life for 99 percent is endless work,and buy energy drinks in bulk to shotgun every morning so we're almost as juiced up as our boss who can afford cocaine    embrace capitalism and soak up every second of our days off as we stroll round the mall and tell ourselves that this is what freedom is    the american dream is not dead  we're living it  we just need a healthy dose of caffeine to see it ,mzgnjh
411,How to spend 9 days to make up for 6 months of my life wasted?,so  next week i took time off because it was the soonest i was allowed to take paid time off as a new worker  and i must ask  what can i do so i feel like i didn't waste my break  that i relaxed  did something meaningful  and that it didn't go by too fast  i'm thinking of walking through some nature paths and parks  and crocheting for fun  but idk if that's enough  i'm really worried that it'll be gone in a flash  i feel like i worked so hard to not quit this job for 6 months  and to get one week of vacation in return feels like such an uneven exchange  how can i make this week off mean something ,mz538w
412,Louder for the people in the back!,  dam west   200 he  adamcbest  capitalism has told us that the american dream is becoming a megamillionaire or even millionaire  the american dream should be collectively building a society where nobody starve or goes homeless  and everybody is treated equally  fully insured and paid a living wage  ,myo5o7

414,I don't want to go back...,this is going to be super long so just a heads up there lol    i appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this but i mainly just want to get it off my chest and get it out in the world     ------------------------------  i m coming around to the big picture of that i have to go back into the work force again sometime soon  i have been unemployed for almost a year and unlike a lot of people i have lost my benefits and have been going without pay since october  my savings is slowly going down and i m realizing the time is coming that i need to do something about it and it s killing me  i understand i have to work  i m not lazy or anything like that either because when i worked  i busted my ass and made life changing sacrifices for nothing  my life consisted of work  work  work  and it has gotten me literally nothing   but i have been in the comfort of my own home and doing things that i love for almost a year and it s killing me knowing i have to give it up and become a slave again  i don t want to leave my fianc  and animals  i love being with them all the time and doing whatever i want  i don t have the pressure of meeting these stupid standards for the workforce or pretending i care about bullshit surveys  i also don t have to worry about my life vanishing before my eyes because i m working 40  hours a week to have a whole measly two days off   but as of right now my life is great and i see no fight to go back to working  i want to stay inside all day  no problem  i want to write all day  go right ahead  i want to go on a road trip  let s pack up  i don t want to go back to some bullshit ass place and have someone dictate my life  i don t want my life to be surrounded by work again and making sure i m right on time and make the good old boss happy    i don t want anyone to ever have power over me again  whether it be customers or managers  i don t want to get abused by these people ever again  i m not a doormat  i m human    i guess i should talk about it  i don t really talk about it that much and if i do  i just call him a fucking asshole  but this is where my main issues with work have scarred me   okay quick backstory  i started working at a grocery store right after high school  it was fine i was young  amp  trying to go to community college but it didn t work out because i picked income over school  then i moved to the midwest to be closer to my family but work took over and i was working so much i didn t have time for family  then i moved back home tried college again but i realized i wasn t a school person and worked retail and also a mobile clinic  i liked the clinic even though the hours were long but it was only on the weekends  then i got a certification for hr  amp  after that was completed  i quickly found a job and the job that completely fucked me up   i don t know why i even accepted the job  oct  2017  let alone stayed as long as i did  9 10 months  left june july 2018  my family was so proud of me because i found a  big girl job  and the work was easy enough but the place was horrible    it was for an adult day care and i was the administrative assistant  the interview was insane to me  i remember my future boss was making these mocking faces at me and using pressure and anger to try and throw me off guard  i walked out of the interview thinking  that guy is an asshole and there s no way i got that job because it seemed like he really didn t like me  a couple days go by and i get the call that i got the job  i was shocked because i literally didn t think i was going to get it and everyone told me to take it and maybe the boss was just being a bad cop to find the right person  it paid  14 65 an hour and i never made that much money before  at the time    my duties were  checking clients in from 7am-11am  i loved these clients and i feel so bad they are stuck in this shithole  calling potential hires  doing reference checks  and monthly charting  of course  some other things here and there but it was easy  but it was never enough for this douche bag  if the potential hire went ghost on me it was my fault  if the reference checks didn t match up to his standers or didn t give answers that he wanted it was my fault  if the reference checks never answered  it was my fault  everything was my fault  i was in charge of the food delivers and if the meal didn t come out how it was supposed to  he would expect me to scream at them and get angry with them  when i am not an angry person and i don t see a reason to be so hateful when two people can calmly talk about an issue  but if i didn't yell he would look at me with his squinted up eyes and scream at me for being weak    he would abuse me to pieces where i would cry going to work  at work  and coming home to work  i couldn t handle the pressure of everything being my fault again and again  i never received any training for anything so i figured it all on my own yet i never was enough compared to the woman who was here 14 years prior  if i had a question about my work i answered with a sigh  amp   how could you not know this  i remember i asked the nurse a question about the client charts  to make sure i was doing it right  and she went to him and complained that i asked her about it and he yelled at me for being so embarrassing  okay  i guess i should just fuck up the charts and when you guys get audited you guys can explain why they're wrong    he abused the social worker at the place too  he would scream at her as loud as he would scream at me  one time  before i got hired there  he threw the phone at her because he was so mad at her  how can your employee make you that angry  i tried everything i could to report him but he was best friends with the owner of the place and also ran the compliance program  that if you had to report an issue with the place  he would be in charge of it  i had an issue on my first week of the job where one of the drivers was being very flirty with me  he would make these comments about how i looked and would bring me coffee in the morning  i was 21 at the time and he was 50  i told the boss how uncomfortable i was with his actions and he laughed at me and told me to stop being stuck up for someone being nice    a few months of being hired there i found out my mom had cancer  ugh  i hate talking about this  he saw i was down and abused me even more  he wouldn t allow me to leave early and be with her because i had the weekend to do that  and when the cancer became terminal  eight months of being here  i had to write a report asking to take half days for her final weeks  once she passed  he gave me three days off to grieve and that was it  if i just lost my mom at 22  my best friend and i couldn t even spend that much time with her because i had to suck it up and do this stupid fucking job  i regret it so much  i feel so stupid that i did this and regret it more than anyone could know understand   the plan was to spread her ashes in florida  in an environmentally friendly way  i asked him if i could do this  was planning to do it no matter what  and i gave him three weeks notice  he gives me this very smug look and goes   you don t have vacation time until you re here for a year  i m don t think so  my mouth dropped to the floor and the tears started right away  i had to excuse myself and ten minutes later my phone rings and he goes   you know i had to make a couple calls and i guess you can go  charlie is going to have to do all your work for you and he s a real busy guy but he said he didn t mind  like you re such a piece of fucking shit  i m not going to kiss your feet because you  broke your back  to let me spread my mom s fucking ashes   after i came back  i remember i had this one reference check that wouldn t answer and i faxed this woman  i emailed her  and called her daily  yet  i get the call from him  screaming  to come to his office to sit down and talk  he had the other program director there and he was screaming at me telling me how much of a horrible worker i am and i can t do anything right and how he s disgusted that i can t get this reference to respond  i just lost my mom and you re yelling at me over a reference check  i take the abuse  there s a half hour left in the day  and write out all the abuse i have taken and what i witnessed with the other employees  i woke up early the next day and got to the office before anyone showed up and left my keys and the letter on my desk  i emailed the other hr people that were at the other location my letter and that was it   i escaped and to this day he s still there  i hate that i put myself through that and i wish i was smart enough to leave or not even accept the job    a few weeks later i was hired as a manager at a retail company  the customers sucked as always-- it s retail  but my manager was very nice  but i spent so much time working there and the abuse from a manager was replaced with abuse from customers  i left when covid happened because they weren t taking any precautions and i was exhausted from the customers that were upset over a two-dollar coupon  here take it i ll make it five dollars off if you just fuck off    my mom was an amazing woman but she worked all her life  she worked two jobs to make ends meet and i appreciate her sacrifice  but the year she was supposed to start her retirement she found out she had cancer and died  she spent her whole life working and not living  and i don t ever want to be that way  i don t want to work so much for a retirement that i might not even see one day  because no one is guaranteed their life at 60  shit people aren t even guaranteed their life the day they wake up and start their day    i just want to live     thank you for your time ,mz5pix

419,Do people want to achieve the dream.... or do they want to complain about it?,hey guys  so there are a few ways to achieve the dream of not going into work  i have almost done it myself  but  when i share how i did it here  i get alot of hate  when i show other people the path i took  i get alot of dislike  and nobody follows  i took the cryptocurrency route to breaking out of the debt slave cycle    but  here is something to think about  how do you break the cycle of work  how do you personally see yourself breaking out of the rat race  if you simply post here on reddit  and foment  and complain  and post memes  that will not change the fact that your boss has dollars  and you don't  it will not change the fact that your bosses boss paid dollars to get free government loans for employing you  and took a nice healthy helping for himself before he gave you those dollars  it does not change the fact that those dollars are also worth less than they were just two months ago  and all the supermarket prices went up  because the dollars that the gov gave to your bosses boss were printed out of thin air    the united states government is robbing you  your boss is robbing you  your bosses boss is robbing you  and of course  nobody will ever tax the likes of jeff bezos  cause jeff has his fingers in the government pockets  yay   so  here is the thing  unless you change your actions  you are doomed to grow poorer and poorer at just a slow enough rate that instead of getting mad and fighting back  you slip further and further into despair  you will never have enough spare money to date  buy a house  raise children  or do anything else a biological organism was meant to do  you will die young  poor  alone  impoverished  and your boss will make bank    so  the next point you will inevitably ask- how can i fight back  you cannot fight back through the legislature  you know why  your boss paid more money to the representatives of both parties than your entire neighborhood makes  your elected representatives listen to the people who pays the bills  your bosses  you cannot fight back with weapons  the police will shoot to kill  and will outgun you entirely    there is however one way you can fight back  you can change the narrative about what has value  do intricate pieces of paper art that are mass printed have any inherent value  no  that 100 sign magically confers that the piece of paper is worth more than the 1 when you need to buy food  never mind the fact that the fed prints both for free and gives them away to your bosses via the bonds market  the moment people stop believing that the us dollar has any value is the moment when the entire edifice of work  and the society that has been built as a prison around us comes crashing down    this is why cryptocurrency is important  if the haves suddenly see all their net worth evaporate  and the have nots suddenly see these magical tokens they hold on ledgers suddenly have value  then wealth is redistributed to the masses    so  is cryptocurrency a big ponzi scheme  maybe  but if its a ponzi scheme  is a scheme with a goal in mind  burn down the bigger ponzi scheme that is reckless federal printing and giving of free money to the 1  we need a major wealth redistribution  and the only way that is going to happen is if all cryptocurrencies take off in value  cryptos are something that the everyday person can hold onto and obtain value from  you are a slave to the system  and you need to break free ,mxqrj8

421,How I view everything,the government had black slaves that were taken away from them for humane justices  so they needed legal slaves  black slaves did all the hard labor work  and i mean all of it and when this was taken away there were no slaves left to work freely    so the government needed to devise a way to get people to work for them still  they created minimum wage  and it s called this because it s what the minimal amount of money s needed to keep the worker  slave  coming back for more money   never satisfied only hungered  since a wealthy man is seen more than    as population grew the number of labor jobs grew  as well as the overall segregation began to collapse  white people began to take black peoples jobs not by choice but because there was nothing left since what was rightfully just became fruition and black people started obtaining non-slave labor jobs    and because of all of this nothing ever changed  so the government created colleges to educate people so they wouldn t have to have labor jobs aka slave jobs  but the lack of access to college for a mass majority of americans has created a system of failures    and now in 2021 you have jobs paying not enough money to afford a no bedroom studio apartment  everyone is either living with their parents  leeching a relationship  or homeless  a bunch of kids taught to work to live is the only answer  trickled along by a 15  a hour on a rope hanging over their head  blinded by the thought that it should be 44  a hour    the government spends trillions of dollars to fight an imaginary war  a government who allows billionaires to milk the poor  a government who cares more about its own image than its own citizens  who spends less money on us than any other country  who for the past 5 years has destroyed democracy  a government who has created a uncertain future for 80  of its people  a government who only cares about the wealthy  a government who denies mentally ill people disability income  a government of just absolute shit    until the government stops legal slave ownership  i refuse to work  i am anti work because i refuse to bust my ass for 40 hours a week to make 600  before taxes  in a world where apple charges 660  for a headset  it doesn t add up   i rather be poor than work and be poor  we all die and take nothing with us  there s no point ,mxz1ps

440,Seasonal work may be an alternative for those who hate traditional work.,i stumbled across this sub and have been lurking for awhile  the system sucks  and it really does feel like torture if you dislike your job working in general    look into seasonal work if you work a shitty minimum wage job and want out  many companies have employee housing and either cover the cost of your housing or charge a small fee for rent  100- 200  the company i work for charges  120 month for housing utilities and pays for 3 meals a day  you also get to travel to beautiful places- national parks  overseas  etc  you re still working a 9-5 that may may not suck but it does relieve a lot of stress about making rent  having money for other necessities  and you can travel every 3-6 months if you choose to move around to different seasonal locations  seasonal locations typically need a lot of workers and will take anyone they can get too  so there s less of a barrier to entry when you apply  if you re going to be forced into a shitty 9-5 for a company you hate  might as well travel and pay little or no rent  it would free up a lot of money for debt payoff  saving  and investing as well    i know this post doesn t necessarily fit into anti-work  but i hope someone finds this helpful or looks into this as another route in life until you can get to the point of not working  if this doesn t apply to you i m sorry for wasting your time  amp  have a great day  i m sorry so many of you are unhappy and struggling in regards to work finances  and best of luck to you ,myd3qn

472,"Graduating in two weeks, not excited at all to enter the work force",i am an engineering student who graduates in two weeks  i have a good job lined up with a good salary and benefits  but i am not excited for it at all   in fact  as i think more and more about my future i am feeling sadder and sadder  i have only have two internships in college  which was my main perspective into the work world  but those were both very depressing  they were both 8-5 corporate engineering jobs where i went into an office for 8-9 hours a day to do 2-4 hours of work   i cannot escape that i was lied to by everyone i  my life that graduating and getting a good job would make me feel happy and fulfilled  but i am now realizing that i do not think work will make me happy or fulfilled and rather it is simply a means of acquiring the money i need to live  i just felt so sad having so much of my time taken up by work and having almost no time to do the things i actually enjoy  also  i hate that everyone else seems to just have accepted these poor conditions  especially when so much time is wasted at the office anyways   i do not consider myself lazy as i graduated with honors from both my high school and college  but i really hate the idea of having to work a corporate job for the next 40 years of my life just to support a family with kids    at this point  i m really not sure i even want kids if it means i have to work a job i hate to support them and i lose all my free time and freedom  why make those sacrifices just for kids   anyways  i am feeling very sad about graduating  even though i didn t have the best time in college because i dealt with a lot of anxiety and depression and i had to work hard because of engineering  and i m not sure what to do  i am thinking about joining e peace corp but my current partner doesn t seem like they would support that   i honestly wish i had done an easier degree and partied and had fun through out college if i knew i was going to have leave college and work a depressing job regardless of what i majored in  i also know some people with easier degrees who seem to have the same level of jobs   anyone have any advice on how to overcome these feelings or patches other than general corporate work ,mxabma

474,our society is mechanistic and doesn't allow for emotions,one of the worst parts about work culture is that it demotes our humanity  in more ways than one   at the workplace  the only feeling that is allowed is surface positivity   and the way work is set up in its mechanics and logistical aspects  your mood and your current place in life is irrelevant to the job  you just broke up with someone or was sexually harassed at a bar during the weekend or your cousin just died  it doesn't matter  you're supposed to be at work   it doesn't matter if i'm feeling sad and need to isolate myself from other humans for a while  it doesn't matter if i need to focus on grieving the fact that i've been ill for months at my own pace  i need to be at work because it's a weekday  for fuck sake   we're not people with our own lives  moods and feelings - we're just tools  beasts of burden   for some reason  we are to treat our coworkers as beasts of burden  but also as family members  at the same time   let's do some customer service  let's get those sales  guys  let's not deal with our shitty attitudes towards each other and focus on getting those sweet  life-affirming stats    society does need mechanized aspects in order to function well for a huge amount of people  but we humans have allowed ourselves to mechanize our own minds  our entire lives  in order to devote ourselves to never-ending production and never-ending optimization of efficiency  but  we are not machines  we are feeling animals ,mxnx8i

477,Employers weaponize work friendships against you--anyone ever study this in depth?,i grew up idolizing the ideal of friendships forged through camaraderie at work  i didn t even believe authentic friendships could be formed outside of a shared venture--if not doing work together  then chasing a trophy on a sports team  or invading a country together in an army   despite realizing my idiocy  i still have made some of my best friends at work  and how convenient this has been for employers trying to squeeze every last drop out of me  i ve chosen to endure many an abuse of management because i knew dropping the ball would screw colleagues who a  i love  and b  are under the same pressure     the energy workplaces put into  culture  tells me that employers are aware of this dynamic and want to encourage it  i can t yet prove it  let alone explain the method   but if someone has formalized the technique of weaponizing friendships to make you work harder  it s gotta be out there somewhere in a book  in the corporate world  no cabal s secret can outlast someone s desire to be a thought-leader   perhaps one of you can point me in the direction of a good source ,mx4w8a

527,Weekend gone in a trance,my job isn't the worst in the world by a long way  but it's pressured  and after a buy-out and continual  harmful change in the years since - including several rounds of redundancy  giving everyone who doesn't lick boots bad appraisals to coax them to accept redundancy  etc  - i can't say it's an environment that is helping me thrive  where i'm at is much closer to burnout    this weekend i probably spent most of my time  running away  - in various ways  most involving the internet or my smartphone  not much going out right now amid the pandemic  - and not doing a ton of stuff that  had i done  would've made me feel much better about my life   why did i do that  this evening i've been reflecting on that  as i'm sure you can imagine    it's because i feel like shit  it's because my career  which has always been an important part of my life  and the company i work for  which i cared about deeply  has been shat on from a great height by assholes who if they saw good management would try to destroy it  it's because the time i have spent immersed in the hell they have turned the place into has sapped so much of my self esteem that i feel utterly hopeless  that i cannot possibly succeed in anything - so what's the point in trying - not just professionally but as a person as well   of course there was a point in trying  and now it's too late to do anything about that  but i hate that this whole situation has happened  despite efforts by many good people to stop it  most of them no longer part of the organization  i hate the effect this has on me    if this hopelessness was conscious i'm confident i'd spot it fairly quickly and shake it off  but it's like being in a trance  and by the time i start to come out of it the weekend is almost over   can anyone relate  has anyone found a way to deal with it ,my9j6m

545,Choosing between crippling anxiety or functional depression while working,i've never been this depressed in my adult life   2 years ago i left a high stress job in the dental field where i'd work 3  occasionally 4  long  10-12  hour days  plus one half day a week and almost always a 3 day weekend  i had benefits  while not very good ones  but did get a decent amount of vacation and sick time  the office i worked at would close for a week at a time probably 9 months out of the year  some months  like december  would have 2 weeks off in a row  during those i could use vacation time and i had the option to work on projects as needed desired for hours   this job gave me crippling anxiety and worsened my pre-existing but then undiagnosed chronic pain and illness  i would work myself into the ground every single shift  i was constantly sick and by the end of my 6 years there was having anxiety attacks nearly every day i was there  i developed chronic back pain  spasms  issues that i still deal with constantly    eventually  i had to quit  someone i know offered me a job at a small local business  shorter hours but more days a week  easy office job  no benefits  but at least i wouldn't be so stressed all the time   fast forward two years  i have been ignoring my chronic pain issues because i don't have insurance  i quit physical therapy because i no longer have a day off during the week to take care of that type of thing  i still get horrible back pain and spasms and sitting in an office all day makes it much worse  i'm currently dealing with a pinched nerve in my neck and back pain and am exhausted    over the 2 years i've been here i've had one paid week off  2 unpaid weeks off and during covid we did not fully shut down but my hours were drastically reduced and i basically came into work to do what needed to be done  which took maybe 2-3 hours twice a week  i am here 32 5 hours a week  30 on the clock  sitting in this goddamn uncomfortable chair in pain    since things have been reopening our work has become busier and busier  i work in the office of a construction home remodel type company  i am constantly berated by people who are impatient  rude  and have too much money  i have no authority here  i literally do office work  answer the phone  pay bills  make appointments  i am not involved in the rest of the things that go on here    i am exhausted i am drained  the phone rings constantly  people hang up on me or yell at me if i have to schedule an appointment for them they don't want to wait for  they don't care that this is a very small business  less than 10 employees  they don't care we have probably one hundred jobs lined up currently and they are not special  they have to wait like everyone else  i am the first contact  the front line  the last contact  i am the only woman who works here  sometimes men won't even give me the time of day when i try to get information from them or answer questions  they will only talk to my boss  a man    i am paid more than minimum wage but am still low income  not low enough for state insurance or any benefits  low enough that i can't afford it myself  low enough that if i was single i couldn't afford to live in my house anymore    i am so depressed  i've never worked this much in my life and while it's not  that much  it's still 5 days a week and 35 hours of my week spent driving or at work away from home    when i was doing very limited hours during the height of covid i was painting  practicing guitar  walking my dog and seeing my family nearly every day  now i'm lucky to get in a dog walk  i haven't painted since i came back to work full time  i havent picked up my guitar since then either  i see my family much less  my so works about 60 hours a week and i don't see him much either  there are days i go home and by the time he gets home around dinner time i haven't had a single pleasant interaction with another human being and because he has worked a 12 hour day he barely has the energy to talk to me and eat dinner before falling asleep watching tv    how is this living  i am miserable  i want to die nearly every day but could never do that to my sister or my so or my dogs  the best thing that's happened since going back to work with covid was getting another dog  i can't think of much else that has made me happy over these last  10 months    i am at work crying and why am i even here  i'm literally doing nothing  i am in a lot of physical pain  i am not mentally well  i was yelled at by a customer for a delay i am not involved in but i am the messenger  i am exhausted     if you read this all  thanks  i'm not really sure what to do  i can't leave this job for reasons i don't want to share on here and i live in a rural area where not much is available anyway  i hate zoom therapy and haven't had an in person appointment since last february  it's just nice to feel like i'm not the only one struggling with this ,mwbf5y

551,The unemployment numbers are not accurate and completely fucked.,  there are 60 000 households who are surveyed for work  according to the bls  this is supposed to be  representative of the entire united states    the way this is conducted  50  of the sample remains the same from year to year   this is such a small sample  i know of no one  including myself  my parents  my extended family  or friends who have ever been contacted by the census bureau for labor interviews    it's absolutely bullshit  there are 122 million households in the us  how is interviewing 60 000 of them anywhere close to being accurate  even a million would not be a 1 in 100 sample rate    but to find out how many people aren't working  we need to find out how many are   pre pandemic employment in the us was about 163 million citizens  politicians  elected persons  and military are not counted    not everyone can work at 18  many jobs require the age to be 18  and many people chose not to work in high school  so let's completely cut out 18 and under from our work    it's also a tad messy to work around teen employment because for whatever confusing and stupid reason  a lot of bls charts go from like age 16 to 24  for example  17 million are employed between 16 and 24  but this counts 18 to 24  a 6 year difference  there is also little data on people working on farms and other jobs you can start at 14-15  mcdonald's will let people as young as 14 work  depending on state laws  the bls does not even count people under 16    we are left with about 255 million people  of 2019 numbers which are probably estimates from the 2010 census    54 million people are over the age of 65 currently  but  8 9 million are working  us with 45 million we can get rid of too  this brings us to 210 million people over the age of 18 who are able to work or retired and working or need to work   but we aren't done  for starters  inmates have never been part of unemployment figures  they account for 2 1 million  not counting people in immigration detention  youth detention  etc    so now we are down to 208 million  we also need to figure people with extreme mental or physical disabilities that prevent them from holding any kind of job  the data gets foggy on this  but the best number i can find is 11 million people cannot hold any employment due to severe physical or mental impairment and receive disability payments on account of it  there are people who are disabled and can work with the use of an assistant or work in a field where blindness  deafness  loss of mobility  etc is not an issue     this brings us to 197 million people  now remember  the workforce does not count military  so we need to balance that out  now i won't count  reserves  because many in reserves also hold employment  and honestly it starts splitting hairs at that point  active duty is 1 3 million  bringing us down to 196 million people   alright  i think that covers everyone  we removed under 18  people in prison  people disabled to the degree of not being able to work  and people over the age of 65 who are not looking for work  our grand total is 196 million people  but i want to do more work to make a more accurate figure   from the latest data i can find  3 million high school students between 16 and 18 work  or 1 in 4  remember the workforce is not counted below age 16  this makes 9 million we can remove from the 196 to make 187 million   12 million total  3 million working   so realistically  the true unemployment rate in the us is  12 8  quite a difference from the 3 5  boasted in 2019 before the pandemic     i'd hate to think how high it is now with as many people still out of work or on unemployment ,mwoqbz

556,I really want the people who make job searches awful to be named and shamed,this is going to read like a rant because it is  hiring processes are all so fucking bloated and i fucking hate it  but people aren't helping    i heard from several boomers that a store is taking walk in interviews for 15 dollars an hour  i've been pretty hard up so i followed that lead  knowing it was a boomerism  of course  each and every sign that even smelled like a job offer had  apply online  plastered all over it  sometimes in bigger text than the  walk-in interview  part  i guess the boomers didn't like that part so they ignored it  they will continue to feel validated that they proved  all jobs are processed online  to be a lie until they leave this earth  oh  and it wasn't anywhere close to 15    so after a wasted trip to jump on the chance to skip the online process  i went home and filled out their shitty fucking personality quiz  their insanely inefficient data entry and hit apply  i had to give my address to make the account  i had to give my address again to pick what store i wanted to work at  i had to give my address again to apply for the specific position  there were three  and all of them had a separate nonsense job-title and the same description  and i had to fill out my entire fucking address at least two more times on other paper work adjacent to the job  like confirming that i can work in the us and something else  that all took me about 30 minutes   i did the walk in thing the next day  they asked me some stupid fucking open ended questions about my experience  side eyed my patchy work history for a fucking  seasonal  position  like how the ever living fuck are you going to say anything about an inconsistent work history if you literally offer inconsistent work  eat shit and choke on it you fucking inbred excuse for a person    they told me i pretty much have the job  this was 3 days ago  they sent me home with instructions to come back  an hour and a half later  for the drug test  this store was a 20 minute drive  the fucker told me to my face that he did that because he wanted his lunch break    so they stick a fucking swab in my mouth to make sure they don't let anyone who participates in the devil's cabbage doesn't have the privledge of dealing with slackjaw customers 8 hours a day  and send me home  i spent twice as long driving as i did getting drug tested  if the entire fucking lab fell into a sinkhole i'd mark it on my calendar  people told me to  get a real job  when i was trying to write for a living  but most people actively make life worse for everyone and i fucking hate them    i'm now waiting for them to fucking email me a consent form so they can do a background check  i've not received one  but i have gotten an email telling me that i'll get another email that i need to click a link on  i don't know if their knotted  bloated  automated system shit the bed or if he was just wasting my time incase someone else didn't show up for work    every single step of this process is a direct  intentional actionable act of pure malice by multiple  possibly dozens of people  why shouldn't i view these people with the same amount of hate and disgust they treat me with  why do they get to hide behind anonymity if you can't even vote on a union without people bending over backwards to make sure the voting  booth  is in plain sight of the bosses     we just need to start over  it's rotten to the core  i'm tired of pretending these people are human ,mwm464

560,I have lost hope that I will ever find a job I’m happy in,i was recently fired from a job that completely destroyed my mental health  the experience of that toxic workplace and this sub has completely changed my mindset on the world of work   i often wonder if the 250k or so members of this sub are somewhat enlightened in a way  i assume most of us have been through an awful experience in work that has changed our views   i ve been unemployed since i was fired and have been living off my savings while i wait for the job market here in the uk to somewhat get back to normal  the incident has truly made me feel like a complete failure  i m 25 and i really am struggling to see any sort of future for myself   i feel once you really experience a toxic  degrading workplace you can t see the world in the same way  even in my time away from work  the horrible dark cloud of knowing one day i will have to return has made enjoying the time near enough impossible   browsing job adverts daily is horrible  the same buzzwords  the same corporate nonsense  the ridiculous number of hoops you are expected to jump through to work in these vile companies who barely pay above minimum wage  i m so sick of it  and i just can t bring myself back to the misery of my previous job  i feel like i m out of options  watching time slowly pass me by every day  of course i have been able to enjoy my hobbies  it s been a true escape  but it feels like it s exactly that  ignoring the real world and the stress and sadness i know it will bring again   i hope there s someone out there that may have been in a similar situation and if there was any advice on how you recovered  i would appreciate it so much  please let me know ,mw61z5

563,does anyone have advice about quitting an extremely understaffed job with overemotional coworkers?,since covid  the company i work at has been laying people off  everywhere causing every single person at the company to carry pretty much double or triple the workload they were once responsible for  i won t get into it more than that but the environment of the company now has led me to the decision that i m ready to go  however the company has forced everyone  including me at times  to feel as if you owe something to it and your coworkers  constantly using the  we re a family  and  we are here for each other  language  and most insidiously imo  occasionally using hr people to hang our benefits packages over our head  reminding us that we have healthcare and all this shit only because we work there  i know in my conscious brain these are obviously tactics to keep you too guilty to set boundaries or quit  but i do feel as though sometimes i can t go through with my plan to leave in a few months because i  owe  it to them for letting me work right out of college and through the pandemic  healthcare  etc   i also am terrified of even having that conversation with my boss because she is extremely emotional and self-invested to the point where i hate telling her the truth because it just never comes across correctly to her    i want to give two weeks but some people say give up to a month s notice if you work in an understaffed environment  i mean really i want to just leave the day i tell them i m quitting but i don t think that s totally an option if i ever want to work again    sorry for the rant  basically tldr just want to know if anyone s had experience quitting a super understaffed  office  job where everyone is very emotionally invested in the  family  fa ade of the company and you know people would take your leaving personally ,mw9pu1
564,Just packed up and walked out..., please don t follow my example unless you have money saved up   today ends 2 years of torment at an abomination of a company    story time   2 years ago i was hired by this company to come in and manage their engineering projects  i came in with all kinds of processes and tools ready to wrangle everything up  within 2 weeks it was glaringly clear that they were understaffed  ok  i can work with that  i will use my expertise and put together some tools to demonstrate we are understaffed and present it    done  boss says   we cannot get headcount  you ll have to make due  i respond that its not possible  deaf ears  13 active development projects and production support with one engineer    3 months later i am the scapegoat for everything being late and i sat in fear for months my job was in jeopardy  worked to the bone and every week it was a 1 on 1 about how i need to improve etc etc    new year rolls around  i was able to close out 8 of the 13 projects in 9 months to the tune of  5mil in replacement and new incremental business  no raise  no bonus  no thank you  i was rewarded with a demotion from management to engineering because   its your background and we need engineering help  it will only be 3 months    pay stayed the same i guess thats fine  holy crap was i wrong  they quickly piled on new business and overwhelmed me and the other day engineer  he put in his notice  they move another employee like me to engineering from a different role  the 2 of us survived all the covid layoffs while they kept adding projects    well another year passed and out of nowhere they sell our division to a competitor  who is smaller and mom and pop not corporate  we lose a majority of our benefits  all of our bonuses and vacation  we had no control and accepted the new roles to stay employed    i kept my title and pay  but was told still do engineering  figured i d give them a try while i job hunt    they add more and more work  they switch databases and tell me and the 1 other engineer to do the data entry  i ll spare the details but roughly 800 hours of data entry to go along with the 24  24  development projects for 2 engineers  we work 50 hours a week and get called part timers when we leave at the end of the day because its just so funny    well today i hit my limit when my retard of a boss promised a full development project that usually takes 12 weeks to be done in 1 week  which means its all on me  he proceeds to leave early after dropping that bomb    so i apologized to my fellow engineer who is also my friend irl and packed my things and walked out    i have a few months salary but last time i was unemployed it took 6 months   i still need to sell my time so i am accepting good luck in my job search until i can leave the rat race    thank you all for reading  typing this out helps in a way ,mwg528

574,My experience at Walmart,i used to work for walmart as a cart pusher and i wanted to talk about my garbage experience  i need some answers to some questions that genuinely confuse me   i started workin at walmart as a cart pusher in november of 2016  i immediately hated the job it was hard  i always stunk cause of sweat and you were expected to work in the elements unless it s a tornado or flood    i somehow stuck with it for a year and by then i figured out some tips that made the job way easier   we had a cart pushing machine that did a lot of the pushing we just directed them to the left or right   the grocery side was harder and more busy so us cart pushers organized and split the work evenly  the hard side had three or two people and the easy side had one or two but don t feel bad for them that side is so easy i offered to take it by myself and have the other 4 people work on the hard side    they were friends and i wanted to be able alone and finish work stress free so it all worked out   btw we moved around daily so it s fair   ok to the point we got so good with this setup to the point where we were able to get all the carts in 20 minutes or less and then half would be gone by 30 minutes  half is not much they re not enough to jam to cart corrals   we turned a hard shit job that no one wanted and no one could fill for more than a few weeks into a sweet setup   instead of having workers come from inside the store to help us we sometimes went in to help our friends we liked all while doing our jobs to the fullest and more  we found enough time to clean and when all that was done we would sit for 10 minutes to 30 behind the carts to relax and get off our feet  after that half the carts would be gone we d go get them in 15 minutes or less then rinse and repeat   this worked out for a year until a bitch customer service manager who does nothing but get on her phone and micromanage people got on us    the store manager didn t care at first and pretended to discipline us but soon he started taking her side after she bitched for long enough    she tried to micromanage us she caused a bunch of people to quit and ruined our flow  everytime we recovered she did the same thing   my question is why the fuck would you shoot yourself in the foot like that   you couldn t find anyone to fill this position before and now you found some people who can do it and go beyond and find time for themselves and to relax why would you fuck with that  you literally lose more money and productivity goes down when you get on us for just relaxing a bit   my jobs duties are cleaning the front of the store area and getting in carts i did more than that why micromanage me when you don t do shit  then soon all the managers got on to us for that   y,mwjp57
575,The only time you have power in a job,if you feel like quitting your job  you've just achieved the point of power in your job  being able to say  f you  and walk away is exactly what your employer doesn't want  they want quiet accepters  people who will take any crap that is thrown at them   it's easier to be in this position if you have some sense of stability  rich supportive family  savings  new job offer  and therein lies one of the secrets of being born to privilege  you never have to suffer a crappy job and can always have confidence to complain and make your job better  for everyone else  we suffer anything until we can get one of the other two sources of financial stability  a new job or savings   having the confidence to throw the job away at a whim and be able to tell your superiors about your intention often results in being offered a raise or a better work life balance or blah blah  things they could have given you but didn't until they felt threatened  i wonder what solutions there are to achieving this level of confidence when you have no financial stability  i've deluded myself to that point in the past and it worked well for me  but in the end the job wasn't worth the extra benefits    i went through a phase of a capitalistic mindset  doubled my income over 3 years  constantly moving from one job to the next  but there was no real satisfaction  the job was actually mind-numbing and was never given any respect  accounting  working with idiots who talk down to you all the time is not worth the mediocre salaries you can make in accounting  not including executive positions you can potentially achieve in that industry   there's no point to this post other than a rant  so cya ,mwgldw

585,The real reason why there is a big lack of automation.,you can't exploit a robot   a 24x7 mcdonald's spending  10 an hour on a fry cook would spend over  87 000 in one year's time and  870 000 in ten years time assuming wages did not change   in contrast  you can buy a machine that makes pizzas from dough  prep and bake for around  50 000  a fully automatic pizza machine    so how much would it cost to make a robot that could fry fries  probably a little more or less   the point being  the cost would be less than a year of paying a worker at mcdonald's  the technology to do it has been around over 10-15 years  too    so why aren't these places automating  especially when they are having more trouble finding work now than ever before   because automating all these jobs would make a large number of people unemployed  and then of course the next logical step would be universal basic income or ubi   the ruling class does not want ubi either    so i don't see fully automated mcdonald's being a thing for quite some time ,mwpnl5

592,It's all a lie!,i need to be honest  i drank the juice and i paid for it    i was a manager of an average office job  i championed the mission of the organization to my team  i worked late at night and even early in the mornings  i stood up for the  non-existent  integrity of the organization to my team members  even when the company was clearly in the wrong  i did it all  and i was fired    i believed the narrative they tell  this is a mission that is worth investing in and committing to  the problem is that they never invest in you  but boy of boy they'll tell you they do    when i first began at the job  during the interview i explicit told them that i have high expectations to be trained well  except their version of training was  sink or swim  i quickly sinked  and almost 4 or 5 months into me starting  my boss took over all of my leadership responsibilities  weekly one-on-one meetings with team members  that's my bosses job now  leading larger team gatherings  that's my bosses job now  quarterly reviews of my team  that's my bosses job now  the only thing i had to just me was my weekly team meetings  and the worse part is  this was announced when i was on vacation  i took a week off and came back to this new system  i was told that i wasn't providing enough direction  and they needed someone there to do that  was i perfect at my job  no  did i wish that instead of replacing me  they trained me  yes  did they do that  no  they blind sighted me  and my  authority  in the company dropped drastically   once covid hit  my team began to meet online for our weekly meetings  like i said  the only part of the job that i kept as the  manager  was the team meetings  my boss  who was running the show almost entirely at this point  wanted to drop in and listen in on the meeting  usually the atmosphere is casual  people are relaxed  but everything stiffened up during this meeting  the next day i was told that i don't have a team anymore  i was given a different job that previously wasn't held by a someone with a  management  title  was i perfect at running meetings  no  but should they have put a deeper look into things than to just drop in on one meeting   all throughout this process i had tried to advocate that i needed more training  but nothing changed  i kept on being told  we don't have the resources to train you right now  and my favourite line of all time  we're in a spot where we can only afford 'bandaid solutions'  not long-term solutions  i was finally able to convince my boss that i needed training and we got registered into some online program that you can pay for classes on specific areas of growth for managers  did we ever use it  no  did we pay for the subscription for 8 months straight  yes   and it actually feels like a betrayal that this whole time  no matter how much it felt like they didn't train me  no matter how many times they didn't stand up for me  i was still advocating for them  i was still working the 60  hour weeks  i was still giving them the best i had to offer  the ceo of the company had only met with me 2 or 3 times up until this point  but he was always very supportive  at least i thought he was  he always said things along the lines of  i see a great future for you  and  you have so much potential  and i remember being a lot like you  blah blah blah  1 week before he fired me he told me that he sees himself as a mentor in my life  thanks mentor   just 2 more facts to help solidify the crap that is this company  firstly  in 1 years time  11 of the 13 employee's in my cluster of departments had quit  when i had talked to some of the higher ups about this  all they had to say was  oh that just happens every 2-3 years here  ummmm  why  maybe if this wasn't such a crappy place to work that wouldn't happen  i tried writing them a letter as to why i think this is the case  and how i think we could make changes to fix this  no response  second  of the last 5 people to have my position  none of them lasted longer than 1 year  4 were fired and 1 changed jobs  when i asked about this  i was told  i don't want to confuse stories  their story is not your story   anyways  i was fired  the whole time i kept thinking about how i wanted to be remembered and celebrated here  but in the end i never was  i was let go  and no one was told about it until after my last day  they told me after a few months they'd reach out and celebrate me then  but it's been 4 and nothing at all    i'm pleading with you  please don't believe the crap they tell you about growing you  you mean nothing to these people  they don't care about you  and all they want is production  you are only a means to an end  nothing more      rant is over ,mvsicl

630,We are generation fucked.,i try to remain optimistic  but it's really hard to when the future does not look good   currently  a large amount of our political body on both a state and federal level is composed of old boomers who have little to no clue about things like the internet  or the state of the economy for people age 35 and under    over 31  of all single family homes are owned by landlords  and that number climbs daily because homes bought by landlords rarely get sold to non-landlord buyers  we are seeing an increase in the number of large corporations including blackrock buying up massive amounts of real estate   those wanting to find a  starter  or fixer upper home are left in the dust because of how popular it is for flipping houses  they buy a house for  100k  spent  30k on it  and somehow can add another  30k in value because of the  30k in improvements  so the  100k house becomes a  160k house with only  30k in improvements  these flippers often have massive capital and can buy in cash  wish is pretty much a death blow to anyone needing to purchase with a mortgage    not only is college expensive as hell  with the rates continuing to constantly outpace inflation  it is said the  total cost  of a master's degree including loan interest  room and board  etc is about  400 000   the median wage of a master's holder is  68 000 according to the bls  and the median of someone who went only to high school is about  38 000  a  30 000 difference per year   this means it would currently take a little over  13 years  to make up the difference of just having went to high school  and that is only if you find a job  41  of recent graduates are currently working in a job that does not require a college degree at all  you'll find them sobbing in the break rooms of mcdonald's and walmart stores nationwide because their high school teachers told them on a daily basis they would be a garbage truck driver the rest of their life  unless they went to college  i always wonder if high school teachers got some sort of kickback for this propaganda    this means on a 30 year career  a master's holder will have earned about 1 6 million  including the education costs  while someone who went to high school will have earned about 1 1 million  that's a lot of extra work to not even double your money   don't forget at that salary  you will also need to pay for health insurance  a lot of high school graduates are on state plans  and i didn't factor that in either    regarding earning  adjusted for inflation  people who have a college degree are earning less than the ones who graduated in 1990    speaking of college  it costs next to nothing to attend public school from k-12  maybe  100- 200 per year for registration  calculator  notebook paper  binder  supplies  etc  but somehow people lose their shit when we should be able to go to college for free    in 1990  the price of a new car was about  15k  or  30 400 today  however the average new price of a car is now  40 000  i know newer cars have more safety features  but i highly doubt they have nearly 10 grand in safety features    in 1990  the median home value was  79 100 or  160k today  today  the median home price is about  230 000  a  69 000 increase  nice   we are truly fucked  i don't see this changing soon either  we are getting paid less and being charged more  and both figures go up  housing   education  and down  wages  every year     i didn't even touch on the elephant in the room  climate change ,mwhv9y

634,"AMA - 36yo male, no college, have always worked for myself (my money works for me now), own two small businesses and my dream car, was broke 5 years ago crawling under houses installing directv",this is america and anyone who wants to succeed can succeed  we've all been hoodwinked to think we have to go to college and we have to get a good job to become successful and i strongly disagree with this notion    college degrees have been diluted to the point you need to have 8 years of college to even think about getting a six figure income and even then it's going to be highly competitive   students accumulate so much debt before they enter the real world  and receive almost zero education as to how to manage money  that they're crippled before they even get out of the gate and yes it is intentionally designed this way  it is called wage slavery   my advice is always to work for yourself  go to school if you require a set of skills that you can only learn at a school otherwise focus your resources on providing a product or a service that people need  get a job to supplement your income so you survive while growling your business but have your job become secondary income as soon as possible and before long you won't need the job at all   provide your product or service at a profit and reinvest your profits into providing more of this product or service  if you hit capacity then start another business or invest your extra capital into assets and let your money go to work for you   you have to become a problem solver  you have to learn how to think critically  you're going to be surrounded by people coming up with problems but if you can be the one to come up with the solutions you'll easily become successful    my apologies if this post comes off as braggy  it's meant to be eye opening and inspirational  i feel bad for much of the workforce because people think they have no opportunities available  opportunities are always available but if you're not looking for them you're not going to see them  opening your eyes is step one   please ask any questions  i'd be happy to help you become motivated to work for yourself and live a better life ,mwc4mo
635,"""Sorry guys, no raises this year. It's just not in the budget :(""",i would rather deliver this criticism directly to leadership at my company  but they have made it abundantly clear that they will have none of that  so i'm sharing with you all   earlier this year  in february or so  the ceo of my company made an announcement to us all that due to financial hardships related to the covid-19 pandemic  no one would be receiving merit-based raises  to be honest  i saw it coming  it struck me as something every company would do regardless of how much the pandemic really affected them  that didn't make the announcement any less disappointing  but whatever  we moved on   shortly after that announcement  the ceo also announced that the company was closing on an acquisition of another company  naturally  this rubbed people the wrong way  a few reached out to leadership and pointed out the suspicious and tone-deaf timing between the company stating  we can't afford to give you raises  and  we just spent who knows how much money to potentially acquire more business   leadership responded  but their response was  of course  lacking  someone stated that the company has two budgets  one for merit-based pay increases and other incentives  and a second for basically everything else  that was the best  explanation  we were given as to why we got nothing  and we were discouraged to probe further  i'm sure many others saw  as i did  that they just found a polite way to say  we had the money but didn't think you deserved it   fast forward to this week  our supervisors schedule everyone specifically to watch a video  the video was of an awards and recognition ceremony - essentially a glorified meeting where some members of the company receive a shout-out from leadership  each of these ceremonies has a theme  and my supervisor in particular was very giddy to announce that this ceremony's theme would be based on  the office  she said there would be a 'special surprise' related to the theme   i wish i could say this as a joke  folks  but i must say i was absolutely surprised to discover that the company paid for brian baumgartner and oscar nunez  the actors for kevin and oscar  respectively  from the office  to make a couple of statements specifically for this reward ceremony   as i listened to the actors' statements  i was filled once again with a deep-seated rage towards the financial irresponsibility of our company  i'm sure others were too  but leadership must have anticipated such criticism because comments for the video were disabled  once again  they made it abundantly clear that criticism would not be tolerated   i just can't imagine anyone being happy about this  who gives a fuck about a pre-recorded statement from two actors  our company decided to fork money over to literal multi-millionaires instead of giving their workers a goddamn cent  and they even did this after fucking their employees over the first time by nabbing a subsidiary instead of rewarding them for the work they did   and the best i can do in terms of rebellion is typing this up while i should be working instead - which i absolutely did  i'm so furious but there's basically nothing i can do but share my frustrations with people on the internet  i fucking hate this company ,mwd9ld

643,How do I keep drudging on...?,i've always struggled with the amount of time in our lives we spend at work  the 40-hour workweek has always felt way too much for me  and though i'm in my mid-30s  i continue to burn out every few years and most recently quit my last job in december and currently taking some time off to try to recover  it feels depressing and hard to feel motivated with job hunting  my industry requires numerous rounds  of interviews  it's competitive  and at the core of it all  it's just to go back to a grind i don't want to do  but it feels like there's no way out  this is also coming from someone is a booming industry  so i also know i'm relatively privileged which makes me feel worse       just needed to rant and i find a bit of solace when i see this subreddit to know there's people who always feel the same and feels validating that i'm not so alone  sigh ,mx13ze

654,Should he work while he's injured?,to give you a bit of a background  my husband and i got married three months ago  he started working in a rail yard where he drives a truck that moves the boxes  he also climbs up on train cars and locks the cars in place  even though that's not a part of his job description  he is required to work at least 68 hours a week   he is 21 years old and already struggles with his knees  he has to wear knee braces everyday and often times i push him to ice his knees after work  yesterday he slammed his worst knee into a metal wall and definitely sprained it  there is no swelling or bruising  but he limps when he walks and is in so much pain that he can't sleep  when he bends his knee it makes a scratching noise and you can feel something rubbing on something else    he works 12-hour shifts and  at the speed that he is bringing in money  we could have our student debt  a house  and savings paid for in less than 4 years  the only way we could do this is if he got a promotion in 6 months  normally this promotion would take two years to get  but they're really low on people  so his manager promised him that he would get it in six months if he never took a day off and worked really hard  we are worried that if he takes off a day to care for his leg the manager will go back on his word and he will have to work this strenuous job for even longer    if he continues to work and put so much pressure on his legs  the adventures that we are saving up for in the next couple of years  hikinh the appalachian trail  visiting israel  etc  he won't even be able to do because of his joints  we can't decide if he should take a day off or continue working and hope that his knee heals despite all of the pressure being put on it  he talked to a supervisor today and asked that he not be put on the trains today  the supervisor agreed not to but  as soon as his shift ended  the next supervisor forced him to get onto the trains    he is planning on filling out a incident report and asking them about workers comp  but  since the agreement between the manager and him about the promotion in 6 months wasn't in writing  we're concerned that he'll go back on his word  we're 21 years old and we don't know what to do  or if this is really what the whole workforce is like  what do you suggest we do ,mvtnio

660,This system genuinely makes me depressed and feeling suicidal.,hi ya'll   i've been part of the community for a while  mostly just as a lurker and relating to you all  right now i'm in a tough place and just wanted to talk about it  since i know you all can relate   let me start by saying   this system is bullshit   i am currently in usa in my early 30s  and work 2 jobs  one is full time  and the other is part time  the full time job is a set 40 hour week  monday to friday job  it provides me with my health insurance  which is a requirement since i was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2019  i have no visible symptoms  but i have cognitive fog  which especially gets bad under stress and depression  so i apologize for any grammatical errors and such moving forward  it's been really hard to focus and think clearly lately   despite having health insurance  i still have to pay hundreds of dollars for mris  and i got my last bill for my infusion  my drug modifying therapy which is supposed to prevent new lesions from forming on my brain and spinal cord  which was about 1 000 dollars  the full price  100 000 dollars  my mouth dropped when i saw that price  i was appalled  and mostly disgusted at our pharmaceutical industry for how they take advantage of people who just don't want to get sicker  i now fear not being without health insurance  and employer provided insurance is my best option  the marketplace plans are hundreds a dollars a month with high deductibles that wouldn't even cover me until after 1000  of my own money   i got diagnosed with ms in grad school actually  studying for the career i currently have  by the time i graduated  i was working 60 hour weeks between my full time job and doing an unpaid internship  a lot of my classmates were surprised i was doing this  but i didn't have a choice  i needed to pay rent  bills  and desired health insurance  which then i was diagnosed with ms  so then became needed  i tried to ask my job at the start of my fieldwork to lower my hours from 40 to 30  still full time  so i could still have benefits  but they didn't budge  they couldn't work around it they said  my company even had a internship program for the exact field i was studying for  but company policy stated you couldn't work for them and be in the program  which made no sense  since i already was familiar with everything  and the particular clientele  hence i struggled to find a fieldwork site initially  because places wanted hours while i worked  most of peers  who were either young 20s and so still on their parent's health insurance and financially supported by them  or older by supported by a spouse  were either working part time jobs or not at all  and so could focus 100  on school and dedicate time to fieldwork at places of their choosing   you know i got advice to just take out more loans and leave my job  how does that make sense   while there is not hard set proof  there are links between stress and autoimmune disorders  so i keep wondering if the stress i was going through at the time didn't trigger it  i blame myself  even though i tried what i could to resolve the situation  i even tried looking for different jobs  but they usually paid less and i couldn't afford the pay hit   after my diagnosis  i sat with my supervisors at my job at the time and i told them that there may be times i have to leave mid work for an appointment  for anyone who has had to schedule with a specialist before  you understand  they're booked months in advance  i tried to be helpful and schedule my appointments around work hours  or if necessary at the end or beginning of my shifts  but if my neurologist was only available at a 12 o'clock  this particular day for the next 3 months  well i needed to go   one of my bosses looked me in the eyes and said   customer care comes first  this company pays for your insurance   you can imagine my reaction  i was fighting back tears at that point  i cried later on and that's when i realized all the times i had busted my ass for that program and company meant nothing  prior till then  i was under the illusion that   they can't risk to lose me  i work too hard  i've held this program down  it wouldn't exist without me  when i started working in that program  there was 3 of us working it  one was let go  and the other was frequently gone  as she was older and dealing with her own abundance of health issues  many times i was the only one working that program  due to her frequent call outs  doctors appointments  and medical procedures  i held it down  even when i was told they wouldn't hire a temp worker to help me while my coworker was on leave for 3 months due to fmla  i did it   then boom  this diagnosis happened  you never think it'll happen to you until it does  one day  i was at work  super stressed  and the next day i wake up and can't see out of one eye  optic neuritis  which is usually the onset of ms  my vision was fixed with steroids thankfully    since then  i haven't trust a company to take care of me  to genuinely care about me  i did go to hr with what my boss said  and they sided with them  because they did apologize to me  in an email  sent after i was off the clock  hr also put words in my mouth  and i realized hr wasn't meant to protect me either  they were meant to protect the company  the upper managment  me  they could give less a fuck about me   so i ended up moving to a state with lower cost of living after graduate school  because loans  amirite    i live in a questionable area of my city  and while i can afford the rent and bills on my salary  this apartment is terrible  walls are paper thin  you hear sex  people yelling at children  dogs barking  even just heavy walking  i've been woken up several times because of it  my packages have been stolen from the front of my door  and now i stop ordering things    as i mentioned before  i work 2 jobs  my current job pays me less with a master's requirement  then my previous one which was only bachelor's level  though the cost of living was higher where i held my previous job  so that might have been why  but to offset that  i got a part time job   i want to move into a nice apartment  start building up my savings again  spend money for  fun  without feeling guilty  i was expecting to make 50k with a masters and that seems like a joke   but my my part job is more flexible  i can do my schedule however i want  take leave whenever i want  i enjoy it  only cons are is that it's not hourly  its by client interaction  so if a client doesn't show up to their meeting  i make less  if anything at all  than if they do show up  so  income isn't stable  also  their healthcare plan is terrible  their best plan has a 2 000 deductible  and eligibility for benefits doesn't start until you meet so many client hours in a 3 months period  if you fail to meet those requirements during a quarter  you're at risk of losing your insurance  so that's why i'm hesitant to make that job a full time one   but my mental health has spiraled badly since the end of last year with my full time job  when i started with this particular company last year  i signed up for a position that while wasn't 100  what i was looking for  i'd be working with customers that i preferred  so i jumped on  plus i was grateful just to find a job during a pandemic  but  when i started  i quickly realized i wasn't going to be doing what i signed up for at all  in fact  they had me working a lot in a different program  with a different client population  and not doing at all what i expected  i began to dread clocking in  every time my phone went off  my anxiety spiked  also  my shift was less than ideal  and i had no set break  so sometimes i just went an entire shift without eating  or taking a break in general   i wanted to get out and get closer to what i wanted to do  and so when the opportunity arose  i applied for a different internal position and switched   and since then  my health has continued to plummet    i was poorly trained  and now receive upwards to 10  emails daily of my fuckups  asking why i did this  or that  and asking me to redo documents and reports  i literally have closed outlook on my work laptop  because just hearing or seeing the notification of a new email gives me an anxiety reaction  one of the work things is the productivity  the numbers game  i have to have so many meetings a week to meet productivity  but some things are out of my control  sometimes customers don't answer the phone  sometimes they don't want to talk to me  i keep getting told i'm not meeting productivity  my supervisor asks me why are my meetings so short  the amount of time she asks for keeps getting longer and longer  like the emails   oh the emails   she'll state sharply in an email something i did wrong  or ask why i did something  and throw out   we'll talk about in supervision  then we never have it  or it's like 2 minutes  literally this week she went on my calendar and scheduled over it   and since my ms diagnosis  my memory sucks now  i can't keep track of stuff she needs to talk to me about  and i feel like i shouldn't have to  i mean  if you want to talk to me about something  make a note  and actually have supervision with me   i can no longer keep up with the emails  or the reports  i'm literally up all night working  averaging 2 hours of sleep a night  part of it is due to my concentration  it's really hard to focus  and the stress and depression i've been feeling has only had it worse  i'll start a report  lose focus for like 10 minutes  and repeat this cycle  i frustrate myself for long long it takes things to get done  i used to be able to multitask  but i don't think i can anymore  and the amount of stuff my supervisor puts on me without explanation or support is driving me insane  she's even began to say we have to modify our personal time for work if it comes down to it  which i am  not  okay with  i have my schedule  and i won't budge it   i'm starting to cry before clocking into work now  when it's sunday i start to shut down emotionally and mentally  i lack sleep whether it's because i'm working or due to anxiety about work  passive suicidal ideation which was gone is now creeping back  depression that was gone is now back in full force and has sucker punched me in the face  and as of recently  my full time job is affecting my part time job  i am getting behind on reports there  because i'm so busy doing shit for my full time job  or i happen to pass out due to sleep exhaustion  or crying  whatever it may be   i haven't told my current company about my ms diagnosis  because honestly i felt like it wasn't their business  after how the last company treated me  i don't trust to be protected  and because i haven't been with them a full year  i can't apply for fmla yet  which the fact that it has to be a year is bullshit   up until the current job  things were fine  so i really think the stress and my mood has impacted my cognitive fog to where it impacts my work  everyday i fear new lesions possibly forming  or having another flare up due to the stress  i know it'll only get worse if i stay   i've tried doing this the safe way  i've applied to other jobs  and have all the education and experience they're asking for  but i've been facing rejections   i think to myself   fuck man  if only i was married to a spouse who could financially support me for the time being and give me their health insurance  i'd be out  like  yesterday    my other option is just make the job and make my part time job my full time job  i enjoy it more  there are no productivity standards  it's actually the type of work i want to do  and the flexibility is amazing  i can probably set my schedule to have a 3 day weekend  which i do miss having  also  depending on how many customers i see  i could make more at that job than what i currently do now   seems like a no brainer right  but i'm scared of that unstable income  since it's not hourly  and am stuck on that health insurance  i'd have to get a marketplace plan  and i checked today and the best one  still with the same company  because i don't want to switch doctors  was like 330 dollars  with a tax credit    but this system sucks   you do the work  get higher education because it's what to you're told to do  in my case i had to to do what i wanted to do   and then when you have a chronic illness  it's a whole other ball game  because you need health insurance for your medicine or treatment  but may be locked into a terrible company because the usa thinks socialized healthcare is fucking evil for whatever reason    so you continue to work  while your condition gets worse  in the case with autoimmune disorders  stress can make it worse  so you only get worse  and yet you can't quit  because the anxiety of medical debt paralyzes you   i believe the system triggered my ms  and it's just making it worse    i don't want to work myself into a wheelchair ,mvts4m

I feel angry and helpless.,i live in southern california and the city my father works in passed a temporary mandate that required employers to pay an additional  4 in  hero pay  for the next few months  his company s response  shut down the store of course  my mom was also  temporary  laid off during covid and hasn t been called back in  so he s the only one providing a consistent income    he has gotten covid  been hospitalized for a gi infection and has a hernia that he hasn t been able to take time off to heal or recover from  they schedule him to work closing shifts almost everyday so he doesn t get much sleep or seem to take sufficient breaks at work because they re so short staffed  he also got a concussion at work  i ve begged him to take a sick day off  as i can see he s clearly in a lot of pain and he refuses to in fear of getting fired  the retail drug store he works at is shutting down in less than a week and they still haven t told him where he ll be relocated  some of his coworkers are having trouble finding a store to accept them because they  don t work hard enough  and the store  doesn t want them   it s driving me nuts  i m so angry but it doesn t feel like there s much i can do  he s in a union but it seems pretty useless and the staff is afraid to do anything that would compromise their job    growing up and seeing my immigrant parents work so hard to make ends meet going above and beyond only to be exploited and never recognized for their work has made me hate capitalism before i even knew what the word for it was  my parents would always say  this country will work you to bone  or  work you until your dead  it s true  there s no safety net or support system for us  the bills keep coming either way  i used to work retail for five years until quitting right before the pandemic lockdown and dedicating myself to school full time  i feel guilty for not working  but being so close to graduating from university i m not sure if i d be able to handle the load of work and school anymore  i m exhausted  i ve considered dropping out a few times to just work but my parents want me to stay  it s a lot of intense stress and anxiety to wake up everyday and see how much he s dealing with and having to pretend it doesn t affect my daily life    thanks for reading this if you did  i don t like to talk about this with people but it eats away at me everyday ,mug500
666,Advice on getting less mandatory overtime?,i'm 18 and i currently haven't been employed anywhere full time  i've been looking at jobs and recently found out mandatory overtime is a thing   this is so stupid there should at least be a daily cap and extra overtime is optional  when i work for someone i need consistency  staying somewhere 2-4 hours longer than i agree to drives me crazy i can only handle like 30 minutes tops  but i guess it's completely normal in the us to allow your employer to take your life away  can anyone offer advice on getting less of this  or none at all ,mv9630

668,I feel like my issue is ultimately with the system not the actual job.,my job is very alright compared to something like food service or cashier  i work from home currently and people don't really keep tabs on me  however this makes me feel a lot of stress  there is always something to be done at my job  and it feels like the goal posts are always changing  one day my boss will tell me our new priority and then within a couple days it usually changes without much progress actually being made towards the pursuit  my boss is so busy that he can't really keep track of the things we do  we have a 15 minute meeting every morning where he says we can hit him up with anything  but he usually doesn't respond when i message him and he absolutely doesn't have time to add meetings to his schedule 9 10 days  because of this i pretty much have to find my own tasks to keep busy and hope that it's correct or satisfactory     maybe this is harder because it's my first job out of school  but i really can't imagine feeling like this for over 40 years with only two days of break every week consistently  having money to do things is nice  but feels like i sacrifice 5 7 days every week  i'm constantly strssed about my understanding of the business and not being a waste of an employee  my rationale brain is able identify that i shouldn't be that obsessed  but that's where i am mentally  i spend more than half my time doing this during the week    im considering leaving if i'm able to find something else  but i feel like every job is just a rehash of the same stuff unless you can survive on low pay ,mviyim

670,The Most Damning Evidence Against Work Culture,i think the best proof we have that work culture is toxic is old people who work  don't get me wrong this isn't to say old people shouldn't be working  god knows nobody should be working really  but why do older people work past retirement    i've seen so many tragic posts in this thread about loved ones and others making it to retirement age only to spend a month or two really enjoying their ultimate reward after a life of servitude because of an untimely death or being stricken with an illness    there is also a huge amount of people who are forcibly retired after suffering from a mental illness like dimentia or alzheimers  if we find this to be the case more often than not why would so many people choose to work after they have reached their supposed  golden years    unfortunately the answers to this question are all too common and continously coincide with a great deal of what we deal with when we are forcibly thrusted into this evil contract  these people are either still trying to make money to live because of a failed social security system  they are trying to give themselves a sense of purpose because they never had time to find out who they were when they were being overworked  or they have been tricked into thinking that they must contribute to society in some way to  earn  their right to be here  the fact that most  of the elderly go through this is sick and infuriating    this is all the proof needed to understand why   especially in america  this whole job thing is broken and a scam that needs to be reimagined and restructured   i just needed to scream into the pillow that is reddit ,mvornn

680,Prolonging the inevitable (my life story),this is gonna sound crazy but i wanted to fail my senior year of high school  why  you might ask    i transferred from another school my junior year and no one in my classes would talk to me so i made friends younger than me during lunch who were in a similar situation being freshmen and all  naturally i was their leader which was a power trip in and of itself  we would cut classes and hangout near the campus and at kids homes when the parents were at work  fast forward to senior year and not much changed  except i fell in love with a girl a grade lower  at this point a couple months away from graduation i m almost certain i m not gonna graduate since i failed every junior class  i was oddly ok with that    the school is located in a somewhat impoverished suburb  it was not unusual for kids to have failed a grade previously and so there was a lot of 19 year old seniors  i was willing to purposely fail my senior year to stick around with my tight-knit group of friends and to have a chance at my first relationship with the girl i had fallen in love with  but on the literal last week of school  they sat me down at a computer lab and force fed me the answers to tests in a  credit recovery  program and pretty much made me to graduate  their reasoning was that i was literate  and had scored highly on the state exams  they looked me in the eye and said in so many words   we know you re playing dumb  i was bewildered because i had spent the whole certain that i was gonna fail and repeat  i walked out the door on the last day of school knowing i was now an adult who had to start doing something    i ended up doing nothing for 6 months still in shock  i finally enrolled in the spring semester at my community college but i must admit i would frequent my high school campus to hangout with my friends when my classes were over  it was different because i had a car and we would drive around the city doing dumb stuff  we did this the next year too until i dropped out of community college to join the army  i had four months to prepare so i planned on just spending it messing around with my friends who were still in school  we had fun all the way till spring break when covid hit  my basic training got delayed 2 weeks and we renegotiated my contract till july  before i ultimately decided not to go under the circumstances of a pandemic    i ve been working almost a year for the first time in my life  i just got in to student housing at the four year university  when i look back at the last three years i can now see that all my fears were true  becoming an adult truly does suck  the expectations are for you to work 47-49 years till retirement  except even then there s still a bunch of coworkers i ve had in their 70s claiming they can t afford to retire  i tell you  i used to feel ashamed of thinking like peter pan but now i see it as the only rational response when faced with corporate serfdom  i now plan on staying in college for as long as possible as well  this time no one can force me to graduate  and i get to prolong the inevitable entering of the workforce  to many this may seem very immature  but i would posit that getting a good paying job  along with higher tax burdens and financial responsibilities  is consumerist and that consumerism is much more childish than delaying  adulthood    i don t want to drive a mercedes-benz if it means i have to sacrifice my free time  i don t want to live in a  safer  neighborhood if it means i have to work more  hell  i don t think i even want to have children  i m so disillusioned that my personal strategy is to just lay low and frankly  underachieve  the capitalists will say that i m lazy  but i see it as a defensive mechanism much in the same manner as how poor apartment residents leave trash outside to keep rent prices low as a means of self survival    for now i will keep selling my plasma to the vampires to afford food  and i will pay rent by working 20 hours a week around my own apartment complex  i ll take one or two classes per semester  and i ll keep hanging out with my friends who face the same problems ,muwtlm

710,Here is great link if you want to make yourself sick to the stomach with how good boomers had it.,  in some states  like ohio  production workers were earning  5 12 hr in 1974  or  27 50 today  averaging about 41 hours a week  which would be  1127 50 a week today    that's  58 630 a year with no college needed    reading down further  75  of plant workers got  7 days of paid holidays  or more  and 3 weeks of paid vacation each year after 10 years of service  30  getting 2 weeks after their 1st year     it gets worse    in 1975  in cleveland  a union laborer or helper  basically someone nailing plywood to a house frame  made  8 10 an hour  or  39 88  today  today  even a union laborer in ohio only makes about  22 per hour    in 1975  the median weekly earnings of all workers was  185 per week  or  910 today    a white male over the age of 25 made  235 a week or  1156 today  today the median for all workers is only  989 per week  and with all the equality laws passed since then  means most people are paid about  250 per week less than in 1970   in 1975  retail trade workers earned  3 34 an hour  which would be  16 44  today ,muk6t1
711,What's more valuable?,i am as feminist as they come  but having become very disillusioned with the world of work in general  and also the sheer number of bullshit jobs  david graeber  i've re-assessed my former judgement of housewives  and indeed  house husbands  let's get more men on that so it doesn't remain as gendered a role  plenty of men would be happy to to take on this role   how is looking after a home  doing chores that probably won't get done if both are working full time and always bloody exhausted  looking after and caring for a family  either your kids or just you and your partner if no kids  making sure there is decent food on the table and not just ready meals as again you're both otherwise working full time and probably too exhausted  any less valuable than working  any less valuable than most of the bullshit paperpushing jobs on offer  it's not  it's just as valuable to be a housewife husband  in some cases i would say it is more valuable  it is more meaningful  especially if there are kids involved  and also even if there isn't   david graeber states that those in bullshit jobs are more likely to become burnt out and depressed because they know their work is meaningless and has no value  but yet we are told that being a housewife is not as good or as valuable as sitting in an office looking at spreadsheets all week   look after home and family  vs paperpushing for some office or bank or whatever  what's more valuable  why do so many people judge those that are full-time housewives husbands    what a brainwashed society we have become ,mvdc9w

724,Feeling like a rant about a past job,pretty sure my covid is transitioning in pneumonia and i'm in a fairly shitty mood  mostly because i can't stop coughing and it's giving me a pounding headache  so to occupy myself i wanted to give my thoughts on a job that just totally shat on me a few years ago  i will be using gender-neutral pronouns and keeping it as vague as possible because who the fuck knows who lurks this sub so sorry for any confusion    amp x200b   so this was in 2018  i applied through a temp agency and got placed in a warehouse pick pack position  normally i am completely averse to warehouse work  but this was a very small setting and is owned by the family of an extremely famous musician who you've heard of  the direct supervisor and supervisor of the warehouse were both great to work for  i started as a packer  then they transitioned me to being a picker  where i excelled to the point that eventually i was doing pretty much anything they needed me to do  i didn't mind because  again  i liked working for the people  it wasn't a hard job  and it was monday-friday with no mandatory overtime  for a warehouse that is fucking unheard of  the commute was only about 20 minutes as well  which was nice   anyway  for about three months i was probably the most trusted employee there  as far as the regular employees went  there were a lot of shitty workers  and by that i mean workers who would come in  talk and fuck around on their phones  then get mad when they were reprimanded for it and start talking shit about the bosses  one of the people who worked there was a close friend of the boss  and we became really good friends as well  a lot of these people would talk shit about this person too or even straight up bully them to their face  which pissed me off  i ended up basically becoming the warehouse supervisor's eyes and ears  they wanted me to report shit like that because it creates a toxic workplace and they didn't want people like that working there  i agreed with it and was totally fine with doing it  i respected the supervisor  the person they were friends with was my friend now too  and i can't fucking stand being around workplace bullies either   about five months in  shit completely changed  and i still to this day have no idea what it was  the direct supervisor started cold-shouldering me  the warehouse supervisor was suddenly distant as hell  that probably sounds weird  but before this they would often come into the break lounge on my lunch breaks and we'd shoot the shit for a while  i'm an aspiring novelist and i'd usually bring in my laptop to work on my writing  it turned out they used to live right down the road from one of my favorite authors  again  you've heard of this person  and the supervisor showed me the pictures of their house they had on their phone  they'd ask me about shit out of work  ask how my novel was coming  what it was about  etc  same thing with my direct supervisor  just not as often because they weren't as available for obvious reasons   shit kept getting worse  to the point where if i made one little mistake it was the end of the fucking world  i was reported for giving  pushback  to my supervisor  no idea what the fuck they were on about  because i never did anything but what they asked me to the best of my ability  at one point the supervisor just straight blew up on me because i mistakenly grabbed a box of product from one of the trucks that we didn't need yet  there was an unopened box on the floor  on a fucking shelf behind another box that i guess i was just supposed to magically know about  this was on friday  at the end of the shift they sort of apologized and we seemed cool again  and the warehouse supervisor came out to talk to me about random shit again near the end of the day  i figured maybe they'd just been having bad days or something   went home that day  two hours later got an email telling me not to come back monday  no explanation or anything  just  do not return to work on monday  with the subject line  assignment ended  still  to this day  don't know what the fuck i did  that was the last time i ever put serious effort into a job  i did a shitload of extra work for these people because i actually respected them  there was one day i skipped my lunch break because a bunch of people called out and the supervisors needed help with a specific project  i volunteered for it just because i wanted to help out  my thanks was being shitcanned without any notice whatsoever    amp x200b   the moral of this long tale is  never fucking go above and beyond for these shit jobs  because you can literally break your back for these people and they'll just use that as an excuse to fire you  never bother with a two week notice because they will let you go at the end of your shift without an explanation or anything resembling advance notice  i guarantee you they had decided to fire me but waited until the end of my shift so they could get one more day of labor out of me   never do above the bare minimum for these people  especially without being told  never  they do not give a fuck about you  to them  you are human labor  human capital  you are sentient time  anything but human  basically    rant,mvg1ud

730,"The ""Do what you love"" tax is really depressing",my paycheck just came in  and after my 177  car payment  my parents recommended that i get a car with this type of payment because my two previous cars were total lemons  i have 100  left over for the next two weeks   i'm not even talking like 100  of fun money  i'm talking 100  of regular money  just to not starve i pay 50  a week in groceries so i'm now in the red  i'm going to have to beg my parents to help me with rent again   the sad part is that i work two jobs  one of which was  supposed  to be full time  keyword supposed to be  my main gig is as a field service computer technician  i work for a company that works nationwide  and in fact i'm the only tech in my city  i live in a hippie mountain town about 2 hours away from the nearest big city  i've never even met my supervisor in person  my job is just me and the clients  i just show up  install the part  and leave  and for the most part it's awesome  the pay even ranges from meh to pretty good   the thing is though  the company didn't do any field research before they hired me  so i was effectively lied to in the interview  in the interview they said that i would be getting between 3 and 8 calls per day  and that it roughly equals a full time position  for reference after working here 3 calls is about a 4-5 hour day and 8 calls is probably a 10 hour day   but  since like i said nobody else from the company actually lives here  i don't get the advertised number of calls  the  most  i've ever seen is 4  most days range from 1-3  and obviously  i'm paid per call so if i'm not fixing a machine i'm not getting paid   the other thing i do is teach violin  it's great  i love going into work  the pay is good  the time flies by  i feel like i'm helping people  and i feel confident and professional at what i do   but  again the caveat is that i only get paid when i am teaching a student  so between two days of teaching i'm working for under 8 hours   once everything is added up my hours come out to part time at best and literally nothing at worse  but at the same time i work just enough teaching violin to make getting a full time it job probably not an option  and teaching violin is what i've always wanted to do anyway   i had a nice little path laid out last year when i got a job doing help desk at a major company  the schedule was great  the pay was okay  there was the possibility for upward mobility  healthcare  401k matching whatever that means  all the good stuff  but the environment just totally destroyed me  i was considering drastic things just two weeks into the job  so i quit   it just makes me feel even worse because i have all these eyes on my paycheck  i'm constantly begging for money from my mom  so she knows that i'm making very little  and i live with my girlfriend  so obviously she expects to be paid on time for rent and groceries and stuff  and she knows that i've quit more secure jobs to do what i have now  and i just feel like i don't have much time left before she starts seriously questioning my choices   it's frustrating because  i love what i do  i would totally do it for 10 hour days  it wouldn't bother me  there's just not enough work to make that happen,musm01
731,How do you protect your energy in a toxic and drama-filled workplace (that you can't leave)?,i work in mental health  which means i'm often surrounded by clients with negative emotions  and i'm there to bring some positivity into their lives and help them through their issues as best i can  but my co-workers are often talking about other co-workers behind each others backs and there's a big lack of communication that often results in bigger problems and dramas  this has been going on since the beginning of the year when we became so understaffed and management couldn't sort their shit and the employees are all trying to figure out what to do on their own without any direction from management  which just creates more drama and negativity   i struggle with protecting my energy  often when someone near me is in a bad mood that is irrelevant to me i will adopt a bad mood as well  then when they're upset about something that is relevant to me i also adopt a bad mood  instead of trying to sort through it in a problem-solving approach or even just laughing it off and not taking it so seriously  like with the drama and gossiping stuff  it makes going to work and also not taking it home with me difficult  but i can't quit right now and so i have to find a way to protect my energy and not succumb to the negativity constantly surrounding me at work   how do you guys do it  i have tried brushing it off and using logic even to understand why i shouldn't let it get to me  but i still fall into the trap of sensitivity and i am in need of advice on what to do ,mv3x8q
732,You lose money for being loyal to a company,i had to learn this the hard way at an old job  i spent all my 20s at this place and can honestly say i worked harder than anyone there  i was the model employee  no call-outs  no sick time  just put my head down and worked like a dog  the thing is that the raise schedule was so poor that new hires made more money than me and i was actually making less money every year due to inflation  i wasn't learning any new skills and stagnated  so by the end of it all my sacrifices  my labor was for very little   loyalty in the modern job market is a one way street  you're expected to sacrifice your life for the lord class but they will throw you away like used tissue the second you're not profitable  instead of being loyal to a job  be loyal to yourself  demand at least a 3  raise every year to at least beat inflation  learn as much as you can and pad your resume and skillset  when you've been there for 2-5 years start looking at other companies to either get a better job or leverage it into a raise  never ever be loyal to a company  you're working for yourself to build your brand  that's the name of the game now  this isn't your grandfather's generation where people spent 40 years at the same factory and retired with a pension ,mul75q
733,"This page has so many accurate memes that remind me how pointless the work die repeat cycle is, but it’s also oddly comforting to know others feel the same way",for a while i had been feeling guilty about putting in the bare minimum at work  but this page has made me feel less worried about that  it s still stressful to always be worried about being  caught  doing only the bare minimum    i m working to save money and maybe escape the 9 to 5 life in the next few years    i haven t really talked about this with anyone as i d expect most people in my life to be kind of judgy about it  glad i found a place to put this ,mutlm2

736,"For the people who earn some income, how frugal are you? Tiny home?

742,How little can you live on,my goal is to stop working  ironically i need to work at it   the problem i see is everyone has the same problem we work to get money with the goal of not working but it takes so long we keep increasing our expectations of how much money we need to live  we are not gaining skills on how to live well cheaply   by the time we retire we have become institutionalised into being told what to do so we can no longer occupy ourselves in a meaningful way  so many people retire at 65 and are miserable because they can't think for themselves  my dad has a reasonable pension and is bored shitless  i keep thinking he should have stopped earlier and had less money   in my early 20s i owned a bag of clothing travelled the world doing work here and there have never been as happy   so i see the solution is learning to live well on less  with that in mind how little can you live on    ,mvmg1s

745,Well it's time to talk crap about my old workplace.,not gonna name and shame  but it was a call center job    we had 8 days of  occurrences  sounds like a lot  right  wrong    for starters  none of them are paid  full time or not    if you rack up 8 sick days  9th was usually termination   the occurrences fall off  one per 60 days  meaning you pretty much had a two month probation of not being sick  your car starting every day  not being late  etc    they did not reset yearly   so if you got sick once during those 60 days  then you got another occurrence  and the 60 days reset  so it pretty much ran on a principle of one step forward  two steps back  this also encouraged people to show up sick to not reset the clock   we were required to make a sale on 25  of our calls  but we did not work in sales  we worked in insurance  some people  mainly girls with more how should i put it  sweeter sounding voices  got 50-75  while us makes often hovered around 15-30  call it the  siren call  but women seem to do better at selling on the phone  particularly if they have an attractive voice    why should that count against me  i can't force someone to buy something  it's their choice  we could not push on the sale either like car salesman can  we couldn't say  come on this is a great deal  or pressure at all  no matter how slight  why am i being punished for someone's decision  i advertised it politely with all the selling points just like anyone else    we were required to be on the phones pretty much all the time  yet had to watch random training videos  answer emails  take surveys from corporate  etc    our time clocks were also on the computer  meaning when i got to work  5 minutes per day went unaccounted for because it took that long to load the computer and access the time clock website  it was not even an application    supervisors fucked around all the time  their time wasn't watched like a hawk like ours were  i remember them walking around saying we need  everyone on deck   what are we on  a pirate ship  yet i'd routinely see 3-4 supers just standing around shooting the shit    we also had our breaks reduced from 20 to 15 minutes  since most were now working from home  the vp put out a video about how much money  this would save the company    but the people still at the office  a good 25-30  did not enjoy the break reduction  we were also told to use the bathroom on the break   so somehow 15 minutes was plenty of time to walk to the break room  get out food and microwave it  eat it  throw away any containers  refill our water  go to the bathroom  wash our hands  and walk back  ya no  not unless your food was in capsule form like on star trek    fuck call centers  the job itself was easy  but they made it hell  so many of these workplaces wonder why they can't keep help  well  maybe don't expect people to talk for 5-10 hours per day nonstop with rarely any downtime between calls    i'm considering reporting them for time theft  there is no reason why we had to access a time clock on kronos website  one could of been installed in the break room or entrance like a normal fucking workplace ,mvnbz4
746,Work would be so much better if you could work the job you want.,this obviously doesnt apply to everyone here but   part of the reason i think is so tiring mentally is because you're thrown into something you don't want to do but have to have a job  whenever i feel like giving in its always because i'm forced into cruddy jobs  i really wish the future generation would fix this for its people so that job dissatisfaction would cease to exist  it's part of the reason i don't like working  in a better society people wouldn't feel so helpless trapped in jobs they dong want to do    if i liked my job i wouldn't mind the hours honestly ,mvexbc

762,"I had a vision of the future, it was not pleasant.",i fell asleep last night and woke up in the year 2051  just a mere 30 years    but in those 30 years  hell became real    i did not wake up in my body  but rather having  simultaneous view of the entire united states  it's people  their homes  their places of work  etc  i could hear every voice of every person speaking  and yet understand every word    the workplace was  in a word  decimated  nearly 35 to 40 percent of all jobs were replaced by automation  stores such as walmart and target retrofitted their stores for automated stocking and inventory equipment  cart returns  food disposal  even asset protection was automated    an  observer  or basically an inspector  but not a manager or paid well  watched over the store daily for any malfunctions in equipment or other problems  the latest version of automation could even repair other machines  a non-working part could be installed by another machine  the parts would arrive on a normal shipment of goods  the trucks were self driving and could reverse to loading doors by themselves and were unloaded by automated equipment    the only thing that would prompt human intervention would be damage to the units  such as a heavy item falling onto it  or a software issue causing it to shut down before hitting product or another shopper    every restaurant and fast food establishment was automated  except for a few that catered to the  real human experience of cooking food  this was initially sold as being cheaper for the consumer  and it was for a few years as human-held jobs were gotten rid of  but then prices became that of human work levels  solely to enrich the executives and owners    uber and other ride-share services were all automated  janitorial services were automated  teaching  except that for anything requiring great skill or hands on experience became automated  bank tellers  shelf stockers  fry cooks  floor sweepers  hotel workers  front desk workers  receptionists  etc all became automated  a lot of surgical procedures became automated  automated home construction was in its testing phase    of course  universal basic income did not arrive either  unemployment was the highest it had ever been  amazon penned many contracts to built automated equipment and once the processes became more efficient  the people who made the machines were replaced with machines themselves  almost all of amazon's operations were now automated  jeff bezos  now 87 years old  became the world's first trillionaire in 2028    home ownership became almost completely eliminated  reserved for the rich few  as baby boomers died off  some 40 million of them  homes were quickly bought up by massive and often national property management firms  they owned the apartments  the duplexes  the town homes  and the single family homes  as well as many businesses  they often paid above market rates to snatch them away from prospective home buyers and paid in cash to entice sellers to sell and not have to go through the conventional sale process that took much longer  homes were often sold in as little as 2 days    the rate of home ownership was under 15  as many as 8 to 10 people lived in a single 2 bedroom home  privacy no longer existed  it was sold to people as a  cheaper way of living  as the  11 000 average monthly rent for a 2 bedroom home could be split between as many as 10 people    entire cities had their homes and apartments owned by the same firm  amazon was a large player in the rental market  making bezos a quadrillionaire sometime around 2045  rent increases could not be opposed  and renters had no choice but to accept substandard apartments  as every home and apartment and town was owned by the same company    most of those who still had jobs went to college  college was insanely expensive and paid for by a lifetime garnishment of your wages that was tied into social security deductions  it was called the cwga or  college wage garnishment act    this was not the same as tuition free college  because the cost was astronomical and paid for by paycheck deduction and not taxes  even if you did not graduate or land a job requiring the use of a college degree  your paychecks were still deducted  for the rest of your life  even death would not satisfy this  if you died before the set amount of tuition was paid in full  it was taken out of your children's inheritance  if you died penniless  the garnishment would be tacked onto their garnishment as well  ensuring a lifetime of what would be similar to indentured servitude    rent was also a part of garnishment  ensuring these massive and often nationwide property management firms never had late or  deadbeat  renters  if you did not have a job for whatever reason  it would be racked up as a debt and then added to future wage garnishment  while this might sound nice in practice  and you might think it solved homelessness  you were wrong  as people who did not find work after one year were sent to the  camp   the camps were these large  military style barracks were setup on large areas of land in the country  and each state had multiple zones of these camps    the camps were officially called the  unemployed  disabled and disobedient worker housing projects   no one could protest what little employment there was  for starters  with unemployment being extremely high  companies had the pick of the litter  and if you disrupted the workplace in any way  such as striking  protesting or attempting to unionize  you were barred from employment for a period of one year and sent to the camp    those who racked up a year of rent would work a year in the camp doing hard and manual labor to pay back half of the back rent  once you were released  the other half was added to future garnishments  if you did this a total of 5 times  you were assigned to the camp  forever    those sent for being  disobedient  worked a year for no wages   those with mental and physical disabilities were lifetime residents of these camps    now you might think  what if someone doesn't find work for five years  welp  too bad  this was done on purpose to pad unemployment numbers initially and then to make private home ownership harder and then impossible  you are also probably thinking this made a lot of single mothers and fathers  and you would be right  the goal was to eradicate private home ownership and to take care of the vast amount of  idlers  created by skyrocketing unemployment    the camps had little to no privacy  terrible food and less than ideal living conditions  they cost the government little to nothing as they were built out of high strength cement and rebar and would last over 200 years  automated equipment handled many tasks so once the equipment was purchased  there was no wage to pay or benefits either  those who did have to work in manual labor were mainly  back renters    you might think this would never happen  bet less than 60 years ago we had segregation of blacks and whites  less than 80 years ago we found it acceptable to turn over 120 000 japanese citizens into ash and charred remains   less than 160 years ago we owned slaves    we were given many  many  many chances to revolutionize  protest  unionize  etc in those 30 years but we became to docile and placated  and this is what we ended up with    you think it's bad now  just wait ,muz4e9

764,The old-school mentality of management is why we'll learn nothing from this pandemic.,one of my colleagues is off for his paternity leave  due to the pandemic  his leave will sort of be extended as required when you or someone close to you stays in a hospital  when the cause for your stay is non-covid related   during one of the regular water-cooler discussions  one of the project managers   mid-60's  complained that when his daughter was born  his boss expected him to be back on the job the day after her birth  but he didn't complain that he received such short paternity leave  he complained that my co-worker receives such  long  leave   and then he regaled us with something an old boss told him years ago   you know you made it as a boss if you workers think of you first thing in the morning  even before they think of their wives   and this is the mentality keeping us on a 9 to 5  5 day work week for a minimum of 40 years of your life  these people believe if you don't suffer the same shit they suffered during their  earlier years  you don't deserve to complain about anything  ,mv8uzk

772,Conflict Theory,conflict theory   conflict theorists focus on how advantaged and disadvantaged groups are bolstered or broken by the competition for necessary resources  these theorists seek to understand how why some groups of society have attained the power to facilitate resources to other groups of society that they have deemed inferior     the conflict perspective seems to especially resonate with my view of the world  it encourages you to take a closer look at the tremendous gap among different classes races and their accessibility to material wealth  quality education  clean water  affordable health care  equal and fair treatment by police and well-paying jobs  these issues are at the forefront of society today in 2021 and the consequences of these issues really seem to have adverse effects on people of color  of poverty and those with disabilities  this disparity amongst different classes races is in direct correlation to rich white men  camouflaging the real motives  of their greed    a few questions i have asked myself over the years are  why do most of my friends and family live paycheck to paycheck   why do most of the black people in my community live below the hill in a 20 block span away from the interstates and downtown   why is that in the nicer areas of my city there are whole foods  movie theatres and pharmacies yet in the lower income areas there are save a lots  pay day loan services and abandoned buildings    a conflict theorist would approach these questions with the notion that these groups of people s foundations and futures have been undermined by the insatiable desire for power and wealth that the people already in power possess  they would focus on the idea that a position of power usually comes with a desire to protect that position of power and that those higher up on the social hierarchy would damage the prospects of a better future for the disadvantaged even further if given the opportunity to advance their own ,muvqa2

790,I honestly think I hate working, rant vent  i m a 22 yr old that hasn t finished college  not really sure what path i want to go down towards  career wise  i m currently working overtime every week at my current job and honestly i ve found myself miserable  the job itself isn t even terrible but i just hate the idea that i have to use my physical being as a tool for service  i feel like there s so much life to experience yet i m condemned to the shackles of capitalism  i wish there was just a basic minimum income that allowed people to just live and eat  i don t need anything crazy  i just want be free  i really can t see myself working for the rest of my life  i ve contemplated dark thoughts and honestly i get mad thinking them because i know it s the result of this fucked system we live in  i wish i could just gather everyone that thinks alike and we can start some sort of revolution to stop this abuse of the working class  that s the end of my rant i just needed to share,mvn9up
791,Study hours in Indian Education system,12 hours a day  7 days a week   that is the amount of studies that is expected from an engineering student for examinations    that has been my timetable for the past 2 months  and it wasn't too different before that  this adds up to 84 hours a week 80 effective  with no holidays  not even during festivals   and i do like science   that is what is being done in class  but the way that it is being done  rote memorization  and making students think in only 1 particular way  focusing only on getting marks  has made so many of my good friends hate studies  and for those like who don't hate the subjects  its like a torture for them   wanted to know your thoughts,mvhyk1
792,I was told by HR to “give up” after returning to work from a stay in the psych ward,i returned after a week in the psych ward for suicidal ideation with a doctors note where a team of doctors signed off that they  strongly urged my work from home days be extended from twice a week to three days a week  hr met with me twice saying  legally they don t have to do anything since it is a suggestion  and  i can move my arms  and  feeling drowsy from medication isn t a big deal because i can uber 30 minutes to work  and  have your doctor fill out this form  the form in question asks if i can  be on my feet  and  lift boxes  etc  all things i don t do normally for work anyway and mental health doesn t necessarily effect those abilities all the time  and how  since mental health isn t really a disability or a real medical issue there are no accommodations that can be made without the doctor saying i can t perform  in which case if he says that then they will just reduce my hours  also you should only be working from home one day a week since we hired a photographer  which means nothing as he doesn t get the lifestyle photos i need for my job  just generic product shots  so no more two days a week  and so if this is all too much just give up  that s not an exaggeration those were her exact words  just give up  not the best thing to say to someone who was on the verge of suicide a week ago in my opinion    so  i m working from home today and putting in as little fucking effort as possible  don t know how much longer i can be at this place or any place at this point  i wish there was a ubi so i could work just part time at a tea shop or a farm that would make me happy and less stressed and still be able to survive  i hate it here ,mvn0dl
793,Thoughts about businesses saying no one wants to work,when they want to pay you  13 an hour  its such a joke inflation is way higher than 2  its more like 10  you really need  20 hour just to live a reasonable wage today should be  25- 35 an hour but no business wants to pay that plus a 5  raise annually  anything less in todays world is basically slavery so yeah if you pay more you could probably find people to work its not 1950 anymore  ok thats my rant ,muw9l1

797,What are the new loopholes to collect unemployment benefits and quit your job?,so i'm working right now but i would rather not considering biden extended the extra  400 a week until september  last year i didn't work for 10 months which made me not ever want to work ever again unless i'm getting paid really really good money and i don't get paid really really good money so it's not even worth going to work   anyway  what are the new loopholes for quitting your job and still being able to collect unemployment benefits  people at my work don't wear their masks sometimes and the front desk staff don't say anything when clients come in not wearing their masks correctly  is this technically a hazardous work area  i texted my boss about it and she didn't respond to me which tells me she doesn't give a shit    should i give it another week and if nothing happens  quit due to hazardous work conditions and then get unemployment   even though i make too much money to get any benefits i'm still certifying every two weeks because we are still under a national emergency and this pandemic is not even close to being over with    so is anyone familiar with biden's unemployment extension rules and guidelines  i want to know what the new loopholes are for being able to collect unemployment with quitting the job    i know i know i should have refused to come back to work but i went back to work before biden signed the bill to extend the extra unemployment until september and now i'm trying to figure out how i can stop going to work and still collect the unemployment benefits ,mt64m2

800,"Calling Capitalism moral and free because we let people ""choose"" a job is like calling rape moral and free so long as the victim chooses the position",i don't care that i get a  choice  in what i do to earn a living under a system that i am in no way affiliated with or support in any way  i'm not a capitalist  so it makes literally 0 difference to me that i get to choose a job under it    it's funny how capitalists will make our argument for us so often by admitting that the options are take part in one very specific system  or die  they will actually try to argue homelessness and potential death to overexposure as a  option  without realizing they are admitting we're right  they're admitting it's servitude or die  which is our argument  and spinning it in a way that sounds like you actually have a choice  just remember that every time you hear the  you can choose to die  argument that they're actually do our job for us    i really can't stress enough how scary and strange it is to live in a world where people actually think servitude and freedom are compatible   neets  and  hikkimori  are picked on a lot  but i believe that having the ability to see the difference between right and wrong  and actually  act on it  is something that should be applauded   freedom fighters  will call us immature constantly  all while themselves being too psychologically stunted to recognize that words like  freedom  have actual definitions  if being  atypical  means that i am able to understand and act upon my moral beliefs more readily then i'd like to be as atypical as possible ,mtoou0

825,Why do managers ask big picture questions for minimum wage interviews,i had an interview for a petsmart bather job  at first everything went great  i was interviewing with the salon manager  id be working with them directly  i was cheesing behind my mask thinking i nailed it  till she dropped the second interview bomb on me  theres actually three  and the second one was with the assistant store manager and that guy asked me questions about shit like  what do you know about the company and the services we offer besides the obvious ones  why did you pick petsmart  what makes us different from the competition   i was totally unprepared for these sorts of questions  i honestly thought this sort of questions had stopped because the last 3-4 job interviews i had were short and to the point  my current job didn't even bother with the  have you ever been in x situation  type questions    dude was such a corporate whore  went on and on about the companies ethics and charities  im just a dumb young person but we all know that this is a business  and we're here for business  so i am so sorry i couldn't indulge you in your little fantasy that this is some sort of heroic charity    i know they do this because they want to see if i did research  i did do research btw but not on the corporation  i was researching the job itself  i'm mostly just mad at myself for being unprepared  still its fucking stupid that these questions come up  i'm a hard worker  this job demands a hard worker  not a schmoozer who tickles your companies balls ,mu6rl1

832,Getting real tired of the corporate nonsense,i feel like i post here all too often but find it to be strangely therapeutic  i work for a very large healthcare system worth billions of dollars  in my area there are a number of similarly sized organizations that are highly competitive  but the organization i work for is notoriously cheap  because u s  healthcare is more of a business rather than a service we push our providers and offices to work through all conditions and expect us to be grateful for getting paid  this has meant cutting staff to skeleton crews to pad our bottom line and getting mad at not being able to retain staff  now we find ourselves in a  worst case scenario  where we are forced to adjust office hours because we don t have anyone to run the front desks or screen patients  then senior management gets more mad because we aren t producing enough    one measure to combat this is most organizations raised their minimum wage to  15 which made a big difference  but after my organization  evaluated the market  they determined it wasn t worth it  and adjusted pay scales in a manner that made it look like a raise for a few but didn t affect 90  of the workers    so what are we to do now  well  we decided to pay a contracting agency to supply us with staff  and we are paying them a more significant hourly over  15 hr  which is still not that great but comparatively  so now the minimal staff we could get are costing us so much  we need to work everyone even harder to overcome the cost  of course there is a savings in benefits i guess but i find the whole thing is gross   not to worry though  all senior leadership received most of  if not all of their annual bonuses  while our frontline managers didn t receive a bonus because they didn t hit their financial goals  because you know  covid    i took a position in leadership with the hopes that i could make a difference but i find myself disappointed in myself for the lies i have to keep  just feel foolish and a failure  now i find myself job hunting again after only 6 mos and hopefully away from healthcare if i can help it ,mto7zo

835,The Recent Surge of Anti Stimulus Propaganda Was Predicted By A 1940s Economics Paper Which Provides A Blueprint To The Likely Reaction Of Capitalists To A UBI Measure., despite the name  it is relevant to discussions of a ubi  and in my opinion that is the quickest way to less work at least in the states  as the paper is more about the apparent paradox of the capitalist being against government spending despite the increase in demand from that spending ending up in their pockets  you could consider full employment policies as anything that subsidizes consumption and increases worker power  this obviously includes a ubi   kalecki outlines three reasons why business leaders would be against full employment   i  dislike of government interference in the problem of employment   ii  dislike of the direction of government spending  public investment and subsiding consumption   iii  dislike of the social and political changes resulting from the maintenance of full employment  i will summarize each of these points below though the paper itself is very short and not very technical    i  letting the government spend money to keep up demand eliminates the undue influence capital can impose on the political process by unlinking employment from how capitalists feel about the future of the market  as kalecki puts it  the current system  gives the capitalist a powerful indirect control over government policy  everything which may shake the state of confidence must be carefully avoided because it would cause an economic crisis    ii  capitalists do not want the government to spend on public infrastructure as it may pave the way for nationalization  however  they are even more opposed to subsidizing mass consumption  a ubi  because  as he puts it  a ubi would put at stake  a moral issue of the highest importance  to the capitalist that one must  earn your bread in sweat - unless you happen to have private means  basically  why would you work for mcdonald's if the alternative was anything less than starvation  now we're getting closer to direct parallels to present day   iii  this argument is more about how even if these objections by the capitalists are temporarily overcome  such as our boost in unemployment spending and our stimulus checks  the capitalists will  if anything  oppose the measures harder  kalecki sums it up nicely   indeed  under a regime of permanent full employment  the 'sack' would cease to play its role as a disciplinary measure  the social position of the boss would be undermined  and the self-assurance and class-consciousness of the working class would grow  this is why these little capitalists are all reacting in the same way today  they're seeing how people respond when termination of employment is not a recipe for destitution and they do not like what they see one bit   point  iii  i think nicely summarizes why you will continue to see these articles about the  problems  caused by government assistance and spending  it's upending the social order on which we are dependent on our bosses for survival and even though this would likely increase their profits  they are willing to take a loss on their overall profitability to see you under their bootheel  if we ever get a ubi  these articles will continue at a feverish pitch and we will have to be constantly on guard for capitalists acting to increase their power even at the expense of profits   if you've read this far  thanks  i hope the information is useful  even if you think the paper is just pointing out the obvious  i find the more thorough rigor applied to it than my thought processes alone a great help  i have always found it a good framework to use when discussing the power of a ubi with skeptics from all walks of life but especially fellow workers    tl dr  discipline in the factories and  political stability   no demands by workers for something better  are more appreciated than profits by business leaders  and that is why they oppose even the smallest of reforms  even when it helps them increase their profits  they will fight us every step of the way as we search for a better world and even in a better world we will need to reform our institutions to keep our gains  good luck out there ,mth956

854,Why does less work makes sense?,i'm curious to learn other people's ideas or references on the thesis for this sub   my own take is that many people over the last century have pointed out the contradiction between the rise in automation  but the lack of rise of leisure  bertrand russel for example  obviously noone  pays  the sun  which ultimately powers everything we do  if we can somehow automate most unpleasant jobs  it makes sense that we should progress toward a society of less and less work   my favourite reasons for why this doesn't happen would have to be something chomsky-esque  i think to maintain power the wealthy elite use media-manipulation to encourage absurd values in the working class  like consumerism  work-ethic competition  and fake hierarchies  by keeping the working class stressed  busy  afraid and focused on these values  there is little room for any systemic change  and the power structure remains stable    i'm ignorant of any explicit examples of powerful people stating this agenda though  wealthy people i know of don't seem to be system-designers  they just blindly act in their own self interests ,mt9mv2

873,Speculation on how to get a bwetter working world please discuss,right  am i deluded im my thinking    is it our social responsibilty to not work and claim off the state benefits until a genuine working wage is achieved    follow my logic    the reason many don't work is because after child care  commuting and other things  they are worse off than  signing on  and have no incentive to get off benefits where they have a better standard of living    by putting a strain on the goverments benefit systems the goverments themselves might start asking the big important questions such as    why are the multiple big companies given tax breaks  using those tax benifits to create private profit that does not trickle down to society as a whole    why has modern capitalism created a system where a wage is so below average in hours per week or wages per hour  and where a worker has zero hour contracts and absolutly no rights  that the goverment then has to step in and give those workers  tax credit  or other help  why not just force these companies to inflate there wages and make it worth working    of course there will be those that say it will cause big business to abandon our countries but who cares    am i being naive  please discuss and tell me if im missing a valid important economic point to this simple solution    thank you,mtzmob

 i ve tried doing everything i can to make my work life bearable recently  but it seems like every time i do  the higher ups do something to make it even more unbearable     you pay peanuts  you get monkeys     do the bare minimum for the longest acceptable time possible   i ve been doing my own strategies to make my job bearable  like looping every piece of bullshit they throw at me  right back to them   x wasn t good enough quality  okay  so now i make it perfect  but take at least 20 minutes on each task   backwards thinking for backwards wages    you legitimately  wholeheartedly  do not deserve my over-the-top work ethic for the bullshit pay  bullshit conditions  and bullshit treatment    i personally am working a position meant for 3 people as one person  mandatory overtime every week  which obviously isn t helping with money  considering i m one of the now-many who are voicing their frustrations about this broken system    so now  the post title  it s something i ve heard others say  and it s something i myself was always saying up until recently  it s because there really are so many of us  we aren t the few and far between anymore  we are the fucking many  and yet we don t know how to make the change we want to see  we think we don t have the power to make change  we re afraid of consequences against us  we think  eh  almost 8 billion on the planet  someone else will do it   that  someone else  has to be you  it has to be me  it has to be that guy down the street who just lost his house  it has to be that guy being escorted by ambulance because he just tried to kill himself to escape this hopeless capitalist lifestyle  we are the last defense before this country becomes a completely hopeless case  if we don t take action in our generation s lifetime  we will never get a chance again    this system is flawed  every single possible act of your literal human existence is being profited off of  you are not allowed to live a happy life under capitalism because it s designed to brainwash you and keep you under their foot and prevent you from enjoying your own humanity  and you know what  you can follow their directions by the book  get good grades  go to college  get a degree  and still get fucked over in this system   your wife has cancer  well  i don t care that you have insurance  gimme 20 years of your life savings   we can t wait around for all these corrupt officials to do it themselves  because the truth is  if we continue on this course we re headed towards a fascist country  assuming we weren t already in one in the first place with all the social media shutting down people that say this stuff  and how most workplaces are essentially fascist  challenge your manager s authority in any way  and you get absolutely shit on    my view is still very very undeveloped and under-informed  i ll completely admit that  i only recently  in the last few years  have woken up to these issues and just barely recently  have i gotten so fed up that i want to start trying to fight these issues  there s a lot of things i need to learn about  but all the same  i believe wholeheartedly that we don t need socialism  we don t need capitalism  we need to form a brand new system  we may not be able to make a perfect world  but we can make it a damn fair world   we don t have to bend over and accept the oppression  living the rest of our lives in constant misery  barely able to live paycheck to paycheck  barely able to find jobs even with a degree  going into potentially lifelong debt just to go to college  i don t want handouts man  i don t want stimulus checks    you know what i want in life  a place to live and time with my girlfriend  that s it  i don t want any yachts  i don t want a high rise  i don t want all these goddamn luxurious bullshit that shouldn t even fucking exist when you have people out there legitimately starving to death in our own goddamn fucking country  fuck luxury and the idea of it until everyone has fair circumstances   there is no goddamn reason that  let s say for example   even at the least busy xx burger joint restaurant  we still make  3 000 000  great job team  oh  wait  i m getting a call  oh  justin died  he said he couldn t feed his family on  16 000 a year  hmmm  replace him with simon   we need livable wages  we are the only reasons your precious baby fucking companies run  if we all went on strike  you would absolutely be fucked  we honestly should  fuck your system  run it yourself  anyway  back to the point    we need to stop letting the system brainwash us into accepting the fact that  life isn t fair  yes  in a grand sense  life truly isn t fair  but we can make it as fair as possible by giving people a fair chance at their own fucking lives    if enough of us wake up and realize that this system is not humane  we can make a change  somehow  somewhere  until we make a government that is truthfully  wholeheartedly  beyond a shadow of a doubt  by the people  for the people    we need to fight all the corruption everywhere  whether satan is on earth spreading his influence  or it truly is just the insanity of human greed  we need to fight it  we re not going to have some magical reset  we have to do it ourselves  because these corrupt people in power will never come back to their humanity ,ms2r7n

935,I shoveled 100 yards of heavy ass snow and my boss told me to go back to work after.,i was the lucky winner selected among 8 other perfectly capable men in back of house to shovel snow at our restaurant  during the day it sort of rained as well so the snow ended becoming extra packy  so i was easily lugging 25-35 pounds of snow per scoop  with a sidewalk at 5 foot width i was already tired 30 yards in  meanwhile one of my coworkers who was taking orders outside was saying  you got this  joe  in the back of my head i was thinking about how 1 dude who was suppose to help me bailed out to take orders from customers instead i finally finished after what felt like an hour  i come back inside in the little breakroom hallway that leads to the kitchen and sat on a chair to catch my breath knowing i still have 5 more grueling hours to go  my boss comes up  without missing a heartbeat telling me i need to come back to the kitchen because rush hour s stumping us rn  i told him  i reallly need to catch my breath from shoveling  all he had to say was  well it usually takes around 30-45 mins to shovel that  take a quick break  but i really need you back  i was already busting myself before shoveling  the fucker can t even give me 5 mins of rest  i was so close from walking out but i went to work  a day or so later we received an email announcing how everyone s having 75cent raise  i go from 12 75 to 13 50 now  oh boy  i walked out a week later  absolutely not worth breaking your back over  nor was that something i signed up for ,mrywpu

937,Quit my job of 4 years,        even though we all knew at the team that this was going to be such a project  i was the only one that pointed out that we should simply take our time and deliver it at our own pace  due to my stance i was sidelined at first doing support work  later on as the specifications frequently changed by client  and accepted by our managers  there was a need for an extra person to work full time   they reluctantly assigned me the new tasks in a totally unexplored field for our company and gave me two months      due to logistic problems and delays on project i could only work on a mock system with lots of problems most of the time  i got my hands on the actual system 6 days before the deadline and i had to adapt from the mock system  i had to work the weekend and i told my manager that this was unacceptable from my part but i will do it and its gonna be the last time  however as i was working at the full system i noticed design problems related to my colleagues' works and the constantly changing requirements  i was told to find workarounds and i did so however not every requirement could be met  all requirements were met except one  however we sent the system to the client and there i was again without equipment to work again       client complains for the missed requirement and some other stuff not related to me  due to logistic problems i still did not have the equipment i wanted  in every meeting i explained that i could not work without the system or without the colleagues reworking their design  no one seemed to care  i realised that my colleagues were so burn out that could not defend me or do the extra work i required  as the deadline approached i was required to find a solution without having the system i worked on       one manager told me that he understood me but i had to find a solution nevertheless because the upper management believes in the project and the client is strict  the other manager was pretending that i was making excuses to not work and that i could work with whatever equipment i had  so i told them that i dont want a part on this insanity where i dont even have the means to do my work yet i am constantly pressured to deliver  suddenly the second manager acknowledged the problem and tried to persuade me to deliver the requirement by telling me that he gave us all the badget we asked for and that is our fault that we dont have the equipment  i just asked for the date of my termination       4 years working there with no failure at any project i was in and to have that behaviour was something beyond me  i know that people of my expertise are hard to find  the cvs we receive are from graduates only  i was a graduate myself who was clueless when i first came and now that i was trained on their expense they just let me go like that  i hope the place sinks ,msfqv2

945,Every day working for corporations feels like an opportunity cost,hi people  i've been a big fan of this subreddit for a while now but decided to post something more of kind of a rant    i'm from a small country in europe  i finished my bachelors and masters there - econ and management  i never had guidance to where to go career wise as both my parents passed while i was young  and my school or teachers never bothered  after finishing school  i worked a min wage marketing job for an it company where i would do unpaid overtime often and do work out of my scope  after a year or so i moved to canada on an open work permit  unable to find a job in my background  i worked hospitality jobs - often 3 at the same time as i never had a backup fund and with no parents i don't have anything to fall back on  so i slaved and saved until my gf got pregnant  after wich i needed stable income with benefits for us  so i started working for a big bank  first as a teller  now account manager  making pretty much an avg pay  or below average considering the rent here  i never took sick leave  i'm doing a good job  i worry about finances all the time  i don't have enough vacation time  i deal with the corp bs etc - all the regular antiwork stuff  i dream of opening a business  and even though i have some ideas  i don't have money and the know-how for designing apps websites  i study in my free time to get investment certificates and also to do the gmat so i can get into a decent mba program    in short - i'm a clown and a puppet to the system  frustrated each day  killing my health with a pointless desk job   meanwhile  my now ex gf  we separated  but co-parent the kid  always had even less direction in life  she has bipolar  never could hold a job longer than 6 months  dropped out of school  did no upskilling whatsoever and had no plan other than work admin jobs  but  she started doing camgirl stuff recently  she makes my weekly pay in about half a day for sticking a dildo up her ass  and i still feel more fucked by my job than her  basically  she won at life and can retire in 10 years   this life just doesn't make sense  i'm losing motivation every day i go to my office and pretend i want to be there  3 weeks of vacation time feels like a joke    let's get that bread   sigh ,ms1rsz

956,I Just Quit My Job as an Amazon Warehouse Picker,tl dr  amazon managers want me to play games  i don't  it was the summer of 2020  recently graduated college  and i was on the hunt for product design jobs  granted  covid really hampered that  so after 3 months of searching  i needed more money for food  gas  etc  prospects were not looking good  so i bit the bullet and sold my soul to amazon fulfilment  that  15 hour for menial labor was what drew me in  it's not worth it   that soul i sold has now been crushed   there are a lot of bad things about working at amazon  all the horror stories you hear are true  my experience was picking  the most common job entry level associates  get  here's what the job entails    picking is how products go from inbound to outbound  whenever a customer on amazon places their order  pickers are the ones who take the product from a pod the tall yellow shelves of product that the robot brings to your picking station  and place it in those fucking yellow totes  when a tote has enough things in it  you push it forward and the machines and conveyor belts send that tote to the other end of the warehouse where outbound packers will get it ready to ship  your entire 10 hour shift is spent standing in an area the size of a dinner table and constantly picking  and i mean constantly  you cannot stop picking or else operations managers will come breath down your neck  everything is monitored by cameras and amazon's algorithm  micromanaging as much as possible  you've probably heard terms like  time off task  yeah  fuck that bs  managers want you picking at a breakneck 400 units per hour    the tipping point for me was their fucking  games   you see  the machines you pick from  arsaw  have two touchscreens at each pick station  the main screen is all that matters  as it tells you what item to pick and which tote to place it in  it also tells you how many items you've picked  your rate  how fast you swap a full tote with an empty  and the time in-between each scanned product  nothing wrong there  it's simply how you interact with your job  now the second screen fuck the second screen  it's for games  everytime you sign in at your station  the second screen boots up games for you to play while picking  except they're more like stat trackers than games because you barely even interact with them  you have a game that pits your floor against another floor in the warehouse  there's one where you raise a tomagotchi like animal with food and excercise  there's one where you are in a spaceship and race other ships  keep this game in mind  it'll pop back up later  but the thing is  all these games are the fucking same because your game score is your pick rate  which is already shown on the first screen  these  games  are said to be extra motivators on your pick rate  but dressing it up as a game is pathetic  it's distracting  serves no purpose  and makes us feel like a child  so i naturally just turn the second screen off  as most do  and just focus on picking  however  recently managers have been wanting all pickers to log into the games while picking  and by wanting i mean forcing  they keep pushing space race like it's hot shit  saying it helps them keep track of workers  except they have always been able to track us without these stupid games   so to the actual part that made me quit  i wasn't even 30 minutes into my fucking shift before an ops manager walks up to me  manager   is your game screen working  me   i'd rather not play the games and focus on my work  manager   what  me   i don't like playing the games  i want to pick  manager   well it's actually required  i continue picking  ignoring her like i didn't hear anything and this bitch just stands there and watches me pick for a solid 10 seconds before manager   can you please turn on your game screen  me   reluctantly turns on game screen  manager   go ahead and select  me   i know  i know  space race at 350 units per hour  manager   ok  i'll be coming back around later to check on you  me   immediately turns off second screen once her back is too me because i know she won't be coming back around and the games are asanine anyways   you know what amazon should be doing instead of trying to push space race  well how about   making sure arsaws aren't constantly malfunctioning piles of shit   giving employees more break time to physically move our bodies around this massive facility  barely anytime for bathroom breaks  so some have to piss in bottles   paying us more than a paltry  15 hour  stop infantilizing workers and trust them  remove all the fucking cameras at pick stations   amazon has been  bar none  the worst working experience i have ever had  the only  and i mean the only  solace is the camaraderie between pickers stoners counters the ar techs  fuck ops managers  because we all are working in that hellscape  everyone hates working there  but we never release that anger towards coworkers because we know how tough it is  and we revel in that empathy we share for each other's jobs  it's hopeful solidarity of the masses screaming  we will get through this together   i had been working there for 6 months  and i didn't know how much darker the tunnel would become  the physical toll is one thing  but the mental toll is beyond comprehension  every time i saw that damn fucking smile on the facade of the warehouse  it wiped my smile clean off my face     once i hit that resign button on the a to z app  i felt like genie at the end of aladdin  i now have to bust my finding a good design job that matches my degree  because i'm not against work  just against  that  type of work   i know this is rambling  but i just had to tell you guys  i have been a part of r antiwork for about as long as i worked there at amazon  and i knew you all would understand the most ,msy79q

985,I wish I could go back to not knowing what it was like to be unemployed and receiving enough money to live off of,i ve been working since i was 16   and often  if i wasn t also in school  i had more than one job at a time  i moved to nyc fall 2019  and quickly got two jobs and a side gig  i was busy all the time  i didn t cook  or sleep a lot  and i lost sight of what i moved there to do  when the pandemic hit i lost all three of my jobs and moved back home for a few months  in july  i moved back  and i got a job at the beginning of september  that job also ended in late december when the restaurant temporarily  theoretically  closed   at the end of march i was hired for a national coffee chain  i applied for the job because i thought that the restaurant i worked for july-dec was closed for good well  surprise  they reopened in march  and today i went to go talk to the owner  now i have my first shift on saturday    i should be happy  i m only scheduled for  20 hours at rhymes with  car trucks  and i missed my coworkers at the restaurant  now i ll actually have money  i guess  but i just   i don t care  i don t  want  to work anymore    the thing is  the period from late december to the end of march  when i was unemployed  was the most creatively productive period of my life  i finished my novel-length fanfic  yeah yeah i know  but it s not what you re thinking   i can post an excerpt in the comments if anyone s interested  i improved as a writer  i got a very short original nonfiction piece published in one of the most-read newspapers in the us  i came up with the idea for and wrote 5000 words of a play  i worked on my novel  i walked in the park  i read  i painted  i cleaned  i cooked  sure  i couldn t afford to spend money on things like clothes i didn t really need or  stuff  but i don t really buy a lot anyway  thanks to pua  i could pay rent and utilities and my grocery bill  not much else  but that s all i really need    don t get me wrong  i know that subsisting on very little income while consuming very little isn t that sustainable  sooner or later i would have had an unforeseen expense  or wanted to move to my own apartment  and then money would be important  but for those few months  all i did was allow myself to  create  freely  and set myself free from caring about  keeping up  with fashion or consumer trends  now i m going to have two jobs again  and i ll probably be making the same amount i was getting from unemployment  and have a much worse quality of life  and for what  money for stuff i don t want or need    i don t want to go back to my life  pre-pandemic  i was tired all the time  i had never written anything creative that was longer than a few pages  my room was always a mess  i was eating like crap and sleeping like crap  and what do i have to show for it  i didn t contribute anything meaningful to society  i didn t bring people joy or catharsis or understanding like i was able to do with my writing  all i did was work    before  i was okay with sacrificing my health and time just for that  i know now that i have value and potential beyond work  in a lot of ways  i wish i didn t ,mrtphr

1040,My vision of UBI could be like. Fair? Stupid? Your general thoughts?,i don t want ubi because i want to sit on my ass all day  i want ubi because by default we re deprived of basic human necessities without money and get below the bare minimum from our jobs   the way i think ubi should work  which is as fair for all as possible in my view  is that ubi should be available for everyone old enough to work and old enough to start shifting towards supporting themselves    this ties into two different conversations i ve been making lately with my coworkers   1  it should provide enough money to live comfortably - a house  food  and water  which gives you time to just enjoy life and spend time with loved ones  jobs are still out there  but you aren t forced into them to comfortably live your own human existence    2  now why would you work a job if we had ubi  well  here s how i see it  ubi would be cancelled for anyone who decides to go out and work at a job  however  jobs would actually pay a thriving wage  not a living wage  but a thriving wage  this is how you would get the things you want  video games  television  etc  that money not being used for someone s ubi would be redirected to other things  but the employee in question could gain the ubi back from quitting their job  also  i would imagine that alongside this we would fight for fair treatment in workplaces as well  not just fair wages  4 days on  3 days off  the way things are  the 40 hour work week is designed to drive you insane and strip you of your humanity   this  in my view  as under-informed as it admittedly is currently  would create a society where the people who are tired of work and just want to live their life can do so in peace  while the people who want more in life can go out and seek it and work for it  but under no circumstances will we have people dying in the streets anymore from poverty ,msb3to

1047,Things would have to get worse before they get better for most of us.,something i've been thinking about for a while has been the perspective of a lot of people who have access to the internet   i come from an immigrant family and so does my wife  so visiting the  third world  before covid was a pretty regular occurrence   in order to  escape  and become an immigrant in most cases you need to actually be pretty well off in your country of origin  and things need to be pretty bad there for you to make the move  think about those stories of doctors engineers coming to the americas for custodial jobs   so even in these countries  when i go i'm seeing a pretty narrow perspective of these actual societies   when i went to the philippines having a shower in your house was considered fancy  as was eating meat more than twice a week  and toilet paper   when i went to peru it was about the same thing  a police chief's mother could afford to have a personal electrical heater wired up that would shock you every now and then   i remember visiting a community of people just outside the capital city of the philippines  where people were occupying unfinished concrete buildings  taking electricity directly from the power lines  and digging their own wells  and still  this was pretty high up in a country that is still mostly agrarian  with lots of people still living in the mountains and forests and depending on their gardens and livestock for subsistence   a more civilized society might result in less work for all  but a lot of westerner's  mostly american  perspectives of decline are built around a view of society that the  boomer  generation was able to enjoy   pension plans and mortgages  and healthcare and higher education and strong unions and good infrastructure are not common in history or on earth  they were mostly constructs as a result of the west's dominance in the early 20th century  and were often distributed in these places in an incredibly unequal fashion to top it off   a more equitable world is possible but i think it would be best to accept that  because of our place in the global hierarchy  a transitionary period would look like something between what we have now and how the rest of the world looks ,ms2bnt

1061,DAE...Wish some of their boomer coworkers would just retire already...,i am so sorry to say this as i recognize the main reason people hold a job is to earn money that they typically not just want- but rather  need- however  if someone is so disengaged with their work to the point where it seriously affects their attitude towards others  they need to quit  i have multiple boomer coworkers who seem miserable  burned out  treat the workplace like  boomer social hour  and treat everyone else who hasn't been their buddy forever in the same suburb  like crap  and they're often involved in a bunch of bullying and gossip in the workplace  even yell at others  i often feel like despite these people being in their 50s  60s  and 70s  they can't handle basic job related stress like things getting super busy  or not everything getting done on time or done perfectly  constant bad moods in response  shit happens  how you treat people after things go wrong is everything to me   i do have some boomer coworkers who are pleasant to work with  actively inclusive  hardworking  good attitude  and open to new ideas experiences  however  all of the millennials and gen z that i work with at least try to put on a  professional act  while at work  some of these boomers aren't even trying though  i am so sick and tired of boomer entitlement  if you can't show up and do the job the best you can  and treat others with a basic level of professional respect at all times in the process  then quit and stop making it worse for the rest of us  doesn't matter if things go wrong  that's just what happens at work  it isn't an excuse to disrespect or devalue others  dae have this issue at work ,mr8z4c

1107,Getting that boomer economy back on life support after COVID (Bit of a rant),the company i work for has brought in  professionals  to study our jobs and work out a  better way  of doing things  i work in customer services and this is telephone  webchat and email based work - some of it is targeted but the job is just about manageable and fluctuates between really busy and sometimes a little quieter than expected    anyway  they've paid these  experts  to come and do the usual cuts  lunches are now going from 45 mins to 30 which is just a pain the ass because we handle complaints mostly and that can get a little much and most times 30 min lunches are not enough to eat and relax after in order to come back to the job somewhat relaxed  i did ask and got told that they could only have a couple of people on lunch at the same time  around 4 in total i think  so the obvious solution is to employ more staff to avoid the burn out but that's only obvious if you actually give two shits about your staff  i'll be damned if im calling their  helpline  number to discuss my shitty mental health that they will inevitability cause with all of the changes their about to implement    anyway  pay rise denied this year despite our company rubbing their hands at getting access to government cash which will likely be paid out to shareholders and higher management for doing such a top job over covid    i give it 1 year covid free before every one is back in the offices  the only people who will be working from home are the managers and even that will be part time    boomers gotta get their economy back on life-support  interest rates still at 0 5  because raising them would bust the housing market  still working 40 hours a week in 2021 despite huge unemployment numbers and poverty  i loved lockdown  i loved furlough  felt like the biggest  fuck you  to this whole shambles of an economy that is built in the image of old timers living out their golden years having their asses wiped while looking down on the masses and saying  you have to earn your time on this earth  its not yours  it belongs to me    fuck work  fuck every single one of those efficiently savings cunts  cant wait till they have us all fighting over clean water ,mr1m8w

1121,This subreddit has changed my work life,i've been a long time lurker on this sub and only in the past couple months have i started to implement anti-work philosophies into my career  i feel like a stronger person now   i just turned 19  moved out of my toxic parents' house a year ago  and have been bouncing through jobs ever since  i currently work at a daycare as the lead infant teacher while doing schooling to get my cda  child development associates  when i applied for the job the owners promised me that they regularly give out raises  and make sure every employee gets 40 hours by the end of the week  i could never be happier  except i've found out that they are the sleeziest owners in the world    cue my use of anti-work philosophies    i quickly discovered that my supervisor is required to make sure none of the employees get overtime  any minute over and the owner  we'll call him andy  gets infuriated with her  i got confused though because some of the employees from my daycare would travel to another center and work an extra 4-5 hours a day after their normal shift  one of my coworkers  who does this consistently  told me she was tired  i said   at least you make good overtime  well apparently she doesn't  andy runs both centers as two seperate companies  so he can get away without paying time and a half  after hearing this  i was offered to work overtime at the other center  i found the guts to say no   if you don't pay me time and a half  i'm not interested  they quickly moved on to someone else    another situation occurred when my coworkers and i started to discuss our salaries  it wasn't until this subreddit that i realised how messed up it is that this is considered taboo  through having these conversations we learned that me and a couple  other new hires were making a whole dollar more an hour than our coworker who had been there 2 years longer than us and already had a level 3 cda  we can call her tammy  i later encouraged tammy to ask for a raise  she was shy  but eventually did it  this was met with a series of demands such as  transfer to this center  and  continue working extra hours and we'll see  at this point  she got so fed up that she threatened to leave if they did not pay her what she was worth  tammy got a raise shortly after that    there are so many other examples i can use about my job  but i just wanted to say thank you  honestly  if i had not been browsing this subreddit i would probably be in the same position as tammy down the line  hopefully my story can help encourage you guys to stand up for yourselves too ,mquori

1146,I feel like I am just pissing away my time,this is a bit of a rant  but i have been with a company for 9 yrs   i am currently at an impasse because no matter how many interviews they give me  i never get selected for any of the jobs   to be fair  i have gotten some promotions  but not that many  i work in the gov  sector so to get raises you have to go to diff  depts  to actually make any money   i am so fucking frustrated  there have been jobs that i know that i qualify for but the company will give them to people outside of the company and on top of that  start them at a much higher pay rate     i go to my job  do what is necessary  don't slack but sure as hell don't burn the midnight oil    i also have boundaries  although i am professional   at this point it seems like applying for anything else is just a fucking joke   what would you do in my situation  i am obviously looking for another job outside but what can i do to make my time less miserable   the most recent job was one in my current division   yet there is a jackass who they hired for a 6 figure job who was trying to get advice on how to write a resume because he has never done one before       the only reason i have hung on this long is because of the benefits and stability because they pay is not good ,mqtpyf
1147,"Not one but TWO full time jobs, aren't I lucky?",first post here after working  it is so cathartic to see other people fed up with this shitty societies fetish with work   so into the story we go   i work at a credit union  and i have been here for 2 years  first year i was a teller and did the normal duties  but i was already suspicious about the work environment since i made all my coworkers mad because i actually used my sick days and time off  first red flag  so i decided to take a different position in the company  i now work the desk side at a much slower branch and work full time doing loans and opening accounts and the such    since we are a slower branch in a pandemic  my regional managers thought it would be good idea to give us the online account opening tasks as well   second red flag  i thought it would be a short term thing  but no  it is now my full time duty on top of my current duties    in a pandemic were you can't really go into the branch  there are a lot of applications  of course they expect me to do this and my other job  it is a full time task and i have received 0 compensation for the extra work i have been doing  me and my other coworker  there are only two that work this que  are being handed the work that was being done by 6 people    i only make  15 60 i do not get paid enough to keep up with this    i almost walked out today  they had a meeting where  of course  we are not hitting loan goals  surprise surprise  i am working two full time jobs  what one do you want me to do  i just find this ridiculous and thought it would be a good story here  maybe you can relate    amp x200b   tldr  get a full time job on top of my full time job with no extra pay ,mqvnnw
1148,I've been pretending to work for months.,so last year i was moved to this boring ass department  it has a couple of areas  and in the area i'm in  there's only two of us  an old disgusting fucking and myself  f  26yo with a degree   the first months i was giving my 120  because i'm fucking dumb  my old coworker at first treated me  nice  and all  but i missed several red flags until i was done  realizing this fucker was treating me like his assistant and 3-4 months in  i told my boss about my discomfort  asked him if that was my role  basically he said  no  but suck it up  great    as the year passed by  i was completely distant with my coworker  barely acknowledged his existence  and started to warm up to my other coworkers  people closer to my age  without those disgusting ass habits of course  and then i started to play dumb at work  pretending i'm working when in fact i'm doing other shit  and honestly  i started pushing all the work to my coworker  i truly don't get paid for the shit i'm assigned  work under the fucking sun  nor to deal with his harrassment  which everyone is aware of  mind you  how is he here  seeing how corrupt everything is  the responsabilities i have do not equal to my salary    of course being a dumb ass anxious person i always have in the back of my mind that any day could be my last day here  especially because my coworker thrives on gossip  and i've heard him spreading little toxic bullshit about me aside from the fact that i don't help him  i wouldn't be surprised if the hr people have heard whatever   and you know what  i don't care  if i get fired  they will pay me for whatever and i'm free  i don't give a shit about not having a back-up job offer  i've made my savings and i'm planning to go freelance  which of course would be tragic and risky but again  idgaf  i'm done      2021 rolls by  and i'm still pretending to work when i'm actually doing whatever else  including job-hunting  which i haven't had success since  at times of course i pipe in and  work  but most of the time i'm just using this place's internet to research and prepare my portfolio and whatnot   today's paycheck day  and like i said  i'm always  paranoid  that i could not get it  meaning i've been  let go  or whatever the term is for getting fired    if i don't get a paycheck today  fine  it means it's over  saving me the time to quit   i detest waking up every morning  i've been struggling with very bleak thoughts for almost a decate   i used to love my hobbies but now all i want to do is sleep  unfortunately    i wouldn't know if i'm depressed  never been to a psychologist  nor i can afford them  and honestly  i'm not interested  i know what i want  and i want to quit this job and do my own thing  my lifestyle will be too unstable  so no boyfriend  much less with my fucked up mindset  but considering i wanted to vent somewhere without getting judged  i thought i could post this here ,mqxngs

1159,"Revolution ideas: cancel all labor in luxury goods and non essentials, everyone work less hours, and have workers collectively make decisions",our current level of automation has made there way more than enough people than is needed to keep society functioning  we could easily give every working class individual reduced work hours  or allow seniors to stop working completely  and we wouldn't have to sacrifice our standards of living   instead  all our excess laborers must create luxury goods or provide non-essential services  whether they want to or not   currently  all people who don't own land or natural resources outright are effectively slaves to the land owning class and the luxury goods market   it is true that the working class buys luxury goods as well  but if we took a vote  i'm guessing most people would prefer to get more time back in their days   however  the costs of owning land  and other natural resources  and high rates of existing debt make it impossible for this to happen without basically having a revolution  so  i'm proposing that maybe our revolution should aim for the cancellation or strict regulation of all jobs creating luxury goods  amp  services   who decides what is essential or luxury  we decide democratically via vote by the working class  people could still own a business  and get rich from their inventions  however  the working class must collectively agree to make the specific product  and also must approve the real job duties and descriptions to ensure it doesn't require back-breaking or unethical work   think about all the random useless novelty and other crap that currently gets produced by laborers in sweatshops this could be prevented   people would get more time to spend either with their children  studying  or taking care of their home community  mental health would improve drastically   i think this structure would integrate ubi  and it could help pave the way to completely abolishing exploitative labor    these thoughts popped into my head this morning  so i accept all your thoughts or comments on fatal flaws or other things that i didn't account for  i don't even know where to start on planning a revolution itself on a national or global scale  so i will leave that up to someone else  lol ,mnli7e

1211,Working from home has been excellent.,when i started working from home  i was really stressed out because i thought i was being monitored constantly  but the longer it went on the more i realized they just said that bullshit to scare us  it s now been over a year  and i ve taken lots of naps on the clock  have gone for long drives  take my breaks whenever i please  and most importantly get by on the minimum amount of work required  if i get criticized  i just take an extra long break to forget about it  if something big happens and they need extra help  i just don t look at my screen until it s over then tell them i had to take a bathroom break if they ask  i make great money  but my mental health has been ground into much and thrown in the mud from my previous j b  i m happy to have found something else that requires even less effort and time spent watching a screen  it is a thankless industry  and it s stresses are not worth the time spent troubleshooting  i m happy to be collecting a check for minimal effort  for once i feel like i m able to take some time to myself without thinking about work after i m off ,mmsldf

1213,The world is changing too fast to get a proper job when all requires years of experience,i grown up in a small town of a small middle eastern country in the 90s  back than noone new what was going in the world and none of the people around me  me included  had an idea what i should be doing  my parents mostly thought i get some low wage work like them and live by somehow  in school we never learned anything usefull  i remember i picked  it  specialisation which meant word and excel one guy i knew already started learning coding but to me it was weird and didn't know it will be needed in the future  later after several failures i went to a small college  hoping it will help me get a proper job  it was a very bad school and the only one i could afford  it had media and film related classes but in the end all it ever taught me is the basics of the basics  because i really needed a job i started working in retail for years  now i lost my job and i don't want to go back to retail  i started looking for job that i can do with my college degree  turns out everything needed today  like social media and stuff was never on the schools radar when i was there  so i have no experience and starting to really worry about my future   the point i wanted to make is that the world changing so fast that nothing i ever learned is usefull  learning something new cost money and time  i wish there would be some kind of funds for reeducation or something ,mmrv9r

1218,Who’s going to perform high skill jobs in the ideal society?,i ve read a lot of interesting things on this sub  a lot of things that have made me stop and think  a lot of things i agree with  i m 19  i ve never had any strong political opinions  but as i delve into the subject  i ve started to hate capitalism but it s still hard for me to grasp the concept of anti work i read the side bar  but a question that i ve been unable to get an answer to is who will perform jobs that require a high degree of education and commitment  consume a lot of time  require immense effort and concentration and are quite frankly completely oppose the ideas here  case in point being stem fields  now i m no stemlord  i m a business student  but i know for a fact that doctors nurses surgeons have extremely hectic and tight schedules that almost never result in a good work life balance  scientists who stay up day and night to conduct researches that advance the human civilisation in terms of technology  emergency services such as law enforcement and firefighters just to state a few  all these require either years and years of extremely gruelling education or extreme fearlessness and dedication  these jobs are also essential to the functioning of a society  who and why would anyone do these jobs in an ideal society  and even if let s say the ideal society was created in the us  the economy is still global  companies will just shift their operations to other countries with minimal effort creating an even worse living standard  fyi i m from asia  the jobs i stated above are essentials  what about the jobs that aren t but still require a high degree of education  like creating video games  entertainment services and many others  these only exist because there is a market for them  who s gonna fund these projects considering aaa games cost upwards of hundreds of millions of dollars to create these days ,mnb27z
1219,Today I witnessed the biggest case of Stockholm syndrome I've ever seen.,a couple weeks ago i saw something not really worthy of a post  but now two events have occurred  today being the largest    two weeks ago i saw someone saying that since they were only working x amount of hours  they  don't have to work their break if they don't want to  that's right  this moron actually volunteered to give up their break  they were not even short staffed  but the employee felt guilty for having a break when only working  i think it was  5 hours  boss was more than willing to let them take one  but they felt too guilty to do so    today took the cake  i was at sam's renewing my membership when a manager came up and said they were having bad chest pains after lifting a box  probably a pulled muscle  but they were also short of breath and other symptoms related to a minor heart attack   the three other managers were literally begging her to leave and go to the er  but i shit you not  she was more concerned about who  would cover for her  while she was in the hospital   what the actual fuck  these people actually exist  i can guarantee you  if the shoe was on the other foot  the employer would not go out of their way for you at all and would probably have a replacement in under a week if you died   i can't get over just how unholy and overly loyal these two employees  two different stores btw  were   you can always find another job  you can't find another body  you only get one ,mn0p5s

1235,A special kind of depression that comes with turning your childhood hobby into a career.,the first  few years into the workforce are not so bad   you are quite familiar with the processes  after a few more years   things are not the same  the thing that you enjoyed doing for fun is now a chore   it used to be your favorite pastime   for the most part   it used to be a part of your identity  now   you have no choice to stop doing it when the fun stops  doing it is pegged to your ability to buy food   clothing and other necessities    feels like blackmail  you spent so much time perfecting your craft just to be rewarded with doing the same thing for 5-6 days a week for 8hours   commute a day and this time under the supervision and command of others stating a new hobby sounds like a good idea  but unfortunately as an adult you don't have has a much time and patience for overcoming the initial hard parts of a new hobby  you cant continue with the old hobby at home after 5  hours of doing it at work  after a few more years you even dread of going to work to do the same thing  boy does being an adult suck  it wouldn't be this way if financial obligations didn't seek to dominate every hour of your life ,mneiwv
1236,I feel like my job is going to make me come in after I get the vaccination to avoid giving me PTO,in ny state employees are allowed to take up to 4 hours of paid time off of work which doesn t affect any current pto we have  i m hoping to at least take advantage of that and take rest of the day off after getting the vaccine  also for safety reasons since i ve heard you should be mindful about any reactions after getting the vaccine    but since my appt is at 1 30 i feel like my manager is going to try to convince me to come in after getting the shot and i have no idea how i m going to wiggle my way out of this  they re stingy asf and don t want to give employees  unearned pto  for the vaccine but i m going to take the 4 hours that was granted to us anyway  wish me luck and post any tips you have in case they try to force me to come in ,mngiie

1238,What’s your opinion on this?,the thing is  a lot of people nowadays say oh just make your passion your job  follow your dreams and all that    but at the same time  a part of me fears that if i make my passion my job  there s a part of me that makes me think i d hate it eventually   i m feeling confused cause some people are saying like oh making your passion your job is a great thing  but the other side of me is just like if i can find a job i can at least tolerate and be okay with i ll be fine  but would i truly be happy though   i m more on the side of doing my passion just as a passion  i don t think it s a good idea to make it a job  i d be forced to do it whenever i don t feel like doing it  which is something i dislike  cause that s what kills the joy for me    the other side of the spectrum  people tell me that i should keep my passion as a passion  and pursue it only as a hobby   but then another side says that is limiting myself  i m so confused about all of this and everything feels uncertain  i just really need some advice or something ,mnkkc7

1245,Safety culture is at war with productivity, begin rant  canadian railway worker here  i work on a 10 man crew that fixes rail defects  i would like to think this is productive work that should be encouraged  we kinda play a major part in keeping north america's supply chain operating by keeping the train wheels facing in a downward direction   down is good   i operate heavy equipment that requires constant maintenance to function properly  this involves crawling under machines and wiggling into tight spaces on greasy equipment    today is my first day back to work for a 9 day shift  as we have some new crew members  we have two extra safety officers on site today to  make sure everybody is being safe   0600 - i drive to fuel pumps to fill my truck  decide to change a wiper while filling fuel tanks  safety dipshit sees me changing the wiper and asks what i am doing  i say  changing a wiper  he asks  oh  you're changing a wiper   great start   0700 - i arrive at work location and begin inspecting a machine that i will be operating today  safety dipshit tells me to get out of the machine so he can show me pictures of an audit he performed on another crew  how is this relevant to me  nobody knows  maybe he wants to show off his new iphone   0725 - i am warming up the machine and functioning the hydraulics  checking for leaks and whatnot  safety dipshit tells me to stop moving as there is a train passing by  100 feet away from my machine  super helpful  thanks  probably saved my life   0730 - safety dipshit begins taking pictures of two other contractors from another company that we work with  they are a separate company with their own safety program and their own liability insurance  other contractors are confused and understandably a little pissed off   0735 - i am familiarizing myself with the new machine and going through my checklists  safety dipshit interrupts me to point out that the inspection tag on the fire extinguisher needs to be metal  i nod and go back to what i was doing  safety dipshit interrupts me again to tell me he is going to order some metal tags  fantastic  good to know  safety dipshit tells me how to put a mark or a dent on the monthly inspection tag for the fire extinguisher  he instructs me on how to use a nail to make a dent on the metal tag  fascinating    0810 - i decide to grease a boom truck that i will also be operating this week  i shut off my truck and put wheel chocks under the tires  even though the brakes are set and i am on level ground    safety dipshit walks past my tires with wheel chocks under them  he is standing next to a greasy rag and empty grease tube  i have a grease gun in my hand  he leans down and asks me what i am doing  i resist the urge to say  kundalini yoga  or  baking a birthday cake  and simply reply  greasing my truck  safety dipshit feels the urge to ask   are you okay  between gritted teeth  i reply  yes  i'm fine  safety dipshit asks  is your truck going to move  omfg   0817 - i crawl out from under my truck and safety dipshit races over to talk to me before i get a chance to put my chin diaper on  as i am wearing greasy nitrile gloves  he then proceeds to tell me about how i need to wear a mask if i am within 6 feet of another worker  this really happened   0825 - i find out that safety dipshit  2 went into my truck while i was under it and began moving around my personal belongings to see if i had completed all my checklists and paperwork  i was literally completing items from that checklist while he was going through my truck  he didn't bother mentioning that he rummaged through my personal belongings   0835 -  i am inspecting my truck  the nearest person is 75 feet away  safety dipshit  2 sees that i am not wearing a mask and races over to tell me the exact same thing that safety dipshit   just told me  i need to wear a mask when i am within 6 feet of somebody  thank you for racing over to give me shit for being compliant until you snuggled up next to me and made me non-compliant   0910 - i have two hard hats  one is orange and has ear muffs and a face shield  the other is white and has nothing on it  i use the white one when the bulky orange one is a nuisance  safety dipshit  2 reminds me that i can't wear a white one  as it is for supervisors    1015 - i have given up  i have tried taking the initiative  i have tried being proactive  i am now drinking coffee and playing on my phone  the safety dipshits have stopped all movement on site  productivity for today is zero    this kind of bullshit is why production has left canada  crippling compliance  over-reaching safety  and over-the-top environmental regulations have made it unprofitable to invest in canada  commodities used to be the backbone of canada  now it's banking  the working class has been eviscerated   we are held hostage by safety officers and our excessively litigious society  workers live under constant threats of punishment for not knowing every nuance of the labour code  every moron who does something stupid and likely lies about it ends up adding another rules for everybody to follow    in order to do my job  i need to be compliant with federal and provincial transportation rules  hours of service requirements  covid rules  my company's procedures and requirements  the railway's rules  the municipality's rules  labour code  all while being courteous to landowners and other drivers  i also had to sign anti-harassment and bullying forms  if i actually dedicated myself to being 100  compliant  i couldn't actually legally work    for instance  wearing a company-supplied mask blows humid air onto my safety glasses and eliminates my ability to see  exercising my right to refuse unsafe work under these conditions is technically possible  but i will likely be seen as a  problem worker  and will suddenly stop getting called to work  which is not actually the same thing as getting fired    days like today make me want to go live in the woods  i am tired of this work culture  i am tired of canada  i am tired of subjugation and compliance to useless safety dipshits who couldn't hack doing real work  i am tired of self-serving bureaucrats whose only function is to ensure their own job security   those who can't do  teach  those who can't do or teach become safety officers   no wonder china is eating our lunch    end rant,mmay6u
1246,I fucked up. Feeling suicidal right now.,i had a very good job that was in my field  music  not too dystopian an environment  public library  and things were starting to look up after months of hellish experiences  well  at least until my dumbass autistic self ruined everything   so one day i had to attend an event where i had to play a game online with the teenagers  in the game a question along the likes of  get over it  would be a ridiculous response to  overwhelmed with the stress of making sure that i would be engaged   i was given a sheet that would have measured my communication abilities  not easy thanks to my disability  and under stress of a timer  i ended up hastily saying something along the lines of  getting raped    i answered the question honestly with no ill-will  but thanks to my autistic natural lack of filter  i can t properly apply social filters under pressure  what i ended up saying was not appropriate for teen spaces  and as a result i was fired  after just three weeks  and i was so happy about my life finally getting better  now it s back to indeed hell for me  even if i managed to get another job  not easy since my condition makes interviews very difficult  i m certain i ll never get another opportunity like the one i had  someone please tell me why i shouldn t just jump off a bridge   there are a lot around where i live ,mmbueg

1250,Life is a game,within this interactive game is a number of games you can play  the 9 to 5er  the entrepreneur  the entertainer to name a few  all these games require time and energy and some  a level of skill and currency    to win the game is to not have to play games for survival  this requires a certain amount of in game currency that for most players is out of reach  so they are forced to play until social security kicks in and subsidises their remaining game play    there are other games one may opt to play such as relationships and creating mini character versions of themselves  these games require a significant investment of time  energy and currency    since time and energy is limited it may be wise to limit the amount of games one chooses to play  collecting shiny objects may be tempting but these require time and energy to polish and maintain and can cut into your downtime as well as your currency reserves   it may be wise to limit these objects and reduce the number of games you opt to play as the typical 9 to 5 is very time costly   save your 9 to 5 currency as every weeks worth saved is a week you dont have to play   you may be able to buy yourself enough time to switch from one game to another    in the mean time try to enjoy your game play and keep the stakes low as possible to reduce stress  also refrain from abusing your console    play the lottery weekly for a chance to win a cheat code if you were'nt randomly handed one at the start menu  good luck and happy gaming ,mmfu0r

1259,I am seriously debating quitting but need advice and support.,i need to provide some pretext but i will make this as brief as possible    i've been self-employed since i was 16 years old  primarily selling on ebay   i've worked retail and other jobs off and on since i moved to iowa in 2017    i took a job march of last year because the pandemic fucked everything up  there was a two month period i had no income  because everything came to a halt  all the thrift stores closed due to the pandemic and not being essential  a lot of local auction companies never sold online and had to learn and invest in selling online   so now it's april and i have 13 months at this place under my belt  but i ask myself every single day is it worth it   why  because i'm on day 7 of a 10 day vacation  unpaid of course    i literally feel like i've been released from prison  i have so much less stress now it's unbelievable   i have a lot of health conditions that has always made working for someone else absolutely suck  none of which are either severe enough or do not qualify for disability  but who wants that anyways  it does not pay jack shit    imagine sleeping 10 hours one night but feeling like you got either an hour of sleep  or no sleep at all  that's pretty much 3-4 days out of every week for me   i've had every test imaginable  full mri  thyroid levels  thyroid ultrasound  all kinds of blood and urine tests  nothing indicates why i'm always so tired and lacking energy  i do have sleep apnea and use a machine  but it only helps a little  i can literally drink an energy drink and fall asleep    so working a set schedule sucks ass  i've literally blanked out for a couple seconds while driving due to lack of sleep  of course i get massive shit if i come to work tired  even though i literally talk on a phone and don't sound tired in my voice  so it comes down to either driving to work exhausted and showing up  or not showing up and getting fired    but  i'm not lazy or one of those  neet  people  i've literally been making money since legally able to  i just can't handle working for others   it's not just having shitty health  i despise co-workers  they all have this fake  buddy buddy  persona and when you need to talk to them about something important but non-work related  they don't care  they are also very superficial and will run to the boss to narc if you say one tiny bad thing about your boss or company  i've never seen so many people walk on eggshells like i do with co-workers of any place i've worked    i also despise management  too  i'm always super polite and friendly with my supervisors or bosses  but i don't kiss ass  i'm not one of those chummy  sweet talk the boss types  i view my boss as another person  and give them as much respect as they give me  i don't fucking worship them or put them on a pedestal  but guess who never gets compliments  or gets in trouble for shit that other co-workers never get talked or reprimanded for  that's right  me    but  i have a few issues if i quit  for starters i feel like i'm letting down my parents  i know that sounds stupid  but i am close and have a strong relationship with my parents and telling them news like that is never easy  now my parents are very understanding and won't do anything stupid like cut me off or quit talking to me for telling them i quit  but i still feel like they will be a bit disappointed in me   but i live with my wife and pay the bills  my parents do not  i have to go to work  my parents do not  what i do with my life is my choice  but i still feel bad  ya know   the other issue is qualifying for a mortgage  credit unions and banks tend to laugh at self employed people which is quite stupid  i can get fired or laid off at anytime  but other than the two month freeze during the pandemic  i can make money no matter what    lastly is retirement  my job chips in 30 cents of every dollar i put in retirement  you don't get that advantage when working for yourself    otherwise i figure if i devote more time to my self employment  i can make up for what i would make working  maybe  100- 200 less per month  but not be  maybe if i fall asleep this time i won't wake back up and not have to go to work   sorry for the wall of text  i am really torn on this and would like advice ,mn05m5

1268,8 hr shifts are inhumane,yes i realize people work longer  regularly  but this week since we don't have any major profit boost-er i mean  holidays  coming up  i have mostly 5 hour shifts this pay period  which sucks for being paid hourly  but is also a godsend for my personal life    if you've never worked in food service or retail  8 hour shifts suck  on your feet constantly  waiting on customers  cleaning  cooking  stocking  it's not always hard physical labor  but it sure is stressful because of the environment and expectations    it's so nice to not have to come home from an 8 hour shift only to have a little down time  usually filled with errands just to prepare yourself for the next 8 hour shift   i realize part of the reason i hate waking up for work is that i'm nowhere near rested enough even with plenty of sleep  but today i'm done at 10pm and don't have to be back until 5pm the next day  it's honestly great    i'm sitting back  eating a sandwich  browsing reddit  knowing i have to work  but it's not this looming sense of dread hanging over me  i had time to wake and fully prepare myself    i don't understand why this isn't the norm  most 8 hour shifts just waste productivity anyway   i still would rather not have this system at all  but in terms of coping with what we got  5 hour shifts are really nice ,mmwopc
1269,I fucking hate emails.,i have an extremely email heavy job  a job that i hate  but that s a story for another post  the sheer and immediate entitlement people feel whenever they send an email is  unreal  i seriously get in the triple digits of emails a day and every  single  day  some new asshole is whining that i didn t get back to them until the following business day  fuck you    i hate that putting an out of office message does nothing to curb the insane amount of emails i get  i hate how easily things fall through the cracks because i m so overworked  it s impossible to keep track of every little thing  i hate that deadlines and reasonable requests are sprinkled into a sea of bullshit that i have to wade through every day  i hate that people feel so entitled to an immediate response to their questions that they have no understanding that i actually have to do research before answering them  i hate that emails make people think i m available 24 7  and the disgusting workplace culture that encourages these unreasonable demands  i hate that someone seriously just complained to me that email is too cumbersome for her  so she expects me to text with her instead    i just want to crawl in a hole and die most days  seriously  i feel like i am being worked to death ,mmy2fe

1275,Sick days.,i work at a bakery  i bake stuff  and sell it  disguised and paid as a cashier i am responsible for an entire shop on some days   wouldn't that make me a manager  no  because otherwise they would have to pay me more  also i am not allowed to eat anything without paying and have to throw 200-600  worth of food in the trash by the end of each day  but that's another topic   currently we are understaffed because the bakery chain is slowly vanishing and stopped hiring new people  i wonder what could have led to this  throw 200-600  worth of food in the trash by the end of each day  the branch manager  a cashier like us  just a slightly higher position  like a supervisor  went on a one week vacation  on the first day of her vacation she calls in sick  for the entire next week  no info  nothing  just that she's sick  that's fine   after calling the higher district manager about this to see if we can find someone from another shop to help us out he starts crying about how he is already helping out in other bakeries despite it not being his job   poor soul had to serve people for a few days  what a pity    few days later turns out  he moved his vacation closer  so now he's gone too   after working 10-12h shifts to keep this bs bakery running   knowing that in october this year we will all be laid off anyway  the district manager comes back and has the audacity to thank us for our great work and that this company needs people like us   i don't want a thank you  i want a check that says  here  have 100  for putting in so much effort  but instead i get to correct the time stamp paper because for someone reason on some days some working hours just  disappear  like we are open until 20 00 but the clock checked me out at 19 22  sure  i left and a ghost took over and finished the shift huh  not like i always work overtime until 20 15 because we can't take out the cash register to start counting before 20 00  that's multiple hours you legaly don't get paid if you don't watch out    amp x200b   so today i called in sick  my nose is running like crazy and i am for sure not going to work with food in this condition  last thing we need is the health department giving us a visit  closing down the entire bakery  and after all it's my responsibility to not risk the health of our customers   i had a digital appointment with my doctor and she told me to stay at home and minimize all contacts till monday  if it doesn't get better i should do a quick covid test   so i call the district manager and  he actually tried to talk me out of calling in sick   so you really want to call in sick because of a runny nose   it wouldn't be very collegial towards the others  like  excuse me  didn't you  desert  us while understaffed like a few weeks ago  and aren't you supposed to make sure proper hygiene is carried out in all the shops  that's straight up inconsiderate  i also had to inform the branch manager and she just send me a message saying  i should do the covid test now so if it turns out negative i could still come in for todays late shift  besides the irony of  do as i say  not as i do  this is just f up  a covid test is not going to change the fact that i went through an entire toilet paper roll in one day just for my nose   after ignoring that message for  four  minutes she is trying to  call  me  nah  i ain't picking up  i'll just say i was taking a nap because guess what  i'm sick   sick and tired of how you should feel bad for being sick    sick and tired of how hard work has become during covid    sick and tired of hearing thank yous  don't thank me  pay me    i just want to survive ,mng1k7

1321,The you gotta deal with bullshit in every job mentality needs to stop.,i'm sick of hearing people say my job sucks but what can i do  you dont deserve to be abused  a scape goat or treated like a nothing human being for any amount of money  idk about you guys but if the options are go hungry or get shit on id rather take hunger  when did we decide a certain amount of abuse is acceptable we need to take back our balls  if a job treats you like shit stand up leave ,mlmz7l
1322,Going from working part-time to full-time (advice needed),so  i ve been working three days a week  25-30 hours  for the past month-and-a-half after being largely out of work for around ten months  so far  it s going pretty well and i generally enjoy my job  accounting  and the people i work with  it was initially on an interim basis for tax season and i agreed to work three days  citing personal reasons and wanting to study for the cpa exam   however  today  after telling me how much they like my work  they offered me a full-time position with more money and benefits  when i m ready  even without seeing the terms  it seems like a no-brainer to accept  as i m currently just paid hourly   my problem is that i do not do well personally when i work full-time and five days a week  yes  professionally i can hack it but i m miserable  i m not the most efficient with my personal time unfortunately  moderate ocd  and i generally require a decent amount of alone time  i also do a very poor job of getting enough sleep at night when i m working a lot  since i have so many interests and goals i m going for that keep me up   even working just three days a week  i m only able to average around 4-5 hours of sleep on work nights  i catch up the other days  i ve also unfortunately gained about 8-10 pounds and though i m not overweight  i m not in the best of shape at this point  obviously a lack of sleep and consuming caffeine has contributed to this   i guess  in a nutshell  i m asking for advice on handling this  i do enjoy my job and those i work with and i want to stay but going in five days a week just isn t going to work well for me long-term  i ve done this in the past at other jobs  i mentioned when they hired me initially that i could work more if i was able to do so remotely but they shot me down  the current situation is manageable  even if the early hours don t work well for me  but anything more and i m going to struggle   so what do you think  how should i play this ,mlsmc6
1323,Becoming a Praise and Thank You hustler,my employer uses an app that allows employees to praise and thank their colleagues for being helpful   you collect points wherever someone thanks you in the app  and you can redeem the points for gift cards  kinda like leaving a tip   so  it's no longer enough to say  thanks for the brojob  tom  company culture demands you to tip them for their service   there is a leader board which shows who has received the most points for the month  basically gamifying gratitude   what's point of gratitude without a gratuity  better hustle those praise and thank you's  son ,mlgmaw

1326,What does your CEO do?,i am going to be completely honest and i just like to hear your stories guys  what the heck does your ceo do   i've always seen them appearing once or twice a week month and just say some irrelevant shit and then leave to the shadows again   please note that with ceo i'm referring to the person that has the executive role   is founder or co-founder  not hired   this is a low-key rant because apparently people say the deserve a shit load of money because they bear the risks and made investments to make the business work  and fair enough but how comes the businesses are always on the edge of collapsing because  money isn't enough to make everything function properly 1 1 we need to cut down on those coffee machines  while ceos post photos of themselves on yacht  on vacation in tropical islands  driving fancy cars   just why   so they make x300 my salary because 30 years ago they invested 200k and now are liable of the business   do they make x300 because they work x300 times harder than me  i don't think so  i just see them chilling and doing literally nothing and posting it on instagram   cmon  they can't fool me  they don't work x300 harder than me  they don't make deals with customers because they don't even know what the company can or can not do   on top of that companies' legal status provides  limited  liability so they can't even take ceos assets  at least in my country  in case of bankruptcy   sorry for the rant,mlw77i
1327,Making money stresses me out,does anyone else feel like they'd feel better about work  well  some work at least  if we were living in a money-free society  for example  i've been volunteering at a dog shelter and it only brings me joy  but if i was getting paid for it i know i'd stress out  or i recently painted a portrait for a friend's birthday and i enjoyed painting it but if i get a dm asking for a commission i get a panic attack  it's like if my work is benefiting someone or the community that motivates me  but as soon as money gets thrown into the mix it scares me      ps  i know i can only have this mindset because my family is able to help me financially and i never experienced poverty  i'm not rich by any means but i don't struggle either ,mlzbp3
1328,I'm tired of my self worth being tied to my performance at work,i've posted about this a lot  but i feel like i'm not doing great at my first job  everyone keeps telling me that i just haven't passed the learning curve  but i'm feeling pretty lost to be honest with you  sometimes i'll have days where i only get tasks i fully know how to complete but most of the time it feels like i'm just fumbling through tasks trying to appease everyone and it's just impossible  i should be clear  no one yells at me or talks bad about me to me  yet  it just sucks to spend 9 hours a day doing something i feel like i'm not even good at  sometimes i enjoy the it aspects but that's trumped by the near constant feeling of inadequacy  can't quit because i need the money  i don't really want to spend my free time applying to another job because i feel like it's all going to be the same and at least here i got management that doesn't yell or pressure me too much  every day after work i can't help but feel like i'm just not getting it  i'll never care enough about this company to succeed    haven't even had my morning meeting and i already fucked up a basic task due to lack of fundamental understanding  a part of me wishes my boss would just yell at me instead of fake corporate lingo  but it'll be alright  life keeps moving  i just live for the weekends  it's depressing and the feels like not much i can do about it but put my head down and keep grinding ,mm20x5

1334,How did you accomplish a work-free/work-lite lifestyle?,i see a lot of comiserating on this subreddit but very few productive conversations in how to accomplish an anti-work life  while i'm not work free i have a very healthy work life balance and live a decently comfortable life  i'm a temp  i started off doing non-skilled labor  did some work with electricians  currently in school for welding to become a welding temp  the temp life has its fair share of bullshit but it's best quality is that due to its nature i don't ever have the same boss for more than a few months and that there are breaks in between jobs  i tend to work 2-3 months at a time and take a month or two to live off my savings and unemployment before going back to work to re up on money  how i plan to move closer to being totally work-free is to trade cryptocurrencies and stocks untill i eventually have enough money to be able to take longer and longer breaks and so far  after some trial and error  i've ve found a system that works for me to make steady profits on crypto and that i can scale up with time ,ml4mg5

1337,Being an essential worker broke me,i m tired  just  so tired   why  why am i still doing this  why do i still drag myself out the door for a company that doesn t care if i live or die   i work for a popular grocery store chain  one with a reputation for standing by its workers  before the shit storm that started with this pandemic  i would ve agreed  we have pretty damn good health insurance  decent pay  and flexible hours  the people i work with are fun  and i consider many of them to be my friends  i gained a lot of confidence since starting there  and i considered it a positive influence in my life   but i can t anymore  they abandoned us   it started small  first we weren t allowed gloves on the register  can t have the customer thinking  we see them as dirty  or that we re scared  i ve seen coworkers sent home without pay after arguing with managers over this  then the panic buying started  people reached over our heads  demanded more mere inches from our faces  screaming  all of us  customers and employees  crammed in a small store with little space between  we were offered overtime instead of protection   we weren t allowed masks until several weeks passed  anyone who wore one into work was expected to take it off before starting a shift  one of my coworkers would ve been fired for wearing one all through their shifts if a state mandate hadn t been implemented  they started cutting hours  and sending people home if we weren t busy  any time we missed had to be covered by our ar  or we weren t paid for it   then came the issue of health insurance  it s one of the biggest draws of working at this place  at first  things were okay  the company grandfathered in everyone into their insurance for the spring summer measurement period  it was a huge relief for everyone  if we missed a few days due to cuts  it didn t count against us  at the time  they didn t carry it through to the second half of the year  fall was a scramble for hours  i saw full timers who ve been with the company 10  lose their health insurance in the middle of a pandemic  it was soul crushing  this happened while hours were still being cut   they tired to give us a  bonus  instead of putting money into our 401ks  the opted everyone into it  and encouraged us to take the money  if you really need it  tantalizing their already struggling work force with money that  if we take it  will harm our prospects of retirement in the long run while saving themselves millions  if you wanted that money to go into your 401k  you had to manually opt out of it   there s more  more personal stuff  the daily berating of customers who are sick of wearing masks  sick of having to wait in a line outside the store  sick of all the cleaning getting in the way of their shopping experience  sick of us just trying to stay safe  too many people think it s okay to touch me on the job  to pull down their masks to talk to me  yell at me for waiting outside just to find out their favorite product is out of stock  or bringing their whole family just to get out of the house    i can tolerate a lot  if the company had chosen to help us get vaccinated  i could forgive a lot   but they didn t   we re on our own for appointments  i d say at my store  less than half have had their first shots  we ve been eligible since february  but it s an absolute struggle to get an appointment   they abandoned us   but everyday i have to hear people around me talk about how great the company is  how wonderful  it feels like gaslighting  i ve given up on talking to management about my concerns  they don t care  about us  or the customer  all they care about is the bottom line  human life is secondary ,ml0eoj

1364,There's nothing responsible about taking part in something you have no say in,if you don't work  humanity will let you suffer  despite having more than enough to prevent it  you don't get any other option other than spending a massive portion of your life working  you have no say in this matter  so you can't claim whatever  decision  you make regarding it is some sort of responsible one  there's nothing  mature  or enviable about living life in a way that you wouldn't choose to if you had other options outside of servitude    there is  nothing wrong  with wanting to live in a way that makes you comfortable  happy and of most benefit to those around you  wanting to spend time with loved ones  learning  exercising  exploring  trying new things  relaxing and getting as much sleep as you need are signs of maturity  not immaturity    if we want to claim we live in a free country  we have to allow people to choose for themselves how they spend their time  anything less is servitude  and honestly the fact that we have to explain to people that servitude is a bad thing gives me chills  convincing people that they are free despite having to live in a very particular way is one the most impressive tricks humans have played on themselves  it's honestly interesting seeing people who claim to  love freedom  defend the furthest thing from it every single day ,mlvp65

1369,Isn’t it kind of stupid to require employees to get doctors notes for being out sick?,my work requires a note for anytime you call out for not feeling well  for me  i have regular mental health issues and migraines  i don t go to my doctor for a migraine  because i can t even get to one when i can barely see straight and am vomiting all over  i had to take off today because of severe anxiety and ptsd symptoms  my note is going to be from my therapist  and i m worried my employer is going to be uncomfortable when she reads that i took off for mental health reasons  most of my past employers didn t believe in mental illness  i feel like it s none of their business why i m out sick  it feels like an unnecessary hoop to make the employee jump through  it s just a pain in the ass  now i m having anxiety about how my boss will react to finding out i have mental health issues ,mksj47
1370,Well fuck.,so end of the lock down last year  i live in nz  i was made redundant from a job i hated but was begrudgingly working in  which was fine  i now got the redundancy govt benefit for up to 3 months and it was sweet i did not a lot of anything because free time means anything i wanted   well that had to run out and i moved down to look for a fruit picking job while i could stay with aunty cheaply   long story short i ended up finding another it job  however it was finally internal and a mix of t1 and t2 support for a winery  pay is fantastic and the benefits are really good  my manager used to have my role and he s super great leaves me alone  only chasing me up when he needs to  and for a while it was great  as long as i hit my 40 hours he doesn t care when i work it s very flexible and cruisy and the end users are also really good  a potential  i don t dream of labour  dream job   yet slowly and surely tedium is setting in and my days are starting to blend and i have to force myself to perform tasks and draw energy from somewhere to get things done  i ve only been back to work about 8 months   fuck ,mltrt8

1375,Just got let go. Hurry up and end this rat race called wage slavery.,i was working in a factory    i got little sleep last night  i was busy so i ended up going to bed later than i wanted to  i came into work  6 am  was only there for a week today  was being trained and i had a hard time keeping my eyes open  i was told by the manager i can t sleep  i m not trying to sleep and i was literally trying to keep my eyes open  i want to learn but i am fucking tired so it s hard to do that  i was accused of not engaging before and yes it is my fault because i did not put the effort into going to bed earlier  but today i tried my best and i have tried my best before when i was tired too    then later  the trainer was busy helping out someone else while i waited  i was pulled aside by the hiring agency agent or whatever because i apparently don t engage  yet  what am i supposed to do if i m waiting for my next instruction ffs  if i look away from the trainer for 2 seconds i get accused of not paying attention too   bs    then later comes the final nail in the coffin for me  the trainer was explaining showing us how to read blueprints and i couldn t hear her  so i told her that  she told me to come in closer to her to hear her so i did and i still couldn t hear her and she starting talking even more quietly  she said  she didn t want to yell  i was leaning in and was like 4 feet away with my hand up to my ear to hear and still couldn t decipher  factories are loud  speak up ffs    she asks me a question expecting a answer and i told her i didn t know because i can t hear  she walks away  sighs loudly  then comes back  got a call when i came home that i was let go but they offered to train me in another department  screw that  i do not want to see these people ever again    being in a factory made me feel not much different from being the replacable parts like i was assembling  yes  it was my fault and i fully admit that i should be doing better getting proper sleep  i think they were in the total wrong for being impatient and inconsiderate at all when explaining things to people who can t hear you well    i look forward to the time when jobs get automated  having to do this for years makes me feel dread  day in and day out of wage slavery ,ml149o

1392,"Nostalgia, escapism, geek culture",i'm sure most of you have noticed a rise in a certain kind of consumer culture  the reenacting of the old  and the promise of awe and excitement  of entering a different world of purpose  this symptom of our times should not be treated as a mere  extension of childhood  in a condescending manner  or vilified as simple capitalist  consumerism  it is an anthropological crisis developing in front of us every day  people have lost hope in changing the world  apathy is on the rise  life has become atomized  self-indulging  coping  going through the motions to get to the weekend   so  whenever a different world is shown to us  we are drawn to it  the stories  the fauna  the characters  the civilizations  the technology or lack thereof  it all fascinates us  collectively we nucleate as fans of certain shows  movies  games  books  etc  as  at the same time  our striving for something different and also our individualistic lifestyles  escapism is so widespread because it tries to fill our yearning for purpose  and shows us a world where our existential problems would vanish  mainly a sense of disconnection  of uselessness  of submitting to the worthless rat-race  it gives us an adventure that we cannot live today without risking all that we have  emotions  and experiences   this happened to me with several media  novels  documentaries  of course  there's always a romantic idealism  but maybe criticizing escapism as naive is even more naive than that  you can't expect us subjects of capitalism to have an objective sense of what our human existence could be like  or how much could it be improved in the spiritual sense  in our quest for purpose and belonging  if anything  we have to give more power to these visions  as they could tell us so much about our own oppression and the disenchantment of the modern capitalist world ,mm3o1j

1466,"Is this, what do they call it, ""Your Best Life""?",omg  wild   all this time i've been asking myself  what's wrong with me  why don't i care to impress anyone anymore  why don't i want to do my work  and besides that obvious  ever-pressing apathy that comes with your work being ignored  which again is wholly my fault and a vicious cycle because i never get anything finished  i simply realised today that the reason i haven't been striving for more and killing myself the way i usually would be is because i'm happy   i'm 29 f  gay  live alone in a little bachelor pad where no one bothers me  and that's honestly a life closest to my deepest values and desires - and that's why it's been a struggle to strive for more  i can barely bother with the headache  i'm not rich  i have dreams  there are things i absolutely could work harder for  but like on a base happiness level with all the things i can control  i've reached a level of contentment that makes striving for anything else literally a risk  or a bother   sure  i could try and get out there  get a girlfriend but if it doesn't happen  meh   i could try and get richer but i'd have to work harder and i just like my bottom of the barrel but adequate life so  meh    i could try and travel but like if i don't it'd still be okay  so meh   i could work out and become a monster being but i'm in pretty good shape as it is right now an am so bored of long term goals  so meh   i don't really have any friends or family or crushes i need to impress and as nice as those things would be to have  i'm perfectly happy being a hermit and love my own space   i don't have any enemies to defeat because i feel i live a better life than all of them as it is  how i am right now  genuinely  it's not my best life but at least i don't have any problems  currently    so maybe this is my best life   sounds selfish  i know  i used to be the  save the world  type but it just got boring and old and other people's cynicism have gotten to me  i used to try to sell my art but it was too much work trying to beg people to see what i see  to beg people to enjoy something ffs  so i just create for myself now  maybe i'll become one of those hidden gems who gains posthumous success for their art when they die because that seems to be the only time people want to take notice  i'm tired of yelling at the top of my lungs for unity and compassion and philanthropy and have people look at you like you have two heads  over it   i think i've peaked and i'm cool with that  haha  there's no resentment  just peace  as long as i can just survive and afford my basics  i'm sweet  if i can't i'll just get another job  or become a prostitute  or just die  lol there's literally no reason to worry and the worrying was making me ill  i don't care about  omg tiktok make  30 more per hour reddit financial freedom  bla bla  i could just be burntout but i don't think so  this has been going on for a while  if this was the olden days  i'd be that loner in his hut by the lake with my dog  bro  fuck it all ,mkgijb

1470,How I made it out of the system,i'm going to keep this short - just suffice to say i've been an unhappy cog in the machine for 20  years   i discovered investing about 4 years ago and i am retiring a little later this year - i'll live off the interest - i won't be rich  i'll have to live frugally  around 40k a year for the first few years until i build the nest egg   full disclosure though - i inherited my house  it's nothing great but i didn't have to buy it and that's a massive expense for most people   the stock market is kept intentionally overwhelming and confusing to deter average people - i started learning how to invest from the book 'the intelligent investor' and with  400 i got into the market   i read every book i could find about investing  learned options  built up to 25k  and started day trading   there are a ton of resources out there for new investors learning the ropes   i never invested more than 1  of my total pool  i've never yolo'd into a position hoping to get rich off one trade  i just played the odds  learned how to read charts  do my own due diligence  and learn who not to listen to   i'm not saying this will work for everyone - but with time  effort  and patience it can work for most people   it's not ideal - it's stressful at times - and it's not what i consider 'fun'  apart from winning trades  but it has given me my life back and as of august  i will answer to no one anymore    it's going to be a long time before work is eliminated - but you can help yourself in the meantime - and you don't need a lot to do it   just stay away from no commission brokers like robinhood and stay away from yolo plays and you can pull this off as well   i was completely financially illiterate 5 years ago - credit score in the 500s  didn't understand good vs bad debt  compounded interest etc - our school systems are set up to keep you in your place   having money in the bank gives you confidence and improves every aspect of your life - yes  it's absolute bullshit that's what it takes but it's better for the most part than being homeless or not having any options   good luck ,mkp8tj

1474,New to sub but Anti(useless)work most of my life.,hi everyone  i just found this subreddit today and am happy to find a community of people who share my thoughts about how crazy the modern work world is and how valuable our time on this earth is  i thought i'd share my experiences and difficulties and hope they help someone   i am 34 living in the usa  when i was in elementary school  i only learned english from school while my parents spoke to me in two non-english languages  i was consistently getting below average scores on standardized tests and my teacher thought i was retarded  as anyone would be if they only had us public school to teach them  one day i decided to get a kid's novel i could hardly read  work through it myself for a few weeks  and by the time i was done  i was finally able to read most english books with good fluency  it also taught me a lifelong lesson of teaching myself from books   since i was 13  i didn't want to do meaningless work that didn't actually help people  in the early 2000s  i read books from the 1950s warning of politicians leading the usa into its current economic situation and i couldn't deny that was the direction we were going  i was aware of the transfer of industry from the usa to asian countries and that automation would obsolete jobs   during high school  i was tired of the public education propaganda  and i was already learning the things i needed from books at local libraries  i would skip classes  go to the library or outside school  and went through more of the textbooks than i would sitting in class  i wanted to homeschool but my parents wouldn't let me  so i had to wait until i was 16  the legal age to decide for myself to homeschool in the state i lived in  this caused a lot problems in my asian family  some were neutral or supportive  some said that i was no longer family   while homeschooling  i still worked hard to go through the textbooks i needed to read  but it gave me the freedom to learn when and where i wanted to  whether library  outside  or at home  and i had a lot more time to learn new things and pursue my hobbies  i really appreciated how i was in control of my own time  and my time didn't get wasted on things like going to and from school  pointless class activities  waiting on classes to start or end  lunch  or physical education   i did well on my ged and sat tests and got into a good engineering school  anyone thinking about homeschooling but are hesitant to because you think it may hinder getting into a good college  please know that many homeschoolers do get into good colleges  what matters to them is whether you can demonstrate adequate proficiency and are prepared   college was less retarded than public school  and good for the people who can put up with it and find their dream jobs  i dropped out after working at a commercial solar pv installation company  i learned to design pv installation layouts and install solar panels on the job site  i eventually worked full time but we have an understanding that i can come and go as i like  right now i am taking a long break from my day job and working for an open source project  and learning programming because i would like to contribute code to the open source ecosystem  in the hopes that someday we can have a humane ubi system based on open source software   i live frugally and have taken long periods of time off from work to just spend time on my hobbies  learn new things  and try different work that interests me  i am not rich  but i take care of my health and am time rich  i don't waste my money on materialistic goods  and i find my time well-spent working on things i care about  at the age of 34  looking back i may not have gotten on the career path to make millions like some people around me  but i feel like i have been semi-retired since 16  only doing work that i find enriching  taking plenty of time to explore the things that interest me  and most importantly  pursuing the things my heart tells me to ,mkc3vx

1478,Sick of the obsession with productivity and perfection,the corporate world went downhill as soon as companies started religiously focusing on productivity and employee outputs  all this stuff straight out of a harvard mba  things like kpis  lean sigma  this corporate bullshit where they take concepts from manufacturing and apply them to people    except it doesn't work like that because these metrics are simple and don't account for so much so it's easy to bias them  management reducing staff may increase their kpis and the bean counters will praise them for reducing expenses  but all it's doing is putting more pressure on the existing employees  longer hours  more work  more stress  more phonecalls  more emails  more shit to deal with  they wonder why there's so many big fuck ups and it's because employees have too much on their plate to deal with  even if they don't mess up they just burn out and wind up in the hands of the mental health industry  that's the problem with being cheap  you pay more in the end    but this illness is spreading faster than covid  jobs are becoming more and more scarce as a result of automation  offshoring and reducing employees to save money  and management looks good  jobs being scarce is putting fear in everyone who wants a lifestyle above poverty level  workers are now so scared they're endlessly trying to be productive in their lives  not because they really want to but because they want need to impress hiring managers in the future    those of you who went to college university would've seen people doing all these extra-curriculars  leadership roles  volunteering  not because they truly wanted to do it but because they want to impress hiring managers  you see them on linkedin using bullshit corporate lingos like  motivated self starter  and  devoted to self improvement  they sound and look like dogs doing any trick for a treat  i can't fault them because anyone who's desperate will do anything for their own survival  employers see this and use it to fuel their superiority complex and narcissism  they have all the power so it makes them feel big    just endless ass-kissing just for a fucking shit job you don't even want to be at  if this was 1921 employers needed workers more than the reverse  now it's the opposite and it's getting worse by the day ,mjtgm8

1498,After reading a disturbing story about Toronto poverty I'm now completely convinced the government is trying to murder its poor,the story is on the ocap website  an anti poverty organization  i have stayed up all night in horror after reading this worried about my options  i knew there has been years of austerity but i've never read of anything like this before  this is truly a new age we've entered in the step the governments take to kill off their citizens    anyway  what they were saying is just how the toronto city officials had fought back on the idea of 24 hour warming shelters for homeless women and children  women and children are being pushed out on the street to die  there are no shelter spots left  they gave the true stats  not the fake ones  there was more discussion on the true level of unemployment and how the government  provincial and federal  through ontario and canada has given false statistics about just how dire the unemployment crisis truly is  and this was pre covid    there is literally no way to survive this if you're working class  you can go to school  collect debt and never be guaranteed a job despite your best efforts  the little ''survival jobs'' are now impossible to get and won't pay the exorbitant cost of rent in most canadian cities and towns  you can try to get a room but you'd be surprised how much that costs  as high as 1600 in someones basement in toronto  if you go to a shelter it's 100  full  even if you're a woman with a child  which used to be priority years back - most homeless out on the street were single males    in a country like canada it's more than easy enough to succumb to the elements  extreme cold  this goes beyond austerity  this is all by design and it's at the point of murder now  a decade back it was more of a neglect on the pat of the government and you could still get by with extreme budgeting and long hours at work on your own    what i've more recently is like nothing i've ever witnessed before  what the hell is going on with these governments  in canada  u s  uk it's much of the same thing ,mjwpm0

1526,New to sub but Anti(useless)work most of my life., hi everyone  i just found this subreddit today and am happy to find a community of people who share my thoughts about how crazy the modern work world is and how valuable our time on this earth is  i thought i'd share my experiences and difficulties and hope they help someone   i am 34 living in the usa  when i was in elementary school  i only learned english from school while my parents spoke to me in two non-english languages  i was consistently getting below average scores on standardized tests and my teacher thought i had mental problems  as anyone would be if they only had us public school to teach them  one day i decided to get a kid's novel i could hardly read  work through it myself for a few weeks  and by the time i was done  i was finally able to read most english books with good fluency  it also taught me a lifelong lesson of teaching myself from books   since i was 13  i didn't want to do meaningless work that didn't actually help people  in the early 2000s  i read books from the 1950s warning of politicians leading the usa into its current economic situation and i couldn't deny that was the direction we were going  i was aware of the transfer of industry from the usa to asian countries and that automation would obsolete jobs   during high school  i was tired of the public education propaganda  and i was already learning the things i needed from books at local libraries  i would skip classes  go to the library or outside school  and went through more of the textbooks than i would sitting in class  i wanted to homeschool but my parents wouldn't let me  so i had to wait until i was 16  the legal age to decide for myself to homeschool in the state i lived in  this caused a lot problems in my asian family  some were neutral or supportive  some said that i was no longer family   while homeschooling  i still worked hard to go through the textbooks i needed to read  but it gave me the freedom to learn when and where i wanted to  whether library  outside  or at home  and i had a lot more time to learn new things and pursue my hobbies  i really appreciated how i was in control of my own time  and my time didn't get wasted on things like going to and from school  pointless class activities  waiting on classes to start or end  lunch  or physical education   i did well on my ged and sat tests and got into a good engineering school  anyone thinking about homeschooling but are hesitant to because you think it may hinder getting into a good college  please know that many homeschoolers do get into good colleges  what matters to them is whether you can demonstrate adequate proficiency and are prepared   college was more tolerable than public school  and good for the people who can put up with it and find their dream jobs  i dropped out after working at a commercial solar pv installation company  i learned to design pv installation layouts and install solar panels on the job site  i eventually worked full time but we have an understanding that i can come and go as i like  right now i am taking a long break from my day job and working for an open source project  and learning programming because i would like to contribute code to the open source ecosystem  in the hopes that someday we can have a humane ubi system based on open source software   i live frugally and have taken long periods of time off from work to just spend time on my hobbies  learn new things  and try different work that interests me  i am not rich  but i take care of my health and am time rich  i don't waste my money on materialistic goods  and i find my time well-spent working on things i care about  at the age of 34  looking back i may not have gotten on the career path to make millions like some people around me  but i feel like i have been semi-retired since 16  only doing work that i find enriching  taking plenty of time to explore the things that interest me  and most importantly  pursuing the things my heart tells me to ,mkcgf3

1532,The Black Hole Of Material Consumption,you know  when i look around a lot of reddit posts and threads  i notice a similar theme where most people feel they are winning at life simply by accumulating more material wealth   a lot of the discussion is around how to invest better  have more money  have nicer things  etc   i realize it is this very topic that makes me very unhappy and miserable   i simply want to make the point that life isn't just about accumulating material things  some of us are not materialistic people  and so we do not have the same greed of others when it comes to maximizing wealth   for me  i have the  material  stuff i wanted  i sit here thinking about what i can buy to make myself happier and realize it doesn't work like that  there really isn't  stuff  that would change my mental state anymore   i'm the type of person who can drive a cheap car  and live in a small studio or one bedroom apartment and it is enough  what is annoying about this world to me is the constant pressure for people to do  better  than that or  attain  more   i think for the people that can buy happiness by owning tesla cars and 5 bedroom homes  great go for it and spend decades to get there  for me  i realize i could care less about these things  i don't have many friends and i'm not trying to impress others since i know i will always lose in that game   i guess what i am trying to say is - i encourage others to not feel bad about their own situation because the culture we live in tries to force you to feel inadequate no matter what you have  if you are like me - and you don't get your happiness from owning expensive things - don't let the toxic culture make you feel inadequate and unworthy for not wanting what you don't need ,mk2gcx

1579,Our tax structure is the biggest middle finger to the working class.,there are many subtle  more egregious  signs that the us doesn't care about its working class  but the most obvious is the tax structure   the best part is  that it's largely not talked about      amp x200b   when politicians ramble on about taxing the rich  they always talk about people  earning   400k  a year   this actually refers to a specific group of high income people  doctors  lawyers  engineers  and other high salary professionals   interestingly enough  the overlap between the truly wealthy and the highly paid professional class is not nearly as large as most people think  and yet  these professionals usually pay the highest effective tax rate out of anyone        the truly wealthy are typically asset holders  people with property  stock  bonds  or businesses  and their  earned  income usually doesn't exceed  150k  yet they are the ones making millions   year in  capital gains  income      amp x200b   for perspective  the top marginal tax rate on earned income is 37  compared to the capital gains top rate of only 20   a rate surpassed by your average factory worker   this doesn't even account for the fact that wage earners pay for medicare  social security  and a host of other payroll taxes that capital gains related income is shielded from   this points to the government wanting to help the capital class  while punishing the working class   this is what we should be upset about  and this is why the wealthy don't really pay their fair share   my view is that if anything  earned income should be taxed more favorably on the basis that someone is literally trading their life for money  whereas an investor is only trading the risk of financial loss for money ,mklwcs

1586,I legitimately couldn’t tell while I was reading it if this was on r/tumblr or r/antiwork which means it probably belongs here, sticks-on-a-lawton  of keunkopussirotta  i've come to the realization that the reason why   end up in so many arguments online is because of one specific cultural difference  americans apparently think that working and complaining are mutually exclusive   finnish people work and complain  they do them both at the same time  is a matter of fact  if doing something unpleasant isn't unpleasant enough to make you complain while doing it  is it even worth doing   used to work in this factory  and the factory work fucking sucked  it the punch clock at 5 48 of  waiting to clock in for morning shift    could ask a co-worker how he's doing  and the answer could very likely be something along the lines of  well    didn't die in my sleep so i'm here  but i'm not awake enough yet to be sure whether i'm happy about it  and it's like aye  that's valid   it wouldn't have crossed my mind to ask  then why don't you go home  why don't you just get a better job if you hate it here  or get personally insulted  like  well what do you want  me  to do about it  like bad moods are always someone's personal fault   life is simply not run sometimes  it's often nobody's fault  and it doesn't feel nice when things are like that  and it's not a tabor to acknowledge that  the way   was raised   i am in a situation and this situation tucking sucks  is a perfectly acceptable way to word a request for advice on how to fix it   and americans will look at you like you're dogshit and give you their useless dem of wisdom  you can get up and  do something about it   3 and it's apparently rude to point out that you can multitask   source  keuhkopussirotta  250 notes to 2 9    ,mkipp6
1587,The final straw has been laid upon the camel's back,this week  they finally did something pro-active about the overtime  well one of the sister locations near by closed their doors and we took on some of their employees  now we can do a split shift  but i still have to work 12 hours a day  they still won't hire someone to work in my area  even during the split shift  they even told me they can't hire someone to just work in my area when they do for every other area  since things have to keep moving in my area  i still have to work 12 hours a day  it's not seven days a week anymore  but i'm the only one doing it    i think it's because my boss got in trouble because her boss found out that she told me i was mandated to work even if i was quarantined  in march  my wife had a covid scare  i went in to ask if i was quarantined  could i use some of my pto for it  she told me i was mandated to work even if my wife had covid  i just had to sleep in a different bedroom    this news sent me into a mild  but a little spicy panic attack  mostly stemming from the other bosses acting like i do everything wrong for the past two weeks  i left at 3 30 on friday and didn't show up saturday and sunday  so if i get chewed on  i'm likely to just leave and never come back ,mkh1r1

1648,I just got terminated by my new job that I just started 2 months ago and found this group,hello people    first of all  i thorouhgly read faq and understood the ethos of this group   although most people don't question modern slavery  it is refreshing to encounter   thinkers  with thought provoking ideas   i worked so hard to keep this customer service agent role at swedish on line casino company  under urkranian female boss who said they would train me and it was ok to not have any prior experience as customer service or game industry   i performed under stress of handling muptiple chats as a newbie  i never took small breaks except for my lunch break    i was glued to my laptop 7 hours to show dilligence   and did everything or more than i could possibly do to learn new gig   all my efforts was all in vain   i was informed yesterday with vague reason how  i don't seem to fit into this role   so they decided not to extend my contract as a permanent employee   there are endless supply of people who is willing to take this kind of role that pays under 40k and i understand that they want someone who can learn and be perfect in 1 month but i guess i didn't meet their unrealistic expectation   i feel that most jobs just pay you enough to live  not to thrive  but most of us have to take that option just to survive   thankfully  i have a partner who is in top earning bracket so i don't have to worry about the basic necessities of life but i really wanted to make my own income so can spend on my hobbies which fulfill my life  i am not that type to just live in complacency because you have a successful husband  but at the same time  i am tired of going in and out of revolving door of shitty jobs with ruthless bosses during the last several years   to elaborate  i am an immigrant from asia  i was earning 100 k in 2006 in a coporate world and i saved up money to come to study   ever since then i never recovered career wise even after completeting useless degree  lol     additionally  i don't seem to pass interviews on certain roles because of my accent    speculative but very plausible   a question   can you suggest what i should do with my life with all the time i have    i obviously will now have a lot of free time because i will be unemployed with monthly passive income of   800 i get from my property in asia  i am childfree and 48    many would suggest  to   get some coding license  etc but i don't know if that is one solution fits for all career path either   i thought of doing air b  amp  b with my own room once pandemic ends but that idea seems not the best with all the crime going on right now   thanks for listening to my aimless rant but i am just happy to have found this group,mij7vh

1650,what should i do?, tl dr  i don't want to work  but if i have to i want to work stress free and for max 3 days a week  what should could i do   hi  i'm probably not the first person to ask this here  but i feel like this is the place where people understand what i'm going through  i don't want to work  but in order to have a house and  eat  i in a capitalist society i kinda have to  and i mean im okay with working  though for max 3 days a week  but i can't seem to find something i'm okay with doing   so a little about me  i'm in my mid-twenties and i live in the eu  so im sorry if i make some spelling errors  i like making art and music  sometimes i do a little photoshopping or video editing  i'm not particularly specialized or highly skilled in anything and i don't have any carreer ambition  and i'm pretty lazy  which more people should openly be able to be  imo  but i'm a creative person who just likes to make or do whatever i want whenever i want   i've been unemployed for the past year  which was really boring because of the pandemic and i had to move back to my parents'  i have a bachelors degree in media  but i wasn't really a good student so i'm not really an academic  i worked at a broadcasting station for a couple of months before the pandemic  but the stressiness of the whole thing made me realize i don't want to do that lol  so  after a year of unemployment i finally got hired somewhere  i knew it wouldn't nessessarily make me happy or anything  but at least it's something new  so now i manage the social media for a non-profit organization  it's not where 'my heart is' or anything  but at least it's something i can do and where people actually wanted to hire me  but now after some weeks working there i realized  oh right  i don't like work  i don't like stress  i don't like responsibilities  i don't like dealing with people all the time  i don't like working in an office  although most of the time i work from home  which im actually quite okay with  and i definitely don't like working 5 days a week  and i most definitely don't like being  on  all the time cause social media go on 24 7  if this is what the next 50  years of my life are going to look like  i'm not sure if i can handle that   i've been dealing with depression and anxiety now and then  but i find my stress levels shooting up when having to deal with work related responsibilities  even in my dreams i'm anxious about my to-do's and dealing with people i'm not comfortable with  lately i'm thinking of moving to another country  like that's going to help  but i feel like i could do better and try to be happy in one way or another   now  i know how priviliged i am  growing up in one of the world's richest countries  not really having to struggle through life  but i kinda feel like i deserve to live stress free  i also feel like i don't owe this society  which i don't like  anything  sure  i'll work a couple of days a week to make money  but the rest of my time i don't wanna think about work  i wanna do my own little projects  or read  or watch series  or get a dog and go on hikes with them  or do nothing at all  as long as it's my choice   so  my question basically is  how can i make money  in an ethical way  stress free  responsibility free  not more than 3 days a week  some place that doesn't hurt other people or animals  is this a reachable goal within a capitalist society  i just wanna exist in peace  is that too much to ask   i'm sorry for the long text  if you made it this far  thanks for reading my concerns ,mih1hi

1653,Life is a joke.,your born  you spend 3 4 of your life working  then you die  everyone who could get the day off comes to your funeral  then goes back to work the next day  and your forgotten    the only way to not enter this cycle is to be born to wealthy parents  alternatively you can win the lottery as soon as your legally able to play    some start a business that becomes successful but that too is a lottery as 98 percent of business fail    you can go to a top university if your lucky to get in and maybe get a top job if your lucky enough so you can pay off that mountain of student debt    or maybe your lucky and your parents footed the bill   for most people  the only realistic options are work 9 to 5 till 65 or refuse and accept being homeless and try to make the best of it    the punchline in the end is that everyone dies and none of it matters  so is one supposed to do    whatever you want  accept life is a lottery system and have a good laugh  dont take it seriously and definitely dont work yourself to death to make someone else richer    a couple drove by in a winnebago as i was typing this on my phone  i think its time we all consider an alternative lifestyle  you can try so hard and get so far but as linkin park said it doesnt even matter ,minswa

1657,Removing pro work people from your life,i find that by removing all pro work people from my life  i remove the pressure to constantly improve myself to get a better job in the future  they are your average careerists that claim that capitalism is working just as intended  i absolutely detest these people and even more so especially when they tell me to get a better job or climb the career ladder  capitalism rewards hard work they say   like it is that simple  it is an employer's market and the game is rigged  there is no 100  guarantee that i can even get a better job or even get a promotion  there are so many other factors that determine a raise or promotion  factors like being an introvert can literally diminish your chances at a promotion  so why bother  you are literally playing into the hands of the capitalist class  if capitalism does indeed reward hard work the workers at places like amazon would be paid a livable wage ,mihb63

1660,In absolute disbelief. Was I tricked?!,got laid off and lucky to find another job within two weeks  started the new job on monday  the new job was in my same field but a different sub field of what i normally do that i wasn't familiar with and they knew this  from my first day something felt off  my old office wasn't perfect but seemed amazing compared to this place  the computers were practically falling apart on windows server 2008 and the software was probably 20 years old and made tasks that were simple at my old job nearly impossible to the point of frustration and anxiety  my boss was training me and some things i totally understood but other things not so much  i wasn't doing very well with her because i felt like she expected me to know everything despite it being my first week   i trained with my coworker yesterday and we did pretty good and she was very nice so i felt like we were getting somewhere  my boss was pretty critical and never really gave any positive reinforcement whereas my coworker would when i did something right  my boss was strange in the way that sometimes she was really nice and other times she was cold and not understanding  today it got worse because she let me work on my own which i was starting to feel great and confident with and we were going to go over the accounts i worked  i did some correctly but others incorrectly and i noticed i didn't get bad anxiety unless i was training with my boss  it almost felt like i was being gaslit because no one except my coworker gave positive reinforcement to the point i started doubting my abilities and if i even knew my career to begin with it was that bad   today came to a head when she told me she can see i'm struggling and stressed out and said there's another job in the same department that would be much better for me which made me feel hopeful  we tried training again but at that point i was so anxious i couldn't focus or retain anything and ended up in tears  we sat in her office and talked and she was super kind and empathetic and told me she got it and if i wanted the other job i should go for it so i said yes  which made me think she really liked me and believed in me because if she didn't she would have just let me go  the other job was in a different department so she had to speak with the manager there    she comes out of her office sighing later i think  oh maybe she's just stressed  she says let's go talk to the other manager  i get excited say ok cool  we walk in and i get a weird feeling  the other manager says  i think you'd be better fit for this type of position blah blah  so me being naive i say  oh you mean the position my boss told me about   no you're fired   but boss told me there was this job that would be great for me and that we would be able to do that   well we already interviewed two candidates and there's an internal one we're going to hire and they get preference  -shrug-   at this point i'm basically shaking in tears grabbing my things to leave and absolutely stunned  i'm having trouble figuring what happened  my boss basically made it sound like i had the new job  was this some kind of sick trick between the two of them  or did my boss try to genuinely convince the other boss of my abilities and the other boss was just a bitch  i was shocked because i was showing effort and trying really hard and it was my fourth day  i'm not sure if their expectations were unrealistic but i've never ever had a job that i was fired for over this let alone fired at all  i'm very angry and still having trouble making sense of the situation and what exactly happened because it appears i was fired for absolutely no reason  if i showed up drunk to work i'd get it but i was on time every day and generally a good worker and got along with everyone sorry if this is a novel i just really felt like i would be heard here and wanted your guys' perspectives ,midgzf

1700,"15 minute breaks ""isn't fair"" according my management.",at my job there are 4-10 shifts and 5-8 shifts   i used to do the 5-8 but my team was forced to move to 4-10 because people weren't coming into work and thought this shift would get more people to come in   i was annoyed because i had the opening shift and would get off at 1 30pm which gave me the entire afternoon to have a life and work on my hobbies   not only that but they gave us less than a week notice of the shift change  so screw you if you had a second job or had a kid to pick up after work i guess   yes  getting an extra day off is nice but i used to be able to work out  cook healthy meals  spend time on my hobbies and play video games with my friends all in one day and didn't have to deal with the rush hour traffic going home   i feel like my free time has been significantly cut because i'm too exhausted after the long shifts and there's less time to do anything     but that's not the worst of it   on the 5-8 shifts we'd get two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch   it used to be a 45 minute lunch but the trade off is we got to leave 15 minutes earlier so i was fine with it   when we moved to 4-10 we got three 10 minute breaks   the idea is both shifts should only get 30 minute of break time each day  but 10 minutes is barely enough time to do anything and when you're doing a 10 hour shift of customer service at a call center you really need time to recharge   not only that  but since both shifts are working 40 hours a week total  and each day is only 30 minutes of break  the 5-8 shift people are getting an extra 30 minutes of break per 40 hour work week that we aren't   i figured getting two 15 minute breaks and a 10 minute break for the last one would be a reasonable compromise  so i brought it up to management   she was surprisingly receptive and agreed that 10 minutes was too short for a break  but then asked me if in exchange for the 15 minute breaks if we'd be willing to stay an additional 10 minutes   um  excuse me     apparently the reason for her question was to be  fair  to the people working 5-8s that only get 30 minutes of break during the day   despite our much longer shift  getting more break time wouldn't be fair   i brought up that they get an extra 30 minutes of break per week that we don't and she said she'd  think about it   what is there to think about   you know and agree that 10 minute breaks isn't long enough   it's an easy enough problem to fix   just fix it   when i was working 5-8s i just assumed people on the 4-10 shifts got three 15 minute breaks and i didn't feel like that was unfair   when i worked at other places that did 4-10s i'd get three 15 minutes   my friends who do 4-10s get 15 minute breaks  but no  apparently it's  not fair  where i work ,mhtktb
1701,Americans fetishize jobs to a religious degree., has gotten some predictable liberal discourse around some drama with georgia becoming fascist  so everyone wants to waste their time high fiving eachother over pointless gotcha moral victories   however the second part of the article  where our governor is planning on handing out tax breaks in an already expensive state to live  is what worries me   americans rarely use more than one brain cell for economic analysis  and all of the comments are shit like  these tax breaks won't cost us anything because these companies wouldn't be coming here without the tax breaks  they're bringing jobs and more business to local economies   this makes me seethe  because if someone actually gave this situation more than 2 seconds of thought they would realize this is bullshit   there is no such thing as a free tax break  there is no such thing as a cost free business moving in   there is this brain damage where americans imagine  jobs  as something being worth  infinity  dollars  this is how they think of jobs when they aren't thinking  it is literally a religion   with equal religious fervor they only think of companies as something that only costs  positive  dollars  they can't imagine that a company would be worth more than it costs in tax breaks to bring them in  it's blasphemous to even consider this     but if someone actually works for a company they are costly  they are costly to people not in the company and people outside  in the community   these companies still use public infrastructure   at the very least they are using our roads and public schools and education for a lower cost than anyone living here  not to mention all the other breaks they can negotiate down the line   once a company moves into a new area with their tax breaks  they have a huge advantage against the local companies  in essence turning locals into second class citizens   you only reap the benefits of tax breaks if you work for one of these companies or have resigned yourself to some vague economic benefit that is really just the result of people paying more taxes overall   a tax break literally means these companies are paying less in taxes  they are paying less into all of the social services you depend on  which means you  an actual tax payer  are now subsidizing all of the damage they are doing to your area  in social services  in infrastructure  and in your environment ,mj6k31
