3,Quitting a farm to start a farm,i am a 24 yo male  after a bout of joblessness  where i was truly happy but understood it wasn't sustainable because of a lack of funds to achieve my goals of not needing to work for someone else - which is kind of ironic when you think about it  i found myself back at the factory farm where my parents work and where i worked part-time for 7 years while in high school and college  this time i'm working full-time in a semi-supervisory role with one individual who works under me  i make decent money  more than i ever have because i've never been able to find a job  much less get an interview for a job i actually have an interest in  with the bs in psychology degree that i worked so hard for  i have been depressed for as long as i can remember and i have felt like a worthless  lazy person for how i feel about work ing for somebody else  until i just discovered this subreddit   i feel like i and all the other employees at this company are being raped  we are selling our time of course  but we are also selling our dignity as the manager  who is emotionally immature  screams at us when a task is done incorrectly  we are selling our pride in what we do when we never see a dime for our efforts  this company is notorious for it's lack of raises  we are selling our spirit when we efficiently and effectively complete the tasks of the farm  but have to stay an additional 3 or more hours  just because  and i know damn well that they are only able to  pay well  because they profit exponentially on the labor that we provide   i am just finishing up my second semester of local community college accounting courses  which have done nothing to help me even get a phone interview for accounting-type positions   i feel like i have a lot of pressure from my family and boyfriend that i live with to keep working until i find something better but there isn't anything better  at least not until i can establish an income from my own farm in the future  i want to produce as much of my own necessities as possible  energy  food  clothing  etc  and sell the surplus to pay for the taxes on my land and that's it   i don't know how to get there without committing suicide over the draining  exploitative  unappreciative  45-hour work week  with 9 day on stretches  through the many different jobs i've had these feelings still persist  at least this one is bearable for my social and generalized anxiety  and depression  i cry almost every day and i'm able to cry at work because i spend a lot of time alone in the loud barns ,a44srh

6,Wanna be a mod? Step right up!,hey  everyone  hope your holiday season has been ok and not too stressful   we had a bunch of troll posts today and i had forgot to check up on the subreddit which left them up for longer than they should have been  as such another mod had to tackle the issue  it's not a huge problem but having another mod  or two  will help keep this subreddit cleaner on a more consistent basis   if you're going to be a mod you  must     be respectful to sub members    communicate with the other mods about decisions unless you think they are a no-brainer  preferably through chat  we can make a mod group chat    use your mod powers responsibly  with great power comes great yadda yadda    try to give people a few chances to mess up before banning them  this goes in line with my previous comment  for example  i usually tell people about our rules and remind them to follow them  they usually insult me them  i warn them and then they insult me again  so i ban them    no prior mod experience required  but appreciated   and that's it  sound ok    feel free to comment below or pm me or u onedayitwillbedaisy about it    thanks y'all ,a6t9gh

8,What’s your opinion on ‘hard work pays off?’,this saying never sat right with me even as a kid  hard work for whom  and that things never quite go your way from past experiences  i feel people don t consider how much luck has to do with where one works opportunities for work regardless if they have a good or bad work ethic   i like the term practice makes perfect  because there s room for improvement and it implies something one is intrinsically interested in doing  but i tend to be misunderstood when i have distaste for people commenting on my work ethic    so what s your take on it  or quick responses that won t make you sound like you re lazy  although being lazy sounds like the worst someone can be in capitalism  or anti-improvement  ,a6x1ae
9,Fucked.,this will be long  brace yourself   i got a dwi which is a felony because in my state 2 in 10 years is felony  previous in 2012  it wasn't really that serious  just huge snow storm to where i literally couldn't park my car at a friend's like i normally would do when drinking so i had to go home because i had to work and got stuck in the snow 5 minutes from my house  barley failed the breathalyzer and honestly drinking had nothing to do with me getting stuck in the snow  it would happen to me every morning even without the blizzard conditions  anyways i'm not here to defend that or get out of it  it's my fault and i take the reprocussions  being scared of a possible felony i hired a lawyer for  6000  turns out i didn't really even need to as going through this process i've seen several people in the same felony diversion program with just a public defender but none the less i got a lawyer    at the time i had a job i was at for over 2 years  it looked stable enough  it could have been stable enough  there wasn't much i could do to get fired  they relied on me for a ton of things and used the shit out of me without ever giving me much  i was previously a line worker like anybody else that they cycled through from temp agencies except for that for whatever reason i had gotten hired to the actual company unlike most of my co-workers  eventually i tried out the fork lift position which i was weary about because in the past  at other jobs it always was a position where you're asked to do too much that literally one person couldnt do  i was told not to worry about it and took the position   4 months later i'm full blown in this forklift position and the person who got me to do it was already gone  forced out of the company in a shady situation herself and i'm doing exactly what i feared everything and anything  and i'm doing it for  2 less than what the position is supposed to be paying according to the national average  the excuse from managers and higher ups was that they didn't hire me for this position with previous experience so i didn't deserve that pay but maybe if i'm a good little boy as i am right now maybe i'll get it down the road  meanwhile i'm loading and unloading trucks  dealing with the drivers paperwork's  still working on the line helping out  even though every previous driver never did that as it's not their damn job  training new employees on everything and anything  handling office related stuff  troubleshooting common problems you get my point  so i demanded the raise to at least match the national average  i got it  but i was down talked like a little kid and made to feel like it was a privledge and an honor  it wasn't   14 is still shit pay for the amount of work i was doing  sorry not sorry  also i was going through managers left and right as the company was in a changing process so basically i was dealing with new supervisors who didn't know me  my history with the company or anything about what i'm capable of and constantly having to prove my self over and over until one day after dealing with drama from 4 different directions and feeling like i was about to get into a brawl with 15 people  whole nother story i went to break and never came back   rewind three paragraphs and you can see my delimma  the quitting of the job coincided with the dwi  i quit the job just a few months after hiring the lawyer  i only payed him  2000 of the  6000  now  he hasn't been that great  he barley contacts me  he has missed a few court dates and he never has a clue what's going on with my situation etc  etc  but still he holds my fate in his hands  and i haven't payed him since the end of june  so i guess i'm lucky he even shows up at all  i'm actually almost done with the pre trial program  weekly meetings and check ins  before i quit the job i was having these strong anti work feelings about everything we talk about here in this sub  life is just too short to be someone else's bitch and to be a miserable cunt every day of your life  especially when it's montonous sometimes even strenuous manual physical labor  the reason why i was even there so long is because i could listen to podcasts and music on my headphones and skate through the day and it was actually semi enjoyable because of that and i also had a female co worker who i got quite chummy with and became good work buddies with and enamored with until the company started threatening the headphones constantly for no apparent reason other than control  literally  and the girl got pregnant with twins and went on leave  she came back but it just wasn't the same  i was miserable and in the midst of the forklift position  now my anti slave anti work feelings were becoming dominant  they're always there it's just no one wants to hear it and i have no other means of money   so this was an absolutely terrible time to quit my job but now that i've been out of work for 6 months i am completely lost and hopeless  i haven't had a dime most of this time  luckily i live with people who allow me to live rent free and aren't kicking me out  that's a whole nother story and a blessing although it does make me feel like a joke no they're not my parents lol  i have been looking for work this whole time but i'm sort of unavailable because my car got repossessed in the process and i'm not available at all times due to the meetings  i also have no bus line anywhere near me  i feel like a fucking bum  i honestly didn't expect it to be this hard to find a job again  i suffer from social anxiety disorder  depression etc  and i also have a previous charge on my record that's apparently showing up to employers and making me look terrible  charges were dropped while i was in jail which is why i didn't even know they still existed and its thrown me for a loop  apparently employer's can see it either way  i've never had this much of a problem after leaving shitty jobs  but here i am completely fucked and don't know what to do  no matter how much i know what i need to do it just isn't happening  next court date is soon and this lawyer doesent know my thoughts about all of this just wonders why i don't have any money for him  it's like i'm dealing with the mafia lol  i've lost control of why i even started making this post and i apologise  i guess if i just didn't owe this lawyer all this money i would feel so free right now  i'd still be truing to find work anyway because i do have a kid but i can not lie because i do feel liberated  while i am completely fucked right now because of the legal situation i do not regret leaving that job that was causing me so much stress  life is too short  it really is ,a5o6yf
10,The Story of the Mexican Fisherman,an american investment banker was at the pier of a small coastal mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked   inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna   the american complimented the mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them   the mexican replied   only a little while  the american then asked why didn t he stay out longer and catch more fish  the mexican said he had enough to support his family s immediate needs  the american then asked   but what do you do with the rest of your time   the mexican fisherman said   i sleep late  fish a little  play with my children  take siestas with my wife  maria  stroll into the village each evening where i sip wine  and play guitar with my amigos   i have a full and busy life  the american scoffed   i am a harvard mba and could help you  you should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds  buy a bigger boat  with the proceeds from the bigger boat  you could buy several boats  eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats  instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor  eventually opening your own cannery  you would control the product  processing  and distribution  you would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to mexico city  then la and eventually new york city  where you will run your expanding enterprise   the mexican fisherman asked   but  how long will this all take   to which the american replied   15   20 years    but what then  asked the mexican   the american laughed and said   that s the best part   when the time is right you would announce an ipo and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich  you would make millions    millions   then what   the american said   then you would retire   move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late  fish a little  play with your kids  take siestas with your wife  stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos ,a4i3lu

25,The definition of 'work',it's frustrating when i try to explain my anti-work philosophy to people and they can't see it as anything other than  wishing that others suffer so i can keep watching tv and eating cheetos all day  doesn't help that 'working out' is the most popular english phrase for performing exercise  i don't have a job or make money other than selling my plasma right now  but that doesn't mean i don't do things  in fact  i think the things i do are every bit as productive as what millionaire investment bankers do to destroy the economy  if not more so  because i'm not destroying the economy by coding and writing   unfortunately  'work' is a 4 letter word everyone immediately understands  'bullshit work' or 'junkfood jobs' is a little better  but still requires at least a paragraph of explanation  what word or phrase do you guys use to distinguish 'work' from 'productive  healthy  expenditures of effort'  i mean  in my opinion even the 'productive' and 'healthy' parts should be optional  people deserve the right to be unproductive and unhealthy so long as they don't put a disproportionate burden on everyone else although even in that case  it's not like we would just kill off all disabled people  true equality would mean everyone has the right to live like a disabled person   i like to use 'conscious work' to describe what i do with my life and what i don't mean when i say i'm antiwork  basically it's any work i consciously  voluntarily do  without any promise of reward  so writing would count  but so would exercise  but so would conducting experiments to prove my hypotheses  on the other hand  selling my books  selling my plasma  or conducting the same exact experiments i do but solely in exchange for money rather than due to a desire to sate my curiosity  would not count as conscious work   how do you define 'work' in 'antiwork' ,a2qlon

41,I want my boss to be ripped apart by dogs,the other day  when he forced the team out of the building for his routine not-mandatory-but-totally-mandatory-if-you-want-to-stay-in-my-good-books lunchtime walks  some of the other team members lagged behind a little bit  say  10 seconds behind  he stopped  waited for them to catch up  and told this story     i remember back in my old country  there was this man who would take his dog for a walk every day  the dog would walk beside him  cutest dog ever  then  when the dog got older and older  you'd see the man walk past  then you'd see the dog walk past a few minutes later  each year the dog would be further and further back and the delay would get longer and longer  that's what you guys are like more and more  nobody took well to being compared to dogs     there was a long  tense pause  until he continued     and  even more pertinent to our situation  i remember the old man walking past one year and the dog was gone forever  one of our team members started picking his pace up  somewhat in jest  another team member asked him to clarify   lt team member gt  is reading into your story too much  isn't he  to which my boss replied  no  he is reading into it exactly correctly     he is such a megalomaniac that not only forcing his team to walk with him at lunch on their time off isn't enough  no  he has to dictate their pace under threat of being removed from their fucking job  in his mind a good worker keeps up on his lunch walk and does what he says even in their free time    i fantasize daily about seeing how his excellent pace would hold up if we were replaced with very hungry  rabid dogs    i don't even know why i'm telling this story here  i just wanted to put down my thoughts somewhere where people see the truly awful power imbalance of the employer - gt  employee relationship ,aab2bu
42,Any advice for people with similar mindsets,hey guys was wondering of anyones been in a similar situation or has any advice to share   i m currently on my way out of the millitary for popping hot on a drug test  i became very depressed a year into my service  mostly due to solitude from my family and having to work a soul crushing job  i attempted to kill myself via pills three months ago and figured  fuck it  i ll just start smoking weed again because it s the only thing that ever made me feel truly content in bad situations   sorry for the rambling wanted to build a picture  but i was wondering if any of you have any ideas for what to do  like all people my age i hate working with all of my heart and if civilian life is as shit as this i have no idea what i ll do for the rest of this lifetime    i m not even quite sure what advice i m looking for  just hoping somebody will say they were in the same exact situation and everything turned out okay    thanks for reading  please drop any advice or ways to make rent money with a weed discharge  ,a3l1si
43,Is anyone else in this situation?,my job is so life and soul sucking that i have no energy left over to pursue my own hobbies and interests on my days off  i'm a lowly  underpaid and underappreciated security guard  i used to really take enjoyment in computers and amateur radio and now i do neither  yesterday  i was thinking i might get some certifications to help find a better security job but quickly lost motivation because i don't honestly see enough improvement to make it worthwhile   i almost walked off the job the other day  isn't it amazing how an employer doesn't need to give you any notice that your employment is being terminated but you're expected to give 2 week's notice if you want to walk away  i just wanted to abandon my post and say screw this  but to what end  i have a college degree but it might as well be in basket weaving   sometimes i think i'd rather just be homeless than put up with this  ,a40923
44,Why is trying to find better work or working PT so frowned upon?,i work as a dishwasher for barely above minimum wage  but i have a degree in multimedia arts and sociology  my city is tiny and really only has service jobs  but today my boss asked me how my classes were going  he forgot i graduated from our interview-which further proves how useless a bachelors degree is  but then he asks me what i m doing on the weekdays  which i reply with trying to find a better job   granted  that might ve been too honest  but i m a blunt person  he says that my wage is good  it isn t  and trying to find something better is necessary now that i have to pay my student loans while saving up    i would work more hours  but it s bring back past lower back pain because i m so tall and it wrecks my hands  i feel working full time would just make me lose hope in finding something better and lose motivation  i try to do art projects to keep my sanity on off days   any advice or suggestions on my situation  ,a463sr
45,"How should I explain my offer of for example, selling my first 30 hours/week for $40/hour and all higher hours for $120/hour?", for programming   it  may be that they dont want to accept my offer because they would need  to buy 10 hours at  120 hour and they have a max pay per hour  but to  that i would suggest they hire more people so they can save money   i  am trying to charge for my time based on how i value it so they cant  force me to sell the higher hours week for less than its worth to me   while the first 30 hours week are worth less to me  since i have other  important things to do ,a23dv4
46,Sitting at “work” completely demotivated,tried quitting 6 weeks ago but boss begged me to stay with  now what i realise were false  promises  was made redundant beginning of last month  my last day is 20 12 18 but the offer for me to stay is that i m going to be on the books paid until 31 12 18 without any annual leave deducted between 20 - 31 december  then i get essentially a further 6 weeks of salary while  on leave   issue is  i recently found out a lot of information that has been withheld from me about why i was made redundant that s too much to get into but let s just say my ip i spent a lot of time researching  developing and implementing  and finalised between the period of resignation date and date of redundancy  was sold on by my boss to a cheaper option  subcontractor  than keeping me on board    so now i really just can t be assed anymore to do anything  why bother doing anything at all if there s no employment here come the new year    no opportunities around me right now but i have a pretty good idea for a start up and now the equipment and know-how to get the ball rolling  but if i up and leave now i ll miss out on around  2800 in wages plus superannuation plus more accrued annual leave  hence why i m here just sucking what i can get out of this dump until it s over but i just feel sick sitting here   anyways not sure why i m posting except i guess just having a winge that the boss still expects me to be working happily here while he basically stabbed me in the back  he doesn t know i know this    this is why i m on the anti work side - employers are only out to exploit employees to the greatest extent possible then will throw you out on the street once they got what they need out of you and or find a cheaper option    much rather just run my own business and generate my own income and be self sufficient ,a2v1t9
47,I have three days in a row requested off next week and I’ve never been more excited in my life.,okay maybe that s being a little hyperbolic but here s the thing  my job is a really busy place and it s non stop for six days a week  closed sundays  and i only get tuesdays and thursdays off because of class but that s about to end in a few weeks  the semester for me is finished up tomorrow since all i have to do is take a quiz and be don t with it  while i d love to have tuesdays and thursdays to myself once these college credits are over  my boss insisted that i work those days again once i m done with class  but next week i sorta lied and said that i have finals when irl i m done the week before  thankfully i requested off that wednesday so i have three full days to myself come this time next week  i should also mention that while i m at work the only thing i legit think about is going home at 5 00  i m counting down the days to when i get a nice mini break from this place and it legit cannot come soon enough    if this is what adulthood is like it s no wonder why so many people decide to opt out and end their own lives  ,a3cyzn
48,You anti work anarchists/communists should just be honest with yourselves,   the only reason you chose your political stance is not out of empathy for your fellow proletariat but rather because you chose to become artists musicians and no one ended up liking your shit  so because of your personal failures you blame the rest of society  why do you care so much about homeless anyway    or pretend to care   its their own personal failure  why would anyone be expected to build them a house with free labour    just the other day i read a post on  r socialism https www reddit com r socialism  about how degrading finding a job is  lol you losers just need to grow up  you dont hate the work place because of muh alenation but rather because your lazy fucks who want to leech of society to support your musical passion  lol  most of you only go towards communism because you are lazy and dont want to work like the little lazy commie that you are  its not a generalisation its a fact  i have binge scrolled many socialist communist anarchist subreddits to confirm this  a revolution lead by neets would never work and it makes me laugh that you do think this  hahahahhahahahhahah   under your utopia we will all end up like this loser on soudcloud https soundcloud com imbred anarchy   its very obvious he is one of you because he does not provide anything of value to society  the  proletariat  of the modern day make me laugh  no sane person buys into your ideas  this is not a generalisation but rather cold hard facts that you are weeping about because you know im right  you pot smoking blue haired degenerates are going nowhere in life just like your own shit ideology that was funded by some fat lazy fuck  karl marx  no wonder you follow him lol  i asked on  r anarchy101 https www reddit com r anarchy101 what will happen to those that dont work and one reply was   gt we should all be refusing to work   evidence https www reddit com r anarchy101 comments a0ay5h what will happen to able bodied people who refuse eagfevx https www reddit com r anarchy101 comments a0ay5h what will happen to able bodied people who refuse eagfevx   this isnt even a generalisation  its the truth   now if you dont mind im going to take a shit and i hope someone cleans that up once its hit the sewers for free  hahhahahahhahahha  i cant you think believe this would happen under your ideology ,a6s9fo
49,Guy Debord on Automation and Labor as Commodity, gt automation  which is both the most advanced sector of modern industry and the epitome of its practice  obliges the commodity system to resolve the following contradiction  the technological developments that objectively tend to eliminate work must at the same time preserve labor as a commodity  because labor is the only creator of commodities  the only way to prevent automation  or any other less extreme method of increasing labor productivity  from reducing society s total necessary labor time is to create new jobs  to this end the reserve army of the unemployed is enlisted into the tertiary or  service  sector  reinforcing the troops responsible for distributing and glorifying the latest commodities  and in this it is serving a real need  in the sense that increasingly extensive campaigns are necessary to convince people to buy increasingly unnecessary commodities   just found this in  society of the spectacle  thought it would fit here quite nicely  ,a7hl6x

52,So my new job isn't that good,i quit my steady job that i probably could have kept forever  barring personal illness and severe depression  in favor of a more flexible schedule   turns out  it's not as flexible as i'd imagined  after specifically telling the boss that i wanted 25 hours a week  my second full week of work ends up being 40 hours- which really interferes with my ability to take the programming classes i've been doing  i told the boss of the place that i wanted a part-time schedule on my very first day  when i was there for half an hour for paperwork  and when i went to tell him about the schedule today he doesn't recall me having said that  i guess i'm not important enough for him to remember  and the value of an employee certainly isn't high enough so that he'll keep his word to me  or anyone else- or stop passing the buck around by telling me to speak to someone else      i hate working  and i hate capitalism  i'm so over it ,a44apc

54,"""I fucking hate when these bitches work slow""", were the words my supervisor uttered to me in private on the second day of my job concerning my team   every day  we are constantly berated by our supervisor  and or threatened with disciplinary action for even  minor  errors  such as missing  one  damaged part  e g  a shelf leg  out of the  thousands  of shelf legs we process  even when tasks are reassigned  which they rarely are  when an employee does something incorrectly  the newly assigned employee -- even ones with excellent track records of quality and productivity -- is intimidated   you better do this skid right  otherwise you're going to get me very angry   if i find out you do this incorrectly  that'll be  it   and  none of the employees under my supervisor do anything about this  they just take it  they allow themselves to be treated this way -- perhaps understandably so  perhaps they cannot risk losing their job or causing even more tension  so it is more in their self-interest to stay obedient   it also doesn't help that my supervisor  and our shift supervisor  my supervisor's supervisor  are family friends   i understand my supervisor has her own set of responsibilities by her superiors  and there is a lot of pressure and stress associated with organizing a team  and ensuring this team achieves daily goals effectively  i understand she may be responding to this because elements may feel out of her control  and this is her understanding of the best way to react to such a situation  or even that this is a natural reaction for her   but  i don't think threatening  intimidating  belittling  scolding  and yelling -- constantly yelling -- at people is an effective way at doing things  i've worked in many hierarchical organizations  and when such problems arose  other conflict management approaches were applied   i work very hard every day  and i am recognized as one of the more productive members of our team  but  i hate being treated this way  and i hate when my fellow teammates are treated this way  i understand  even from them  that they do not like being treated like this   i wonder why they do nothing about this  i am currently submitting a complaint to hr regarding this ,a7rkgd

60,Feminisms relationship to work,first of all  i just found this sub so if this is off topic or not related with this sub im sorry    i am female and was raised in europe by a feminist  also the area i live in has very high feministic standards  from the very first second of my live i was raised to be  strong and independent  i was raised by my mother telling me how i could never be dependent of a man otherwise he will destroy me  i have to add here that she was a sahm for 20 years    work  is a virtue  the highest point of live according to how i was raised  a job according to people around me was the peak of live  the absolute freedom and empowerment for women  the ultimate goal i should have as a woman to be modern and valuable    the thing is - i dont see any of this  work for me is not a virtue  to see work as positive and not as a weakness or something only the lower classes have to pursue is a rather new concept that developed after the industrial revolution  and even back then work was already criticised  work is not the ultimate goal - whether work is seen as positive or negative is totally dependent on when you lived and on the current philosophy   i have depression  i have an anxiety disorder and a dissociation disorder especially when i am put under stress  my entire live i dreamt of running away and living in a small forest hut   i have a hard time with that thought  i was raised to believe that without work i am not worth anything  that i betray other women and what they fought for  that i am weak and just  lazy  - while lazy is seen as a bad trait   but i dont feel empowered by being a slave to a job  i dont feel empowered to loose 8h lunch break getting to the job and back each day of my live  i dont feel  free  and  independent  - its the opposite  i am threatened with my live to stay in this job otherwise i wont get payed and i will starve    the biggest lie is that work gives us a  purpose  or a  meaning  in our live while the only thing we are is interchangeable pieces in a big system  women arent empowered by work  they are just brought to the workforce so theres even more people giving their life to the economy   i dont know how people in this sub feel about it  can you relate ,a3g26q
61,"Quit Another Job, and I Don't Regret It",so the new-ish job that i got in an attempt to get a flexible schedule for myself turned out to be run by exploitative capitalists who didn't take my needs into consideration  they gave me too many hours four weeks in a row  so that i had difficulty focusing on my education  they didn't give a regular schedule- they often had me come home in the evening one day and report in the morning the next day  that alone was enough to make me want to quit      then  to make matters worse  they would regularly give me infrequent breaks  my last day there  this previous friday  they actually broke a us labor law by letting me go more than five hours without a break  i hadn't had breakfast that morning  my own fault  so i was extremely hungry and just wanting to eat  of course  you can't really eat in the drive-through  and it was a friday  so everyone was using their fresh new paycheck to buy fast food      on that day  they ran out of     -chicken nuggets    -chicken tenders    -salads    -caramel drink mix    -chocolate milk    -and the frappe machine hadn't been working for the last two days      when yet another evening-to-morning shift came between friday and saturday  i sat down to figure out my budget and i realized that  since february 1st fell on a friday  i'd have four paychecks this coming month to pay my bills  so i really didn't need the money  and i'd already been extended an offer anyway  i was already hired elsewhere at another place that promised me the hours i wanted      so i just didn't show up on time for my shift  i washed the single work shirt that they gave me and expected me to wear four to five times a week  eight hours a day  along with the stupid hat that made me look like a goof  i took a nap and walked in at about three o'clock in the afternoon      of course  it was so busy there that i couldn't just say   hey  you're full of shit and i've had enough  all the managers were occupied working  because that's how fast food is  they like to do all the work themselves and never actually show or teach people how to do it themselves      i ended up just walking to the small manager's office  leaving my uniform junk on the cold metal folding chair and walking out without another word  and that  as they say  is that ,aay0l8
