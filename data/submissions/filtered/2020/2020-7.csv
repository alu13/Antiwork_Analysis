0,"Considering quitting job I got in April, kinda long story",some background  i was homeless in february  it was a long term situation where i was trapped in a situation where i was working for free  it was so bad that i exhausted myself into a dangerous level of depression  i then escaped because i got really really lucky and someone another friend knew was able to help me move  i moved in with a friend  i have no bills  no rent  no pressure  in fact everyone just says do what i need to do   i was hired in april   hazard pay was cut in may  i've been making almost nothing after commute since then  and i've also been holding off in case a stimulus bill was passed  just to see if hazard pay situation would change  i don't have much confidence in that now  and i'm really burned out not even by the job itself but the commute and the exhaustion i feel as if i haven't been able to relax or enjoy anything  it's so much time to waste per week to not see any gains  i have to borrow money in fact to be able to maintain this job   i can't keep doing this and honestly  at this point even if we got hazard pay back  i wouldn't feel that much more motivated  the damage is done  that's what decision makers don't realize here  you can't repair something if you broke it too much  kroger fucked up  majorly  and it's impacted me especially hard in specific ways    during this time i've been drained of so much energy i can barely get up the strength to clean my room in one go  i want to clean  i want to do things  i just cannot make myself do it no matter how much i want to  i'm frequently late because of this  i'm considering calling off tomorrow just because i have a turnaround shift the next day and i don't know if i'll be able to make myself last another week if i do that  basically i'm trying to conserve energy where i can and they want more of me    what i learned while being homeless doesn't apply in this  working  world either  i did work while i was homeless btw  i worked my ass off  for free  i am certainly not  lazy   but being in a paid job  i've found that i've inherited these old fears and guilty feelings around work that i used to have  and i know those are not good motives  i know i'm more intelligent and resourceful than i'm really giving myself credit for  i should trust my abilities and the support i have right now    but the greater fear  more than not having money  is also something i learned while being homeless  one small decision can ruin your life for a long time  if not  forever  unless someone interferes    so i'm afraid to make this decision and yet i know also that not making a decision can have the exact same affect of making the  wrong  one  it can be even worse because the people who will make the decisions for your  will not care about your interests    i think honestly my partner has a lot to do with me feeling pressured to make things happen as well  i'm ambitious normally but  i definitely don't feel like he realizes that i need a break from the survival mode and that i really am never gonna heal my brain if i continue this work schedule  and my brain  it's very important    i need my wits about me if i'm going to be trying to make it without a job  and i need a break    anyways this is pretty rambly  but i think i'm just looking for someone to tell me i'm not crazy here or making some big mistake ,hza1vd

4,How do companies make sure the person they hire is a complete numbskull who will do all without question or complaint?,seems like a recurring problem for companies with high turnover is the constant flux of employees joining and leaving  what exactly do companies do or ask during interviews to see who is an obedient sheep who will do everything a company asks of him and not complain about pay ,i01fsr
5,Reminiscing on life as a child.,here i am  currently quarantined at home due to taking a covid test yesterday  i have been sick since saturday but ironically i am feeling almost 100  today  i am sure it was just the flu  but i took a test just to be safe  so instead of enjoying my free week off of work as i would as a kid while being out of school  here is what runs through my mind nearly every moment of the day   1  i am missing out on a week of pay  while the pay is not extravagant by any means whatsoever  it s still a week of pay  it mentally hurts to sit here all day feeling fine and knowing i could be making some money  but i m not    2  are my co-workers and boss annoyed upset with me  i wish i was the type of guy that doesn t care about what others think and perform all the same no matter how my work relations are  but i m not  the moment i start to second guess or wonder if my performance is annoying a co-worker or boss  my performance starts to take an even steeper dive to shit and my anxiety in the workplace sky rockets  and i m afraid my absence during this week will lead to something of the sort    3   i need to be doing something  i can t just be sitting here  holy shit i hate this  i can t just sit down and relax  and i absolutely hate that this work-worshipping society has molded me to be like this  i can t believe i literally can t allow myself to just sit down  accept that i m stuck at home for a few days  and relax    and amongst all this  i think back to how i felt to when i got sick when i was in school as a child  i would get so excited i might as well have not been sick anymore  i would be able to lounge around the house all day not worrying about a thing  feel content with a parent taking care of me  and get even more excited when my sickness wouldn t let up by the end of the day granting me another day off  i wish i could feel like this again when i am given the opportunity to be off of work  work has been so brainwashed into my head i literally start going insane when i am taken away from it  and i absolutely despite that ,hzpj1s
6,Job interview on Wednesday,i have an interview on wednesday for a call center on campus  it s remote  i get to chose my shift times  i don t have to work than 20 during the semester  get  10-12 an hour  i don t remember the exact amount    it would really help  and as far as jobs go right now  it s pretty good  i m very high risk and taking classes online   i m still not super looking forward to it  i want to do well we need the money and it s pretty good  but i don t like talking to lots of people  plus i ll have to be really careful so i don t stutter   i know i shouldn t complain  but ,hz78h2
7,Not having a career,i read bullshit jobs a few years ago and it had a huge impact on me  i was going to work in graphic design and being passionate about work  however my political leanings switched further left and reading and immersing myself in marxist anarchist work made me realise that working in a private organisation i would only be selling myself to a tyranny whilst they made the majority of the profits from the work i produce  since graduating i have been trying to live a work free life without a boss screaming down my neck and worrying about a shitty paycheck as i sit staring at a screen 9 hours a day  side note  i couldn't even find a job to begin with  i tried and got nothing even before covid  fortunately i am able to live the rest of my life without working  i hope  so financial burdens aren't an issue for me  since graduating i have begun doing things i wanted to  skateboarding  reading  playing guitar  martial arts and spending time doing what i want  i'm interested in knowing what the community thinks about this lifestyle change ,hytvxz

9,"Leave of absence, now what?",didn t know if this deserves its own thread  but i just put in my request for a leave of absence for my job teaching private music lessons  i was getting so burned out with online lessons  not being able to actually make the corrections needed with younger students to keep them going  that plus the pressure from corporate to keep my students interested and paying for more  as well as a constantly interrupted workflow  just totally ruined the joy i had in it    i just don t really know where to go from here  i have another job that is currently paying the bills  but is not something i want to be doing every day  just looking for advice on next steps i guess ,hz6h7d

11,"""We don't get paid for outbound calls.""",making outbound calls at my job  tech support call center  is discouraged because the company doesn't get paid from those calls  only the inbound calls  one of the many policies and shit that prevent us from actually helping people  along with keeping calls 20 minutes or less and requiring customers call back despite the long ass hold times and thousands of people in the queue    sometimes a customer may need us to call back on another line  call back after they restart the device  or they disconnect accidentally  i have no qualms about outbound calls because i prioritize actually helping people   i'd like to think i'm robin hood ,hyrsrm
12,Been unemployed for 2 months and will have to start looking for work,i have been unemployed for two months and its been so amazing  as many here will attest to  i have had such a great time to enjoy my hobbies   i've read so many books  played so many videogames and just chilled so much  of course i'm still worried about covid and my elderly parents  like it's not been a stress free period of my life  but much better than it has been for a long time  i kind of feel guilty cos so many are struggling in today's world   but starting august i'm gonna have to start applying for jobs  i was supposed to start at the beginning of this month but i decided to give myself an extra month of freedom  just thinking about applying for jobs is making me sick  i hate the fact that i will have to be working soon or a face some sort of disadvantage if i don't due to a gap in my employment history in my cv  i hate that it's like this so much  i mean i've already given myself a disadvantage as it is by being unemployed for two months   i fear i won't be able to have such freedom away from work ever again  it sickens me that i will have to look for a job  this system really needs to change because i don't see any happiness for me working   working life worsened my already fragile mental state  this freedom allowed me to recover somewhat by doing the things i actually locked and enjoyed  i fear that i will lose this recovery  the thought of working again is just  uhhh ,hzrcfi

14,How to handle a new colleague that make a miserable job 10x worst ?,so  i don't like my job  but i've managed to make it a little easier   a couple days a week from home etc   this took me weeks of negotiation and heated arguments with my boss because he hated the idea at first  i managed to make it happen by saying it would help retain people in the company   their turnover is insane   since he was sick of productivity being halted by having to train new people all the time   lol     he agreed    now  enters overzealous new freshly graduated staff member    she comes to the office on her wfh days and boasts about it    constant brown-nosing  complains about wfh  she has a million  ideas  that she only voices when the boss is in the room and they land on my desk  doubling my workload   she doesn't realize that we all  the senior team  know this needs to be done but we don't say anything because we're all grossly underpaid  we do what we're asked to stay employed  that's it    i would brief her about how it is  but she already snitched on me on a couple minor things  the atmosphere in that office is awful    i can already see the boss turning around like   see  they don't need wfh  back in the office it is    so how do i deal with her   do i wait until she gets f cked over on pay or hours   which happened to all of us   and opens her eyes     i'm pretty sure the boss promised her the world plus she's starry eyed because it's her first job so i don't want to make it horrible for her   which i could  i'm her direct manager  but this stuff needs to stop or she's going to ruin it for all of us    not quite sure on what to do ,hzxd6s

17,‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an asshole.‚Äù,today  i was working with the  director of operations  which  as far as anyone below him can figure doesn t mean anything  he says that he keeps everything moving and is the one responsible for the production within the company    i was told this after i had asked what he did around the facility  i made very clear that i wasn t trying to be belligerent  but clarified that i wanted to understand what he does  after he told me  i proceeded to ask him why  since he s on salary  that he s at work 60  hours a week  i wanted to know what needed to be done that couldn t wait until monday    he has a history of overworking and never being available for anything outside of work  all of this is made worse by the fact that he s technically my father  all growing up  he was always at work and when he wasn t  he was sleeping or yelling at my mother  sister  and i for being  ungrateful for what i do   i suggested that steps could be taken to make for fewer hours spent at work and more efficient processes made  obviously he s a brown-nosing  boot-licking type  that s when he looked me dead in the face and said  you re an asshole   it was stunning  he and i have never seen eye to eye  but this was something new  i told him that i no longer wanted to speak to him and he stormed away  muttering under his breath   i don t understand why he felt that that was an appropriate reaction  but for the foreseeable future  i m not interacting with him beyond what i absolutely have to  i m not going to his house  i m certainly not going to subject my wife to him  and i don t care if he apologizes    sorry for the rant post  i can t stand this shit anymore ,i06lyj
18,The Hypocrisy of Employers,does this seriously anger or irritate anyone else  i ve been working since i was 19 years old  i m 22 now  so i m quite young  but still  i have noticed the deception and hypocrisy  i ve recently reread some of my new hire manuals that i found while cleaning my room  and some things have opened my eyes   how employers can simply  fire someone for no reason at all or for the slightest misdemeanor or mistake  yet if an employee were to quit their job  they re expected  sometimes even required to give a two week notice  having to politely explain their departure or positively reflect on their work experience  despite whether or not they actually liked working there   how most  if not all companies prioritize the customer over the worker in disputes  i know they do all they can to keep customers and the money they depend on  but i ve witnessed situations where  karen  like customers get what they want  and the employee is reprimanded    how difficult it is to receive healthcare  i am a massage therapist  and our main objective at our job is to promote health and wellness to our clientele  yet we don t receive free or even reduced healthcare from our employers    if a manager or higher up is cheating  lying  talking shit  etc they are less likely takes longer for them to be fired than compared to employees    anyways  i m so glad i ve found this subreddit and learned even more  please feel free to add more to the list ,i00582

21,Had to get rid of this...,hello antiworkers    i live in a small  rich  country in europe  we have one of the best healthcare systems in the world  we have minimum 4 weeks paid vacations and paid sick days  however  let me tell you something  it does not make it better     i am 22 years young and i have already lost all joy in life and it started 5 years ago  when i left school    i did not complain about my first jobs  i still hated every single one  because it was the first time i was earning my own money and everybody else was doing it    then i started in the office of a production company  i stayed there for 3 years and it was during these 3 years  where it got worse   i realized  that the only thing i was doing besides working 45 hours  5 days a week for a minimum wage and always doing shit i m not passionate or even care about  was playing call of duty  resting from work and going out on the weekends    every morning i got mad and punched into my chair because i knew i was going to throw another 10 hours of my life away  i started hating my coworkers bc they were just a bunch of zombies  they think that working 5 days is the purpose of our lifes and if you don t think the same way  you re just a lazy  pathetic human being  i had to stay at home for 3 weeks after a surgery and when i came back  the first thing they asked me was   did you miss us  you re happy to be back right  after 2 weeks off work  you get bored anyway  right    i wanted to punch every one in the face  i realized  these people are so braindead  they can t imagine a life without going to their 9-5 job  i saw my parents  my friends acting and thinking the same way  i got depressed by the fact i should do this this shit for  40 years  i lost some friends bc of it but i still managed to get through the day  looking forward to fridays  until    after 3 years  at the end of january  i left and took 2 months off  just for me before i would start in a new company  covid came and gave me another extra month  so i had 3 months to do almost everything i wanted  to be honest  i didn t do that much due to the lack of money but i never felt so fucking good in my entire life  i went to the gym in the morning  always cooked for my family  played cod  cleaned the house  if i was tired i could take a nap  going outside into the nature  smoke some weed etc etc  i was free and you know  just fucking happy  i finally enjoyed life after a long time of anger issues and signs of depression     then  it was monday  the 3 months were over and i knew that i had to start this shit again  during the first month  when i was coming home  i always went straight to my bedroom and punched into my desk  sometimes cried  i felt something strange in my chest  i thought i was getting a heart attack  i was so sad and angry at the same time   i had to throw up every morning and couldn t eat much until 8pm  my whole body felt sick i can t describe the feeling  like it was deep inside of me    i never went to the gym again  i lost all my progress from the last 2 years  i m the skinny guy i swore i would never be again  i started smoking again  even more than in the past  i don t enjoy music or movies anymore  i don t want to cook anymore  i barely speak to my family  lost most of my friends  i was a happy  extrovert and healthy young man and now  always inside the house  tired to do anything because i know the next day or next week is gonna be the same 9h shit every day  40 years     gaming is the only hobby i can try to monetize  i m just too tired and sad to start anything new and if that youtube  twitch thing won t work  i see dark for my future  i have a great family but they won t understand it  maybe i m just too weak and a lil pussy idk i m seeing myself ending as a drug addict  thank you for reading this  i just wanted to get this off my chest  sry for my english   god bless all of you,hyyl5l

24,How did you realize ...,how  or when  did you realize that the system of work we live in is just not made for you  i realized it quite late    when i was a child  life was kinda great  i have been told that i was an active  creative child with a lot of interests  and i do remember that time with joy    but things already went darker when i got into elementary school  suddenly there were schedules to be followed  tasks to be done  and later on evaluated  and also my parents were putting quite some pressure on me - that i would need to be a good student from the start in order to  make it in life    so i put myself under a lot of pressure and suffered from severe anxiety early on in my  career  but i was successful  i did well and ended up in what would be comparable to college  not my school-system  in the meantime my anxiety got worse  my parents divorced and things turned out to get really ugly  in all that mess i developed severe ocd  there was only one thing i focused on that could save me  i was a good student and would    make it in life  so i focused on school and missed out on a lot of fun  partys  girls  trips  etc    i was immensly fascinated by people like bill gates and warren buffett at that time  little did i know  its sort of cringeworthy from todays point of view   when i graduated i was finally done with my dull  grey life  i was exhausted  today you would call that a burn out  there has been no joy in my life   but my grades were top notch  hurray  thats when i found out that something went terribly wrong  this could just not be it  my friends seemed happy and my life was a mess  so what did i do  study  i literally started reading books from dale carnegie  erich fromm and such in order to  learn  what life was all about and how to feel  happy   but i was still sort of in line with the system  i developed critical thinking and taking care of myself  starting to lose weight  workout  spend my time with different things  as university luckily turned out to be a relatively easy experience for me i got plenty of spare time to spent  and i used that time to educate myself out of the box  and it was great  and i came to the conclusion that i have been indoctrinated by the system and that i lost a lot of years and missed out on so many things  that was when i woke up  step one  being aware of ones condition  step two      to cut things shorter  right now i am sitting in a 40  hour per week office job  i am appreciated by my coworkers but the pressure is high and my free time is very limited  i am fully aware of the  sheep  life i live - like so many other people  and this awareness has changed me over the years  i am no longer a people pleaser and a  yes -man  but i am still there  following rules  commuting  living for the weekend    and i did not find a solution  yet  you can bet i did read some books   on how to do that but nope   no clue so far    so what is your story  how  or when  did you find out about the reality of  work ,hzi55x

26,Do you think there is a correlation between population and bullshit jobs? Let's discuss.,i was recently thinking about this and i wanted to discuss it with some like-minded individuals and get some other points of view    my present thinking is that due to the increase in population more people are being forced into bullshit jobs to make the unemployment rate go stay down  politicians always talk about how they are going to make sure that unemployment is at its lowest and when it is people are just doing worthless shit   i'm also wondering that without the bullshit jobs people would be able to actually get paid a decent amount but that might just be wishful thinking    i am in no way an antinatalist but it seems the more people there are the more bullshit there has to be to go around to keep up busy ,i0om0u
27,A funny controversy I've noticed,i applied to many places in the past  almost every response was a denied message  so explain to me  why do we get thought that jobs are essential  yet then you get no opportunity to work  since you always get denied  it is really a screwed up system  in the end you are forced in the worst job  simply because you didn't get taken by the places you actually wanted to work in  funny enough that they never tell you why you didn't make it  it's always this pre-made text with a  sorry  but you didn't make it  so am i just being judged by some stupid numbers on a piece of paper  if so  that's just pathetic for something like a serious company,i147rl

30,I'm kinda bummed about life tbh,i'm 19 rn  iv been working at a job rn  and it kinda sucks especially now during pandemic because since it isn't a career  they can make me work overtime up to 12 hours if they need ppl for the night shift holiday because there are tons of ppl that took a lot of time off   anyways if i get the career i'll get paid more and they can't force me to work overtime  which is cool  but the thing that bums me out is the fact that if i do get it  that means i would just have a a pretty boring and mundane life  8 hours everyday 5 days a week  for the next 40 or more  years until i can retire  idk man  sounds pretty cringe,i0eil8
31,I walked out of my job and I'm never looking back,it was an awful job  with awful conditions made worse by the pandemic  we got new ownership who made massive cuts to our perks and benefits and started hiring on friends and giving them preferential treatment  i was supposed to be done in 2 days but i just couldn't take it anymore    the second i got in there i was immediately under fire by the bosses  the place was busy as all hell  and my coworkers are just stressed and taking it out on eachother  i was there for 24 minutes  had a panic attack  took a second to breathe and think in the bathroom  did a lil more work  then just slipped out the back after a few more minutes  i got in my car  waited for a green light and then just fucking booked it out of the lot and towards the highway  home  freedom  happiness   you know that scene in breaking bad where jesse smashes the gates in the car and is crying from joy  that was how i felt  i didn't realized how bogged down and trapped i felt in that job  i was killing myself and all for what  to make fucking burgers for ungrateful customers  get yelled at while i put my blood sweat and tears into the job  and get laughed at when i ask about a raise  no  absolutely not  i deserve way better than that and i am never going back to that god awful establishment    i used to have nightmares where i was at work and it was busy  that's literally it  i wasn't naked or on fire or anything  just at work doing my job while it was busy  i'd wake up feeling like i was gonna throw up  my heart would be going so fast   was what i did cool or acceptable  absolutely not  do i feel bad about it  for sure  however  the immense weight that left my chest as soon as i got out of the parking lot told me i was making the right choice for me ,i17qbu
32,Do what you love and you will never work a day in your life is such a horseshit advice,1  you need to be on top of your game for people to pay you for your service  you need to spend hours upon hours to be really good at what you do   you may also need expensive equipment to be a professional  2  you need to make the word out   you will have to keep explaining to potential customers why they should pick you from the countless others who also provide similar services to yours  3  you also need to convince them that the money you are asking for is fair enough while trying to undercut your competition  4  some clients simply refuse to pay or not pay in time   it sucks having to spend a lot of your own money on a clients project who does not pay in time putting you in a financial constraint   slowing down other projects  5  the razor thin margins you get are supposed to pay for food   taxes   child care  medical care business e t c e t c  you could take out a loan trying to prop up your business but success isn't guranteed unlike the further debt spiral you put yourself in   passion and capitalism do not blend well   nobody is deeply passionate about working with idiotic clients   after doing this   you come to a conclusion that it is a much better deal to provide an employer with a different service and work on what you love on your spare time for your own personal enjoyment ,i0i00c

34,18 years old and recently fired: My thoughts on work,my mother was over an hr department in a plant that makes houses  i was out of work and covid was just then hitting so my mom offered me an office job answering phones  filing papers  etc   it didn t have the greatest pay but it was an office job with air conditioning and easy work so i couldn t complain  if i m being honest  the company was in rough shape  the owner was a mess  people were worried about the pandemic  and the amount of calls i ve gotten about someone else in the office not answering their phones was enough to make me hate my job itself  but regardless  it was a pretty nice place with pretty nice people then we got sold to a competitor   i was there for about 3 months when it happened and it happened in the middle of the day with no warning to anyone  suddenly  we all had to  work for our jobs  and not even the higher ups were safe  it was shocking but i knew enough to just keep working and do what i had to do so i wasn t worried  it was at that time that they let 2 people go  one was the owner  and told about 5 others that they had 30-60 days left    my mom was stressed  she s always been a workaholic and she s never been fired before  she told me to pick up the pace so that we didn t get the axe  but i knew that they pretty much had predetermined who was staying and who was leaving as soon as they walked through the door  my mom started getting comfortable with their people and their system of doing things  so we figured we would be safe  we were so wrong   yesterday  they fired both of us  no warning  no heads up  just let us go in one day  the reasoning was that they were basically reducing the place to bare bones and making it some side gig shithole  now  i m not going to lie  i couldn t care less about my job  i m not going to beg someone to let me waste my time stapling papers just for some cash just to be stabbed in the back a month later  however  my mom was broken  this was the first time she d ever been fired and its like she just then realized that bosses are snakes    my mom already had an interview lined up for a way better position just in case something like this was to happen  but until then  we have no income and what little we do have is going to insurance  bills  etc  i don t think that the owners are totally bad people  i believe they have their orders and they re just doing business in their eyes    but that s the problem  every time one of these rich dickheads does  business  they put families in deep shit  especially in times like this  for anyone out there  do not let society make you be as heartless as these people  it might just be another budget cut to you  but it s someone else s life you re messing with ,i09z8q

46,Work expectations,just having a shitty day with shitty people at work so i just wanna share my thoughts about being promoted   because i can perform maintenance and get along with colleagues  i got promoted  i took the offer and was told to just keep up my work and so i did   months have passed i develop this habit of just recharging myself in the first hour of morning where i drink coffee  take  shit  and organize my work station before i run myself throughout the day and finish    but then my boosses told me i was underperforming  mind you that reporters  and techs call me all the time to fix their issues and move along aside from finishing my work and keeping up with other stuff where i ensure the reports are being sent properly    out of my frustration i fucked up once where i forgot to send a piece to other department  a boss threw it out and the blame was on me 100  he pointed out that i was going through personal shit and whatever i go through just keep it to myself  i cant talk anymore because whatever i say i always being shut   being promoted is  good for image but adding a couple a hundred bucks and eating a shit sandwich from assholes makes me feel like a failure to society   i am at this position right now to just fucking give up and just want to live a much simpler life where i dont keep up other people expectations    i have a side business but it doesnt pay my living  i dont know what to do right now but thanks for reading ,i06bdw
47,I'm tired of pretending to be someone I can't be.,yes  this is not my main account  because  well  look at the name  linking these sentiments to my main reddit account is not going to be helpful to that aim  given the mindsets of some people who know that one   i almost took a government job  i mean  i could still take it -- all i have to do is jump through some more hoops  and it's mine  oh  the prize of a 23-dollar-an-hour inbound call center job  remote but requiring a secure environment  which means i'd be spending at least six-hour shifts in my bedroom -- which is a sauna during the required working hours  it's a good job  as my mother reminded me -- and when i impulsively blurted that i'd rather die than take it  she said that we'd all die if i didn't   i look like the classic millennial suck-up artist -- almost 30  live with my parents  an advanced degree in an intellectual-elite subject  and don't want to work  actual facts  my parents  both of whom have severe disabilities  rely on me for their everyday needs  they also rely on my income  given that their combined social security and disability payments don't cover their rent and bills  let alone food  my main reason for staying in academia as long as i did was that as long as i was in school  we could live off of my loans and workstudy funds -- and i believed that getting paid for a fulfilling vocation was the reward of all that study  in fact  jobs in my field will either get me hated by roughly half the population of the united states  get me hated by the entire population of the united states  have barely survivable wages or are in call centers  inbound call centers handling things that should be done though web portals  i learned the hard way that i can't do that last one because of the sensory overload  so i figured out how to survive on barely-survivable wages  at least i wasn't making enough to have to pay off my student loans  and i figured i'd just be in debt for life  then the pandemic happened  those jobs either disapeared or would put me in a position where i had an unacceptable chance of getting infected and exposing my very-high-risk parents   we've gotten this far on their payments and the ebt card i got as part of the barely-survivable-wages initiative -- even though when i stopped working  my funds got cut from that because i'm young enough to work or starve -- the largess of the local food pantry  our stimulus money  and loans from a relative who married rich  this job seemed perfect for me  my mother was right to tell me that i'm just like my father  too good for anyone who would hire me  i finally stopped arguing that i'm not  and admitted it  after all  she's the neurotypical side of the family  given that everyone in my paternal bloodline has either high-functioning autism  add  or a combination of them  that i have the combination  that everyone in that bloodline has been either  shiftless    a grifter   too good to work   too stupid to get a decent job  or just constantly gets fired  and that i already have a history of being fired for reasons i can't comprehend why should i torment myself to emulate the other side of my family  the one that honestly seems to enjoy work for its own sake  because we need me to do so to live  that means i force myself to do something that makes me want to die in order that my parents live  but i can't die because that would kill them  nobody to get the food  nobody to cook it  catch-22 that's a recipe for mutual hate  we already fight about money too much   i wasn't expecting my mother to even listen to that  let alone agree with me  in retrospect  i think it's because she had noticed my isolation-depression abating over the past few weeks  as i had discovered projects that made me feel there was hope for a better world when the pandemic eventually recedes -- and that there was a place for me in it where i could use my education for good causes rather than patching a broken system and getting yelled at for it  my crashing back into that maybe-suicidal desperation  she says it was suicidal  i say just an angry realization that i'd rather not live at all than live like that  about what was objectively the good news of having almost gotten a job gave her a glimpse of what goes on in my head  my father's view of the whole argument was along the lines of   finally you see sense  let's get to planning your future doing what you want to do  because now i know at least you'll survive this mess   not as helpful as he thought  and maybe not accurate given that i have a heart defect and may be higher-risk than my age would indicate -- but i appreciate his understanding of my mental state   i don't know where the rent's coming from in two months -- maybe another stimulus  maybe more from that married-rich relative  maybe i'll find a way to make money that doesn't make me want to die  the  grifters  always managed to live well  i'm determined to eke every bit of silver lining i can out of this horrible year -- it looks like that includes a fair chunk of finding my true self in a way the commercialized self-help business does not espouse  because there's no money in it ,hz4vlw

60,Need Some Advice,hi guys  i m in a bit of a dilemma at my job  and would just like your thoughts  with my current employer  i used to be an engineer technician  but took a promotion to become an engineer  which i have a b s  degree for  while i was initially happy for this opportunity  and the salary increase from about  30k to  55k was extremely nice  i ve started noticing more and more that this position may not be the right fit for me   the new position is just overwhelming  with the amount of things they expect me to know and the overall added responsibilities  it s just too much for me  and i ve come to dread having to work each day knowing what s expected of me  besides the salary being lower  i much prefer my old position of technician  the technicians are essentially helpers to the engineers  with much less overall responsibilities  which i think better suits me personally  i still have the opportunity to drop back down to my old title  but i m torn on what to do  on the one hand  i d much prefer just going back to being the helper and not worrying about all these added responsibilities  but on the other  it would make me feel like i ve failed with this  and going back to  30k isn t the most ideal  i just feel stuck currently  and have no idea what i should do  any help is much appreciated  thanks   tl dr  took a promotion to become an engineer  but realized it s not a great fit for me  i used to somewhat enjoy my old title  but not sure if taking the paycut and going back to it is the right choice ,hykbkq

66,How do you reconcile with the fact that your company doesn‚Äôt give a shit about you?,i ve been with the company i work for for over two years now  and it hasn t always been great  but for the most part it s been positive  the management has been accessible when we have issues  and tends to listen for the most part  when i started  everyone here told me how great we were treated  and there were people who had worked here for 20  years  so i was inclined to believe them    since covid struck  things have happened that have not only rubbed me the wrong way  but have genuinely upset me  we were never allowed to work from home or have flexible schedules  but once there was a stay at home order in place  we all transitioned seamlessly to working from home  the only hiccups were with the older employees struggling with technology  i was told  that i would still have to make special trips to the office on a twice weekly basis to accommodate for one of our clients who demanded special treatment  so  i  and 4 other employees had to continue to go into the office  putting ourselves at risk  when no ppe was available for anyone    then  we moved to phase 1 of reopening the office  and since i had already been going in the office since we closed  you guessed it  i was nominated to be one of the first to go back in  i have now been back in the office full time since june 1st  in an area that is now booming with covid  and have been required to travel out of town multiple times  work on a sunday  gotten reprimanded for being 15 minutes late  told i cannot work from home while others are still able to  gotten reprimanded for being on my phone  even though i ve been here since we closed    now  here s where i got upset  an article was published releasing all of the companies who received ppp loans in our area  my company received a  1-2 million loan  good for them  we re also are an essential business  we didn t lose hardly any revenue during the early part of the pandemic like other businesses  and maintained all of our employees  we were lucky  but  at our company wide meeting last week  we found out that no one is getting a raise this year  for the first time in company history  i get that it s quite an expense  but due to the nature of our work  we ve all been working our asses off  and instead of a raise  you know what we got  a fucking thank you letter from the board of directors on fancy paper    to make it even better  we just bought a new building  and we were told working from home is done once the new building is finished  so i can t even leverage for flexible schedule in the future when they inevitably take our bonuses away too    i ve worked my dick off through this only to get a thank you letter and to get yelled at for sleeping an extra fifteen minutes  i m done giving this place 100 ,hz1l2e

(rant),so i'm a 21 year old security guard and cleaner that works 12 hour night shifts and i'm starting to lose my mind ive been doing it since feb 2019 and i hate the shite out of it its gotten to the point where it's taking a toll on my mental health since i have depression and anxiety i only work 4 days a week but feels like 5 since it's obviously long hours i have to cover almost 2 weeks holiday next week with 1 night off in between for my coworker as me and him are the only 2 to do night shifts i do the same crap every day cleaning every kitchen  toilet  desk etc at an immaculate level like i'm working in fucking buckingham palace i do this on my own with no one around so it gets real lonely being unable to talk to anyone and being alone with my depressing thoughts which drives me insane out of me and my co worker he's been here the longest and he's only been here a couple years and the place we work has been open 13 years many cleaners seem to have quit out of the 15 months i've been here 3 cleaners have come and gone we had a second cleaner role working with one of us on the side to help clean the building since it's big but now me and my coworker do it on our own nights off are pointless since  i end up sleeping through the day and waking up at 5pm because i'm so exhausted and i dont get anything done i wake up eat my 1 and only meal for the day and scroll reddit while listening to spotify lost all motivation for anything and feel like i'm closer to suicide each passing day i have like  25 000 in savings and feel like bolting and living off that while i have a long break and have some clarity figuring out what do with my life while working on some hobbies for once only problem is the huge guilt i feel i live with my mum and she wouldn't be happy if i left so i'd feel i'd have to make up a story  like say for example work couldn't afford to keep paying me cuz of the pandemic draining the economy and therefore i was let go id think it's for the benefit of my health but it's the fact people would judge me since working till we are dead is socially acceptable and quitting is like high treason sorry for the long wall of rambling this is my first post on reddit and i just wanted to get this off my chest and see what yall think ,i14htq

94,You don't actually have to pay rent in California. A practical guide., step one  get a lease one way or another  the ideal way to do this is to step in on the lease of someone who wouldn't mind you doing this  e g  a foreign student who's leaving soon  of course  these opportunities are far apart and few between  most likely  you'll just apply and be accepted like a normal person    step two  save up for a lawyer  i used legal insurance for this and had to pay nothing  but most people won't have an affordable group legal insurance plan like myself  a lawyer  for the whole case  should run you a few thousand dollars  which should still be far cheaper than rent over the period of the lawsuit  make sure your lawyer is halfway competent and agrees with you in terms of general strategy  does he know what a  delta  motion to quash is  and the fact that some courts no longer accept them  does his fee include writs of mandate  and does he know what a writ of mandate is  will he demur to the complaint  how good is he with getting the clerk to calendar cases  what is his track record and experience  is he afflicted with bourgeois sentiment  or will he fight tooth and nail for tenants  right or wrong  will he file an affirmative lawsuit for you on contingency  or will you have to pay him hourly     step three  go around your house  start taking note of everything wrong with it  doesn't matter how minor it seems - you'll find that it often adds up  electrical problems  bathtub clogged  garbage disposal rattling  heater malfunctioning  cabinets not closing  windows letting in a draft  write it all down and take pictures if you can    step four  in coordination with your lawyer  start complaining  then withhold rent  if it is a less professional company  the landlord may bluster  threaten  etc  keep logs of everything  and record everything after the first episode  this is an exception to the two-party consent law  then forward everything to your lawyer     step five  do not answer the door for people you don't know  if they can't serve you  they'll have to seek an order to post and mail  this will add weeks or even a month or more to the process  your lawyer should take care of everything else after that - make sure you've discussed strategy beforehand with them  at some point  your attorney will file a lawsuit against them demanding restitution for the habitability issues as well as any harassment you may have faced    step six  when the trial date has been set  it's time to leave  as long as you deliver possession before the trial date  they cannot proceed and must dismiss or convert the case to a limited civil action  go get an airbnb or a group living situation and either reapply for a new place or take advantage of the situation you find yourself in next     q  what about my credit score or my public record   there is no public record of an eviction in california unless the landlord actually wins  landlords will rarely report to credit bureaus in general  however  you don't know this  as such  try to avoid giving them your ssn in the first place  your lawyer should be able to get you a full release as part of the settlement for the affirmative lawsuit  so this should not be a problem  however  it's part of the risk you take    q  what if my landlord tries to harass or threaten me   there is a risk your landlord might try to do something stupid  you look a lot more sympathetic as a  victim  of harassment  and this can substantially increase your payout  all this said  don't be dumb - be armed in case they try anything and by california law  if they attempt to break in  you may use lethal force against them if you feel your life is in danger  however  do  not  reveal that you're armed or anything of the sort unless you truly need to in order to defend your life  brandishing  etc  when you are not in actual danger is a good way to get the police interested  which you do not want  however  if you have a corporate landlord  it is unlikely they will do all that much but put a notice up on your door    q  isn't this his property  what stops him from just coming in   real property is a bundle of sticks  when a landlord leases to you  or to someone who then assigns the lease to you  he hands you the stick of possession  you effectively own the property as against the whole world  including the titled owner  he is nothing but a trespasser on your property  and you can deal with him as if he is nothing but a trespasser if he attempts to come in and fuck with you  while he can  by statute  enter upon giving 24 hours notice  he can only do so if he has a good reason  and he cannot do so if doing so would lead to a breach of the peace even if he does have a good reason    q  how am i going to get a good reference   usually  the landlord will agree to a positive or neutral reference as part of any settlement  if all else fails  you can simply hop on to a roommate situation and get friends to vouch for you  if you can't get good formal references or fake them  or go get an airbnb  then use those references to sight your next target    q  what about my record  even if the eviction is confidential  won't future landlords see my lawsuits against the landlords   make sure you sue as a john doe  alleging fear of retaliation  physical harm  etc  this works better if you are a former victim of domestic violence or something similar    q  how does this interact with covid   in the bay area  before covid  it could take more than 12 months to evict a tenant  now  hope you enjoy having a stable  long-term place to live rent-free    q  isn't this fraud   don't lie  just don't pay ,hz1cll

100,genuine question,im not  trolling  i would genuinely like to discuss your thoughts on this so i can be better educated    i see posts on here pouting out flaws in the system  capitalism  and that many are faced with  work or starve  my question is that even without capitalism  if we're in some socialist utopia  at this stage in human technology  how would a society function where people didn't work  i can agree with some points - there is too much focus on work as a central part of most people's lives and it could be cut down significantly but if you think about it  i can almost guarantee that you rely on others to function in your daily lives  without society it literally is work  farm  or starve so someone has to make food and someone has to get that food to you  via shops or whatever  and  there's also water distribution and builders and doctors that you more or less need to survive  electricity and roads and education and medicine research and heating and transport are all other things that technically you could survive without but they're nice to have but you need workers to keep those working    are you guys literally anti work or do you just think work could be reduced in daily life because im close to the point where id call myself a socialist  still learning  yet i still think most  able  people would work in some form in a socialist communist utopia  they would be treated better and would likely work a lot less but modern society needs work and although work seems bad it's better than getting everything for yourself  a world where no one works would not be better than present  unless you're a really good thief i guess   sorry for long post   tldr work is necessary in some form to have a good life ,hyy4vl

102,The working class is completely fucked and there is nothing short of violent revolution that will fix anything in the dystopia of the U.S,title says it all  i m becoming so very depressed at the state of the place i m now forced to live in  why can t i just stay at home forever so i don t have to juggle not getting covid from braindead customers or anxieties from an extreme workload  my dad always spouted that socialism is the same as communism and if we had that i d never work a job that i wanted  it s amazing how idiotic that is because most people hate the job they work at  massive wealth inequality and the elite being in untouchable positions really squeezes the hope out of me too  i feel sickened by the fact that i have to pay hundreds of dollars for insulin  life is hell enough but i have to pay extra just to survive  sorry about the ranting but i just need my thoughts to be somewhere other than in my head,hz9hc9
103,Lacking the will to live due to the prospect of working full time,note  i'm not currently suicidal nor do i have any active plans  its more like that im losing my desire to keep living as work will take a more central role in my life   anyway  where do i begin   i'm in my mid twenties  and have dropped out of university  i'm in a unique situation where i don't have to work at all for the moment  i don't wish to go in depth here  i have worked various part time jobs in the past with little enthusiasm    however  i know that this is not a long term possibility and  have to  work full time or some equivalent   in theory  i'm not opposed to the idea of  work  in general or spending my days doing something or developing a skill  in a pure theoretical sense  this is all well and good   my main problem is how it's all set up   to keep things simple i'm simply can't do it  i can't   i find the whole process of work  from the hiring process  to the repetition of mundane tasks  to the simple idea that you need it to live and determines your quality of life  to be utterly appalling and repulsive    for example  i used to be a actually enthusiastic about the workforce when i was younger as i naively believed that my skills would be appreciated and that employers would notice   oh what a fucking joke that is   despite being trilingual and having experience in library work  as an assistant and volunteer    i couldn't get through the interviews for several menial bookstore jobs despite  having the experience   actually researching the company and developing decent questions    contrary to what they say  they care more about apperances and how your image matches the  team  as opposed to raw skill  despite the fact that i'm a genuinely pleasant person  so i think  and would love nothing more than to do a job well done and go home after  apparently that's not good enough no   they want an overly positive   agreeable  people pleasing drone who will say what they want to hear  i've been told in a practice interview that i'm not  positive  enough  despite smiling politely  coming prepared  listening and asking important questions  and trying to engage overall in the hiring process  good forbid that i wasn't born with a rainbow shoved up my ass and that i don't smile like a drooling idiot every two seconds fuck off   it all  fills me with various unpleasant emotions such as  rage  resentment  unending sadness   and a splash of general hopelessness   what kills me the most is that on a grand scale  it's all technically pointless  life has no objective meaning and i don't want to spend a majority of my life doing things that i simply don't want to do   the only hope that i have now is that i'm looking into web development and coding  now  i'm not naive as to believe that it has no drawbacks but at least  in theory  this is a job that can be done remotely and that pays well  it also  at first glance  seems to be a workplace culture that values skill  for obvious reasons  more than social savy  i intend to maybe do a 3 year technical program for it or perhaps a bootcamp still researching  i also intend on tutoring languages on the side   i also plan on living with the minimum  currently a minimalist as all my entertainment is from the library or the internet yes  also don't intend on getting married or having kids   but if i can't succeed in my current plan i frankly don't know what i want to do   this looming obligation of eventually having to work full time is driving me crazy and making me lose the will to live  i have tried to  leave the world  once have since gotten a bit of help and feel better  yet the feeling of dread remains   anyways  any solutions  solidarity  or whatever comments are all perfectly fine  i don't expect solutions as my expectations are quite low at this point  thanks for this sub   have a good day ,hztdyq

118,Personal Experiences with the US Workplace and the Gig Economy,warning  wall of text incoming   in 2006  i quit my first adult job working in a kitchen after  8 years of employment  my hourly wages at first were  6 hr as a dishwasher  and by the time i quit i was a sous chef making  13 hr - which was pretty decent for a louisiana resident at the time   after a short stint in the oilfield where i witnessed the astonishing amount of waste  both environmental and financial  that goes with that industry  i went back to working in kitchens and also returned to college to pursue a degree in 2011   when i graduated in 2015 and finally left the food service industry  i was making  13 hr at the same exact position that i held in 2006  by that time the cost of everything had increased dramatically but my pay remained the same   13 hr felt like a lot of money in '06  but in '15 it was just enough to get by  and i was among the highest paid employees in the building   to make things even more difficult  my rent had risen from  700 month at the start of my lease to  850 month between 2012-2015  things were so dire that there were times when i had no viable choice but to buy groceries with a credit card  the credit card bill sometimes had to be paid with student loan money  because i frequently found myself with no other means to meet those payments while working and attending school full time   the food service industry - like most jobs in this gig economy - has a painfully low ceiling for the average employee  and each person who works at a restaurant is completely expendable and can be terminated for just about any reason  most of my coworkers had to work multiple jobs to get by because they weren't offered enough shifts to be considered full-time employees  so that the employer wouldn't have to provide health insurance  many of them had substance abuse problems to cope with the insurmountable task of working multiple shifts each day in order to be able to feed their families  health insurance was either non-existent or unaffordable for most of us   lately conservatives have been arguing that  600 a week for unemployment is too much and that it discourages employees from returning to work  they argue that citizens should  pull themselves by the bootstraps  and stop accepting  government handouts  but without  government handouts  like the pell grant  i would still be making starvation wages in a restaurant and relying on government services to keep me going    hearing conservatives talk like this upsets me deeply because i have firsthand experience of how difficult it is to reach middle class today  and my experience wasn't nearly as bad as many of the people i had to work with because i was fortunate enough to have had a strong support system of family and friends   it's also worth mentioning that i first attended college in 1999 and  foolishly  didn't finish my first semester  my tuition that year was just under  1000 for the semester  by the time i graduated in 2015  tuition had risen to  4500 per semester  last i heard  tuition at this university is well over  5000 per semester   my personal experiences are proof enough to me that this economic system is completely rigged against the average person  we are all cannon fodder for the companies and corporations who exploit our labor and productivity  in the early 20th century people had to literally die for the 40 hour workweek and minimum wage  but it's not at all uncommon to hear complaints  usually from conservatives  about how labor unions are corrupt and regular people are taking advantage of the system   this post has no point other than to share my anecdotal experiences with others  but i believe that it also implicitly explains why i am a leftist  if you have experiences like this that you would like to share  please comment because i'd love to hear about it ,i112n6
119,Working makes me want to cry.,i started a job in april  it's a fast paced food place and i hate it already  they're expectations are way too high  everything we do has to be quick as possible so we can move on to the next task    i was on register for most shifts i was there and i was good at it and loved it honestly  we require masks in store and i ask people to cover their noses while they're in the store and almost everyone does it without a problem  one day  i was at register and asked a women to cover her nose   i wasn't smiling under my mask or anything and had slipped into my normal tone of speaking and didn't sound preppy or enthusiastic  this women asked for my manager and told him i had an additude and was rude to her  none of which was true    that was about 2 weeks ago and they've taken me off of reg since then  my boss shadowed me one day to see how i was doing everywhere else and i was doing fine but now they tend to keep me away from the customers by having my wash dishes  do stocking and things like that  i feel like they don't care if i improve now and are just waiting to hire someone new to take my place   they're hiring again    a few times they've said things that have irked me  we're not allowed to sit unless we're on a break even when it's slow  sometimes we have to do things that take awhile like write notes and i've asked to sit while doing this and was told me and could only sit if i was going to faint  i got a stern talking to cause i sat for one second while i had water and i didn't know i wasn't allowed to do that   another is that we have to ask permission to have a drink of water  that irked me so now i just let them know i'm getting water and not taking no for an answer    i once let me manager know that i was going to use the restroom and she let me know my bathroom breaks can't be more than 1 minute long     i think what bothers me so much about it all is that they're all younger than me  they're mostly shiftleads being between 18-21 and i'm 22  and it feels like i'm being talked down to by someone a lot younger than me    and the one thing that upsets me the most is we can't let them know we can't work a certain day  we have to put in a time off request  i let her know i couldn't work a certain day and she told me i had to put in a time off request which she can deny  i put in 2 for certain days i absolutely cannot work about 1  week ago and they're still pending    this doesn't seem normal to me as i've never had to deal with this at a job before  i'm not sure if i'm being over dramatic but the way they do things there just doesn't sit right with me  i am going to be starting school soon for cosmetology and hopefully can make a successful career out of it so i don't have to deal with any of this again ,i0rbrd
120,At my workplace people make fun of or have complaints of people that don't answer their phone calls/emails during lunch or off working hours.

146,"Calling it ""labor"" instead of ""work"" doesn't suddenly make a lack of free time desirable.",this is a smallish rant without real target or thesis  but one that i wanted to post anyways  i mostly lurk in this sub   i think i have  like  two or three posts  maybe  in some comment sections here over the last year or so   so i'm well aware that there's a pretty wide spectrum of political thought across the sub  mostly from areas of the left  naturally  and that various things are fairly contentious aside from the general distaste we share for the current condition of work under the capitalist system   but i see a lot of posts that essentially argue for some calvanist principal of hard ethics   it's not the prevailing attitude  save for that one  we actually  love  to work back-breaking labor  it's just alienation that's bad  twitter post that gets upvoted every couple of weeks  though nevertheless i see a consistent number of posts coming into the sub and getting very popular from people talking about how the ideal would be to forego modern technology and return to the farm to work from sunrise to sunset in the fields or how pulling 13-hour shifts at a steel mill is actually the pure ideal of the modern laborer   and then inevitably there will be a bunch of posts in the comments saying   um  i mean that'd be better  but i still don't want to spend my entire life working just to survive  and a host of responses going   it's not work  it's  labor  labor is fulfilling   and like  guys   be that as it may  which is heavily dependent on the individual and their interests  should we not  also  be arguing that required labor should be tremendously lessened for the average individual as well  is allowing a more relaxed schedule for everyone involved so people don't have to spend their entire lives devoted to a manual task not ultimately the immediate second goal of removing labor as a commodity   and that's not even to mention the comments throwing out re-interpretations of the op  saying things like   well i'm sure there are some forms of labor you enjoy  like writing or playing an instrument  which  like  i'm  pretty sure  that when said generic op mentioned how fulfilling it was to labor tirelessly for the good of the community  they weren't talking about improv theater    just  no  man  not having a boss is still better than having a boss  but regardless of how much less it would suck to have to  labor  for oneself tirelessly each day while seeing the direct results than it is to  work  for a corporation tirelessly each day with no flexibility in schedule and draconian oversight  it'd  still  suck a whole lot  simply removing alienation from the equation doesn't suddenly make a lack of free time and to have oneself defined by one's work all that much more appealing ,hw543u

158,ive been jamming the idea of taking work-life balance seriously to my sister the past few weeks and its finally started getting into her head!,im not gonna pretend that i care about her so much that i always go telling her whats best for her since shes like 10 years older than me she can do whatever she wants but it just pisses me off how she can so willingly slave for a corporation like that   she d usually come home around 9pm willingly  and chill for a bit then go to her room at around midnight-1am and start working until she falls asleep then shes off to work at 9am again  and apparently she doesnt collect overtime or whatever as she says  it doesnt really work like that here   we live in a 3rd world country so everything is just fucked and people dont take their rights seriously i guess   i ask her if shes in a union at work and she just laughs it off and doesnt take it seriously and is probably thinking its  extreme  to be part of a union   so i kept telling her to stop working at home as its fucking idiotic like dude just fucking relax and watch a movie with me  the financial statements or whatever are still gonna be there tomorrow and if she cant meet her deadlines without working at home after midnight then the deadlines are fucked   yea so basically today at 4pm  she works from home sometimes too  cause covid  she asked to watch a movie with me and we did and started smiling at me and said  did you notice  im not working  look i dont even have my phone with me  it was nice but the best part was when she went to her room at 12 and left her laptop downstairs and was like  look im leaving the laptop  hah ,hxbvjc

170,My story on how I starter getting into relationships solely for the purpose of making my life easier as a poor person,i'm 22yo and started university late with my own money that i had made from work and investments  i come from a family where both parents have sources of income  but are barely scraping by  they could have never saved enough to send me to university sadly  but i made up for it by working passively ever since i was a teenager    i would save maybe a couple thousand each year  by the time i became an adult i took some free training courses in local institutions but still didn't have money for anything academic  i also took work more seriously by that time and started saving everything i was earning  by 20yo and also  thanks to some investments that performed somewhat i could enter in a decent collage    things were going great working in parallel wile also studying  but i gave up all work by the time studies intensified  working and studying was driving me nuts  i wanted to focus on one thing and be more relaxed  at least give my self the opportunity to also make friends    thankfully i had left enough on the side to pay off university without debt  the caveat was that i would have to live like a spartan  no eating out  no trips  no drinking  no going anywhere aside of university and generally not much unplanned spending other than maybe a beer and some coffees to drink on a public bench with friends a handful of times a month    that was around around to years ago  at the time that i left work  that had also met my now ex  who was soon to become my first serious relationship  we were together for a year and i can say that life was amazingly more comfortable while staying with her  we could order from outside and she would pay  first of all  my academic life became easier  no more spending hours without ad-block on dodgy sites for pirated textbooks anymore  she would just straight up buy two copies from the crazily marked up university library  no more begging at the university librarian to grant access to papers  she would simply buy permanent access  no need to pirate software  she had subscriptions to every useful software for our studies  anything drm locked  why spend time to pirate crack for free when it's faster to buy it  money is just a number for some after all    and there's more  we needn't take the bus anymore  she would pay for uber anywhere  she would pay for my flight tickets to take trips together and i never had to worry about booking early or spend days looking for the best price  because she would just use miles her parents had accumulated  she even paid for a subscription for both of us in the closest gym  and not the cheapest one  getting fat just a little  let's buy two bikes  that didn't work  call in the family nutritionist  gym not working  hire a personal trainer for a few days or a month  just so much time and effort saved   but more funny  is that whenever she would have an issue with 'adulting'  for example  taxes  laws and even her rights in many given situations etc  she wouldn't call her parents  but instead their house keeper  a filipino woman who  by all means  was a jack of all trades and a true genius  i remember one time my gf got an f by a professor that most probably hadn't even reviewer her paper  and instead likely had marked it as such because i had voiced opposing political beliefs with him  and was her bf  that woman friggin genius of woman  who had never graduated from a university herself  called the school's secretary  and through a series of calls managed to have the university re-evaluate the paper so my gf passed  my gf didn't have to move a finger other than make a 1 5 minutes call    other than that  my gf was extremely shallow  not a trace of character and absolutely no preferences  opinions or even hobbies aside of what i projected to her  she was smart in terms of math  physics and biology  but also very dumb socially  she could never crack a joke  understand the meaning of politics  she just couldn't grasp the political spectrum no matter what i did to explain it for example  or even make friends on her own    i wouldn't have minded staying with her for all my life  and in the long term  even if i wanted to work at some point  her parents could just directly appoint me to the company they were executives at  not that i would ever need to do work while with her  but just in case i felt like passing time there  maybe feel a little more important  while also on the payroll  this was her projected career path at least    still to this day  i genuinely believe that she took more good out of me other than anything else because i taught her way more things than a person merely looking to take advantage of her would have had  at the very least  she was taking well to advice  at least after her doing some shouting at first  i genuinely and truly loved this girl and wanted to give the best of me  but in the end we broke up because no matter what i tried she couldn't understand the importance of not having mental breakdowns at least twice a day over minuscule things  so i ended up being heartbroken  but this whole ordeal had me never wanting to return to my old lifestyle again    even since then  i've had two relationships  and i think i cracked the code to actually find gfs from rich families    1  prepare lunch home  because poor   2  go to university cafeteria to pretend-eat   3  cafeteria charges a meal 15  and 2 5  for a tiny bottle of water  no refills   4  look for girls that go there regularly to eat  water bottle included  and have never been observed talking to other males   5  talk to them    first of these two relationships lasted half a year  that one was looking equally ambitious  she had me moved in from the first week and was spending quite a bit whenever i'd whine a little  to be honest most of my subscriptions from the previous relationship were still valid so she i wouldn't ask for that much aside of recreational stuff  we ultimately had to break up because her mother told her to  apparently mamma's little princess told her parents in what ways we were fucking  because they asked  her dad was zen about it but then the mom threatened to cut her funding if we didn't separate  too bad you can't unfuck someone    now my latest relationship seems to be going smooth so far  her parents aren't mega rich like previous ones but apparently they are ok with her paying almost everything for poor me  we aren't living in the same apartment yet  thankfully i have some friends to support me in between breaks of my long con  but plan to  my worry is that her parents might end up being overprotective like the previous one because i'm seeing some signs already  like for example her telling everything to her parents throughout the relationship    at this rate i'll get to finish college with enough money to buy a car and rural flat  hopefully one of these relationships sticks and i never have to work for real again ,hyhjuo
171,If work is so fundamentally vital to my existence why does it feel so wrong?,breathing feels good  eating feels good  drinking feels good   sex feels good  all things that are the upmost importance for the survival of me and the human species but work  makes me wanna end my life everytime without fail  doesn't make sense to me  shouldn't i feel enjoyment out of it  wouldn't that be logical or maybe i'm just ideal   you could say that coming home after a long day of work feels good but it does not to me knowing i go back the next day to suffer all over  working out can be  painful but can release endorphins to make it worth it but fundamentally work just destroys me psychologically like a cancer would  if it feels so wrong how could it be such an necessary task   philosophical question i know but i guess i'm just pondering questions nobody really has answers too ,hwc0vz

188,You. Are. Fucked. (and here is why),alright boys and girls  you are all fucked  you may not realize it yet  but you are guaranteed fucked   so  the reason that you are fucked is that you are subsisting either on a wage  or you are subsisting on a fixed income  both of these are not dynamic in relation to the number of dollars in existence or even gdp  if you want to read more on that particular issue  here is an excellent link    https www epi org productivity-pay-gap https www epi org productivity-pay-gap   anyways  the fed is buying out the junk bond market  that probably sounds like arcane gibberish  and many of you probably don't even know what a bond is  a bond is like a loan  except you agree to repay the full value of the bond  the principal  plus a fixed amount  the interest  at some later date  for example  you borrow  100  but you agree to repay me  110 in one year  so  what makes a bond a junk bond  well  companies that might default that issue bonds are considered to be issuing junk bonds  for example hertz defaulted on its bonds  it went into bankruptcy  the us government gave money away to hertz bond holders to buy their bonds to prop up the company value to try to not let it default  and it defaulted anyway   but this isn't just about a stupid car rental company  this is happening across the entire market  notice the stock market going up  all that nice slushy corporate money is being used to buy back stocks  why  well  when a company goes bankrupt  they have all kinds of legal moves that they can do  including defaulting on bonds  it is free money  now  it might not make an impact on your life when the stock market rallies by 10  in 3 months  but it will make an impact when the price of food goes up 10  in 3 months  that is 40  inflation   but wait it get's worse  the stock markets valuation is grossly overinflated  even going into the pandemic  they had absolutely horrendous p e ratios and if it had a fair valuation  the prices of stocks would be 1000x lower  what happens when all that nice green cash gets dumped on main street  you  are  fucked   you really only have 1 option  you need to buy stuff  or acquire stuff that is inflation resistant  that means whatever you put your value in needs to be scarce  it should not be something that can have its supply manipulated   now certain people here are very much against cryptocurrency  that's fine  year on year it's gone up and it's gone down  but for the most part since inception it has trended up  however  you need to ask yourself if you trust your dollar  do you trust it to hold its value  even when you know the fed has injected literally trillions of dollars into the economy  and that they owe their creditors even more trillions  when you see the police acting like the police of a third world country  when canada declares the us as unsafe for asylum seekers  when the people who make our country competitive  young prodigies looking to go to college  are being turned away at the door  when every single nation is tarrifing us  and is also pointing at us out for having a less skilled response to covid than third world countries like cuba  no   the us dollar is not a safe store of value  and neither is real estate in the us  you need to get your hands on the following items gold  silver  cryptocurrency  foreign currency that won't collapse with the dollar  foreign real estate  foreign stocks of companies that do not service us customers   if you can't buy these items right now because you don't have money  think about low interest loans like mortgages  if you can service the interest cost of a loan  the depreciation of the dollar value is going to cause your goods to appreciate in value  you could buy enough gold today to afford a car with  however  in 3-4 years  that gold will be worth 10x the cost that you paid for it  and you will still be only able to buy a car with it   ok the car market might crash  but you get the idea   basically  if you take out loans now  and put the money from those loans into a diversified portfolio of goods and commodities that will not lose value when the us dollar loses value  you will do very well   on the topic of cryptos  bitcoin  ethereum  ampleforth  knc are all good choices  do your own research though  stay safe  there are many scammers  and there are many pump and dump groups  cryptos are legit  but they are the wild west   on the topic of precious metals  buy gold and silver coins  not bullion  it is illegal to adulterate coins  or to clip them  this way  you know what you are getting  1 silver dollar is always 1 silver dollar  the silver is what matters   right now  it is better to buy silver than gold  mostly cause silver is so low in price  it will pick up though ,hwlun0

192,Big Brother,my biggest complaint about working in an office environment is how you re constantly told you re an adult but never treated like a one unless you fuck up  then the problem is all yours  but  if you do everything just fine  you re still treated like a child  you re not allowed to go anywhere other than the office unless it s your rushed 30 minute lunch because they can t trust you to manage your time like an adult  you re constantly watched by bosses like they re the fucking secret police to make sure you re not  chitchatting  or doing something else that is looked down upon  you re meant to be watched like children in a day care center  stay in line  mother fucker  not to mention the passive aggressive bullshit and the inauthentic  wokeness  that seem to be a trend amongst businesses now a days    i fantasize about owning a small farm  i understand working on a farm is hard work but it s not hard work which deters me  it s lack of appreciation and subpar levels of job satisfaction that get me  i d love to eat food that i grew myself  to be outside caring for animals  though not too many because farm animals are expensive  i d especially love to be able to be around more often to teach my children and spend more time with my loved ones    maybe this is all just a childhood fantasy brought about by my frustrations with working  maybe i m just an ignorant city boy who doesn t know how good he has it  but then again  there s always the possibility that i might be right about it all    thank you very much for taking the time out of your day to read this  i wish you all well in your future ventures ,hwm37m

220,Unpaid Lunch Breaks,okay  this is probably the most privileged shit  but my first full time job was salaried and quite cushy  and i cannot get over the idea of having to clock out for a half hour lunchbreak  i could almost see if it were an hour  that's almost enough time to actually do something  but half an hour is the literal legal minimum to keep someone on their feet  it feels barely better than having to clock out to go to the bathroom to me  it's probably good because it reminds me that however  nice  the company is  whether or not it's creating profits for capitalists  it still exists to exploit labor  thanks for listening to my rant  sorry for my out of touchness in thinking anybody gets paid lunch breaks  but i'm hoping this sub will at least have a different response to this thing that i know is out of touch with american labor relations ,hvvjx2
221,The reasons houses are overinflated is to keep the masses working for longer...,imagine if house prices was only 1x your wage  would you still work 40 hours a week or would you rather just work enough to put food on the table or not work at all    houses are fucking out of proportion here in australia it's approx 10x your wages after tax    it would take a single person approx 8 years to save for a deposit provided they earn the median wage in australia and by the time they pay of their mortgage they will be 60 to 65 hence the 30 year mortgage   i honesty hope this corona virus will destroy the fucking economy and bring houses prices back to affordable prices such as 3x your income    imagine if every one in society paid of their houses  what incentive would their to work full time  ,hx1hl6
222,The absolute need for my presence,i work in a internship on ti  six hours a day  i'm from brasil and here that's pretty normal since i got to help  pay my university and other things    so covid came and i started working home for three months  i wasn't being productive because my university amped up the amount of work and it's difficulty  and my priority is stop paying that shit first  i'm not worried since there are two people in my sector and i'm the only one that messes with this code since my boss never touched it  in june they called us back  the numbers were too little and apparently controlled on my state   then my stupid president happened and the cases raised like crazy  we kept working all through june with the office with almost no one in with  the owner then sent us home by the end of june saying it was too dangerous   the cases are rising rapidly in my state  then the lady that is home since the beginning of it all says we will come back on monday  it's so dumb  our work is the same wherever  actually i'm working better since i get plus four hours without commute  meaning sleeping better  eating better and better mood  but no we need to come back  i live with my mother that is an old lady with diabetes  a dangerous case   they just want me there to see me working  but do you know what is dumb  they don't give a duck about our job  i don't have someone to go to when something happens  i have to learn by myself  and when i say something it's just ignored  it pisses me off how in their little minds it's  oh  they've got to be here to work well   i mean no  the worst of all is they wanna hire me  and okay  good i need the benefits for my father but i will have to work 44 hours a week on top of studying full time  all so maybe i can realize my biggest dream of getting out of my mom's house   there's no need for that much time of work when most of time they almost give us no job but we extend it so they don't say  why are you not working  and despite this we can't do nothing  i was once reprimanded for staying in the bathroom for too long   i usually stay there for about ten to fifteen minutes   taking to others for too long and going to the bathroom without marking i got out of labor time first    i fucking hate this world man ,hy1b99
223,Job-Hunting is a Joke!,what a fucking joke   applied for a job  got told i'd been put forward to the interview and to book my interview  only date was the morning after  today   get to the shop  and now they tell me it was a phone interview  no prior communication notifying me about this   decide to wait on a bench outside  since i wanted to do some shopping after the interview  so it didn't seem sensible to go home and come back out  or risk missing them while i was shopping   three hours later i decide to give up  do my shopping and go home  the whole time i'm checking my phone constantly to see if they're calling or have called    get home  twenty minutes later i get an email telling me they've filled the spot and not to bother waiting    waste of fucking time ,hwejhf
224,Parents pressuring me to work during the pandemic,so  my parents- bless their hearts- are hard-working doctors  my family makes a fair bit of money and so we're well off  and as such  my sister and i are quite privileged  now  they're thinking about getting my sister and i a car to share  which is fine  though i really dislike driving  in return  they want me to get a job if i take the term off from college for some reason  i'm a generally lazy person and i fucking hate effort  but i do my fair share around the house  i do the dishes  take care of the dog  clean the house  often a bit late  but it gets done  and i cook  i wouldn't consider myself the master of timeliness or cleanliness  sure  but i'm not a slug and i'm not ungrateful   here's the situation  though  i'm considering not going to in person classes for my fall term  mostly because wisconsin is garbage at keeping people safe from the coronavirus  i live in chicago  for reference  online classes are available  but i'd be taking geology online  which is sort of hard and my adhd makes focusing like that near impossible  in fact  last time i took online classes during spring term  i was probably at my worst mentally  i figured that between my asthma and coronavirus  i shouldn't go to in person classes  even if there are strict safety measures  but i also don't want to take online classes that will suck the life out of me  but wouldn't a job at a grocery store basically be as unsafe  if not more  how the hell do i tell my parents that they're insane for making me work for basically no reason  am i the shitty person here  i don't know what to do ,hwrxzo

232,Joining r/antiwork has changed my life for the better. Thank you!,-i get to work two hours before the rest of my coworkers  instead of getting right to work i just drink my coffee and read my book until the first one arrives  or shut my eyes for a bit    -i no longer respond to emails or requests immediately   -i work from home half of the week and do the bare minimum when responding to emails  i save any projects for when i am actually at work   -i get a 30 minute lunch break but usually take a full hour and again read my book  due to the way my office is set up it would be difficult for anyone to know when i am on or off lunch   -i have realized that people do not get rewarded for doing well here and more for just having an easy going personality that can look away from all the bs that happens  so i do not care whether i mess something up or seem unreliable i just say sorry i ll get right on it nobody cares    due to these factors i am usually only working or pretending to be  on  for 5ish hours a day when in office and hardly at all when at home  also boss thinks i have too much on my plate because i always seem genuinely busy because i now  work  the actual hours required to do this job so i am getting some projects taken off my plate and will have more free time to do what i want    still wish i wasn t working but it s nice to bend the system and put myself first  so much less stress trying to live up to expectations that do not matter ,hw5a41
233,Dislike for work and the desire to save money,i've noticed that the more difficult it is for me to work  a bad day  an annoying assignment  travelling for work  etc  the more i want to save as much money as realistically possible   i've noticed that when wanting to buy  i always calculate how many hours would i have to work to buy this and assess the purchase in a way of asking myself  would i want to work x amount of hours for this item   this has resulted in a situation of me deciding to buy only some of the purchases  depending on what i truly want and need  for example  i bought a beautiful french bed  with a mattress  last year  bought a new gaming laptop 2 years ago  bought some gym equipment for when i'm bored  but i've decided against buying a new car  against buying luxurious boutique items that i don't really need   because of this mentality  i am in a very lucky position to be able to survive for over a year should i be dismissed from my work  which  in the context of me just having bought my own place last year and settling in  which also cost a lot of money  is a really good situation to be on   i see the extra pound that is in my bank account as another step towards being freer than i am currently  and while it is not an ultimate solution  it is something that can be done on an individual level   what about you  do you have the urge to have some savings for psychological well-being  at least  if you are lucky enough to be in a position to be saving money  of course ,hwbcrq

238,Thoughts about depression and the idea of assisted suicide rather than ending the grind,hi  tl dr at bottom  i was just having a discussion with a friend the other day which i would love to hear your guys opinion on    i have someone dear to me who has suffered from depression for many years now and pretty much went through all medication there was and all therapists in the area and has just not improved one bit  still wants to die  something i hear often is stuff like  i just dont want to do this anymore  especially after something stressful has come up at his work  overall they share quite a few dreads with people on this sub  before i had started to wonder about countries that had assisted suicide  even for those not necessarily terminally ill  he is also in pain alot both mentally and physically  i was wondering whether it was a good thing   so thats what i asked the friend   would you support assissted suicide as an option for people who have been depressed for years   only if everything else has been tried already   but in the case i am thinking of everything  has  been tried  they did all the different therapy and stuff  and then she said   but i mean  everything  have they had the chance to not worry about work before  did they ever truly get the chance to be free of that pressure  not having to work to survive  i think that as long as the government doesnt provide a right to live they shouldnt grant the right to die first   and that i found super interesting because i have often wondererd whether he could be - even if not free of his illness - living a healthy life if there was zero pressure on him  if his basic living needs were guaranteed and there was no stigma againat not working and instead pursuing interests and focusing on self care  what do you think  if you suffer from depression  do you think it would improve if you didnt have to work  do you think that there should be a right to live before a right to die  that society cant claim they have already tried all options and are giving up if it hasnt tried this    tl dr  a friend suffers from depression and is suicidal  asking another friend about whether assistes suicide should be an option got the answer that a society without necessity to work should be tried first before that option is offered  asking for your opinion,hx9smz

268,Do you think society will reach a breaking point and reject capitalism as we know it?,i believe on some subconscious level  most people with their heads screwed on right can realize that something is horribly wrong about american society  and the world at large  we are forced to work for peanuts  given no healthcare or any kind of support from the government  and have to slave away for decades in most cases in order to afford basic necessities like owning a home  having food  heat  etc  many people realize how screwed up it is to have to work two or three jobs to survive  and how college degrees mean very little unless you have the connections   to have done unpaid internships and then land a cushy job out of college  and people also realize how scary it is that one medical issue or accident can throw off or wreck your finances and life plans    but  most people are also brainwashed by our corporate overlords  and perhaps the old protestant work ethic indigenous to the u s  into thinking that this is just  how it is  and how they should just work harder or find another job and maybe then things will be okay for them  the corporate overlords want us to be undereducated and underpaid so we won t even question the system and so we ll be  so  grateful to even have a job  no matter how little the pay or that you have to endure abuse from your employer    people are so exhausted from working however many hours that they come home and slump over in front of the tv and don t have enough time for whatever activities give them meaning outside of work  not to mention that there isn t much time to study critiques of capitalism  i think a huge reason behind why so many of us are depressed  anxious  and addicted to a myriad of things is that society constantly sends us the message that we have to be the very best and bend over backwards for an employer  and if we don t  we re lazy and worthless    many americans  including myself  are disgusted with the system and have seen themselves or other people be chewed up and spit out by the system with no appreciation  recognition  or material support  but how long will we pretend that this is just the norm    i want to see a 30 hour workweek  increasing the minimum wage to  15  ubi  and more than two weeks of vacation  thank god for the unions who fought so that we could have two days on the weekend  but two weeks is not nearly enough vacation time to recuperate from the stresses of modern life  in addition to that  we need universal healthcare and maternity paternity leave  too many politicians and ordinary people act like these things are impossible and unrealistic  when they are actually crucial to making sure life doesn t get any worse    this has been a rant  but i d also be curious to hear your thoughts  people make fun of me for constantly hating on capitalism  but the state of things under our current system enrages me so much and i don t understand why more people don t speak out about it    tl dr  do you think society will ever reach a breaking point of collective consciousness and rise up to create a better  healthier system so that life in the u s   and around the world  doesn t get any worse ,hygwpt

276,Using the ADA to unchain yourself from workslavery.,hi i'm a sketchy attorney whose favorite color is darkest gray    the problem   you're a 30 year old accountant customer service rep analyst makebelievespreadsheetjobist that dreads the monotonous hell of waking up every morning at 6am to iron your shirts  eat a whole foods burrito  jump in your car and drive an hour so you can get to work by 8 00  get patronizing glances from your boss when you actually get in at 8 10  be generally unproductive for three hours since   1  other people are dropping their work off on you since you're the only person who knows how cares to do it  and 2  you're fucking exhausted from getting little to no sleep and are generally unproductive until after lunch  at which point you squeak out the minimum amount of work to stay gainfully employed  and 3  you feel guilty because all the other people you know are struggling to get a job as good as yours  they're all working three part time jobs with no benefits  and 4   you begin to question why you need to come into work at all given you can do 100  of your job from home in your pajamas  your company is having you show up because fuck you  that's why   long before i was an attorney  i had a job like this  i spent mayyyyybe 15 hours a week doing  work  and the rest of the time was spent surfing the internet and stressing over trying to look busy for when my boss strolled over and sowhatchaworkingon'd me  i was told for years that if you just kept your head down and performed  you'd get promoted  of course  these promotions invariably went to management's lunch buddies or the female employees the bosses were cheating on their wives with   i wish i'd known i wasn't alone in my absolute contempt for my workplace  moreover  that there were ways i could have been significantly happier without quitting  finding a new job  and starting the process all over again    the law   the americans with disabilities act  ada  of 1990 is  in my opinion  the most radically transformative federal law in the last 50 years  the quick read is that the ada prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability  there are several critical sections to the ada  but today i'm only going to focus on title i  which is employment discrimination   the summary of title i is this    amp x200b    gt an employer is required to make a reasonable accommodation to the known disability of a qualified applicant or employee if it would not impose  an  undue hardship  on the operation of the employer's business     amp x200b   let's break that down     an employer - almost anyone who employs you  except for churches  international treaty organizations  e g  the un  and a couple other outliers  the exception is that for the ada to apply to an employer  the employer must employee at least 15 people    required -  not a suggestion    reasonable -  not unreasonable   see  undue hardship    accommodation - this is the fill-in-the-blank section  an employer must accommodate a disabled employee or applicant  so that they can enjoy the same benefit of employment as a non-disabled employee  for example  a blind accountant must be provided with screen reader software be allowed to bring a guide dog to work etc  a quadriplegic employee might need a big list of accommodations  basically  stick a pin in this idea for now   an employer is required by law to accommodate your disability    known - your employer is only responsible to accommodate disabilities they know about    qualified - this is the second big caveat  you have to be minimally qualified to do the job  for example  i've passed the bar exam in my state  but my sister  still a law student  hasn't  my sister cannot use the ada to secure a job as an attorney because she hasn't met the minimum qualifications for the position    undue hardship - the third and final caveat  and the place every fucking boss in the fucking world will try and hide behind  fortunately  courts and hr departments take a dim view of bosses that try and bitch about how it's  undue hardship  for you to get to work from home  that's not how this works  the law presumes that it  isn't  an undue hardship unless the accommodation requested really messes things up somehow  for example  if you were a construction worker or retail employee wanting to work from home  well  there's really no work you can do from home  if you're a spreadsheetologist  you can easily do your job from home    amp x200b    rethinking the hypothetical   let's take that 30 year old who despises his make-believe job   one of the big reasons he hates his job is because around 10 00am  he gets searing migraines that are so overwhelming he feels like he has to lie down  he doesn't take any medication  and he has no idea what's causing them   remember above where we talked about the law  we didn't discuss one critical word   disability  the ada defines disability as  a physical or mental  impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities  a person who has a history or record of such an impairment  or a person  who is perceived by others as having such an impairment   keep in mind that just because our employee has migraines doesn't mean he has a disability  the migraines are only a disability under the ada if they  substantially limit  a  major life activity  that's right  it is your job to explain what the major life activity is  in this case  we'll say that these major life activities are  concentration  self-care  self-balancing  walking  communicating  and  reading   now we've proven that the 30 year old is disabled under the ada  they are legally entitled to reasonable accommodations    reasonable accommodations   the reasonable accommodations must 1  allow the disabled employee to enjoy the same level of benefits of employment as a non-disabled employee  2  not create an undue hardship    remember  deep down  bosses despise their workslaves  they will fight you   the employer can choose between two reasonable accommodations  for example  let's say our 30 year old hypothetical employee has migraines that are caused by harsh lighting  rather than let the employee work from home  the employer can simply change the lightbulbs to be less harsh  conversely   if the employee doesn't know what's causing the migraines  changing the lightbulbs is a non-accommodation   do not give them this option   stick to your guns  if your disability can only be accommodated by working from home  explain to hr that there is no possible adjustment that can be made to the business environment  do not compromise for  fewer  migraines    the  good  use of the ada   a lot of people are simply unaware of their rights and are agonizing at a job they are qualified to do  but are miserable because of a disability  it might be something they themselves don't know they have  like add  ptsd  ocd  depression and recurring panic attacks    unfortunately  sleep apnea insomnia is the  bridge too far  plaintiffs have unsuccessfully attempted to sue their employers for not accommodating a later start time because they can't get enough sleep the night before  it's bullshit that it's not considered a disability  i know  but it's just something to be aware of    phobias have mixed results  social anxiety resulting from a traumatic event that more closely aligns with ptsd will probably be considered a disability  an irrational fear of going to work probably won't be   visit a doctor  have them give you a diagnosis and have them recommend you for accommodations  keep in mind that while doctors will recommend you for  reasonable accommodation  they're not really supposed to since a doctor can't have an opinion on whether an accommodation is reasonable or not   your letter should look like this    amp x200b    gt to whom it may concern     gt     gt mr  contingencyfees visited my offices on xx xx complaining of recurring severe headaches and dizziness  he voiced concerns that these headaches are causing a decline in his work performance because he can't control their onsets  i performed xyz tests and a ct scan to confirm that mr  contingencyfees did not have a brain tumor  cancer or other brain abscesses   it is my professional medical opinion that mr  contingencyfees suffers from chronic recurring migraine headaches     gt     gt his migraine headaches routinely limit his normal activities and can arise without warning  he has an extensive diary dating from the past nine months when he began to track his pain  there appears to be no trigger or immediate cause  but the impacts of the migraines are lessened when mr  contingencyfees is at home and can safely lie down and turn down lights without embarrassment or discomfort     gt     gt i therefore recommend that mr  contingencyfees be allowed to perform his work duties from home to the greatest extent his employer is able to accommodate him     gt     gt sincerely     gt     gt doctor nomalpractice   amp x200b    the  bad  use of the ada    i  don't  in good conscience   encourage you to fake a impossible-to-physically-diagnose disability in order to work from home   because  while it's likely  you'll never be caught   it's really unfair to all those other people who also want to work from home but aren't disabled  you know  like  if your student loans got forgiven  think about how unfair it would be to all those other people who made all their payments already   plus  it's kind of scumbag behavior  right  having to pretend you have a disability so you can make your life substantially better  think about how unfair that would be to your boss and your workplace  you're basically stealing from your company   there are just so many people that would be hurt by you faking an impossible-to-diagnose-disability to get out of work  i can't even think of who those people might be because there are so many of them   it's also just bad  jesus would be so fucking pissed at you   if everyone did it  no one would be a wageslave and how sad would that be  who would be there to deliver my amazon packages   most businesses couldn't survive if everyone suddenly started working from home  involuntary cough   don't do it    amp x200b    conclusion   i hope this was a worthwhile read   wheres the tl dr  this whole post is a tl dr of a massive amount of disability law  law is purposefully confusing so that normal people don't understand what their rights are  cynical take  i know  but i worked in defense for a while  i guess the tl dr is go hire an attorney to do your reading for you  alternatively  save your money and do your own research because holy shit attorneys are expensive ,hw0thr

286,Protest/Movement for Labor rights,starting a protest movement for labor rights  hello everyone how s everyone handling those couple weeks   i imagine that most from this community agree that the labor policies works against the american people and fighting for it was never in our american mind  since the us being the epitome of capitalism for the world    we have almost no policies regarding mandatory overtime  vacation time and sick leave  looking for more options such as unions are 100  frowned upon and can get you fired instantly  not only that  most of the time the employee have 0 resources to work against the employer  since he won t have time  having to work more than 40 hours a week  or money to last litigation for that long    since money and time is short from the average american it is hard to  just find a better job  and because of it  most of us are scared to go to er in case of emergency for our problems since it is hard to get a good job with medical insurance  besides all that i have to remember everyone that this is the country with the highest gdp in 2019 and our  essential  workers are getting paid in pennies    after seeing and participating in the blm my heart pounded and i realize this is the time to fight for our rights  the only reason we don t it is because of this exact system which make us tired and frightened that we have to work no matter what or we will become homeless  for me and many other americans the american dream is not unregulated consumption but freedom and companionship with others in this country  the same country in which it is putting the life of our kids and teachers in danger  the same country in which leads the cases for the covid-19  i am not even going to touch about ilegal immigration since it is a sensitive topic   i think we should start a movement  workplace freedom  and that it should be taken to the streets  i would fight and die for this cause  this comes from someone that isn t lazy  i work hard  i like to make my coworkers and managers proud  i am proud in every place that i work  and even more happy when appreciated  everyone is threatened with poverty and we are tired of it   ps  i copied my original post because i think people from this sub might find useful,htgzv8

293,I decided not to do anything on my job today.,hi  i am at my desk right now  and i just decided to browse reddit and do nothing for the rest of the day   usually my job consists of working from 8 am to 4 pm with just a few minutes to have lunch  and when i'm at my desk i work nonstop  this part is ok  not much to complain   and then theres the clients  many of them are rude  i can't understand why someone thinks it's ok to be rude to someone who doesn't own the company  i am doing my best to help them  but they seem to enjoy mistreating people  my boss is a very unreasonable person  he has this habit of telling us to do something  and then  a few days later  complain for us doing the very thing he ordered us to do   when we tell him that some client is rude  or treats us badly he says that we need to keep in mind that the client is paying our salary  and we should keep our head down and not say anything  the funny part is that he owns the company  so it makes sense for him to say that  because it isn't any client that pays me  it's him  and his property keeps growing in value  while the workers have to endure shitty clients  minimum wage  unpaid extra hours and rage bursts and absurd requests from my boss ,hunx4r
294,My relationship with work,for the last year and a half i've been working at an auto parts warehouse  my job is normally just stocking however on busy days somtimes they get me building orders for stores  picking  i hate doing both of these things especially picking and i don't know why both tasks are beyond easy i even get to listen to my own music but still every second of it is mental agony   my co workers are by far the worst part of the job  i just want to go there listen to my music do my job then go home  all they talk about all day is sports and alcohol which for someone like me is literal torture  imagine being locked up for 8 hours a day with people listening to them go on about a topic you hate and a substance you worked hard at to kick  there is one guy there even when i ignore him he just keeps talking i will walk away and come back and the loser is just still going on about whatever   now one thing too and i'm not sure if i'm alone with this mindset or not  but i can't force myself to care about my job which has become a big problem for me  whether it's a manager or not they will be explaining somthing to me about the job and it makes me want to scream at them because they are standing there thinking i actually give a fuck if the company loses money customers and it just makes me mad for so many reasons  like first off why do these people care so much for a company that would throw them away first chance they got  secondly why do they think i should care  it really does drive me crazy i can't force myself to care and as long as i'm not the worst person at my job there i'm happy with what i put in god forbid i'm honest about that fact though   since i was a teenager i'm 23 now i've wanted to drive for a living i thought it seemed easy and you don't have co workers  well turns out the place i work was hiring a part time truck driver so i inquired about it and got the job this was just a couple weeks ago  did the job for about a week and a half they said i was doing a really good job and i was either early or right on time everyday for the deliveries  last wednesday night when i was finishing up my last load i don't know it all just kind of hit me at once that i wasn't happy driving either and no other jobs sound appealing like i literally dont want to work any job and when i realized this i just started sobbing because it's like what do i do  how do i trick my brain into being happy at a place that brings me to tears  my entire day while working is just a mental battle with myself to force myself not to cry    i just find it really depressing because i dont see any answers or ways around working  if i was feeling this way because of a relationship everyone would tell me to leave the girl  if i left work everyone would just judge me for not working and my quality of life would go down so what are really my options  i haven't been to work since last wednesday i had kind of a breakdown we will call it ,hv7ntn

298,showethought: job dependency is gov't dependency w/ extra steps, thesis  many conservatives will say that working and having a job is glorious as it's not  dependency on the goobeermint  but is dependency on a job any better     1  dependency on a job just means you're even more in trouble and under water  as you have to adhere to how coercive the power-structures in your job are   noam chomsky says something similar about how  while we may live in a freemarket mixed market  crapitalist society  corporations technically often operate as planned command-economies  he makes some really interesting points on that  i'd advise looking into him     2  but- depending on how big the job is  like a corporation  for example  they get subsidies and bailouts from  uh-oh  that's right  the gov't  these jobs are therefore funded and dependent off the gov't  and if you work for them  you are  indirectly a-few-steps-down-the-line dependent off the gov't     3  another fact  gov't prints money  obvi  and to start a business  one need pull out a loan  the loan  that the gov't printed out the money for  for them to pull out     conc  in conclusion  a job is just dependency off the gov't with extra steps  it's not more glorious than  unearned  living  hate that term  like ubi or welfare ,hurqnr

308,The Internet's role in ending work,the internet is  neat  because it acts as network of direct access between  almost  every human consciousness on the planet - it is  in a way  human connection manifested - it is collectivism    i can hardly think of a better vessel for spreading class consciousness  for example   the printing press allowed for the production and spread of information on a level never seen before  and its influence on our current collective conditions cannot be understated  it created a whole new set of potentials and possibilities that did not and could not have existed before it   i think the internet has a similar function but on a grander scale - now information can be spread nearly instantly and constantly  but the total amount of information at our disposal is increasing exponentially  to the point of absurdity  we can already see the dangers of this 'wealth of information' in the form of dis-information and the difficulty people have in determining what is true from what isn't - in a sense that determination is not based on any external reality  but only our own internal assumptions and biases    seeing isn't really believing - believing is seeing   think about livestreaming - it in a sense has allowed for a destruction of the 9-5 white or blue-collar grind - theoretically  you can point your camera at yourself and turn that in to value  and lots of it - this allows for the commodification of the self in the form of branding a personality and selling it for consumption   but in that branding you can turn your hobby  in  to the same thing as the 9-5 grind  or maybe something even worse   streamers can conjure money out of thin air purely by acting as vessels for advertisement - their value is not solely based on their community  but on their community and the possibility for it to be influenced and sold something else - lots of something else's   the internet is weird because we can have this conversation while still being separated by vast distances - it's almost like a rudimentary kind of telepathy between totally separate and distinct people - so are we actually separate and distinct or is that just the surface appearance   any thoughts ,ht8s5j

326,Today I realized my work embedded me with a toxic relationship with money,i used to feel like  if i didn't finish a day of work either mentally or physically exhausted  then i didn't  earn  my money  i took a temp job doing some environmental rejuvenation and it didn't make me feel physically or mentally stressed  and therefore the good money i was being paid gave me imposter's syndrome  like the work wasn't worth that much  but then i had an epiphany  that every commercial job i've had made me do something morally reprehensible or totally exploitative  or cheap  and the only reason i felt like i was being paid too much was because i wasn't used to being treated fairly    it was only  30 an hour  and i left feeling satisfied  like i had done some reasonable effort for a meaningful cause  and that is what work should feel like  and the money is still well deserved ,hv4h2m

330,I'm just playing the game,in capitalism  it's the goal of the company to make as much money as possible while spending as little as possible  even the most  generous  companies fall under this as the  generous  reputation is an investment the helps with worker retention  driving down hiring training costs  pay workers too much give too many benifits and you see diminishing returns  too little and they quit and the company needs to spend money on hiring and training  that's why service workers get paid so little and have no benifits  they are cheaper to replace  so the company won't invest to try and convince them to stay    by the same logic  it is the goal of the workers to put in the bare minimum amount of time and effort to maintain their career trajectory  too little effort and they can be fired  too much and best case scenario is they get  recognized  for it and promoted  but in general they will just end up under appreciated and under compensated     in my line of work  technical field  it's common for management to not notice the difference between hard work and minimum effort  between good results and bad  because they have no idea what we do  so why  when the difference doesn't matter  should i give my 100  i'm just playing by the same rules they do ,hvd1ro
331,this sub is better than therapy,honestly i am so so so so so so so so so so mad at the thought that therapy itself is always about getting me back to being able to be a productive functional member of society  i am just a regular person with a lot of trauma   the society is hella dysfunctional   like when they say  here's how to fight through depression and keep going   like maybe we are just supposed to all be very depressed and not be all keeping on going  but that's not an option  so we all have all these individual mental health issues that lead back to so much trauma and horribleness living in this unnatural way  i also just really like calling out the abusive system  because i have so many friends who for some reason cannot call it out or see it as bad and it makes me furious   anyways  thank you to this sub for existing  it affirms my humanity more than regular therapy type stuff ,huklte

380,An Anecdote about a Mistake,i was thinking about this recently and it bummed me out so i figured i'd share haha  it was january of 2015  i had just graduated college in december and was on the job hunt   i had a good long-term friend reach out to me and ask if i wanted to go on a tour with him and his band - they needed a fill-in bass player for a 1 month tour down the east coast   for some pretext - i played bass in a bunch of high school bands  did a lot of shows back in the day and i was actually at one point in a band with this dude   these guys weren't a big band  and we would be driving around in a not great  but not terrible  van  most likely sleeping in the van a lot of nights  probably not much food either  but we'd be playing music together and hanging out and checking out a bunch of states   regardless  i thought about it  and i ended up turning it down because i had just graduated and didn't want a gap between me graduating and me actually getting a job   fast forward a month  and i had still not found anything  actually  i didn't get a job until march  a month after they already returned  i remember looking on social media during that month they were gone and seeing all the cool shows and pictures with fans people and cool locations  they looked like they had a blast and were just making people happy by playing their music   i was honestly so bummed i didn't say yes to the experience  all because i was worried about something stupid like a  gap  in my resume  even if i did find work while they were still on tour  i would have preferred being with them anyway   i don't really have a point to this  just wanted to share a story  i guess if you have the opportunity to do something cool like that  don't pass it up due to corporate values ,htu78k

404,Losing Faith in My Profession..,tldr  sick of working for greedy ass attorneys and being undervalued as an employee  sick of the burnout of the industry in exchange for menial wages  thinking of changing my career  but not super confident about what i d do or where i could find work in this economy   i have been a paralegal for the last 7 years  only ever worked for really awful  selfish attorneys who pay their employees like shit  even worked for one firm that paid their newly barred attorneys less than some of their staff  finally got in the door with what i first perceived to be a great firm that paid me well enough to thrive and had a pretty chill work environment - but they hired me under false pretenses  said i d be filling in for someone on an extended maternity leave and then would shift my job duties a bit but remain on their staff after she returned  then laid me off after she returned from leave    due to being unemployed for a couple of months i felt i needed to accept a job offer when it finally came  of course  it came with an 800  a month pay cut to what i was making at the last job that fucked me over  this new job i ve had almost a year  they originally offered me a whopping 18 hour - not at all competitive for my profession and level of experience in my area  like i said though i was unemployed so i needed to take something  i countered their offer and they ended up coming up a bit    so after working there 90 days i was eligible for health benefits  which they said extended to dependents only  but not my spouse  however  their new hire paperwork stated that was not true  shady as fuck  anyway  they ended up splitting the cost of my spouse s health insurance with me after i asked if there was some mistake    my boss  the guy whose name is in the name of the firm  has a terrible temper and will go off on people if he even misunderstands something to be wrong when it s not  during the quarantine we didn t have the luxury of keeping this abuse within the confines of our offices - instead he would just do it on our daily conference calls with the whole office present  i cannot go into work just to be anxiously avoiding the boss every single day  who the fuck is motivated by that    this firm underpaying me and favoring others  pretty much the rest of our small office  who have long standing personal relationships with the boss is already stressful and depressing  it makes it worse since i have billable hours and i know what our clients are billed for my time i can really see how much money i bring into the firm  only to make so little that i can barely afford to live in a shitty apartment in the ghetto    during the first month of lockdown we laid off three people  1 full time employee and two part timers  saving the company an easy 60k year plus the cost of health care any everything else  since all of our clients are insurance companies our income hasn t really been affected at all    due to the layoffs  my workload has more than doubled   they didn t lay-off any attorneys of course  meaning nobody else s workload increased but mine  i m expendable as usual  i have been billing above and beyond my quota consistently  and even more so after the layoffs  i am bringing in about 10-20k extra a month more than my quota calls for  meanwhile  boss man still owns his three cars  pays his monthly dues to the most exclusive and expensive country club in the area  and all the other luxuries he is afforded in part due to my labor    as of memorial day apparently i will not be receiving paid holidays any longer  this of course was done without any warning or even informing me  i found out when the deposit hit my account  does my boss really think he needs that  200 more than i do  so disrespectful and dishonest  and this was no mistake because i have to fill out my time card on paper and my hr manager enters the payroll  literally still haven t said anything about it to me    i m beyond over being treated like shit  i feel so disheartened by the entire legal industry  i ve worked for nothing but selfish attorneys just out to fuck their own employees out of money  this month i will be hitting my quota and nothing more  i m tired of busting my ass for nothing    thinking of a career change  but no idea what i d do  i don t really have any other skills besides writing  research  analytics  and organization  only dream i had before was to be an attorney  but between the student loans  time spent on graduate school  my experience working for with attorneys  and the collapsing economy i think i ve decided against it ,hts6oq

406,Sick of being heavily medicated because having ADHD and not being a morning person = depressed from feeling like a square peg forced into a round hole.,i am stuck in a vicious cycle where i need to take melatonin to sleep at night because i am a wolf sleep chronotype with adhd that needs to take dexamphetamine make myself robotic enough to concentrate on mundane tasks for 8 hours a day and then i wake up and take the dexamphetamine because i had to knock myself out with the melatonin and then you get the idea  basically  i have to take medication to make my body behave unnaturally    oh and the whole concept of my 40 hour working life makes me so miserable i have to take citalopram which makes it really fucking hard to cum when i have sex use my vibrator  so i basically have to give up all sexual enjoyment because it is either that or crying all the time about how life sucks and being depressed  this is fucking bullshit  i wouldn't be depressed if i didn't have to be a wage slave   if i didn't have to spend my life on the hamster wheel and could sleep when my body wanted to sleep and do things at the time my body best concentrates  i wouldn't need this fucking medication cocktail that i don't ever see myself getting off until i retire  i feel like i'm being forced to live in a way totally wrong for me and that's why i'm stuck on meds  it sucks ,hui273
407,The loneliness of being antiwork,dae feel like they have no one else irl that share their antiwork views  i was talking to some friends about the concept of fire with some friends the other day  and their first thought was literally  early retirement sounds boring  i'd rather work  i just can't relate to that and it's honestly so frustrating that people are conditioned to think work is good and that if you hate work you're just lazy and deficient in some way  though in fairness i can't deny the lazy part  so do you guys talk about being antiwork to people irl or try to convert people to antiwork  if so  have you had any success  and how do you do it ,hsvori
408,Am I suppose to kill myself if I don't want to work a 9 to 5 job?,i'm honestly considering suicide as an option to escape working the rest of my life  i don't feel suicidal and want to keep living to enjoy what i love such as hiking  fishing  video games etc  but i never have time in the day and i'm always tired after work to do anything  i basically just spend my weekends catching up on sleep and doing other responsibilities  everything seems to repetitive to me now  when i was kid it felt like life was an adventure and i was learning and doing new things all the time  i just want to live life on a farm with me and my future husband and dog  maybe have a kid eventually and not have to walk into a soulless corporate office everyday  i'm still in my 20s and imagining myself doing this the rest of my life is absolutely soul crushing  i just want to escape so badly from all this stress  anyone else feel the same way ,hsl1ce

410,Going back to work after three months of quarantine.,i have to preface this by saying that i recognize that the circumstances of my time off are unique and not everyone was given this chance to stay safe at home during all of this  i'm not making this post to brag   in about two hours  i'll be starting my first shift since being laid off due to the state's stay at home order  which is still in effect until august 1   i work in auto parts  i hated this job before i got laid off  it made me miserable  it's an overwhelmingly toxic environment and the work isn't meaningful whatsoever  there are a lot of factors that go into why i'm stuck in this job  but that isn't the focus of why i'm writing   these last three months have been far from a vacation  my wife and i had our first son near the end of last year  and parenting is more than a full-time job with him  on top of that  we wound up getting quarantined with my sister and her two kids  under 10 years old  she was switching houses since she got a new job  but the quarantine put a lid on that  she wasn't able to start work  so she couldn't move into her new place  i effectively became a parenting figure to her two kids  it has been a full house   despite not being able to sleep during these last few months  having to now parent three children instead of just my son  and juggling keeping the house in order with entertaining two preteens with cabin fever  i have been so unbelievably happy   having the ability to see hold interact with my son whenever i want  being able to dedicate real time to home improvement projects  helping my nephew with his distance-learning classes  these are all  jobs  that have felt more meaningful than anything i've done since entering the workforce at 16  going to bed tired every day because i'm taking part in what's happening around my home feels so much different than going to bed tired because i've been dealing with shitty people all day   it's not like i could have used this time to get into a different job  no one is hiring right now  i did get the ball rolling on some college classes to work towards a degree that i abandoned when i was younger  so that  maybe eventually  i can move on to something different  but classes don't start til the fall  no matter what  i'm stuck where i am for now   i'm just heartbroken that now i have to go back to a job that i hate  to a boss that doesn't recognize the work i do  working with people i don't like  and dealing with the general public who treats me like dog shit because i work in the automotive industry  i can't believe the amount of time that i will be away from my wife and son  that i won't be able to hold either of them whenever i want   there isn't really a solution here  i'm not delusional  i know no one is going to pay me to stay at home and take care of my family  i won't magically luck into more meaningful work  it's not that easy  and the constant rhetoric of  work a job you love  doesn't make it any easier  eventually i will get into a line of work that i enjoy  one that won't make me end every day feeling like i'm wasting my life  but for now   fuck   if nothing else  my experience should serve as an argument for paid paternity leave  i got the opportunity to fully take part in my son's growing up for the past 90 days  the fact that it took a quarantine to allow me to do that is borderline sickening   i just cannot believe how distraught i am   i think that's all i've got  thanks for listening ,hqgfnf

412,"And it's go boys go, they time your every breath...",tl dr  dutch situation and a guy almost losing his arm in a steel mill    title comes from a song that perfectly describes the daily working conditions here   the chemical worker's song  by great big sea   https www youtube com watch v edaxujkev1i   last year i graduated college as a mechanical engineer  title and all  the first boring half year afterward was spent cad-drawing specialized depth-variable swimming pools for the filthy rich  because i needed a job fast or risk being homeless  this paid a whopping 2100  per month after taxes  sounds like a lot  until you realize the average rent for a normal apartment here is now about 1200  in the free sector  unless you want to commute 3 hours per day  a tank of gas is 60  mandatory health insurance is 120  etc  etc you get the point  there is social housing where you pay 600-ish per month  but the waiting lists for that can be 20 years    so i decided to look around for greener grass  and came to work at the country's only city sized steel mill as an installation manager    the wages are much better at about 3k  per month after taxes  that also immediately means the dutch tax service wants me to pay back 600 month for the next year due to creative calculation of the assistance i received over the past year  but that's a different story of how the government works here  spoiler  kafka would be proud     but the working conditions for the guys on the floor  holy  shit  i'm lucky to spend 85  of my time doing office work and meetings  it's dark  loud  filthy  cold and outright dangerous  last week  a guy in the section of the factory that i am responsible for had his arm and part of his leg hit from a water hose due to human error  doesn't sound bad  except this water hose had about 500 bar  7250 psi  of pressure on it  almost cut clean through his arm and part of his leg  his colleague saved his life by applying a tourniquet  and all the bosses said to me was  well aren't you lucky that you just started  and it was someone from an outside company  so this is in no way your fault or ours  dude  a man almost died of blood loss and might lose his arm  this happend in my part of the installation  the fuck  the same happened when a colleague opened a supposedly empty material bunker  and got an eye full of magnesium dust for his troubles  the reaction   should've worn the new fully enclosed safety glasses   that's just the working conditions here  but there's so  so much more i could say about the state of europe and especially the netherlands at the moment for some of the americans that dream of coming here     basically it boils down to the fact that there are different massive problems  like the enormous tax pressure on native dutch people  not for big companies or expats  which is why we are swamped with expats and investment firms buying up all the houses and driving prices to insane levels  think 500k  for a normal terraced house in and around large cities  but the impossibility of being paid liveable wages and the top 1  hoarding what they can are still very much the same ,hqwarq

415,Entitlement of the upper management,last year  in 2019  i had to do an unpaid internship for around 8 months to get into a company  i know that's degrading  but i had no other choice  i was shifting careers after dropping out of my masters due to a mental health breakdown and in india where i live  that was the only way i have to shift careers   now here comes the entitlement i want to speak about  after those 8 months  the cto had a chat with me 4-5 weeks after i expressed interest in a full time position  and get this  he tells me that i have the skills but since their company develops data solutions  i need to be able to come up with real world problems that my skills can be applied to   i was fuming  isn't it the upper management's job to get contracts from other businesses whose problems they want to solve and then tell us that this is the problem  now solve it  this guy was sitting there  asking me to do that complete process  his fucking entitlement was something to see   luckily  unfortunately in hindsight  i thought about a potential problem and laid it to him  and made some progress solving it  after which i was hired   now  7 months into the job  i hate it  i absolutely despise it with every fibre of my being  it turns out that the upper management really is incapable of bringing in projects and contracts from other businesses  i am working on a dead end project now and that cto is taking out his frustrations on me by saying shit like i need to communicate more and be more social with my co workers   i have been applying to jobs since 3 months now  must have sent around 1000  applications  have had 4-5 interviews that went till the final stage but no results   i absolutely despise being a wage slave in the current system but that's all i can do   thanks for reading my experience ,hq55rx
416,Your life as a worker starts a few days after you are born,in most countries  only a few days after birth  mothers are pressured to dump their kids off at daycares so they can continue working due to financial pressures and lack of benefits for new moms   this teaches the toddler  at a very impressionable young age  that they are not as important as they thought as individuals  it leaves a strong impression on the toddler that the most important person in his life  the mother who birthed him and nurses him  has more important shit to do than nurse him  unlike every mammal on earth  humans  think they are too good to nurse their own young  they feed them the fish-flakes equivalent of mother's milk  a fake mix of cow's milk powders and vitamins  every study on earth has shown that formula is not as good as natural human breastmilk for babies  but the ceo's and company owners of the world have convinced us others  they have used their power to convince us to abandon our own children to strangers care  and let our breasts dry off to be useless  all that so we can continue being workers and working hard and contributing to our owners  then starts school   where we will be ritualistically imprisoned every day in an indoor forced training facility school to condition us to get up early against our will and sit on a bus against our will to sit in a closed building all day against our will being told how to think and what to do and how to speak every day  to prepare us for a lifetime of forced servitude work as adults  this is how we are forced to spend all of our  free  lives  no matter what part of the world you live in  and retirement at 65  a third of us dont even live to 65  and out of those that do  only a quarter or so are free of serious health problems and pain at that age  it's like playing the lottery  but the way employers and companies sell these  retirement packages  and deals and pensions  most of those people will never see it   we just slave our lives away  and then  nothing  there goes the only existence we have  and it is taken away from us generation after generation  voluntarily  we sell our days away for money  but you can never buy those young healthy pain-free days back  no matter how much money we made   but yet we still teach kids from a very early age that this is whats best for them and the world  but it is not  it is only whats best for ceos and billionaires who need people to work to buy their crap and rent their condos and they need workers to make them money      your life as a worker started a lot earlier than you realized ,hqt14d

421,Here is a 3-pronged strategy for a meaningfully better future,1  short term -  2 months  - stop the devos trump death march  the main reason trump and betsy devos want to send thousands of children and teachers to their deaths  and thousands of others via community spread  in the fall is to maintain a social order in which most people are just chattel  i e   human capital stock  for oligarchs and an oligarchic system   if the human cattle have too much free time and energy to think  they might start getting ideas about freedom from their enslavement to our oligarchic system   better to force march them to their deaths in the thousands to maintain the status quo     if there was ever a time for aggressive civil disobedience  it's in ignoring and protesting the devos trump death march orders   conservatively estimated  over 140 000 americans have already died under trump  and that could easily be hundreds of thousands more if the devos trump death march goes forward   children and teachers will die and spread the virus throughout their homes and communities     if the devos trump death march goes forward  there should be general strike to stop it     stop the needless mass deaths before the community spread grows exponentially   2  medium term -  2-6 years  turn the senate meaningfully blue  in order to change the country meaningfully long term  we have to take control of the senate  which disproportionately gives power to sparsely populated red states     we should turn the sparse populations of the red states to our advantage by flooding them with civilized blue state people     if you have or can get a job that can be done remotely  and maybe even if you don't  if you want cheaper housing than can be found in desirable blue states cities  and if you would like living in a functional country and a habitable planet  consider moving to one of the dakotas to help turn them blue   it's already happening to texas to some extent  and it's certainly possible with the dakotas as well   with a more permanent 60  member majority in the senate  a much more progressive agenda on climate change  healthcare  and economic justice freedom would then be possible     3  long term -  4-12 years  shorten the full time work week to create a permanent foothold for future labor victories   in any war  including a class war  it is important to win permanent victories that make further victories possible     the working and middle classes need to claw back the last 80  years of economic and technological progress by implementing a 4 day  32 hour work week   this would spread the available work around better  give people additional time to organize  educate themselves  build up their communities  prevent and adapt to climate change  connect with their families and friends and brothers and sisters in solidarity  and enjoy life  which has gone off the rails under the hellscape the oligarchs have forced humanity into   if we stand in solidarity and fight  we can have a brighter future  a habitable planet  and a functional country without needless mass casualties  without living under a brutal oligarchic political and economic regime  and with a much greater degree of liberty and justice for all ,hr0i36

423,Is being a wageslave no longer a really viable way to actually make money?,lets face it  being a wageslave sucks ass  unless you're in something like high finance  biglaw  medicine etc  aka for the top 5  of people  you 're probably in a shitty job that doesn't compensate you enough compared to the hours pain and effort put into it  with constant rising expenses  increased rental payments and of course inflation  it seems like you are losing out more each year  not to mention there are less and less jobs but more and more people  that means the workers bargaining power is getting squeezed out every year  oh and i haven't even mentioned student loans if thats applicable to you  i was wondering why so many are trying to go intro crypto  robin hood  dropshipping  streaming  ig-ing etc  i thought its coz they were impatient lazy fucks who felt like they were too good to get a job and wanted an easy way out   but as i get older  i realized late capitalism doesn't fucking work  doing stuff the  right  way doesn't seem very good at even getting you a comfortable living  look how many people are having dead end jobs and still can't even pay their fucking rent  even when covid19 is over  the root problems are still gonna be there   how many rich people actually got rich by working anyway  if i bought btc 10 years ago and held on  i would be able to retire already  thats right  i don't contribute any damn value buying some internet coins but somehow i will have more money than several wageslaves combined  i will have my own house  own steady income from using the money to purchase dividends stock  own schedule etc  all of this defies the traditional way of thinking to work for my living  but i don't give a fuck  i'm not here coz i wanna work  i'm here coz i wanna have money to survive   realistically i don't expect to be like that and make it big  but i can see why people still try these methods  because its a great source of additional income on the side especially if you are successful with it  i think in today's world  you have to go to these sort of things just to even get a comfortable living   most people still try the traditional way because they are scared stuff that isn't  traditional  will blow up in their face  i thought the same but like i said  in today's world i can't even see the traditional way working alone   btw you don't even need to be a radical early adopter to make some good bucks on the side  tesla was 500 in april and is 1500 now  if you put some money in it through an educated guess  you would have made some good side profit  maybe could even be worth several months salary for way less work   i guess what i'm trying to say is i used to look down on all those  gamblers  and people trying to find  another way  to make a living  but now i realize why they do it  i kept thinking i wouldn't be just another struggling  wageslave  but lo here i am ,hr47i6

445,I got fired from my office job this morning. It made me realize corporations treat customers the same way they treat employees. (Long Rant),i had been working this boring office job for about a year now  we're just like any other business  we provide a service  for the most part i liked this job  easy work  decent pay  it had the occasional office politics which i stayed out of  most of the time i came in  did my 9-5  and left  easy as that    the thing i enjoyed most was working with my customers  or as we're supposed to call them  clients  i was responsible for bringing in new clients and getting them into our system  with phones ringing all day  we were supposed to bring in 80-100 calls each per day  with no call going over 5-10 minutes  the service we provide can range from  100- 500 per year  now look  if i'm paying as much as  500 per year on anything  i want the full rundown  i want to know what i'm paying for  what that gives me  everything  i'd want every single detail  as did every single client that called in  the issue is you can't do that in 5-10 minutes  and it always leads to clients calling back unhappy  confused  or simply wanting to cancel   me  i did everything i could for my clients  i'd answer everything question  concern  anything and everything  wasn't good enough for my boss as my calls lasted anywhere from 20-30 minutes  cause guess what  i cared about these people  and they deserve a good damn service if it's up to  500 a year  so i was only doing maybe 30-40 calls a day versus the 80-100 we're supposed to do   now you could say yeah  you only got half the clients you we're supposed to get  the thing is we have a satisfaction grade every week  the average you're supposed to have is around 85  now i don't mean to blow my own horn here  but i was bringing in an average of 92-95  for weeks  i felt like i was hitting home runs every week till this morning   i get the call this morning saying i'm being let go for poor performance  as i'm not taking a correct number of calls a day  and it's been an  issue  for a while  i realized today that even customers are just   signs to ceos and your boss  funny thing is my wages have stayed the same since i started  while my supervisor and boss always go on about their bonus checks and raises  my satisfaction grade meant nothing this entire time  all it meant was i'm bringing in half the pay for my boss   i'll miss my clients and i feel for them as i feel only a few of us actually cared for them  and focused on them versus focusing on the number of calls  corporations don't care about their employees  and i now realize they don't give two shits about their customers either   tldr  got fired today for spending too much time helping customers with their service,hrrgbc

486,Double the salary and cut the work week in half,this would make people a lot less disenfranchised with the system   working hundreds of hours a month  many of whom are still living in poverty while doing so  is such a ridiculous notion to me--especially when there are like 3 or 4 families that own the vast majority of the entire country's wealth   how in the world is this acceptable ,hra342
487,I wish it was easier to be poor,i don t mean that i wish for it to be easier to get out of being poor  but that i wish being poor could be evaluated as a genuine choice for how to live   so much focus is always placed on middle income earners and  how to achieve  that goal  but i personally am really happy being poor and i don t really want to do the work that s required to not be poor  i m perfectly happy doing what i have to to maintain my lifestyle   there s some benefits i obtain from being young  late 20s  and in good health  and i recognize that being poor is significantly less tenable with regular medical bills and the like  medicare for all is one of those policies that really excites me because it would benefit my lifestyle dramatically without demanding i change what i do  i just recently read about biden s healthcare proposal and it s something that would also have a ginormous impact on my life for the better  it s not m4a  but damn it has me hyped   i just sometimes i listen to my friends talk about their accountants and others talk about how they maintain their businesses and i m just like that isn t for me  in more superficial ways  i don t buy books from amazon  i like my local library  i don t go to a gym  i go for a run at the park and utilize the ymca  in better times than covid times  i mean  i don t like spending my time working  so i work less and spend less so i have less and it makes me happy   why does liking a simple life equate to deserving less respect  to sum it all up again  i wish being poor was a choice and i wish it was easier to be poor for those of us who make that choice ,hrj0nm

490,"Self-worth tied to productivity at work, need help",a major reason why i am anti-work is that after years of being in intensely competitive schooling and university environment  in india  which frequently used to fill me with despair  i have internalized the feeling of my self-worth being tied to my productivity at work  or school earlier  i am sick of these expectations that always keep rising  while my salary stays the same  in fact  even if my salary were to hypothetically increase with the expectations  i would still be just as sick of it   how do you handle expectations at work  my mental health has been torn to shreds by expectations at university and now at work  i want to  and i do slack off and do just enough work that matches the salary i receive  yet when management tells me about my decreasing productivity  my sense of self-worth takes a nose dive off a cliff      how do you decouple your sense of self-worth from productivity at work     i have tried to focus on my hobbies like gaming and reading novels but it's just a stopgap measure for me because as soon as i am reminded of my low productivity with increased expectations  my self-worth takes a hit and disappears     a major part of the reason behind this might be my declining mental health which is directly tied to my productivity  fuck  i hate that word  at work and school due to years of being indoctrinated by a system which demands increased productivity honed by developing a competitive spirit  with the huge population of india  that's the only way to get just your pinky toe  not even the foot  inside the door of getting a job  no execution of labor laws here  with decreasing compensation for the same and i have no words to express how much i despise it      i am going to reach a breaking point soon with these rising expectations and i just don't know how to handle it nor how to decouple my self worth from work       sorry if my post was all over the place ,hsahgl
491,What is the absolute worst job you ever had?,back in 2006 i worked as a corrections officer in a medium security prison for  8 25 per hour  a laughable wage for the job being asked of me  but it gets worse  i was in the first class when the state decided to privatize the prison  the state officers that had worked there were making something like  17 per hour   this place legit had something like 300  employee turnover on an annual basis  entire classes of new officers would disappear within 2 weeks of finishing training  they just stopped showing up for their shifts   the shifts were 8 hours  during which you only got 1 15 minute break  no lunch  at the end of your shift you might not get to go home  they had what was called  mandatory overtime  you would literally get locked into whatever part of the prison you were working in  central control would disable the locks on the exit doors in your sector so you couldn't leave  to further prevent you from leaving nobody came to relieve you for a break in your subsequent shifts  once i worked 32 hours straight with 1 15 minute break about 3 hours into my first 8 hour shift   you would think that with all these hours worked you'd get a fat paycheck even at  8 25 per hour  you'd be wrong  only 10 hours of overtime per pay period was paid at time and a half  the rest was given to you as  comp time  which was paid time off you could take in the future  except nobody ever was able to take it  they were so chronically short staffed no request was ever approved   the fuckery didn't end there  at the end of your employment you didn't get paid for the comp time unless you were in a very narrow set of circumstances  they wouldn't pay out your comp time if you voluntary quit or were fired for cause  the only way you could really collect that comp time money is if you were 100  disabled on the job and being let go for medical reasons   this place was hell  since it was a private  for profit prison everything that didn't keep the inmates alive was cut  to make the shareholders richer  the library was closed to save money by firing the staff that worked there  the chaplain was fired  so no religious services  they closed the inmate workshop  education  the garden  gym  everything  these inmates were locked up all day with nothing but 3 channels of tv to watch  the lucky ones were able to get a job in the kitchen   which brings me to the food  to increase shareholder value the inmates calorie count was reduced to the minimum level allowed by law  the food was of such awful quality i wouldn't feed it to hogs as slop  just the absolute nastiest shit you have ever seen   i ground it out for 8 months then quit without another job lined up  go fuck yourself  corrections corporation of america  the company that manages to create value in abusing the human rights of its employees and the inmates it's paid billions to house ,hr3c91
492,I don't know how or if I can keep doing this,about a year after working an apprenticeship  i was working 16 hours a week 4 days  then summer hit and they had me working 40 hr weeks  i developed depression  i had anxiety beforehand so idk if it's a coincidence or not but anyways  i just couldn't go in today  the stress and pressure is crushing me  i woke up in tears  unable to do anything but cry  i feel like i'm aging faster and faster and i'm only 19  the idea of having to do this for  40 more years is destroying me  i'm not able to do 8 hours a day for 5 days  it's too much  i keep calling in  was able to do a month of not skipping days  until this morning  there's so much emptiness      i can't go like this forever and it's getting worse  it feels like there's no escape  i want out  i already tired getting hours reduced and they said no  like  i don't need to to paid for  when i'm not there  but god fucking damnit i need to leave sometimes     what can i even do at this point ,hr57lc

494,I was anti work all my life and just didn't know it/a rant,so i'm 28  i still live at home  work part time retail  full time hours this month though since everyone is on vacation   i feel a lot of shame i still live at home  and honestly that's another conversation right there  how along with our society being made to believe being a wage slave is great and normal we also convince young people to move out of their family's home asap even if they get along well with their family because being a wage slave and struggling to get by is preferred right   but anyway    back in high school  this is where i was anti work without knowing it  i would dread it when they would force us to open the college uni books to try and figure out our careers    i don't want a career  i would think  all i wanted to do was write  for myself  read or daydream or play video games or spend time with my friends  but that's not how life is  everyone would say  so i would force myself to read the descriptions and feel miserable with each page flip  everything either sounded to boring or to hard  i didn't want to be bored but i also didn't want to work hard  a career would suck out all my energy  i would think  and how would i have any time for the things that really mattered   my mom was also putting pressure on me to find a job in high school which i remember being unhappy about because i went to school monday - friday and my mom was basically asking me to give up my weekends  that's life  she would say  i felt miserable at the thought  if i got a job i would have to work either after school or on my weekends off and i just didn't want that at all   i did end up going to college  since at the time my parents wanted me to and chose to pay  i graduated but hated the program i was in  and i wasn't good at it  just good enough to pass  and i couldn't find anything in it anyway   fast forward to now  and i'm feeling a lot of emotions  guilt  my mom is disappointed in me  i keep saying mom and not dad because my dad is never one to have serious convos and i kinda get the feeling he wouldn't mind his daughter staying forever  but she's disappointed  she thought i would see her  miserable and unhappy in her retail job  and want to do better for myself and actually get a career  i'm single  not dated because i'm so used and comfy being single but tbh i prob could use a man to take care of me  not gonna lie   anyway i can't explain to her the truth  that i never had interest in a 'career' because any 'job' or any 'career' is all the same to me and tbh at least in my retail job i just clean mostly and keep everything tidy and it's boring but simple and i can daydream about things that i like and i don't know if i'd have any daydreaming time in a super intense career  in this society  it's a crime tbh to admit you don't want to work  that you don't want a career simply because 'it'd be to much work' you're lazy if you admit that and being lazy is unforgivable  we're so used to being wage slaves  so accepting of this reality and this normal that not wanting a career is a sin   and i get it in a way  because i'm gonna be 30 in 2021 and i'm still living at home working retail part time and what's worse is like an idiot i haven't been saving my money well  i created a savings plan for myself to stop myself from touching my money since i live at home and don't need too  but i think it all comes down to me just  being so empty i guess with my reality i like buying myself things i like because i can't see much of a future for myself  so what am i saving for  i guess has been my mindset  and maybe because seeing how miserable everyone is not very motivating for 'career job'  i need to figure my life out  i can't seem to get full time in my job because tbh i struggle at even my retail job and haven't been cut out for 'full time' because fun fact in retail you really have to be good and go above and beyond for them to give you full time  but what else is there    i started thinking a lot lately about how fucked up it all is though  because even getting full time doesn't promise you a good life  not even just because of all the hours you lose to work but because even that is not enough money to really live  and it's so awful  how is this our reality   maybe i've been so bad at 'saving' my money because i know how good i have it right now  living at home  yes i help out around the house alot  but there's a luxury in living at home that i feel like i never want to leave  and it's shameful  i don't doubt for a second me staying a home at 28 still as stunted my development a little  cause while i do think making young people feel like they need to move out asap when they could work and save at home isn't the greatest i know being able to take care of yourself without support is vital to surviving in this world   gosh i just hate it  i hate it how this is how life is  how nice would a world be if the machines did do all the work and no one had to work unless they wanted too   i feel bad for my mom too  she hates her job so much  she much of my mom's misery is because she has to give so much time to a job she hates  i think about how fucked it is  she is forced to go in there and work to make rich people money  and i'm doing the same thing at my job  the rich people on top get it all for our misery   i think about how messed up it is some people are so filthy rich  on one hand  sure  good for them  like jk rowling wrote harry potter and whether you like her  or like her books  she did write a book series that became huge and made an impact on lots of kids lives and yeah  totally  she deserves to be rich  but at the same time  it's kinda messed up how in our society  we allow indivduals to hold so much wealth when so many people are so poor    i realize now that youtubers  or authors who hit it big  or actors who hit it big with roles  or hell even the owner of say doug the pug all these people kinda cheat the system  i mean  pewdiepie started off making videos playing video games and look at him now  he works hard but he gets to do what he actually truly enjoys  he has full control  he cheated the system    i wish i had the talent or courage or luck to cheat the system   it's just  fuck i'm anti work  i hate it  i hate myself for not embracing the system and everything and being where i am now  i hate the system for how it forces us to work for the rich  i hate how society distracts us from paying attention - most people don't think about how we should try and change things because they're to distracted either by entertainment  and who can blame em for that  but i mean you'll never see anti work thought trending on twitter because we're to busy with everything else but being anti work

495,Of Brick Windows and Broken Men,i don't want to write my whole life story  but here is a quick  anecdotal blurb  i graduated in 2003  had no clue what to do  and went to a community college for electrical engineering because  what else to do  for 12 years  i was told that school mattered because i needed it to go to college   so that i could be  free  by choosing whatever soul-crushing job i wanted to  working for some random employer   i got a job as an hourly technician and quickly realized that i had been set up for a lifetime of disappointment  there was no freedom in my life  i lived for weekends and five vacation days a year  which also were my sick days  i was given a wage to work on products that i would otherwise never know or care about  yet i had to act like i lived and died for these goods  i had to wake up before the sun rose  every day  drive through mind-numbing traffic  take breaks at specified times  wasn't even allotted a chair  even cavemen could sit down  had insurance that covered almost nothing  yet the rates went up each year  watched the cost of living outpace my wages  and quickly realized that nobody had my back  best of all  i lived in a world where there was a single  opaque window that kept the sunlight out as well as it kept our darkness in   then i got promoted to a salary engineer position  i had finally made it  then i realized that yes  although i could shift my hours around  each lunch when i wanted to  sort of  and received sick days  i was actually worked far more for less pay  that  and seniority no longer mattered  so the threat of layoffs could be used against all of us and nobody felt safe  black friday hit one day in 2012 and i saw 1 5th of the engineering department get cut  including half of my team  i survived  but did i   after 12 years  my wife and i decided that we had had enough of this 20th century american experiment  everything in my life revolved around emptiness  my work did not lead to my survival but to the profits of some other guy  i wasted my time earning wages when i could have been working directly on my own livelihood  so we sold everything  our four bedroom home  debt  the majority of our stuff  we packed up our suv  drove to alaska  and my wife picked up a teaching position in a rural village  a career with tangible results  we use wood for heat  we can hunt and fish for food  i just built a chicken coop out of scrap materials and we will be raising our own chickens  even in the -40 temperatures  they will be fine  are we still working  yes  but in a different sense  we don't work for wages but in order to teach a new generation and to implement critical thinking concepts  explore new avenues for growth  and to create an atmosphere of actual learning  openly encouraging questions   i wanted to take a moment to link a fictional novel i just published  titled  of brick windows and broken men https www amazon com dp b08bdk531c  based on my experiences in an hourly role in a production environment  it is satire  it is serious  it explores the depths of malevolence that permeate the corporate world today  finally  it questions how one is to survive in a world where we are not humans but  human resources  i will put the link to this story  here  on amazon https www amazon com dp b08bdk531c  feel free to check it out  review it  share it  or do nothing with it  it is just refreshing to find a community that speaks to the same truths that i have long felt  most of my coworkers hated their jobs  but still defended the system  i challenged the entire construct and i suppose that is why i left it in the dust  thank you  my fellow working men and women  and happy wednesday ,hripyp

mcdonald s in the us  i have hated this job since before the pandemic  but now i am counting the days until i quit  it s 42  btw  this is going to be a very long rant but i absolutely need to rant    i immediately was told how lucky i am to still be working  i seriously could not and do not understand how anyone could consider me lucky  i was in college and working at the same time  which is hard enough as it is  but then my state s stay at home order hit march 25  all classes moved online and the only thing that changed about mcdonald s was that we couldn t let people sit and eat at the store  didn t change hours  didn t move to cards only  the literal only thing that changed was you couldn t stay and eat in the restaurant  i totally suck at online learning  but i still managed to get straight as in my classes somehow  and learning online was far easier than the hell i ve been put through at this job    mcdonald s is a typical first job for teenagers  the day the sah order hit  the parents of literally every high schooler called and one even came in the store to say that their child would not be returning to work until the sah order was lifted  this meant we lost about 8 employees  or about an eighth of our total staff  then  because we had to prove  staggered shifts  to the state  everyone s hours got cut from top to bottom  but our rate of business literally never slowed down  we were routinely understaffed and could do little to nothing about it because we weren t even allowed to pick up shifts  and since mcdonald s it s also a minimum-wage-ish paying job  many people had a second job  some lost that job  others didn t  but then the scares started happening  one of the employee s other job was at a pharmacy  she told us she may have been exposed to someone with covid and had to quarantine for two weeks  did the store care  slow down  close  do anything  no  not at all  so we were worrying about potentially having asymptomatic exposure and not knowing it all while serving food to people  luckily  nothing came of it  but there was a  rinse and repeat  cycle of this for the first six weeks or so   then came panic buying  when people went to panic buy and stock up on foods and meats  distribution centers had to do a whole re-prioritization process of who got what products  this eventually affected us  we had to cut the menu fairly severely due to limited amounts of trucks coming in  and also corporate was planning on doing away with all day breakfast  so the pandemic kickstarted that  the amount of customers angry that we couldn t give them a sausage mcmuffin at 10 40 am were astonishing  however  we are a franchise store  well really stores  the owners have 13 stores  and there is a fairly close store that is corporate  the corporate store did not have to limit their menu at all due to different suppliers  so our clientele was getting confused and angry with us at that  too  as if limited our menu was a choice we even wanted to make  oh  and when meat became harder to come by  we had to raise our prices on the beef sandwiches  a cheeseburger off the dollar menu is now  1 29  there have been so many people who are furious over  0 29 and too many who have straight up cancelled their order because the cheeseburger was no longer on the dollar menu    but how  you might ask  did the owners think to help employees  here is a very messed up story of what happened    1  because we cut items out of our menu that we still had in stock  the owners didn t want to waste them  they told everyone that we could take 12 cookies for our hard work  as cookies were something we took off the menu  this sounds nice  except there were a few issues that a lot of people had with it  some people working there were the only ones working to support an entire family  meaning spouse and 1 or more kids  as well as themselves  12 cookies is not enough to feed a whole family and it s not money to help pay bills  then  one of my managers was curious and put 12 cookies into the waste calculating system  and the net loss of 12 cookies is a whopping  1 60   2  many people from across the franchise were insulted by this  generosity   because the waste cost got around  i swear mcdonald s is a high school  it was also about this time that the first set of unemployment checks and stimulus checks were rolling out  and people recognized that they could literally make more money on unemployment than at work  so people just stopped coming in  prompting managers to fire them  qualifying them for unemployment  this made us lose another 10 or so employees  almost 20 out of 65 people in a single store were gone  similar numbers were across the rest of the stores   3  the owners finally got worried  losing a lot of employees but not a lot of business can actually cost money more than saving it because some stores would have to call others to send people to help  meaning they get more hours and some even get overtime pay because they re working at multiple stores  this didn t help prove staggered shifts  either  in a fragile  last ditch effort to keep the employees they had  they granted us what they call hazard pay  which is an extra  2 hour  this actually worked  it s even been useful in hiring new workers who are still out of their original career fields and jobs    the owners made it clear that we weren t valuable  but it s been the customers who constantly remind us that we re expendable  originally  we were supposed to refuse service to people not wearing masks facial coverings  this didn t necessarily apply to drive thru as the order had already been taken and we would essentially need a manager back there doing nothing but voiding orders  as they are the only ones allowed to do it  it has not helped one single bit that people are making memes about  you re dumb if you wear a mask alone in your car  so people just didn t  i really wish this meme and these jokes would die because otherwise we might die  so it mainly became that people coming into the store would need a facial covering    about the beginning of april  if i m remembering correctly  a mcdonald s store in oklahoma city refused to serve someone without a facial covering  that person had a perfectly legal conceal carry license and opened fire on the employees because they wouldn t be served  4 were wounded but i think no one died  so mcdonald s corporate said that it is no longer mandatory to enforce the no mask  no service rule  but we still could if we chose  basically  either get shot or get covid  we got to choose  nothing says expendable or sacrificial like dying over a mcchicken    people have also  understandably but also unnecessarily  been more rude than normal  one evening during a dinner rush  3 kids probably no older than 18 came in and tried to order food from one of my managers  when he told them the total  the kids said something along the lines of  well we don t have money so we were hoping to get it for free  to which my manager nicely replied that that s not how restaurants work and they needed to pay  one of the kids gets up in his face  before the plexiglass came into play  and said  i quote because i heard this   well what if i f cking cough on you and give you corona  my manager rightly told them to get out and voided their order  this is technically a terroristic threat and is illegal  but there was no sense in calling cops because they were already gone    another point of tension has been the drive thru  we asked that all delivery drivers continue to come into the store to pick up food so that the drive thru didn t get even more congested  but some refused  we still technically had to give them the food through the drive thru  but it felt insulting  at least to me  that they think themselves so much higher than us that they can t come into the store  but we have to be stuck here and dealing with everyone as normal  other regular customers thought that the lobby would be closed and walk up to the speaker  fun fact  our headsets are not motion sensored  they re weight sensored  meaning that you physically have to drive over the plates for it to trigger  we don t watch the cameras 24 7  but sometimes people look up and see the waving and shouting angrily  then  because it s a drive thru and not a walk thru  we had to tell them to come inside and that we can t take orders of non-motorized vehicles  not even bikes  scooters  or skateboards unless it has a motor  i have been cussed at and screamed at for this as if was my decision  it has been like this since before the pandemic  why would i decide not to serve you now    masks and facial coverings have always been a point of contention  the selfishness and downright ignorance regarding masks always infuriates me  i have asthma and an auto-immune disease  so if i catch covid  a lot of harm will come to me  i wear my mask for 8 or more hours every day i work in this hellhole  you can wear one for the ten minutes it takes for your food to be ready  masks do not deplete oxygen because if they did  i d be dead in the first hour and surgeons literally could not do the surgeries they have to perform  if i  an asthmatic with daily and rescue inhalers  can wear a mask for that long  i can see no other reason than pure selfishness for someone not to wear a mask  i should not have to sacrifice my health to make you comfortable  it s not infringing on any right at all  the mandates are not unconstitutional  and you are not special    the only reason i still work in hell is because i have almost no savings  i have no cushion  if i got fired and tried for unemployment  that money would get sucked into bills  i wouldn t have food for myself or my cats  since the beginning of the pandemic  i was promoted to crew trainer which came with a  0 50 raise  and then the hazard pay helped  i technically make a little over what the unemployment benefits give  even after taxes have been taken out  it wouldn t make much sense for me to quit now  i m quitting in 6 weeks because my next semester starts august 24 and i have my father s gi bill back  which pays for food and housing as well  but until then  i m forced to sacrifice almost everything  my roommates  my boyfriend  his family and coworkers  manufacturing job  he didn t quit working either  and my friends because i have been deemed an essential worker in a world full of rude idiots  i have been sacrificing my physical and mental health trying to feed people cheap  unhealthy  not-that-good food  i m tired of it    if i was in any other industry than the service industry  i might be more grateful to have work  but at this point  if someone else wants my job  they can have it  this job just isn t something i can be grateful for right now ,hqm2jw

536,"The Movie ""Office Space"" - have you seen it? What thoughts did it bring?",have you seen this movie  basically  it is about a guy that got sick of his  bs job  his moron bosses  silly bs tasks that are busywork  the general inefficiency of large corporations and how the current corporate system is wasteful    one of the topics that were mentioned in the movie was a question  what would you want to do if you won 1 million dollars  he answered that he would do nothing and would just enjoy himself   it reminds me of me  i had a privilege of not having to work until i was 25 due to university bursaries  i'm 30 now  i was terrified of the idea of work - i was truly genuinely content with just chillin' at student accommodation with a few buddies of mine with whom i've lived  playing video games and a bit of poker while also drinking dark ale  that was life  and  thankfully  i came out of uni without any debt   however  after uni  i started working and i've forgotten how it feels to have a lot of free time  i even started thinking that having too much free time might make me unhappy because i would not have meaning in my life  yup  exactly  as if meaning came from work   this yeah  however  i had some good experiences  i've been working from home for a few months  eventually averaging about 3-4 hours of actual work per day  then i was put on furlough with 80  of pay for 6 weeks  they were absolutely amazing  sleeping in  playing video games  talking with friends via facebook using voice chat for 2-4 hours at a time  having baths  that was the life  now i am back at work  but  other than catching up on stuff which i did in a week  i'm back to working 3-4 hours a day on average  this is absolutely amazing  i love it    i consider myself very lucky to have been in this position  for most people  it was a difficult time  for me  it was a blessing  even for the people who have been furloughed and successfully came back to work  they said that disliked being furloughed as  they had nothing to do  it is really sad to see that people can be so uncreative with their free time   i wish i could prolong my current situation - which i think i could if i've done fire  but that would mean that i'd have to pay off my mortgage first  then buy another property for renting out purposes and paying the mortgage off of it  too    it might take a while  but least that's something   anyways  what about you ,hqdafg

581,Even thinking about getting a ‚Äònormal‚Äô job makes me feel physically sick and the work culture for working class teenagers here is disgusting,just a warning  this is really long  the jist of it is  is basically in the uk kids who are from deprived areas who have lazy or neglectful parents are shamed and forced into work at a young age and there s a ton of businesses willing to take advantage of that due to the age wage gap and get around the law by not having a clock in system and paying kids cash in hand and not having them on their books  thus forcing and manipulating them into working really horrendous hours while still in school    my working life started from 11 years old where my dad pressured me to get a cash in hand job delivering magazines  it was door to door and similar to a paper route but i done 3 rounds and had to deliver 6 stacks of magazines  each stack being 250 magazines and all i had was a flimsy bag to carry them  and the weather is freezing and wet here  this was all because i wanted snacks and toys  i was still playing with toys  and my dad didn t want to pay for them  he told me i had to do it because my sister done it and  she was fine  my sister was a high school athlete playing rugby and volleyball and was 5 years older than me  she could lift the heavy bag  i couldn t    when i turned 13 i worked in a cafe and i enjoyed the work for the most part and miss making coffee however  my manager done some really iffy stuff like training a 13 year old on a coffee machine when you have to be a minimum of 16 or paying me  2 30 an hour  working after school and one weekend day  believe it or not my work schedule got worse than that  after 3 years i was fired for no reason and without being told  2 weeks later i actually went in and asked about my shifts and they just said  oh the pa fired you  and that was that  when i worked there i got one 15 minute break for a 9-10 hour shift  also illegal  both how much i was working and my break time  they didn t have a clock in system so i couldn t prove it  but my break was supposed to be 45 minutes and my manager shamed me into taking a smaller break because another girl took a small break    when i turned 16 i worked in mcdonald s i considered harming myself every single day  i was miserable  i was pressured to work there because my other 3 siblings had worked there and my sister invalidated my feelings and opinions and enabled by dad s behaviour by saying  well we all got treated that way  you re not special  the reason why i was complaining is because my dad was taking  220 month off of me to pay him rent since i was 15 and making me pay for basic necessities like sanitary towels and safety razors  the was increased to  380 per month when i turned 16 because i was an  adult  but i was a stupid child when it was convenient for everyone  my managers would scream at me and force me into situations that i was highly distressed by  i have a really bad audio processing problem due to autism although because i m a girl i was of course undiagnosed and i am 20 and still not formally diagnosed  i was constantly forced on headsets even when i d break down in tears and beg to do drinks or lobby instead  i hated the headsets because i couldn t understand what the customers were saying  they would scream at me causing the shift manager to scream in my face and if i cried they would just scream even louder  ah yes  just like home  every school day i d get in at 6am to do supported study for art  so i d actually pass  leave at 4pm and work until 12pm  which was unannounced and forced overtime that i wasn t paid extra for  i was supposed to stay in until 10pm but i was always pressured to stay and was made to feel guilty when my shift was over  i d throw up on my breaks from the stress and then do my homework  i didn t even relax on my break  my colleagues bullied me and stole from me    i stayed there for 2 miserable years until i finally handed in my notice  what drove me to do so was when i collapsed from a severe migraine on my bathroom floor at 4 in the morning  i usually get stress induced migraines but this was the worst one i had ever had  i went to a amp e and i had crazy high blood pressure  nothing bad came up on my mri scan but my doctor said that i had to be less stressed and wanted to prescribe me diazepam  he was pretty surprised when he found out i already took quite a high dose of diazepam  in fact at that point when i was 18  and doctors actually started listening to me  i took 4 different medications for anxiety  ptsd and depression which were diazepam  valium  and alprazolam  xanax  as well as sertraline  zoloft  and amitriptyline  elavil  to treat migraines    i have an intense fear of people that was fuelled by working in my younger years and being around so many aggressive and toxic people  my fear of going out if the house is considered a disability by doctors but the uk government doesn t feel that way hence whenever i know i m going to hit a dry spell of student loan money i try desperately to get freelance work because even after all that shit and experience i would be paid not even close to a living wage because i m 20  literally  let me remind you that this horrible feeling crazy work hours started from when i was only 13 and just got worse  no kid should have to deal with that but so many did who didn t have parents willing to pay for  basic needs  for them  you were lazy if you were over 14 and didn t either have a cash in hand job or a part time job    so now when i think about getting another job that isn t something to do with my degree  animation  i feel physically sick all over again  i just can t do it  i can t go back to living my life like that  i still have nightmares about it to this day  this is so commonplace where i live where kids with middle class parents got bought cars and didn t work a day in their life and working class kids were forced to get jobs lest they be lazy  the class division is so blatant and leads to overall bad health  i have chronic pain that started when i was 14-15 and has gotten progressively worse  standing up too long is agony and the doctors don t know what it is  some think it s fibromyalgia which you are stuck with for life  and also another illness that people don t take seriously  i d be money that i don t have that i am in pain constantly and my hands are fucked up because i had to work since i was a literal child  no child or young person should ever have to work a job while in full time education  especially if they are neurodivergent  i m just glad that i have some socialist and liberal friends who wholeheartedly agree with me and support my anti work stance and my desire for ubi instead of just telling me that i m just making excuses to not do work and be lazy which is literally what a girl in my art class told me when i was 16 because i wasn t getting folio work done on time because i was so exhausted  this girl and her twin sister have a record deal in nyc  got tons of free shit and their mum bought them a car  it always these privileged  neurotypical individuals that are the biggest bootlickers honestly and claiming that they have worked for everything they have gotten  and if you got this far thanks for reading my story  this is the reason i appreciate subreddits like this  this sub makes me feel far less guilty and alone and validates me ,hofa20
582,Went from the best job ever to a pretty meh job to a shit job all within 6 months. What do?,i m not sure why exactly i m making this post  guess i just need to vent or something    so a little backstory   last summer i graduated highschool  shortly after  my parents started getting on my ass about getting a job   they threatened to kick me out unless i worked at this local grocery store near me  i lasted about 3 months there  after a lot of fights with my parents  and threats of getting kicked out  i finally just decided to stop showing up so that i could doordash full time back in october   when my parents found out  they were pissed  and started charging me rent  only  125 every two weeks  not much  but too much to handle without a job     the doordash thing lasted like 3 days   i made bank in those 3 days    then some update happened that allowed anyone to doordash at once   so everyone got a lot less orders in my area   i went from about  150 8 hours to  20 8 hours    i was crushed   and still had to pay  250 a month     i lasted until december   when my bank account was a little too slim for my liking   i decided to go to an open hiring event at allied universal  the security company   and that leads me into the next part of my story    at the open hiring event something amazing happened  i sit down and fill out an application   and after about 20 minutes a manager pulls me for an interview  he says he s been looking for potential candidates for a new position they re starting at the company  i didn t exactly understand exactly what it would consist of at the time  but it was  15 an hour   3pm-11  weekends off  and was a driving job so i accepted      the next week i started training with one of the manager s  not the one who hired me  son who had the morning shift for the aforementioned job  the first day consisted of checking on two sites  security guards   dropping off some paperwork    and then straight chilling for the rest of the 8 hours   we took our hour lunch  hour lunches   yes   and paid   and then went to micro center   then yamaha to look at motorcycles   i knew this job would be fucking amazing right then and there       i can honestly say that some days i would rather be at that job instead of at home  i ve never felt that way about any job before   i was able to test drive cars  they always rented the cars for some reason  and sometimes they would be cool    i lost my virginity while on the clock  one day i was chilling in a parking lot and matched with this girl on tinder who asked to meet up right after matching     i d go home and play video games if i was particularly bored  and then drop the car off at the office later    i d go out to eat with my family whenever     i d pick up my brother and hang out   i d sleep   i d go to my friend s house and watch standup   you get the picture      i should have known it was too good to be true   it lasted about two months   january to march   one day in march the manager comes up to me and says that some corporate guys caught on to what he was doing  i guess this job wasn t supposed to exist and he was basically legally embezzling money  he didn t phrase it this way  and that i would have to go to a factory and take the employee s temperatures because of covid-19   i was disappointed   but even this job was pretty chill   all i had to do was sit in a room on my phone from 1-6   then at 6 when the shift would change   about 18 employees would come in throughout the hour and i d get their temps  after that i d just sit for a couple hours and go home   only issue i had was the commute  the place was about an hour from my house   so add 2 hours onto my day    the other guards there were super nice   the site supervisor  highest ranking guard  was really sweet and accommodating with the schedule  and i was relatively happy there    oh   and also i was making  17 50 an hour for hazard pay     two nights ago that ended though    the manager decided to move me to a lowe s warehouse where there s trucks coming in and out  and the manager s son  guy who trained me  is site supervisor  i m now making  14 50 an hour for 10x the work   basically constantly going back and forth signing in trucks and filling out like 3 different forms for each of them  while the manager s son gets the cushy job at the front desk across the place  but they said multiple times  you ll be busy it s great  how the fuck does anyone have this mentality    i really want to quit  but i m gonna see how doordash is this weekend before doing that  i used to love doordash when it was actually worth it  not sure whether or not to put my two weeks in  i really want this on my resume  but i don t want to do this for another two weeks    although i m not even sure if i ll ever need a resume   my long term goal is to become a trucker when i turn 21    save all my money for 6-10 years  easy if you re living in a truck  and retire on rental properties   i d rather not be a trucker though    i really want to start some sort of service business   power washing maybe although it s seasonal  and then retire    when i say rental properties i mean commercial by the way   i couldn t live with myself if i was a residential landlord     sorry that this was sorta all over the place  but i m no walt whitman lol ,hp9zbv

585,annoying things about my job (some covid related),i work at a call center   - we regularly get emails to notify us when someone in the office has had covid  however we no longer get hazard pay   - whenever another event happens in the world  we get an email along the lines of  take care of your mental health  our health insurance does not cover mental health treatment   - in our covid emails  they also always state something like the following   we have had an overnight cleaning and reopened for business as per usual  we have added hand sanitizer stations  and encourage employees to thoroughly wash their hands  we hope this has provided you with peace of mind  it surely has not  because they don't even clean thoroughly and our sick days are limited   - they can cancel our breaks or shorten them to 5-10 mins each when we have busy days  fuck you  i'm exhausted and i can't even get some fresh air ,hp5fqk

587,Anyone have a decent work ethic when it concerns work you care about?,like i can spend 11 hours recording and forget time is going by or help my dad with an hours long house project painting and doing carpentry etc  but it's the inherent exploitative nature of 'jobs' that make me hate the work  the fact you're trapped and the operation is so rigid and how affects every facet of your life from wake up to commute  you think hunter gatherers took timed breaks  they just took one when they fucking needed it and procured food for their tribe and i sure felt valued and pride about it  i'm not 'lazy' and not opposed to labor  but helping to sustain a system of which you have no inherent worth and are merely disposable makes me fucking ill  and i don't see a way out beside accelerationism  too bad kacysynski had to taint the image accelerational-collapse  anyway i'm just milking my unemployment right now  i needed the fucking break  and my heart grieves fkr all you essential workers taken advantage of ,homijr

604,"I don't know what to decide on my path with work, I am very conflicted, anxious and feeling really depressed on finding anything that is remotely doable and reliable at the same time. How can I find a livable wage and not be miserable at the same time!",this may or may not be long  but i feel like ranting and hopefully this community can shed some light or perspective on such issue  i will try to not make it long though with details      i just feel like i am getting the short end of the stick  living in a city where i am dependent on others for my living situation  hoping to find a job but with my lack of  work experience  i can't even get a simple job like cashier or whatever   even with a degree in humanities  stupid job posts say like  you need x amount of experience required including the bachelors  how am i suppose to have prior experience if i am trying gain said experience at the job i am applying to   i just constantly apply and apply to the online applications all over the city  with covid-19  the situation doesn't help in terms of finding a job   even if the companies are on hold or whatever  i still get rejected from the application process  pre-coronavirus  i still get rejected   and i somehow managed to have a 2 year gap in my resume       to make this post relevant to the anti-work reddit  working to me feels pointless  but not just pointless  but very anxiety induced stress   thinking about work  being at the work environment  or just any feedback that isn't positive makes me sick  like an anxiety attack   how am i suppose to function at all if i have such feelings  the conflict with working is that i am all for a work-life balance  less hours working and some how getting a livable wage   but it seems that i was born being told that having a job is the only means to making money so that i can survive        i don't even know what i am good at   i hear all the time about finding your passion  or create goals or just picking something that i would enjoy  the problem is that how am i suppose to fund such ideas when i can't even get a job   but does a job even exist where i can cope with my mental health long enough to endure the bullshit and save enough money to pay for my hobbies and dreams   it just makes me depressed that i have to somehow figure my life out and people constantly tell me that  i am not getting any younger and i need to pick something or i am just wasting my life away ,hoknjy
605,Did I just get blackmailed at work? Please help :/,hey i hope it s okay for me to rant here because i ve been stressed for the past hours  i m currently doing a commercial apprenticeship  office  and i live in europe   its been 1 month that we have a new boss  i tried to be nice to her but she turned out to be a fake b tch  long story  our other boss has vacation this week so me and other workers were alone with her  also the new one is extremely confused  misunderstandings seem to happen everyday with her  yesterday i went to the toilet for a minute and she came and asked me why i ve been 30 minutes here  she s the person who sees you doing the smallest or nonexistent mistakes  corrects you and then goes to the other boss to tell her how she saw you doing this mistakes    so me and a coworker talked a bit too much during work because we don t take her seriously  today i got called into the office of a higher boss and he told me that the boss reported us for talking a lot and me not being productive at work  complete bullshit  he told me i have to write everyday the time   tasks i did on a list and show it to her boss and wanted me to sign an objective agreement or else i d get a warning  at 2 warnings i get fired  i told him that i do agree with the talking and that i ll stop but how i don t agree with being unproductive    ive worked the same for months  never had a problem and now that this new boss is here  it s suddenly a problem  so far every coworker here doesn t like her  2 others even had bigger problems with her   i defended myself and the guy had to plan a meeting with me  him and the boss to clear it out   i thought i could continue defending myself in that meeting but i was wrong  it went for 30 min and the only thing that basically happened was them dodging questions and blackmailing me  for example   they wanted me to write the tasks i do everyday  i told them this is humiliating  degrading  destroyed every trust  then they were like  but this could be very helpful for all of us  its actually very helpful and beneficial to document your tasks  and i said  if it s so beneficial  then why do only i have to do it  they both immediately went defensive mode and said  no this meeting is about you  not others    i told them that i do agree on talking a lot with the other guy but that my productivity is still the same strong and i m a fast worker so there s not much loss when i talk for 10 min with someone else  i agreed on signing the agreement only with the point of stopping to talk  but they kept insisting on how my productivity got down  i replied with  it s always been the same but i don t think the new boss sees all the work i do everyday  she s clearly confused and it s not only me who sees that so i m not at fault   once again  they dodged this   i got tired because clearly  all my arguments were dismissed and i had no free speech  at the end the higher boss said i have to sign this agreement or else i ll get a warning  about 3 4 points were complete wrong  talking about how i have to be respectful to others including bosses at work even though i always was  one other was to  contribute to a good positive atmosphere at work  even though i always did  i was almost crying and signed up  like my depression that was gone for a while is all back   i cant even quit the job because i m in that apprenticeship like study thing and i can t find something else  also long story  i m planning to message an union for students for a free consultations  ive been mistreated so long in my life and i m not gonna take any harassment anymore  especially not from a boss who isn t in the position to judge me    what do you guys think  sorry for my long text,horl1l

609,"Got a new job, already feeling conflicted about it, and it makes me feel weak.",i got incredibly lucky and landed a job as a pipe fitter for a construction company   14 hr base  and if i stick with it for 5 years  i'll go beyond an apprentice  so i won't even need to pay to learn it  now comes the problems  it's 10 hour days  5 days a week  and i have to wake up at 4 30 am just to get there in time  that's the least of it  though  when i'm there  i feel this overwhelming sense of loneliness  and a fight or flight response  this has toned down over time  but it still ramps up my anxiety more than previous jobs have  on top of this  all of my coworkers are country born and raised  while i'm a city kid  nothing against them  it's just our personalities are night and day  and it makes feel out of place and like i should leave  i want to leave  i don't enjoy it  but i would be throwing away a perfectly good career with no need for college or any other formal education  but i'm just so damn weak that i feel like i have to get out  but i know running away won't solve my problems  it's just a constant loop of this thought cycle  and it makes me feel so weak  pathetic  and makes me hate myself  this is probably too much of a vent for this sub  but i wanted it to get it out there to a possibly like minded community ,hogbw8

639,"""Choice"" is an abstraction of language and a myth we use to cope with Powerlessness. ""Choice"" is a Lie that confuses work with value and success with something that happens to good people. There is no choice, only context.",i can't think of a single decision i've ever made in my entire life - i can think only of the ways i've acted in accordance with my character   i find no distinction between  me  and  my choices  - i  am  those choices  not a separate entity in the pilot's seat of my skull that  chooses  - that stands separate  considers  and then finally pulls the lever that corresponds with the  choice i ve made   those last three words are superfluous - to me they all reference a single thing - a localized  happening  from my specific perspective   i think the belief that me  or you  or anybody  makes decisions  is quite backwards - it s partly a product of the language we use to speak about ourselves and the world  a confusion of the symbol with the actual thing  and partly just our basic instincts  it's plainly obvious that i am alive and aware and can consider many possibilities and think rather abstractly about present  past  and future  so it only seems to follow that i  must  exert some basic influence over the course of my life but i think if we really examine that thought there s no good reason to assume that necessarily follows    we might  feel  that it does  but perhaps that is a sign to be skeptical of our most basic unexamined assumptions   this idea is naturally unpalatable as it would seem to absolve one of all responsibility  for both wrongdoing and ownership of good acts and artistic creations  but i think this is nothing more than a knee-jerk reaction to protect our sense of  i  as something distinct and in control  as to accept the opposite comes with a great and terrifying sense of powerlessness  this terror is multiplied further when coupled with the additional quality of randomness  and the ordinary and pervasive accepted fact of our  free will   is an attempt to reconcile this powerlessness with our instinctive need to be in control    even when faced constantly with the reality of circumstance where one life is destroyed based not on any choice of its choosing  but the simple act of existing at the wrong point in time and space and colliding with the wrong other does nothing to dissuade us of this familiar and comfortable illusion   responsibility is not something we  take  it is what we  are  by sheer virtue of being   you may have felt  it  when engaged in something everyday and ordinary  yet struck as if for the very first time by the majesty and totality of all there is - all experience happening right now  billions of distinct and separate simultaneous happenings - connections - disconnected only by virtue of the limitations of our own collective conceptions of what is real  what is true  and what is possible   what is possible   does jeff bezos really have billions of an actual  tangible currency  or is his currency really in the form of power and influence as represented by money    is the standard work-week from monday to friday or monday to thursday    whatever the answer  is it because this is simply the way the world is  or might the way the world is be directly shaped by our collective ideas about it    wars are no longer waged on an actual battlefield - our modern war is a psychic and spiritual one  set in the space of the collective human  un conscious  and the targets of annihilation are not only people but possibilities - the target is truth  and the creation of truth as it serves the manufacturer - we are in an era of memetic warfare and unless we can understand that and figure out how to turn it against itself  the collective human spirit will be swallowed whole  outlived by the last piece of manufactured shit we can sell for a dollar    2095 problems and 1 crucial error stands between us and a better society  and building that society is as simple as believing in and spreading the right memes    we can meme ourselves better  but only together   if you can believe that  it's true ,hni6kx
640,I did it. I finally deleted my LinkedIn account. Some thoughts from a recent law graduate below...,for months  after resonating with many of the principles and words of wisdom on this sub  i had kind of been in a bit of a crisis   as a recently graduated law student  i have  in hindsight  constantly  over the past 4 years  been forced fed discussions surrounding 'the grind' and how it is 'normal' and 'expected' of us to work 70-80  hour work weeks  to always make personal sacrifices and to essentially never have a work-life balance  for most of this time  i was content with a definition of success garnered towards making lots of money and climbing up the corporate ladder as it was all i had ever known  i was obsessed with the fact i thought i knew exactly what i wanted to do in life and believed spreading myself thin was what was going to help me get there  i did so many extra-curricular activities related to my degree  on top of volunteering and my part-time job - not including all the god-awful networking events i went to because 'it's not what you know  it's who you know' was hardwired into my central nervous system  i tried to be naive and oblivious to the mental toll this lifestyle could take on a person  particularly when senior counsel would drink themselves into a bout of misery at these events and come back from the bathroom with powdered noses    however  late last year  this all came to a grinding halt  i completed my first ever internship in a law firm and absolutely detested it  the environment  the culture  the work  the politics  the commute  all of it  as soon as i finished the internship  i decided then and there working as a lawyer was not for me  i just wish i had realised it sooner  i knew i wanted to look back on my life knowing i had done what i truly wanted to do with it  and that did not include slaving away behind a computer for 10  hours a day  slowly deteriorating from dealing with awful clients and even worse bosses  i knew i wanted to prioritise my family and my mental health which had definitely fallen to the wayside within the last few years  but at this point it still wasn't clear to me what avenue my thoughts were stemming from   fast forward a few months  and i decided in my last semester to take some political science and philosophy classes for credit rather than doing more law electives  it was honestly the best decision i could have made  as it genuinely was like a light bulb moment for me  i knew i had a few socialist tendencies in me  but had never really researched or explored them to a great extent  i had great  in-depth discussions with my lecturers who seemed far more willing to converse with me than the law lecturers  through these conversations  which led to research that ultimately led me to this sub  i realised how toxic capitalist society has become and that working yourself to death to put coin in another's pocket is not the only way to live life  it was kind of world-rocking to know i can still find contentment in a lesser-paying  more fulfilling role that frees up more of my time to pursue hobbies  travel and most importantly  spend more time with my loved ones  through this mindset  i have also found simple living  minimalism and anti-consumption  i have fallen in love with the thought of living life again  and that is not something i thought i would ever say  all i care about now is being in a job which will allow me to live comfortably and within my means  some might say i no longer come across as 'ambitious' enough  or 'driven' enough  or 'committed' enough  but i believe there has to be more to life than this   as for what that job is  i currently do not know  doing a degree in law does not open many options  particularly here in australia  where the only pathways seem to be working in a firm  in a massive corporation or in government  and i am unsure if i want to study another degree  all i know is that living this 'fake professional' life is not going to lead me to happiness  i am so tired of people telling others 'the hustle' or 'the grind' is the only way to succeed  i am sick of constantly having to come across as overly productive  i am tired of putting myself out there and getting nothing but a lack of respect towards me in return  i am genuinely over trying to one-up my 'competition'  all of these  as you might already be aware  are baked into much of what makes up linkedin    sometimes i feel like i am the only person in the world that feels this way  particularly in this ever-present 'hustle' culture we live in  but then i come and peruse this sub and i feel somewhat at peace again  of course i still have a few thoughts in the back of my mind which i have to unlearn  particularly with regards to allowing myself to relax and not feel like i have to keep up pace with the busy world around me all the time  but for now  i think stopping myself from feeding into this degrading cycle by deleting my linkedin is a great start ,ho95x7

650,Back at work for 3 days and already resentful,i have been unemployed for most of quarantine  in the early days  i was often at a loss for what to do  and puttered around the house and felt miserable  but spending more time than i ever had before on basic self-care  addressing my mental health  and developing new hobbies left me feeling more at ease with existence than i ever have been   of course  i got a job  which started this week on a part-time basis  i already see myself snapping at roommates and reverting to old  unhealthy habits as i try and do the mental gymnastics of fitting in everything that made me happy for the past few months and a job that will soon be full-time  it isn't even a bad job-- i have benefits and even kind of believe in the work-- but it's ultimately not what i want to do     during quarantine  i've been able to devote more time to building qualifications for work that is more up my alley  but now won't have as nearly as much time due to working-- a real catch-22   nearly everyone in my life expects me to be happy to be back at work  but i am just so stressed  this sure isn't sustainable ,hnt50g

654,"VP Tried to Ambush Me In a Meeting, and I Put Him In His Place in Front of Everyone",around 3 30pm today i was called by boss and he asked me if i would be apart of a meeting so i can explain our special order system  first off i was trying to finish up two reports i have to distribute on friday  and the meeting was impromptu but i digress  the meeting consisted of my boss  vp of merch  the vp of sales  a district manager  and my coworker who managed to weasel his way into the inner circle so he think he is big shit  as soon as the meeting started the vp of sales  i will refer to him as he moving forward  was ready to rip me a new one  or at least try to   he starts screaming at me telling me that special orders are piling  mind you i have been over the special order process for two years now with no issues  i calmly told him that since we have put the new process in place of all special orders needing to be approved before i can process them  this has contributed to the pile up of special orders    i also told him that because i receive approval for every special order  i have to go though those emails and process specific special orders vs before this new process was put into place i could process all of them without any barriers  this has slowed down the processing of special orders tremendously    he then tries another angle  he screams  why aren t the special orders being closed after you say you process them  i made the suggestion to share my screen and show everyone on the call what i do with a special order  he then starts yelling again before i can even get started  i take a one minute pause because i am fuming  i was so pissed i was shaking  my own fucking father don t talk to me like that    i guess it was more than a minute because my boss thought i dropped off the call after the vp of sales stopped screaming  i calmly said may i continue  my boss said yes  so i go through the entire process from a-z  i basically prove that when i complete the order  it leaves my queue completely  he starts screaming again  why is it showing up on the report  i snap and said  listen i have no control over what you see in the system  i also have no control over what shows up on your little report  all i know is the order disappears from my queue when i process and close the order  it gets quiet for a second because they can t believe i yelled like that  i normally try to be respectful to everyone  after that he says  look at your queue  it has 200 plus special orders   why are there so many in there  i raised my voice again and told him i am doing the job of two people with overtime  i can only do so much  i then mumble under my breath  i m sick of this shit  i guess i was louder than i realized because everyone got quiet  my boss tried to be the voice of reason  and he tried to explain what the overall objective of the meeting was  i honestly believe my boss had no clue the vp of sales was going to try to set me up like that    after that i abruptly stopped sharing my screen and i started working on the report i should have been done with by now  while everyone was saying their last piece i just hung up the phone and went back to doing what i was doing  my boss sent me a message via skype  and i said  barry i apologize  but i really need to collect myself  i finish my report  published it  and logged off without speaking to my boss and i could care less  i m a grown man  and i refuse to let another man talk to me like that especially when i do my job  i made the decision to officially start looking for another job because they got me fucked up  i yelled at the vp of sales and i could give two shits about it  fuck him and fuck this job ,hozumm

677,What is your opinion of government jobs? What role do they play in an anti-work world?,i am very anti-work  mainly from the perspective that we work more for less despite a major increase in productivity  showing us that many of our livelihoods are based on greed and not a common goal of survival and happiness    however  i work in government  public transit operations  and i'm struggling to understand my role in society and whether i'm doing the right thing  i am proud to work a job that is mainly there to support lower-income individuals  help the environment  promote healthier lifestyle for citizens  the goal isn't to make money - we  lose  money every year but are considered an essential service   on the other hand  i feel public service has taken a lot from the private business handbook  it is an incredibly bloated oeganization  slow to adapt and change  many people only working to collect a pension  i'm required to put in my 40 hours week even though the work might take 15  i still feel like a slave to work  even if the work is more noble than slaving away so someone can get richer  not to mention the amount of corruption within politics    so  are government public jobs necessary in a capitalist society  are they good for society  just poorly executed  what are your thoughts ,hpzvkn

704,Calling the Workers Back,so at my job  they're bringing people back in larger than ever before waves  despite the fact that our county has seen alarming rates of new cases  i drafted up this letter to the ceo and spoke to a few other engineers to see if i could get their support  so far that's been few and far between  but i've still got more to ask  though i expect by the end of the day i'll be signing it alone  if it even gets sent    regardless  it took some work to write up and instead of just hitting delete  i thought i'd share with you all and see what your thoughts on it were     names have been changed for obvious reasons    amp x200b       a letter to mr  boogerton considering our safety   boogerton    this is a letter of concern from your engineers in  booger department 01  i think it should come as no surprise at all that most engineers  or any staff for that matter  chose not to sign this letter not because they don t believe in it  but because they re scared  that s the world we live in today  people would rather risk their health than their job  while they believe in what s being said here  they are too scared to stand up for themselves   however  this letter is not about the inadequacies and imbalance of the world  it s about booger inc and our safety against the current pandemic which you seem to be ignoring    new cases in  imverysick  county alone have been spiking through the roof at an alarming right  your response to this was  we ll wait two weeks and see what happens  after two weeks and new cases still soaring high  your response was to not only continue bringing us back to the office  you re bringing us back quicker    for some reason  you have deemed yourself and your hr worthy enough to determine whether or not we re worth risking  i can t even begin to explain the moral conflict with that  considering the only thing we re at war with is production    i m not the youngest buck in the room anymore  which means my parents aren t exactly young either  i do  however  enjoy seeing them every weekend  if your response to this is  you have to work and you ll just have to not see your parents until this over  then you  sir  are wrong  i would gladly choose family over any job  for any job that suggests i don t see my family is not worth keeping    both you and  vp booger  have said you have seen no drop in productivity out of us since we ve been working from home and that  you re very proud of us and impressed  yet on the same token  you are requesting that we come back in the middle of a pandemic  hospitals are overrun  nurses are wearing ppe for weeks at a time when they re supposed to be replaced daily  people are dying  i m not sure how much more clear i can make that last point  but i will say it again  people are dying  sir  people are dying  and you are requesting that we come back to work and risk dying  for what  for money that s being made anyway if we work from home  or is it so you can feel good about yourself having an office full of worker bees   this isn t an argument to work from home for eternity  this is an argument to stay safe  an argument we should never have to have with our employer  yet here we are  we have proven we can get the work done from the safety of our own homes  yet you demand we come back into harm s way  i  personally  cannot even begin to wrap my head around the selfishness of that decision     booger inc  is not a one in a million job  by your own admittance   booger inc  is one of the hardest companies to do business with  by the admittance of other directors and staff   booger inc  is 30 years behind the times  while we do appreciate getting paid  let's not fool ourselves here into believing  booger inc  is the only opportunity for employment  there are countless other establishments looking for talented individuals  in short   booger inc  is not worth risking my wellbeing for  especially when there is zero need to do so  which brings me to my next point    booger inc  preaches every day how important safety is to them and how serious they take it  yet when  booger inc  has the perfect opportunity to prove their statement  they do just the opposite  they request that all their employees come back to the office during a pandemic  and not just a pandemic  the second wave of a pandemic  after we've proven we can work from home just fine  if you re going to talk the talk of safety  then you should also walk the walk of safety  no amount of pins and stickers and safety speeches will bring back the people we ve lost  or might lose    you ve also made mention that break rooms will be closing  so what are we supposed to do for lunch  sit outside while it s 100 degrees  sit in our cars during the heat  sit in our cubes and eat  or perhaps you expect us to go out to eat which i hope i don t have to explain why is a bad idea  or maybe your silent hope is that we ll just skip the break altogether    you have also made the comment that it s not fair office workers get to work at home while factory workers don t have that option  if you want to be fair then  i suppose we are all working the same hours for the same pay  correct  should you and i compare paychecks to check for discrepancies    nobody made them work at your factory  that is a choice they made  and it s a choice that none of us should have to pay for  we re free to work wherever we want  and while this is not a threat  i honestly believe it s worth noting that some of us might not continue to work here should things continue down the path they re going  it s also worth noting you had trouble keeping engineers before the pandemic    again  this is not a request or an argument to work from home for the rest of our lives  this letter is out of concern and is an argument for our safety and wellbeing  an argument that we should never have to have    i feel incredibly silly and even stupid for saying these next words  as it is something i should never have to request  but here i am    please let us continue to work from the safety of our homes until this pandemic is over and we feel it s safe to return  not when you feel it s safe for us  closing break rooms yet sharing bathrooms  having to wear a mask all day  constantly sanitizing work areas  and practicing social distancing means it is not safe yet     amp x200b   it's long  i know  but there was a lot i needed to cover with boogerton  thoughts  improvements ,hm7uhs

727,Can we take a second to acknowledge the terrifying irony that money isn't even fucking real?,or is that too bleak   'real' isn't  exactly  the right word  but it's probably the most impactful - it incites a reaction  anyway    gt like  omygod  like  wouldn't it like  be great  like if  people didn't  like need money and stuff  like  all those kids in  like  africa wouldn't  like  starve if money didn't  like  exist  ya know https www reddit com r shitstatistssay comments 6x0762 money isnt real and scarcity is almost always dmc5il4   this  but unironically   of course money is a real thing that performs a necessary function  but our shared collective  understanding  of it shapes both its form and power  it  is  power  and in this way we can alter its command over our reality through a collective psychic exercise - memes manipulating money   we can't function without money  but we  absolutely can  function with a new way of distributing it in hopes of lessening  not eliminating  the total amount of suffering in the world directly related to poverty and the soul-sucking and exploitative nature of selling your labour   ask google   how many billionaires exist  - answer  2095   do any of them  really  have billions of an actual  tangible currency or is their currency really in the form of power and influence as represented by money   is the standard work-week from monday to friday or monday to thursday   whatever the answer  is that because this is simply  the way the world is  or might the way the world is be directly shaped by our collective ideas about it   wars are no longer waged on an actual battlefield - our modern war is a psychic and spiritual one set in the space of the collective human  un conscious  and the targets of annihilation are not only people but possibilities - the target is truth  and the creation of truth as it serves the manufacturer - we are in an era of memetic warfare and unless we can understand that and figure out how to twist it against itself our collective human spirit will be swallowed whole  devoured and outlived by the last piece of plastic manufactured shit we can sel   2095 problems and one crucial error stands between us and a better society  and building that society is as simple as building  believing  and spreading the right memes ,hk8a14
728,Apprenticeships are a con,just a short post to vent a bit  i am 26 years old  i have a degree  and i'm currently an apprentice for the nhs  i'm paid  502 a month and am paid so little that i get universal credit to boost it  i've had four instances of sickness since i started due to depression  anxiety  and a toothache so had an 'informal chat' with my manager  where she suggested i use my annual leave instead of my sick days   i work really hard because i'm so anxious about negative feedback  maybe i was so deluded that i thought the relationship was an equal one and that i'd somehow get something out of it at the end of the day  the qualification i'm getting is utterly useless and was only tagged on to make the idea of being cheap labour more appealing  there is no job at the end of this  it's just a way for my department to fill the second  much needed assistant position without paying a full wage  it makes me so sick that my future job prospects might be jeopardised because a future employer might check my record and see that i've been depressed and anxious for a few days and refuse to hire me because of it   i had a job interview on wednesday  the position was advertised as a fulltime one but in the interview  they told me that it would likely be a job share  is this my future  am i going to be juggling multiple jobs at a time because employers don't think it's in their interest to hire fulltime staff    i'm going to start relaxing at work more  make an attempt to even the scales somewhat  i have a longterm plan to retire asap  but until then i refuse to be such a willing sheep  i've always known i was being taken advantage of but i think the events of the last few days  specifically  the interview and my manager telling me to use my annual leave instead of sick days  have really brought home to me the fact i am being exploited   people tell me that i knew what i was getting into and that it's just a fact of life  i couldn't give a shit  it doesn't make it right  i'm not stupid  i know life isn't fair  i've always known that the current work system is fundamentally bullshit  but i've never felt it as much as i have done recently  i feel like i was always aware of my situation but now i've had my eyes fully opened    i don't want people to read this and think that i'm new to hating work or realising that i'm being taken advantage of  i'm not  i've just never seen the ugliness of my situation so horrifically exposed as i have done lately    my manager isn't in on monday or tuesday  everybody else dislikes her with varying degrees of intensity and i think everybody feels basically positive about me and my work ethic  my job involves leaving the office loads so i'm absolutely taking advantage of that and smoking whenever the fuck i feel like it  i can't describe how i feel right now  i've wanted to be done with work since my second day when i realised just how soul-crushing it was  i've been stealing time in little and irrelevant ways  i suffer from really bad social anxiety so i can't really steal time by talking so i'm basically working non-stop  no longer    i'm pretty sure some of my colleagues realised this about my job from day one  there's one older lady who is always saying how hard i work  i'm fairly certain she does it to remind my manager that i'm doing her a favour  i feel so stupid for working so hard for so little   i'm going to wrap this rant up now because i feel like i'm repeating the same points  thank you for reading    amp x200b   tl dr  manager told me to use annual leave instead of sick days  interviewers lied about the job role  i put way too much pressure on myself  gonna steal me some time back  also  i knew this was all bollocks very early on  i just never had such a raw experience of it till recently ,hl2a0v
729,This is my story of wanting to get my life together,i quit school because it caused me a lot of stress and constant anxiety  i was blinded and at this time i worked a full time job for about 3 years  i wasn't happy but at least i could get money to eat sometimes  pay my family rent  buy some things that made me temporary happy  when i quit my job  i was the happiest  didn't have any notice because they didn't treated me like an human being  i felt free  after a year  i wanted to have a goal so i looked at what i love to do in life   creating food  i then processed to give my admission to the school and i was admitted  in my country  the gouvernement pay for your study and is supposed to help you with loans and bursary  i had no money whatsoever  1300  of debts  my family is having a hard time  living with less than 500  per week  we got refused for the helps 4 times  it was their mistakes at first  four times  now they called us and told us they can't help us anymore  a girl on the phone told something that made my dad go crazy mode   sir  just do what everyone is doing  work during your full time study formation    i actually quit school because i couldn't do it and it was part time  is it me or everything is crazy   i will never get myself sick mentally and physically for some piece of paper  the girl processed to told me to do like any other citizen and go to the bank  it was our last hope and i got an online appointment  they told us that they can't help me with my study  it costed too much for   what it was a false-non-manly-job   aka being a pastry chef   cooking  she proposed with the biggest enthusiast to do a credit on   10 years  that's it was   normal and everybody do it    my dad really tried to get his shit together to not insult the poor privileged lady on the phone  is it where we are now   if you are a poor lost soul that want to do something in your life that you thrive for and you don't get help in your country  what are you suppose to do  work till you can't walk  die without living a passionate life   i'm really not okay with this  i still don't know how i will find 20k  in less than 2 months  but i will not be a puppet  i will fight for me and everybody in my situation  thank you for listening to my rant  i hope you have an amazing day    ,hkinpu

732,I a 14yearold have a 60 hour work week,send help    i hate school  i wish i was prepared to be actually productive  hardworking and benefit society instead of being prepared to make a billionaire richer than he already is so that he can buy a 13th fancy mega mansion in the countryside   i study 12 hours a day  i had to give up dance to do this shit because i had to become at math although i'll probably never get a profession related to math in my life  i work more than most adults with 8 hours  i spend 12 hours a day sitting in a chair without moving at all and i take random 30 second breaks with the excuse to get water just to move my body cause i hate sitting on a chair all the time    i don't mind labor  i'm not lazy  i have dreams of goals that i'm willing to try hard to achieve  one of my hobbies is literally learning foreign languages  i also want to help my caregiver with her household chores and cooking but she insists i'm too young  i don't have an issue with productivity  i want to make that clear  while i support universal basic income i still think that people should take care of their homes  families and land and get an education  so that they can raise their children  eat their own food and sustain their household  i would still work with ubi  so i'm not against labor   i am against the modern system of it  the system of  work  also known as jobs  they're capitalistic  they only profit the rich  they are unnecessarily hierarchical  and there is no proper work and lfoe balance in today's man's life  people see their bosses and co workers more than they see their family  i see my classmates and teachers more than i see my caregiver  8hours is just a couple of hours less than the work hours some people who work in sweatshops have  how is one inhumane  but the 8hour is okay  don't get me wrong  it is great that got invented  it helped workers a lot at a time when there were simply no sane work hours and employers could do whatever they wanted and exploit their workers even more than today  however  just like many old ideas  it was a produc of its time and isn't perfect  cuase it doesn't help the family life  mental wellbeing and overall happiness of workers   i hate how school forces me to he good at things that i'm not good at when i'm only going to use what i'm good at for life anyway  isn't school supposed to prepare us for life  i am good at psychology  philosophy  history  literature  languages  geography  biology and physical education  i am average at physics  and chemistry  i am god awful at math   i am probably either gonna end up a social worker  a psychologist  a full time historical fiction writer  or a circus performer or a dance teacher  i don't need advanced math  i only need general knowledge of them  i could as well be a language teacher  i don't need to have such extreme knowledge that i'm not going to use anyway  i definetly need general knowledge and a proper education  but i think that the only useful subjects right now  in my middle school are house economics  informatics  p e  and english  plus literature class but i don't agree with the way it's taught since there is no objective right way to interpret literature  i don't need to know ancient greek  extreme algebra  or some bs like that and i don't like how this system expect people with different talents to be good at the sake things and rewards perfection and therefore promotes perfectionism  i nearly cried last year seeing all the perfect students who had gotten straight 20s  i work 240 hours a month and hey my studying doesn't pay of  it's simply because people have different abilities and learn in different ways  but i'm not a bootlicker so i'm not expecting a reward from a system i hate   i feel depressed  numb  empty  anhedonic  and like almost all the things i enjoy doing were ripped from inside of me because i've lsot every single trace of social skills and life i've had  i am with people i love and i simply don't know what to say  what to talk about  how to speak  how to enjoy any thing  and it's super painful and uncomfortable for me  i've lost most of the pleasure from my life  because of this and because of shunning bullying  anyway  that was my rant for today  good night everyone  it's night in my time zone ,hk4ea2

744,A little insight.,think of every product we consume  it is very likely that a very unsatisfied worker was involved in its production process  think of the fast food we consume  it could be likely that the worker who made the meal was having a rough time in his her life and accidentally messed it up  behind most of the things that we consume there is a dark process which many of us don't realize  we blindly consume because that is how the system is built  people die from working in slave like labor conditions even today   the capitalists just throw in some people that would fill their pockets  products we consume would be so much better if the system we live in focused more on the individual potential of a person  there are many people with so much potential in places where they don't belong  people with the ability to change the world  that fast food worker has great engineer potential but can't afford to pursue it  that man who was driving the garbage truck was rejected from college due to unfair reasons  then we see people with no talent or skill becoming millionaires and leaders while the others are a paycheck away from homelessness working a job they hate for the rest of their lives ,hmh417

746,Boss is a hivemind of dunces,about two weeks ago my boss failed to pay me  i asked about fixing this  and the resulting email chain became a rapidly escalating self-own of contradictory bafflegab that continues to this day  amidst this  it feels like my 'boss' is having her email run by a number of other people  all with different terrible ideas about how to avoid paying me my tiny paycheck  i keep forwarding this stuff to the department of labor to strengthen my back wages case  which i informed them about but they haven't shut up long enough for me to brief them on   for example   i just got three emails from her  all with the same font  size  and text color as the finance director who mailed me as well  those letters  from both email addresses  have been calm  he was asking me for something my boss asked me for  so i bet he asked her for it  but he was also asking me if i'd seen that email she sent me--despite that she had sent him part of my response to it  and she somehow failed to send the other part of my response  what in the world   some of these strange emails have huge shifts in tone and phrasing  they would demand things under a tight deadline that previous letters thanked me for sending days ago  or bizarrely contradicting new 'facts' they had only just laid out in the previous letter's attempt at cya maneuvers  some of those mails had text which was clearly copy-pasted because the bulk of the mail had one text type and specific sections had an alternative one  and those letters had the belligerent energy and phrasing of the hr manager  who hasn't contacted me but who i know has been involved for a while now because of an email the finance guy forwarded to me maybe accidentally  in just one of these mails  my name was misspelled and a lot of the writing was garbled   last week i got a paycheck at least  but for  three hours  of work despite my supervisor having approved the timesheet where i recorded 42  i can no longer rule out some kind of cryptic code being sent to me in the only language that a boss knows  abuse of the worker   i will not quit  because i want my ui benefits  but oh my goodness is this a carnival of aggressive failure  how can all these bosses  vps  and department heads be so bad at this  i imagine them all crowding over the same laptop trying to get one low-paid hourly worker sufficiently confused to forget they are required to pay me for time worked ,hmhr1e

I will continue to hate work.,ever since i was old enough to understand  i ve hated the idea of having to work for a living  watching my parents lose decades of their lives to thankless  racist  parents are immigrants  corporate and organizational structures primed me with a healthy disdain for  labour  in all forms     but what about working for yourself  you may ask    i still hate it  but at least i get to decide when to stop     but what about the satisfaction of a job well done   that feeling of satisfaction is actually relief  relief that the work is over  for now    don t you take pride in your work   not really  it s something i m forced to do in order to survive in this world  emphasis on the forcing     the money must make up for it  right   there isn t enough money in the world for me to enjoy the act of working     surely  there must be something that you enjoy doing   yes  if it doesn t involve work    fuck work ,hln262

768,"Five Reasons to Hate Your Job. From ""Automation and Utopia"" by John Danaher.",give reasons to late your mob  the structural badness argument has two parts to it  the first part consists in identifying the features of work in the modern world that make it bad for most workers  the second part con- lists in arguing that these features are difficult to reform or change  i'll start by rousing on five features of work in the mo- den world that make it bad for most workers  in brief outline  they are   the problem of nominating influence  employment contracts  and  more generally  the state of being employed  typically give employers an unjust dominating power over the lives of for- hers  his significantly undermine the freedom of workers   the problem of fissuring and precarity  the working environs- men is becoming increasingly fissured  and working conditions are becoming increasingly precarious for many workers  his makes working life more unpleasant and distressful   the problem of distributive injustice  work is distributively unjust  technology is resulting in an increasingly polarized for- force in which a small number of highly paid individuals reap most of the economic rewards  and these rewards are not  in any obvious way  proportional to effort or merit   the problem of temporal colonization  work colonies our lives  most of our mental and physical effort is taken up with preparing for  performing  or recovering from work  that s mo- re  this colonization is getting worse as a result of technology   the problem of unhappiness and dissatisfaction  most people are dissatisfied with their work and think they could do better  and this makes it difficult to justify the other bad-making feat- yes of work  ,hlrwys

771,Is there a word for work done directly for a person as opposed to work done for a boss?,i feel like i need a word to express how i feel about work  i like working for people where they ask me to make a thing and i give them that thing and they will use it for themselves  but i don't like working for a boss who will take the thing i make and sell it to other people without giving me any credit or money from the sales   what words can i use to differentiate these and other different kinds of work ,hmcrk8

775,Applying Online is a BIG Waste of Time,it doesn't matter how good your resume is  how qualified you are  how much  time you spend to painstakingly filling out the application perfectly  and key wording your resume you still won't get the job because chances  are a real human being won't ever look at your resume once the  application tracking system parses it into gibberish and even if they  did  guess what   bob bobberson who  has worked at the firm for 4 years already has his son a shoe in for  the position so them looking at your resume is just a facade to deter  any allegations of nepotism or discrimination  companies actually are  required by law to post to these positions but by the time you see it  bobbert jr is already in the 2nd phase of on boarding   what's  worse even if they did humor you and give you the time of day and  consider you for the position  guess what  you don't qualify because you  need to be a recent college graduate with a masters degree from a top  university and have 3 years experience for this  entry level  position  so you you can hit the ground running  is bobbert any of these things   no but his dad knows the hiring manager so f you   that's why in college they stress  well  tsk  you have to network  ass kiss  if you don't  know a guy  that can get you in through some back door deal or some such flim flam scheme forget about it   what's  worse if you're in america they'd probably just trash your resume and  look at applicants from overseas since they can hire them quicker   cheaper and with less risk since they don't have to pay them benefits   do salary negotiations and can fire them without any unemployment  insurance claims so there's that   utter nonsense   the  time you spent sitting there flitting your life away on applications  that go into a black hole and then fretting if these people call you so  you can stroke their ego and beg them for their  15 an hour  entry level  job  you might as well go learn some other self start hustle that will  actually preserve your dignity  humanity and sanity ,hmmodz
776,Automation vs. Degrowth?,so i know a lot of people on here are very anti capitalist  and thus in favor of automating most repetitive tasks in order to allow people to perform less labor overall  the idea being that most work will be done without people  will be cheaper overall  etc leaving humans to just live and do work that fulfills them  i ve been reading about degrowth  and now i m just wondering  how do we get large scale automation without pushing more money into the hands of corporations and capitalists ,hml0dy

794,"I‚Äôm not opposed to a real job, but minimum wage jobs are where I draw the line",the goal is to be like a firefighter or even park ranger  those jobs are actually useful and you can make a difference with them  it s just that i can t stand the monotony of a minimum wage job which is why i think i m anti work to some degree  we have to face the fact that none of us are in any financial situation to live without working and it s a tough pill to swallow  but without sounding like someone who says  go work your dream job  i d say explore the possibilities  all of us here are just upset that we work shitty  menial jobs that hold no value other than keeping shitty companies running  look into something that ll help out the community more like a firefighter or paramedic  even the army is a good place to start if you don t know what to do    instead of complaining about how work is terrible  in a lot of cases it is  let s all start trying to get into jobs that can be hard work sometimes  but will definitely be rewarding for the community and yourself,hkpe9f
795,Life is not worth living,i have come to the conclusion that life is not worth living  i look ahead and all i see are decades of wageslaving and then old age after that    i dont see the point in living it through  either i find a way out of wageslavery  or i figure out a way to end my life  and once i've done that  quit my job and live off my savings until its gone  and then pull the plug on this gruelling life simulation    living life amounts to a sacrifice for the rich in my case  i cannot continue to sacrifice my life to this company so that the billionaire owners and their families can live in luxury    i've had enough  i've seen enough  i'm at a crossroads right now  its do or die  god help me ,hkd5ve
796,My parents are drug addicts with severe mental issues all because of their jobs,theyre both nurses in psychiatric wards  they guzzle pills for everything- anxiety  insomnia  blood pressure  headaches  anti psychotic meds  benzos  etc etc   they claim its perfectly healthy because its all been prescribed  my last job caused me so much stress that they tried to get me in those meds  fucking sick   i legitimately think their higher cognitive functions are gone because of their destroyed brains    my mom leaves the oven on  the fridge door open and throws trash in the sink  she wont have any memories of these  her mood is absolutely destroyed it swings back and forth in seconds  she used to cook delicious food now all she makes is disgusting goop   i honestly fucking loathe what they ve become ,hko951
797,I realized capitalism and the working industry was broken during my first management job.,i wish i had realized sooner     at 17  i worked at a pizza chain and climbed the ladder from delivery driver to assistant manager   i realized after how little regard for the rest of the employees management was supposed to have  their lives  energies  desires  were all worthless under the bottom line of profits   assistant managers weren t treated much better  we were pushed to work 60-70 hour work weeks  and being in the store working feverishly for 12  hours at a time  i don t just mean sitting at a desk  we were lucky to get 5 minutes to sit down  there were nights when we would leave the store at 3am  then come back to work for 9and continue working til 3am again  there was barely enough time to sleep so usually eating would be done in the few slow moments within the store  that was the expectation  and any unwillingness was met with the common mantra of  you just don t want this enough  stop being lazy and work harder    during a 60 hour work week  after an argument with a very stressed out co-manager   i abruptly quit and left  i felt bad for my other managers  i left them with my scheduled 50  hours for the coming week to divide up and try to get people from other stores to cover  but i was done     i took two more management jobs in other places in the coming months  and after a month into lockdown i left my newest job  a few of my coworkers had caught the virus  and upper management threatened us with termination if we told anyone in the public about the risk of half of the store being infected   when i got sick myself  upper management began pushing me out    now  after the peace of lockdown i ve realized that life should not be about working  we have to work to survive  but i never again want to return to any building under someone s feet   i ve started my own retail business and i am studying web design and beginning to gain clients  hopefully  if all goes well  i ll be safe in my new chosen path    if we are in a depression for the next 10 years  i d rather be miserable and free than miserable and a slave to evil corporations ,hko6h9

799,Cognitive dissonance about anti-work,i am mostly anti-work  at least the sort of work which requires one to spend min 10 hours a day and sucking up to superiors to move up the ladder  at the same time i love watching movies and sports  and based on all i have read  those industries require people working almost 20-hour shifts  yet those people love their work  love spending those kind of hours  i admit if they thought like me  we wouldn't have great art and great sport  i feel so sad and so depressed i can't be like them  think like them  how do i resolve this dissonance,hkl3r3

801,Do I pick the free law school or the elite law school that could possibly help me not work later in life?,thank you in advance for reading  any advice or insight would be very helpful to me right now as i must make a decision soon  law school deposit deadlines are coming up   hey guys  i have a dilemma  no one in other subs seems to get me like you all do  i value my personal  freedom  being financially independent  work-life balance  and enjoying my life a lot more than the average person  i do not want to regret wasting so much time on work when i am old  i don't want to be that person putting off their dreams  travel  and fun plans until old age  i have seen so many around me ruin their health and lives all for the sake of work and i have no intention of doing that  i want to be able to have a family  pursue hobbies  and just  live  i want to do that in my youth too  where it's important  not as a senior citizen  at the same time  i have a big opportunity here to possibly increase my earning potential a lot and retire earlier     here is my dilemma  i want to be a lawyer  i got into a respectable top 40 law school with a full tuition scholarship  i also got into a prestigious top-14 law school  but that would cost me about 135k in tuition  family will chip in with the living expenses  the promise or dream that the elite top-14 law schools sell students is that you can get a 200k starting job at an elite firm  after graduating  and be on the path of being a high-income earner the rest of your life  because the top firms paying top dollar only want to hire grads from these fancy schools to boost their image  these high-paying jobs are around 60 hours a week  however  and can be high-stress depending on the law firm  i hear some law firms are better than others  it increases to half a million like five years in  although many opt-out of the big firm lifestyle by then to achieve better work-life balance  my idea is if i go this elite law school  i work a few years  live frugal  retire early  i could possibly acquire enough to retire by 45 or so   this trajectory is less certain from the top 40 school  where you're not really guaranteed high income right off the bat  but the education would be free and i would be increasing my earning potential from just my bachelor's degree  and i do want to be a lawyer for a living  i could also luck out with a decent paying job from here if i do well academically  and work my way up  and have more freedom to pick less demanding jobs that won't eat up my work-life balance without the stress of debt  at the elite law school  i would kind of be forced to go the corporate law route in order to pay off the student loan debt initially    for those of you outside the legal profession  i'll just say it's insanely elitist and you can look up the statistics which are all public-the 200k corporate starting jobs are basically only available to those at the top 14 law schools according to the us news rankings  or  if you're lucky  the top 5 or 10  of the lower ranked schools  14-50  all this data is published in the nalp report so it is not a rumor  you don't even have to be above median rank in the top 14 law schools  they will take the  majority  of the class into the elite firms  unless you are truly horrible at interviewing  northwestern isn't the school i got into but comparable  you can see the salary info of their 2018 graduates  here https www law northwestern edu professional-life career stats documents northwestern pritzker nalp employment summary 2018 pdf    schools that are not the top 14 have more varied salaries reported  this is not the top 40 school i am referring to  but here is a comparable top 60 school for a look at their salary  report https www law temple edu site wp-content uploads class-of-2017-nalp-report pdf   i am at a crossroads  i can kind of see my life going two ways  either i put the investment in myself and get the fancy degree which would put me in a 130k  hole of debt where i'd basically be forced to work an intense job a few years after  and then i could have freedom  fuck-you money  and the ability to go my own way with my fancy credential  i could retire early and stop working earlier  but i would also be a figurative slave to debt and  forced  to work a high-intensity job for a bit  i also heard these 200k  jobs  you make like 500k your 6th year in by the way  which are the whole appeal of paying over 100k in tuition  destroy people's marriages  give people strokes  alcoholism  heart attacks and are utterly soul-crushing as you give your life away to the almighty billable hour and can't say no to more work because you're paranoid you'll be replaced by a younger associate attorney  but i also hear some firms are enjoyable to work in  plus  once you have two years experience in these corporate firms  the world is your oyster  you can go corporate in-house  you can go federal government attorney  you can go back and dominate your hometown  you have that line on your resume to then do whatever etc  also  i am in a better boat than a lot of people who didn't get a scholarship at this school and would be paying closer to 220k for the elite law school in full  the elite law school also has a program where if your income happens to be less than 75k  aka you go into government work to start  the school will pay your loan payments  and after 10 yrs of that  low income  government your loans are forgiven  i don't know the details off the top because i want to go into private practice  but it's a nice idea to fall back on if you end up with a lower than 75k but comfier public interest job    or i could take the full scholarship  feel grateful i am becoming a lawyer for almost free  and make my own way that route  i am not certain that the work life balance is better this way  lower paid lawyers do work very hard   but i hear it is less demanding than at less prestigious firms  but the pay would also be a bit less  i would also have flexibility and go an different way in my career without being financially ruined given the full tuition scholarship  and i would not essentially be forced to work to pay off debt  i could even dip out and move to a cheaper country and do remote work  long time dream of mine  and live well on lower income in a lcol area    i will say the free school in question is very respectable and the best in its state  it is not like a joke of a law school  it is solid  and no  i have no option in between the two like a 25 rank because the in-between ones waitlisted me or had tuition rates even higher than the elite law school  wtf  a lot of people pay good money to go to the top 40 law school   there is also a great chance i can dominate academically and make the top rank there even though everyone says law school grading is a crapshoot  and still get that high paying job from there that way  i did manage to be high ranked at my huge university  graduated with a bunch of honors  and definitely am capable of putting in the work required for high grades  i financed my entire fancy undergrad education on scholarships for high grades alone    on a personal level  my personal expenses are not very many  i do not live extravagantly  never have  so i do not need to keep up with the joneses  a house down the line would be nice  but i am not looking to spring on cars  mansions  clothes all the time  my expenditure is like maximum 30k a year in a hcol city and i'm inflating that number so that i don't fool myself  i don't drink or party at all  super homebody  so i am more apt than the average person  imo  to be able to save  i've just always been like this and don't care about material items as much as freedom  travel  work-life balance  not being enslaved to debt  if i get the high paying job  most of it is going straight to retirement  saving  and investments for my future financial freedom and i'll try to pay no more than 1200k on rent  what worries me however is there is no guarantee of the high-paying job  it still depends on your interview skills and resume  and things can happen quick  health  circumstances  family  etc  i don't like the thought of taking out so much in loans when life is uncertain  after the 2008 recession so many top law school grads lost their offers and left the field completely  in hundreds of thousands of student loan debt   one last thing i'll mention is that i don't see law as a get-rich-quick scheme  i legitimately want to be a lawyer  that's why i was going to go to the non elite school before getting accepted to the elite one  i know i'll enjoy the work more than anything i have done yet  and i am tired of working jobs below my capability around awful  catty  disrespectful managers who think their master's degree gives them license to condescend everyone  i want to be the one in charge  autonomous  and a legit professional  and have the ability to start my own practice  my old toxic manager would shit her pants if she knew i got into this top law school  she treated me like such a dunce  i need to advance my education  get a graduate degree  to get away from the fuckery that is available to bachelor's degree holders  i could use the legal education to create my own income as well    i never thought i could get in to the elite law school  but i did recently  and now i am thinking about whether by being penny-wise and pound-foolish about tuition  i could be hurting my earning potential and throwing away an opportunity  but the demands of the high-paying big law firm job worry me as i am not trying to give myself a stroke or spend the majority of my life as a slave to work    people have been very mixed advising me     my parents think debt is the devil  jobs are uncertain not guaranteed  and are pushing the cheaper school on me   my prestige-focused friends are projecting their desires on me  telling me to get into debt for the elite school   my poorer but very spiritually in tune friends tell me to take the cheaper school and relax debt-free   the attorneys i know who went to the top law schools tell me to take the scholarship because their debt payments are a pain in the ass and they are jealous of debt-free people  they are also bitter their top law schools didn't help them enough with the job search   people in medicine or non-law fields think a degree is a degree and discount the intense elitism in this field  they tell me to take the scholarship   people who i trust for advice tell me to take the route of no debt because that is what will me more mentally freeing and more empowering  and allow me to be more flexible   guys who are underemployed and underpaid tell me they regret their decisions not to go big  go elite  and get paid  they push the elite option out of bitterness for their own situations and think it's an instant way to be rolling in money   my rich friends think 130k is no big deal at all and tell me to take the elite school   my friends who live abroad and are unfamiliar with the elitism in the us tell me a law degree is a law degree and that they'll hire people from the top 40 school  they tell me not to get into debt   people who went to non-prestigious undergrad schools seem to be trying to compensate by being hyped up about elite graduate schools and what it says about them  i can't relate as i am not trying to make up for anything or front on a resume  my undergrad institution was good and i am not that insecure about my skills or qualifications  i just am trying to do a cost-benefit analysis here    my most recent ex  a lawyer  who tried to sabotage my application process the whole time  told me to take the free school because he couldn't stand i got into a higher ranked elite law school than he did  i believe he said that just to sabotage my career because he prides himself on his grad degree  went to an unknown undergrad  trying to compensate for something  and was mad the law school i got into was a few spots above his alma mater  jealous fuckwit  he thinks he is one of the unlucky ones who should be more successful rn considering his 300k degree  bitter   another ex  not a lawyer  but a financial advisor  told me to go for the elite law school because investing in myself can never go wrong   laypeople impressed by the name of the law school tell me to go to the elite one because  i'll never be broke or unemployed  going there  but being employed at a stressful job can't be that much of a prize either  just really conflicted  feeling pulled in all directions  i will say however i am grateful for these opportunities and i know that i am in a privileged position to even be talking like this about acceptances  i don't want to sound ungrateful    give me your best anti-work  pro living your best life perspective  because at the end of the day  i know my peace of mind and time are most important  i would especially love to hear from people who left high paying jobs or have already made it through the other side and realized that you can't put a price on work-life balance and not being in debt    logically  i know the safe and free route is great  but if the elite one offers loan re-assistance payments for below 75k public interest and the majority of grads get a job that exceeds 130k  doesn't it pay off  i am at a loss as to what to do right now  would the top 40 school be a waste of time if i end up with a job offer less than what i could've made with just a bachelor's  worst case scenario   tldr  do i spend 130k for fancy law school tuition in hope of quicker financial freedom  but those jobs are often intense and demanding  or do i go to the law school that offered me a full scholarship ,hmgwfs

832,Going back to working hard and ignoring my mental health. Because what else can i do?,so i recently-ish  in april  quit a pretty toxic work environment  i didn t enjoy the work  it wasn t stimulating  it s not even the field i want to be in and the people there were racists   i now work a job that s more peaceful but i get paid virtually nothing  seriously  it pays almost nothing and i m soon going to be drowning in costs of simply being  alive   everyone around me has this attitude that  it s just what you have to do  and  working is just part of life  you just have to do it  and i wholeheartedly resent that  whatever job i do i work hard in it and then naturally there s no recognition or praise and usually just stress and meetings about  we all need to do better  i m so sick of it all  but i can t  not  work as hard as i was before because money    i had this friend who quit his job and then lived off his parents income  to pay for the bills in his house  car  pets  food  weed  etc  for almost a year to  work on his mental health  imagine the privilege  i  wish  could do that but even trying to work a simple part time job now means i worry heavily about money which does  not  help my mental health  christ  no hate on my friend  it s just i m envious of that kind of privilege  after he took a near year off to  work on himself   aka smoking weed  playing video games  and napping all day  he then decided to go to japan to teach  i wish i could do that too  life doesn t work like that for everyone though    so i ve decided to put  focusing on my mental health  on the back burner for now and find new work that will most likely be of high stress but pay much better than what i m doing now  which  hey it s more important because capitalism    i ll still try to focus on my mental health in between but i just know it ll be harder  i m in this weird sport of coming out of a very bad depression and anxiety episode where i was having breakdowns nearly everyday for quit some time now  i m  terrified  of it happening again especially due to work    it just freaking sucks that this is how it  has  to be ,hjbnn8

I'm very afraid.",both my partner ad i are disabled and seeking ssi  but as it stands currently  w don't have any income  i have been able to keep a job for a month tops before everything goes to shit and i am unable to keep going at it  regardless of how dire a situation is  my brain and body just can't do it  my partner is in a similar position  the only reason we'll be kept afloat at all is because we're going into public housing and we'll be on food stamps  but that's not enough to sustain us alone  and i'm so afraid    i wish i could just be neurotypical and able-bodied and just suck it up and work but every time i try to do that i end up in the hospital and once i'm out i'm worse for wear  i haven't been able to get a break in years  let alone get back on my feet after some trauma i won't go into detail with here   i don't know what to do  ssi can take years to pass  it's already been a full year since i started my application  there's general assistance here to help out  but that's only  200 month max  and if i get on it some will be taken to pay rent in public housing   i want advice and a listening ear  i guess  what can we do  how are we supposed to survive  we don't have any family we can fall back on  and a lot of our friends are a few bad days from being in the same boat as us  they can only help so much  we've had to beg online for money to make ends meet once the food stamps run out  and people are only willing to give so much so often before they're fed up with helping ,hjor79

862,Great representation of minimum wage work,   his machine allows anyone to work for minimum wage for as long as they like  turning the crank on the side release one penny every 4 97 seconds  for a total of  7 25 per hour  his corresponds to minimum wage for a person in new work  his piece is brilliant on multiple levels  particularly as social commentary  without a doubt  most people who started operating the machine for fun would quickly grow disheartened and stop when realizing just how little they're earning by turning this endless crank  a person would then conceivable realize that this is what nearly two million people in the united states do every day at much harder jobs than turning a crank  his turns the piece into a simple  yet effective argument for raising the minimum wage  ,hk3cho
