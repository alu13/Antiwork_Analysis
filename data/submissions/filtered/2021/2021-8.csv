2,Trying to rent on a 60 hour work week.,my parents are moving so i've been trying to find somewhere liveable to rent  i knew it was bad but now that i've actually gone out and looked myself it's a joke  it's impossible  i can't comprehend it  the sheer amount of hours of my life i have to work to afford appalling living conditions  i don't even know where this 40 hour work week stuff is coming from because if i worked 40 hours a week i wouldn't even be eligible to apply for these properties  i'm just totally lost and defeated  i'd rather be homeless than work 14 hour days to hand money over for a cold  damp box ,pfdogo
3,I don't think I can hold a normal job,i'm writing this more as a rant  not for advice since i don't think there's a solution to my problem  i've never understood how people can cope with working at retail customer service  especially when it comes to the food industry  it's way too stressful and hectic  i don't know how to interact with customers  it's hard for me to smile at them and use the right tone of voice  it seems like even when i try to act polite and professional i come off wrong  i don't like all the chaos and i can't multitask for shit  these places are too noisy as well  i quickly get tired of loud sounds  these kinds of jobs just make me feel incompetent and drained  when i try to do jobs like this  my thoughts quickly start going to some extreme places  i haven't had much experience working normal jobs  but what i have done i consider intolerable  chalk it up to weakness  i guess  unfortunately  there's hardly any other jobs available to me  whelp ,pf5bcm

8,Does anyone else feel like this sub is harming their mental health?,hi all  i am a long-time follower of this sub but i've been having a few conflicts about it and i'm curious what others' thoughts are on it   like many  i subscribed to r antiwork in 2020 during the early days of the pandemic  i don't remember how exactly i discovered it  but i was instantly hooked by the content  there's mountains of literature out there about how the pandemic shattered any remaining vestiges of capitalism being even a somewhat sustainable model for humanity  also like many  i moved to 100  remote from march 2020   august 2021  and my life improved 100-fold   now life is returning to 'normal' which means commuting  being stuck in an office for 8-hours a day  lugging food  missing my family   the list goes on and on  all of this personal stuff completely leaves out the rampant exploitation of workers in this system  which was laid completely bare   here's the problem  prior to the pandemic  i accepted  although somewhat begrudgingly at times  that my life was going to be marked by 40 more years of commuting to an office 5x a week making work that i now find boring  uninspired and frankly  bullshit  it was an intractable part of life  the pandemic and the problems this sub helped expose has opened my eyes to the sheer oppression of this system and how horrible companies are pretty much across the board  but now the content just depresses me   there isn't a way out for me  whether i like it or not  i'm going to have to work in this field  else i suffer in at least some way  sure  i could just leave and do something else with my life  but that would mean no insurance  no or less amenities of modern life  losing my house  and any number of things  it's scary and with the debts i have it's almost impossible and the return on it isn't guaranteed   now the content here just depresses me more than it empowers me  we're just the ants being crushed under the wheel  and knowing that wheel is coming down or not does not matter   we're all going to to get crushed anyway  in some ways  the pre-2020 ignorance was bliss  now i'm just frustrated  anxious and depressed ,pf7fmw

10,Should I quit or let them fire me?,i have a meeting tomorrow with my manager where i'm 90  sure i am going to get fired  i was written up twice this year  once for taking long breaks and another for violating a rule about using work tools for personal reasons  i did not steal or break any law here  my question is  should i just quit before the meeting tomorrow or just let them fire me  from my brief understanding about unemployment this would count as a  termination for cause or misconduct  which would make me ineligible for unemployment benefits  i live in california  i'd like unemployment benefits but if this makes me ineligible i may as well just quit to make it easier to explain my exit from the company  i have enough saved up to last at least a year with no additional income  appreciate any advice ,pfeb30
11,Should I Quit My Job?,i initially applied to my job in texas over a year ago and got the role as one of the dance teachers  i got paid  11 an hour and now i m getting paid  12 an hour since i ve been working there over a year  since then  i ve also gained the responsibility of running not only the dance program  but also the parkour program  at the beginning of our class semester  i was never given a schedule nor any updates as to what classes i teach for the past two weeks  i m practically just told what classes i teach on a day-to-day basis    for any of my teachers  whether in physical or regular education  y all must know that not having a consistent schedule makes it near impossible to teach  not only that  but they also stopped listening to my wishes about separating kids into different difficulty levels so i can teach  they also have left me in the building alone with 26 other kids for hours at a time without any type of assistance    my boss is also my landlord  and i ve been living in their rv with a rent of  550 a month  i don t have hot water or access to wi-fi  and i m only working 15 hours a week  i got a second job to help pay rent and help pay for my college classes  but he said that in order to teach classes the way i want to  i can t work at that other job    my second job has also said that i can work there full time and i have a place to live if i have to move out  i just want to know if these are probable reasons to quit ,pfgmv3
12,My partner got fired for calling in sick.,i need to vent  my partner was working for a security company  the boss always seemed off to me but i didnt say anything because i did not want to discourage him  well  today he wakes up and immediatly feels miserable  he has to puke and can barely get of the toilet  probably food poisoning     he writes his boss to tell him that he probably cant make today's shift but will try anyway to get better by  sleeping  hell breaks loose  he gets a call while on toilet  has to justify himself  an hour later another call  this time by the second in command  telling him he has to do the shift  that he does not believe he is even sick  that he should take some medicine against the diarrhoea and go   my partner tried explaining that he feels bad and he wants to work but he cant stand and guard a building if he spends the entire time on the toilet  losing every body fluid     at this point the second in command and his brother  who is first in command  got even angrier  said that they need him to go to the company so that they can confirm he is sick  despite them having no training as doctors whatsoever     it escalates further  my partner is told that they are  done with it  and told him to bring them his work clothes within the next week because he is fired     i'm fuming  the contract states that they can both terminate work at any time but the utter disrespect of their side is insane  assuming he is lying  yelling at him  threatening his job and trying to somehow coerce him into working while being miserable  what assholes,pfbzxh
13,"Basically, f*** Mike Ashley",needed to rant a bit  i've been working at this place that is now owned by frasers group for over 6 weeks  i should have had my first payday today  however there was nothing in my bank account this morning  the manager never gave me sufficient information about my online payslip  and now has gone on holiday for a week  no one at work seemed to know why i hadn't been paid nor could do anything about it  called reception at frasers group - completely blank call  no ringing or anything  had to actually drive down to hr to try and elicit a response  they put me on hold for 30 mins before hanging up  i find it so disgusting that no one there seemed to give a single shit  the whole thing felt like a  big boys  club that only the 'elite' could dare to be a part of  i don't even know if i'll get paid anything at this rate  i don't really know what to do about it going forward,pf7ncv

25,It's not just Retail Jobs that suck,i see a lot of posts here focusing on retail jobs  and to be sure they suck too  i don't want to take away from that  but the work culture problem extends into all waged jobs  including salaried positions  one of the biggest problems with work culture is their seizure of our surplus value of labor  from this they are able to perpetuate the 40 he work week minimum because you can't afford to work less than that  for those of you who are in familiar  the surplus value of labor is the difference between the value of your work versus what they pay you  i e  you make  10 worth of product  but they only pay you  3 for it your surplus value is  7   so i work as an engineer for a government contractor  i won't specify further because i don't want to share any identifying information  i'm salaried  but broken down i make around  31 hr  good money right  here's the thing though  my company charges  125 hr to the government for my man hours  they are charging about 4x what they pay me for the work that i do  and that number is just for man hours  that doesn't include supplies or facilities  many of which are directly supplied by the govt  even if you account for future raises  even if we're generous and include training and time off task into that figure  you'd be hard pressed to justify such an extreme discrepancy    and even as engineer  i'll be quite frank  my job qualifies as what david graeber calls  a bullshit job  most of what i do is busy work to satisfy uniformed managers about the little real work i do actually do so they can make decisions above my head  even though they directly affect me and my work    when i started i genuinely thought i was doing something important  but the longer i stay here the more i realize i'm just a cog in a money churning machine for my bosses  and i don't even get a fair stake in it for my effort  i know a lot of other office workers feel this too  but may feel like they shouldn't complain because they are making a decent living  but you should recognize that this work culture is exploiting you too  work culture hurts us all and even if you make a good salary you should still show solidarity with your fellow working class neighbors  and ask yourself what your surplus value is  because i'm willing to bet it exceeds your salary   p s  this is also a good reason for removing private interests from government work since the government could just hire me directly for triple my salary and still save money  to say nothing of money wasted on our expensive executive officers ,pfcz33

81,what is the point,i posted this as a response to a post about why the sudden shift in views on work  someone said to post it    so why are people now viewing work as a scam   simple people were previously content to work and spend their money their way  even exchange  metaphorically speaking  i work for money  you pay me money for work  and then i spend that money how i want    then covid happened and most people couldn't spend their money the way they wanted  no movies  no bars  no clubs  no vacations  no gyms  no new cars  guns sold out  ammo  gone  home gym equipment  on ebay for 100  markup    but even worse  people previously content to do service jobs were tossed out by employers like two day old fish during the middle of a pandemic   even white collar jobs so employers desperately trying to cling to the falsehood that wfh did not work  and then it turns out that not only does it work  but people are more efficient and happier that way  then  as if a bad job was being done  they are trying to force people back into the office   there is no more exchange  i paid off debts during the pandemic and now realize that when i don't have loans to pay off  credit cards to keep paying  and i'm not spending money on frivolous things  i can actually live off less   my commute to the office was 35 miles each way  two gallons of gas  every day  just to get to work and back home  between gas  oil changes  normal wear and tear  etc it cost me  5 000 a year to just to get to work   5k of post tax income so why wouldn't i take a lower paying job that gives me total freedom or at least 100  work from home   then add in the fact that the housing market continues to inflate  simultaneous to the renting market  breaking all laws of economics and substitute goods    wages are the same as they were when our parents joined the workforce  rich people are buying up homes at 1 and 2  mortgages  but students are paying 8 to 15  on education loans  there's no snow on mountains covered in snow year round  and flooding in places that it never rains  half the country is taking animal dewormer instead of a vaccine  and groceries that cost  75 a week two years ago now cost  100    the shift we are seeing is what happens when an entire generation says  what's the fucking point   like take a 401k for example  why the fuck should i contribute to a 401k when each and every day i grow more and more confident none of us will be alive when i am old enough to collect it ,pf8yxg

90,Afraid of finally stepping into the real world and becoming part of the work force,i will try to keep this as short as possible  i am now 23 years old and have been in college for the last 5 years  living in a students dorm  i have not worked a day in my life so far  the closest i got to it was when i had to be a intern for 2 weeks at my dads company as a engineer    the people there were very welcoming and nice to me  and generally the environment was chill  because its was a government facility so there were no quotas that you would need to fulfil  so not a lot of pressure  most of the time people would leisure there and work 3-4h maybe daily unless there were some serious business that needed doing  again these are just my superficial experiences from being there for 2 weeks   but now comes the main issue  it takes me from one hour to a hour and a half to get there  so around two to three hours a day i spend in a bus  and its the worst when coming back  cause it was super sunny outside so everybody was sweating  and as usual it was super packed inside   and i would come home dead tiered  go to sleep immediately and wake up like 2h later  play a bit of games with my friends online and did the usual eating  showering and stuff and that was about it   and the only reason i got through the two weeks was because i kept reminding myself  its just two weeks of this and then you get to go back to your dorm    and that's why i am afraid of finally having to get a proper job  after finishing college  cause what's the point in living  if more then half of my day is spend on work  besides studying for engineering degree i also spend a lot of my time drawing and used to do 3d modeling  and it just hurts me to think that with work  its gonna be hard to fit everything in  that i would either not have energy or time  and even when i would do it  i would be advancing at twice the slower rate than before   and that is currently giving me some mental issues  but this isn't the place to expand on that   i read somewhere that there are places that work 6h a day  and to me that seams a lot better and should be normalized across the world  cause then you would have four 6h shifts instead of three 8h shifts  i mean its still a lot of time lost each weak on work and transport  but i feel that the current 8h is just too much   and i know that there are people who work even more  and i honestly don't know how you do it  all thoughts and prayers go to you ,pfbs2h

104,My favorite time quitting,back in the late 90's i used to work for a regional chain of comic book shops in th dc area  i liked the customers  i liked the job  the only thing i despised was management  the store manager and assistant manger were fine  but the 6 store chain had 3  regional  managers who all had overlapping jurisdiction   this was the death knell of the store  but i didn't know it at the time  see we would frequently get in really odd shipments of product  rather than our main sellers of comicbooks  ccgs  and rpgs  we would get really low grade toys and other weird stuff like incense  it basically never sold until we marked it down to 80  off   now as i said  i actually liked working there  and i tried to make the business thrive  i asked my manager if we could spend some money on fliers to distribute at two local universities to help drum up business  he said he didn't have authority to do it and passed me on to the  regional  manager  i gave him my proposal  he asked me which way we should spend money  on more product to sell or advertising  i said  advertising  becuase we can't sell what we already have in stock  his response   wrong answer  that's why i'm the manager and you're the employee   well i'm not your employee any longer  i quit  go fuck yourself   now here's the great part  about a year later the whole chain went under  when they did the bankruptcy sale  apparently there was like 50  1 ton palletes of unsellible crap in the warehouse  the same incense  knockoff toys  etc  it turns out that the three regional managers were all issued corporate credit cards  these shitheads would go to tradeshows and such and agree to buy product in exchange for the wholesaler taking them out to dinner or a stripclub  they basically were badly robbing the company they worked for  so a steak dinner for one of these assholes ends up costing the company ten thousand dollars ,per3wi

140,Today I had to do an ''Introduction application'' for my college course,i know this subreddit is centered around work and not college but i think this fits here     amp x200b   so  i'm sure everyone here can agree that the first assignment you usually get in a college class is introductions  from my experience  introductions almost always involve 3-4 things  telling the class instructor your name  major  the reason you are taking your taking the class  and if the instructor wants to pretend that they are human  they will ask you to talk about my hobbies  whatever the case  introductions are usually short and simple   today  however  i started an english class for my fall semester and my professor for this class seems to have a very different approach to introductions that is downright annoying    instead of asking us the common 3-4 aforementioned questions  we had to write 8 paragraphs for the 8 following questions    amp x200b   1  describe an example of your leadership skills in which you have positively influenced others  helped resolve disputes  or contributed to group efforts over time    2  describe how you express your creative side and how it relates to your performance in this class  3  what would you say is your greatest talent  how have you developed this skill  4  what would you say is your greatest weakness  what have you been doing to overcome it  5  describe a time when you took advantage of an educational opportunity to improve yourself  6  what is the most significant challenge you have faced  how did you overcome it  7  what are some activities you have done to make your school and community a better place  8  beyond what has already been shared in your  application  what do you believe makes you stand out as a strong candidate for admissions to the university of california or any four-year university   after that bullshit  we had 2 more steps  the first was to take a generic  timed  and annoying personality assessment that took me about 25 minutes to complete  featuring those shitty questions with the ''i agree or disagree strongly or a little'' options   after that  we had to write a 100-word response to an argument made by slavoj zizek on the covid-19 pandemic    amp x200b   overall  the introduction took me about 1 hour and 40something minutes to complete   i don't know about you but i don't consider that to be an introduction  that was straight up  a job application and i am not afraid to say that i half-assed it  i've distanced myself from engaging in this shit on job applications and i'm not going to do it for a college class   besides  this long-ass introduction was worth only 5 points ,peuicy

143,I wish I would pass away soon,that's it  i can't keep doing this any longer  i don't want to have to deal with the anxiety  depression and pain anymore    i've been seeing a therapist since january 2021  at first i was told it would be like brushing my teeth on a daily basis  that i wouldn't see immediate results  but after a year or so  i'd look back and compare what my teeth look like now vs what they looked like then  i would notice a difference  but nothing has really changed  in fact it got worse   during our last session i made it clear that i couldn't keep doing this anymore  that i live in this constant state of stress and fear  their advice was that i needed to get out of the toxic work environment i'm in and that the first step to do so was to accept the risks   but their risks are too high  i would be on the street within a month or so  i live in a foreign country by myself with no family or any kind of support  i don't have any money saved up because my dad is financially dependent on me and without me he wouldn't be able to afford medication and would eventually starve to death   finding another job is almost impossible  i work from 8 am to sometimes 8 pm and i am just so fucking exhausted  i don't have a weekend either  i had to start working on sundays because we're short on employees  i tried negotiating with my employer but what a waste of time that was   even if i find another job  how do i know it's not going to be just another toxic environment  i've worked for five different companies and almost all had a toxic environment  i don't wanna spend the rest of my days working and there is no light at the end of the tunnel   i wish my life contract would come to an end  there's nothing to accomplish on earth anymore ,pel8az

148,Why do people get angry when work ethic is involved?,work ethic can't pay bills  i work for a small business i'm not well of or rich    work ethic had nothing to do with that i work a good product that people like   it seems it's drilled  into most people that working hard that will make them well of or rich for most of the population they earn around 25 000 a year while those who are well off are commonly head teachers doctors   attitude has nothing to do with it  i do work eight hour days   most people are likely to never become well off  because the company can choose to have layoffs they also can choose to sell to another company   profits can pay someone's bills  i have learned a lot at working at this small business i have been taught about how company's save money with business savings accounts that go up over time   working hard cannot guarantee a raise  that is up to the manger not the employee   can someone become well off  yes if a person finds the right field  they can become well off within years ,pevlol
149,What Would You Do if You Somehow Found Yourself as a Business Owner Needing Work?,i saw a video of someone hiring a forklift person and i was just trying to empathize with a capitalist who was expanding and needed to hire employees   what kind of human do you expect is going to want to work 40-60 hours a week doing a mundane task for you  they must not respect said person  right    do you think capitalists think of workers like opportunity village  like we are so incapable of what they are doing that they are doing some service to us and giving us a purpose when we otherwise wouldn't have one  like there's something wrong with us   if it were me - i'd probably hire super smart overqualified people and have them work like 4 hours a day  more than 4 hours of machine operation is just asking for an accident imo  who has that much focus  i'd want workers happy and focused for their entire shift  right  unless i thought so little of them that i thought the only way they could possibly be happy is working for me   edit  opportunity village is where those with intellectual disabilities to simple and mundane jobs in order to have as place in society and be respected and learn skills  they otherwise could not because  well  for example  their iq is 45 ,per31x

152,Only when it effects the boss,so this little rant is for my mom since she has been dealing with it for 20  years  she told me this story   so my mom has been working at her company doing accounts receivable since before i can remember  she was in the same cubicle for 20 years  she was fine with it  other than her neighboring coworkers  constantly she would complain about a chewing so loudly or playing with candy wrappers and b singing to her music all day  or c not answering the phone so my mom has to stop and do it   20 years of her trying to deal with all this while handling million sometimes billion dollar accounts and not being able to focus   of course that wasn't until her boss came to her with this billion dollar account and wanted to work together to make sure it got done right  he came to my mom with it because she was the best one for it and knows her shit  so for about 6 hours one day he wheeled his desk chair out into the hall to sit next to her cubicle and help  about an hour in he was getting somewhat annoyed because a was playing with another candy wrapper and b was singing loudly to her music  he gave offhanded comments about it and they continued    this continue for the next 4 hours until he finally stood up  visibly upset  and just said  how can you work with all this noise  my mom gave him a blank look and just said  this is how it's been for 20 years  there's nothing i can do  the work needs done so i get it done despite the distractions  he shook his head and just said  i'm sorry but i can't have you working on these accounts when you can't focus properly  it could lose us money    of course my mom was heartbroken because she thought she was losing out on these accounts because of her coworkers  even though she gets the work done  her boss walked away for awhile  and came back about an hour later    go ahead and start packing up your cubicle  my mom of course is shocked and said  what do you mean  he laughed and said  you're getting an office  you need quiet to focus and you can't do that out hear    20 years she had been in that cubicle and not until her boss sits where she sits and deals with the same shit does she finally get the office she deserves   hope you enjoyed the happy ending for my mom  she loves her office and even has a window ,peinso

160,We should do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living (Fuller Quote),figured you lot might enjoy my all time favorite quote    we should do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living  it is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest  the youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living  we keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because  according to malthusian darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist  so we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors  the true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living  - buckminster fuller,peoo99

173,Quit my job at the bank commercial banker,let's start at the beginning    i quit my previous job as support for technical building difficulties for which i had zero qualifications  never studied for that at all  buildings with defects with piping or wiring and other building related problem's  however  at one point i got so got at solving problems and doing other people their work that i felt like a raise was due  on my way home i would get casually drunk and think  eh  i'm getting payed  while slowly becoming a alcoholic  i took a holiday for 2 weeks  which i had to cancel previously  even though it was approved  due to understaffing  and when i came back my mailbox was stuffed to the rim  i even got called when i was on my holiday  finally review evaluation time comes and they said  yeah  we wanna keep you  i said  great  i want a pay raise  which they refused  the whole evaluation felt more like extortion honestly  i could've renewed  but i didn't i fuck them   fast forward 3 months i finally applied for recieving unemployment benefits for 3 months  and then social benefits for another 3  but by then i was a full blown alcoholic and depressed  i got called by a random recruiter who offered me a job back at the bank  but my certificates were out of date and needed to be renewed usually you get a month for the basic one  i had to do it in 10 day's  then second one in 15  but by that time i was no longer a humans human  after recieving and reviewing the offered contract from the middle man  there was no pension  the salary wasn't that much better than my previous engagement and made me feel worse because i had to travel for an hour to get there  it does get compensated at the end of the month  the staff i worked with already decided i wasn't suited for the role as daily bank advisor  because i wouldn't open up about my feelings  honestly i'm not that social  i'm a salesman in everything  i used to work for another commercial bank  but ok  so they proceeded to place me at another spot  which was worse  made me even more depressed  i finally decided to quit and leave  i can't handle talking to much while i'm trying to do a job  talking just to talk messes me up  working at the bank selling my soul messes me up  getting underpaid and scamming messes me up  i left and didn't even look back   i signed up for college after looking for a job again and immediately went nope this is not worth it  they accepted me and all but it's not worth it  the pricing  the commercialization is out of hand  the books are to damn expensive  so now i'm just sitting outside on the balcony of this house which is more a kin to a doghouse or trap house  just feeling like a failure  as if the basic programming which everybody i know with a job is running in their head  except for me in my head it's broken  the installation went wrong and now i need to figure out what to do   that's it  that's all  i just needed to vent,pf3inc

328,How to rip a team apart,so the company i worked for was taken over last year and the new company promised that our positions would be safe for two years  roll on april and a couple weeks after the transition was finalised the new company announced that there was going to be a restructure and were expecting 30  job losses  needless to say this didn t go down very well with everyone  coinciding with the fact that they invited people to the meeting less than an hour before it was due to take place so lots of people couldn t make it and had to find out from word of mouth and they then just palmed off our questions to our team leaders who themselves had no idea about this announcement and were not consulted at any point  not even our regional manager had any idea about it   a few weeks later and they release the new structure of the organisation  and we find that our position has been renamed as  administrator   bearing in mind that my job is a technical and professional position which requires a degree we felt this was a bit of an insult  we were also informed we would have to re-interview for a job that i ve done for the past 6 years   after we analysed the new structure as a team we realised large parts of our job role was unaccounted for and we were told that under no circumstances we would be required to do this part of the job anymore in the new job role  but a couple months later these duties made their way back to us   we also noticed that on the new job profile there was no mention of where this job would be based  we enquired about this but did not get an answer  enquired again  no answer  it got to 1 week before the deadline and still no answer as to where the job would be based so i got in touch with an employment advice service and explained this and they were staggered that they wouldn t tell us this basic level of information along with everything else and advised me to raise an official complaint  i raised the complaint and was told that the job would be based out of another office approx 100 miles  4 5 hour commute there and back  away from where it is now and no explanation as to why or other than  working as a team is more productive  but was told at the same time that the new office isn t big enough to accommodate the whole team and also we ve been working from home for 18 months and the team has been more productive in this period then ever before  so the move in my mind makes no sense at all other than to justify the company building this new office  we also found out that 3 people from outside the team had been assigned three of our positions without interview or assessment which we thought was unfair   why do we have to reinterview for our own job but someone who doesn t do our job gets the job without the interview   anyway to present day and approximately half of our team have left the company and the other half are wanting to leave from conversations i ve had with them  we had a team briefing basically saying as a company we are way behind target to where we have ever been before but they couldn t seem to connect the dots that this might be because half the team has left and the other half have zero motivation to work for this company anymore and are desperate to leave as a result of all of this  the company has now had to put in a recovery plan because we are behind target  asking us to do overtime to recover the deficit  you can imagine how that went down  it s been clear from the very beginning that the senior management didn t value us as employees or as a team  thinking that our jobs were a basic administrative job role but actually requires a degree and a deep knowledge and understanding of the industry   now that they are so far behind target they might be starting to realise how valuable we are  but too little too late as half the team are already gone and the other half can t wait to get out of the door  it s going to be interesting to see how things are in a few months time    i ve secured a new job elsewhere and just waiting for the paperwork to be done before i can leave  looking forward to telling them why i m leaving  i ve been wanting to change jobs for a while but this gave me the motivation to look for a new career which i m excited about starting  so thanks for that    ok that was a long post  longer than i was expecting  guess i needed to rant and get this off my chest haha  so this is my first time posting anything like this so please so let me know if i need to change anything   thanks for reading ,pdvddt

343,"How do I leave a job that pays well but has a big mental toll on me, while a super positive work environment near me pays less?",currently i m 18 years old  i used to hate going to work for a restaurant near me and dreaded going everyday  i d always try and find a way to call off    my mom offered me a job that a friend of hers had available  it pays  15 an hour but it s absolutely awful  it s a construction restoration job and it s easily one of the most stressful things i ve done   something about being in charge of ruining or fixing someone s hundred thousand dollar houses gives me severe anxiety  and on top of that my boss hates that i ask so many question on what to do   i ve never done that type of stuff before so i make sure to ask what to do all the time because i m just oblivious  however it s really taking a toll on my mental health and i got a second job at that same restaurant and i love it  been working there for about a month and all of my issues from before were gone  horrible boss that used to be there  gone and replaced by easily the best boss someone could have  annoying coworkers that were immature 24 7  fired and new people  that are awesome  have been hired for weeks   the only issue is it pays so much less than my restoration job  around  10 an hour compared to  15  is there some way to get rid of the dread i feel driving to that job every day and how to deal with the stress of knowing nothing about the job and how it works    how would i go about quitting that job  do i just tell the restoration boss that i m done and leave  a main problem is that he is a family friend  i just feel stuck ,pefaxd
344,Is having a good reference even worth it,i worked for a video production company for 2 years  as the lead video editor on our tv shows  my position quickly extended to other things due to understaffing  like singlehandedly editing and updating the website  fixing all of the computer issues  and basically being my boss  personal tech support agent  he even gave me his daughter s laptop  expecting i d take it home and fix it for him  which i did  for all of this  i was paid  12 hr and hired as a contractor so i didn t get any rights  days off  or benefits  also if i went overtime it was not paid    eventually  i couldn t take it anymore  and once my photography business started taking off i tried to quit  instead of being allowed to quit  my boss said that it s important i keep him on my side so i had to stay until he found a replacement  and train them  i ended up staying for 6 extra weeks  and then after leaving continually trained the new employee over the phone whenever he had any questions or didn t know how to do something  of course  i m not being paid for this    in the meantime  photographing weddings and doing portraits has paid far better and been genuinely rewarding for me  i put together a website for my business  and thought i d also include some videos i edited when i worked at that company since i should use my  talents  in video production to make some extra money  well  one day my old boss asked me to do more free work for him  this time helping manage a project with one of his producers  i jumped on email and assisted to the best of my ability  this time with my new email that has my website in it  well  after cc ing my old boss  he saw the website and dug through it  he found that i had included my video work in my portfolio  and immediately went into a cease and desist  i had to scrub all my work from my website that he owned the copyright to that day  or else he d get a lawyer involved    after that  i ve lost all motivation to keep him happy  yesterday  he asked i literally code and design a new page for his website  again unpaid since i literally don t work for him anymore  and i simply haven t responded to him  i know i want to settle down into another job eventually  and feel like i need references  but i m not sure if my dignity is worth it  am i in the wrong for refusing to help at this point ,peh0ir

373,All of the sh*tty jobs that nobody wants should be automated,it is more than possible and only a matter of time until that happens  but the problem is  automation is a way for the rich to cut labor costs  making them even richer  needless to say  that shouldn't be  automation could be the saving grace that finally grants us freedom  nobody would have to be a slave to a job like mcdonalds and amazon anymore and waste their lives away    the rich don't want that  they want profit  and as previously mentioned if we don't profit from automation  they do  and that's great for them  after all  they could have a golden bathhouse next to their garage full of sportscars  get an even bigger private movie-theater and wipe their asses with five  no  ten ply toilet paper  having useless luxuries like that is worth so much to them that they would like to see the citizens starve to death  after all  if we don't work for them  what use are we   if the benefits of automation come to the masses  we would see amazing things happening  everyone could pursue their passion  doing arts like playing music and drawing  pursuing an athletic career  and most of all  pursuing everything scientific  i'm putting emphasis on the last one  because new discoveries and inventions can bring us as a collective much further  we could achieve amazing things  like terraform venus and colonize it   how we would do it https www youtube com watch v g-wo-z-quwi   for anyone interested  we could likely see society as a whole improving rapidly after automation  as everyone will be happier  more likely to contribute and would generally want to have problems to solve  societal problems in this case  what we could also see is an optimization of the school systems  i assume you're all aware of how terrible the school systems are  that's because the school systems are engineered to make us workers  not to actually educate us  if everyone were qualified to become a scientist  then nobody would work a sh t job  the rich know that and set the school systems up to interfere with the education of the masses    two paths lie ahead of us  one where we as a collective can achieve unbelievable things and bring humanity to a point it has never seen before  another where nothing meaningful is created  the masses starve and suffer  all because jeff bezos wanted to fly to space in his dickcraft again  it's up for us to decide ,pds2wm

396,So I applied for a new position in a different department at my job and HR fucked it up. Now I’m laughing my ass off watching my managers pick up the pieces,so i decided to apply for a higher paying position in a different department at my company since shit hit the fan when my director left   he basically ran the entire company  all the executives are leaving and a lot of other folks leaving at every level too   i am aware that this is a red flag but i know this company is not going anywhere anytime soon    my current job is pretty easy  i m the youngest person working there and have made reputation for doing a good job despite me putting in the minimum effort 90  of the time  the new department i applied for is much more work stress and less freedom but the pay is a lot better   about 40  higher pay  after applying  i was guaranteed the position since they wanted me so badly    after a couple weeks i come to find out that hr sent my offer letter to the wrong person  someone who has the same first name and a similar last name as me  the manager of the wrong guy hr sent it to got involved and told my associate manager  associate manager came to me about it and said i could do whatever  but he would like me to stay  i told him i m not committing to anything until i see a job offer to review  my manager comes back from vacation and panics when he finds out what happened and has a long ass convo with me about getting me a promotion to stay in my current department  i simply tell him i am making no commitments until i have a job offer in hand to review  if he wants to keep me  i told him to talk with his boss and give me an offer to stay    now there are rumors going around of me switching departments and everyone is begging me to stay where i am or else they will leave too  lol  all i say is  i don t know what you re talking about  i know nothing  i somehow managed to get all the managers under my thumb thanks to hr fucking up  its pretty hilarious to watch since i don t give a fuck about this company  they let all their talent leave and the only good ones that are left only stay since the job is close to home or because they are buying their time until they have enough years under their belt to apply elsewhere  i only stay since i love my shift  2nd shift  four 10 hours shifts  and i can leave early if things are dead   i still get full pay regardless of what time i leave  the only drawback is i have to do a decent amount of ot   which i m fine with since my managers approve my timecard no matter what  all ot is paid time and a half  if it wasn t i would never do it    being antiwork makes this whole experience so much more fun to watch unfold  i plan on staying in my current position and will negotiate a  2 pay bump  they want to make me a manager for my current department but there is no way in hell i will ever accept that position knowing how fucked up things are within the company  i don t need that much more stress  the manager position they were considering me for in my current department is salary instead of hourly too  fuck that  with the amount of ot i rack in i d be losing money   tldr  i applied for a higher paying position in a different department at my company  got in but my offer letter was sent to the wrong person  now my current department is scrambling to make me an offer to stay where i am and become a manager  i still have not received my offer letter and i am enjoying watching it all blow up in their faces,pdnywl

418,I'm 22 UK and spend all my time near tears panicking about what type of labor I want to perform and it feels pathetic,i just graduated with what is basically an associate degree in computing  a vague term meaning my college jammed it and software development modules together into one unusable mess  and turns out i hate technology and it  so since my course ended  and the last six months of the course really  i have been almost constantly on the verge of spiralling into a panic attack because i can't pick what type of labor to do  the idea of doing meaningless admin for the rest of my life makes me feel dead inside  but anything i think could have meaning for me like nursing  agriculture  law  civil service  art or policing seem to be so incredibly stressful with no support  or pay min wage  and with automation and climate change i worry about whatever i pick not being here in 5-10 years    it's just so sad and pathetic that this is the sum of our lives  choosing how we want to make someone else profits  my life hasn't even properly started and i already dead every moment of it  how the f do people live with this  is it something wrong with me  idk just needed a place to get this off my chest ,pdam49

420,60 hours a week is apparently what I should be happy with,i had a conversation with a friend of my family regarding job searching  she's been pretty understanding after i quit my last job for being all over the place with my schedule  i'm talking a 1-hour commute for minimum wage and constantly having to close at 2 am  only to work the next morning  i've been helping out a family member with her company and it's been helpful to learn from that   recently  i got an email about a job opportunity  it had competitive pay  unlimited time off  and all the other stupid buzzwords you see on linkedin indeed that are either misleading or lies  well  the catch was that they wanted me to move to washington dc and work  60 hours a week  it didn't specify whether this way 5 days or 6 days a week  but either way that's kind of ridiculous especially for the job responsibilities  business manager or something like that    when i bought this up to her and how insane it sounded  she gives me a sour look and gives me the  you gotta take what you can get  spiel  i try to explain that 60 hours a week won't give me any time to myself and i'll just be exhausted every day  but it just falls on deaf ears and she tells me  i'm young   honestly  it stunned me how she acts like wanting a typical 8-hour workday for 5 days a week is now asking for too much  don't get me wrong  she's a very nice woman and i consider her a supportive person  but i think she's way too ingrained in this idea that a job will give you fulfillment when the last job i had made me want to physically hurt myself  i don't consider myself a lazy person  i try to keep busy with things like exercising  writing  etc  but i won't lie  it breaks my heart that the line in which people start to look at you as lazy begins when you don't want to physically and emotionally exhaust yourself for 60 hours a week  hell  40 hours a week is already being considered too much let alone 60 ,pddcwi

424,"Not anti-work, but not all Business owners are bad",this isn t anti-work post but honestly i wanted to share this   my parents are business owners   i ve seen them struggle a lot to keep business afloat during the crash of  08 and during the pandemic   one thing i ve learned from them is to always take care of your employees  because it s not the owner that brings in the money  it s the sales people and the laborers that do   they keep your business running   i ve seen my parents not pay themselves for months to help keep their workers employed  i ve seen them sell their house to keep their workers employed   in return  they still gave their workers bonuses  they would provide lunches for them once a month to help keep morale up and would also invite their workers to eat at their home with a home cooked meal as a way to say thanks for staying through the tough times   my dad even hired a person that used to be a waiter that got laid off during the pandemic  just so he could teach him a trade and help him put food on the table for his little family   my dad stopped paying himself so he could teach this man   moral of the story is  companies need to take care of their workers  and in return  the workers will take care of the company ,pdc4ve

440,My full-time job is causing my high blood pressure.,a bit of a venting session  if you relate please feel free to offer any advice or your opinions on what i should do  does anyone else have experience with this  what did you do to improve your health    ---  i work in an elementary school with children with autism  some of the children have behaviors  especially the children that are just going into kindergarten  they often hit  bite  pull hair  and scratch  they can also sometimes just bolt out the door  i have had to run after certain children a lot  and the worst thing about it is that they seem to find it amusing that you're running after them  so there is always the predicament of either running after them and making them run more or not running after them to see if they'll stop running because they aren't getting a reaction from you    i try to not let this affect me  but i find that it really does  last school year i got to a point where i felt so stressed by the work that i had to have a few drinks after work just to calm down  as you can imagine this was a mistake as well  and when i showed any signs of stress at work i was reprimanded for not being  positive  and not  trying hard enough  it also didn't help that i had a coworker who seemed to have something against me  as she would often complain to the boss that i wasn't doing good work   don't get me wrong  i love the children  i enjoy working with kids  and i love seeing them grow and learn new skills  and they're just funny  i have such good relationships with certain kids  i love doing art and one of my students always asks me to draw things for him  so we work for that and it's a lot of fun  but it's like i'm expected by the teacher and my supervisors to not have emotions  i've even been reprimanded for drawing for students too much  it's something that both they and i enjoy and i'm getting in trouble for it   anyway  because of the stress of work  and college  and the increased drinking  and weight gain  my blood pressure has started to spike  prior to starting the job i had slightly raised blood pressure  like 130 80  but compared to today  a few minutes ago it was 149 100  my health is deteriorating  and now i've been prescribed beta blockers  i'm 27 and i'm on beta blockers     amp x200b   i wish i could find a job that is less stressful but i have over half a decade of experience in this field  and the only other work i've done was in retail and food service  i don't want to go back to either of those ,pddx8j

507,1 hour for lunch is not enough,i have always thought this and i feel like no one talks about it  1 hour for lunch sounds like a long time  but it's not  if you're using lunch to do an errand  you might realistically have 20 mins of transit time from your work to the errand  and another 20 min back - leaving you with 20 min to do what you need to do  then if you use it for an errand  you haven't had lunch - so what happens  you buy something and eat it at your desk  it feels unsanitary and i want to separate where i work and where i live   the idea of 'going out to lunch' with someone sounds great - but realistically  you can't fit a social lunch in to 1 hour  including transit time  ordering  conversation  eating  i have tried it before and the entire time i just felt rushed and like i would get in trouble  i can't enjoy the lunch break because i'm worried about not making it back within the 1 hour time slot  the expectation of working 9-5 and a 1 hour lunch break makes it pretty much impossible to socialise and do pleasurable things during the day  that's such a simple fact  but i feel robbed of that because i've been a student for so long and i'm just entering the work force   even if the only activity you do is eat your own lunch on your lunch break  1 hour isn't enough  you can't decompress from work and psych yourself up again in that time and have it be relaxing   what i wrote here is based on summer office jobs i've had  i'm lucky enough that i got my first real job during the pandemic - so it's been totally remote  i am amazed at how much time i can get back this way - no transit time  i can make lunch during work pretty much  putting pasta on and leaving it etc  so i can actually take a full lunch break to myself  i can walk my dog for 40 min during my lunch break  i can do errands in down time  i am lucky that i have a really amazing boss  and i'm doing a job that i think puts good things into the world - but man its crazy how many hours in the week are not your own   my ideal work week would be 5 days of just mornings   i'm rambling now - but let me know what you think of the 1 hour lunch break and what you do in yours ,pctssc

540,Criticizing Kevin Paffrath's proposal of concentration camp for the homeless,though it might sound humane at first  kevin's idea of using the national guard on civilians in peacetime to remove homeless from californian streets within 3 months is inherently tyrannical   he'd apparently then force them into new state concentration camps against their will  even the language of using the army to keep the streets safe until the homeless are removed is fascistic   i don't like having homeless people on the streets  but what he is proposing is crossing the line  he was literally proposing having the national guard on the streets  picture them carrying assault rifles   to keep them secure from the homeless  which only works if you actually think we're living in fucking afghanistan  once he builds his concentration camps he'd then shove any hippy who just wanted to sleep under the stars in at gunpoint   even the language of using the army in peacetime on americans to ostensibly  keep the streets safe  until the homeless are removed is fascistic and it sets a dangerous precedent  and then how do we decide who has to go to paffrath camp  and who gets to stay at their friend's house  how do you ever get to leave the camp if you don't even have means to earn money there  it's just a rich man's sadistic fantasy to put away the undesirables that make him feel dirty   it's like how in the not so long ago past in england there were  poor laws  to criminalize poverty and being unemployed  christuan society used to think the unemployed were only lazy  so we would imprison them in prisons and force them to do grueling slave labor to make the prison owner a millionaire  because not working was considered a malaise  these laws didn't apply to the rich unemployed  but only the poor  and especially for single women  and women who were prostitutes   i don't want to bring back forced relocations of people which have never in history been used as a tool to solve economic disparities  these heavy handed methods have only accelerated the divide between the haves and the have-nots  it reminds me of the japanese internment and the relocation of native americans from plentiful forests to barren deserts where they would be jobless and starve   i made a new forum to criticize the man who wants to replace governor newsom in ca ,pct816

550,Nice to see some fellow slackers with a purpose,feels nice to see this sub  i've felt guilty and out of place for years and used to blame myself for every job i had just feeling crappy  and for me being unable to tolerate it  i would become symptomatic physically and mentally usually within a year of starting  and have to stop work from that  in retrospect i thank my body for knowing before my brain that quitting was a way to avoid hours and hours of sickening scheduled bullshit - whether it was an obligation to be nice to creeps at work  to field clients' anger at the front desk as a 22 year old when the management responsible were tucked away safely in offices  being micromanaged or being judged for my performance without being supported  i never felt like part of whatever work 'family' was  and it seemed like i had to sell my soul to join in  it was always extremely grating to try and understand the logic behind this asslicking idea of what work was supposed to be - reading bits and pieces from the communist manifesto in my late teens did not prepare me for the level of alienation in labour these days  when i was at uni i had a huge burnout and got glandular fever in part because the placements i'd done made it abundantly clear that i was gearing up for a life on a fluorescently lit treadmill  and that me working so hard to be qualified wasn't going to be a way to protect me - it was an initiation rite into being walked all over for decades  i still have trouble with huge levels of dissociative inertia at times of day that used to be for getting ready and going to work or uni  and decompressing from work study - it's left this awful residue on my life long after stopping to protect my health  i have faith that i will find my way into  work  that is meaningful and self-directed one day  but i don't really want to call it that  for now i want to keep gardening and making the area around me nicer  and rehabilitating ,pcndeu

561,Criticizing Kevin Paffrath's proposal of concentration camp for the homeless,though it might sound humane at first  kevin's idea of using the national guard on civilians in peacetime to remove homeless from californian streets within 3 months is inherently tyrannical   he'd apparently then force them into new state concentration camps against their will  even the language of using the army to keep the streets safe until the homeless are removed is fascistic   i don't like having homeless people on the streets  but what he is proposing is crossing the line  he was literally proposing having the national guard on the streets  picture them carrying assault rifles   to keep them secure from the homeless  which only works if you actually think we're living in fucking afghanistan  once he builds his concentration camps he'd then shove any hippy who just wanted to sleep under the stars in at gunpoint   even the language of using the army in peacetime on americans to ostensibly  keep the streets safe  until the homeless are removed is fascistic and it sets a dangerous precedent  and then how do we decide who has to go to paffrath camp  and who gets to stay at their friend's house  how do you ever get to leave the camp if you don't even have means to earn money there  it's just a rich man's sadistic fantasy to put away the undesirables that make him feel dirty   it's like how in the not so long ago past in england there were  poor laws  to criminalize poverty and being unemployed  christuan society used to think the unemployed were only lazy  so we would imprison them in prisons and force them to do grueling slave labor to make the prison owner a millionaire  because not working was considered a malaise  these laws didn't apply to the rich unemployed  but only the poor  and especially for single women  and women who were prostitutes   i don't want to bring back forced relocations of people which have never in history been used as a tool to solve economic disparities  these heavy handed methods have only accelerated the divide between the haves and the have-nots  it reminds me of the japanese internment and the relocation of native americans from plentiful forests to barren deserts where they would be jobless and starve   i made a new forum to criticize the man who wants to replace governor newsom in ca   r enoughkevinpaffrath,pct6p5

577,1 hour is not long enough for lunch,i have always thought this and i feel like no one talks about it  1 hour for lunch sounds like a long time  but it's not  if you're using lunch to do an errand  you might realistically have 20 mins of transit time from your work to the errand  and another 20 min back - leaving you with 20 min to do what you need to do  then if you use it for an errand  you haven't had lunch - so what happens  you buy something and eat it at your desk  it feels unsanitary and i want to separate where i work and where i live   the idea of 'going out to lunch' with someone sounds great - but realistically  you can't fit a social lunch in to 1 hour  including transit time  ordering  conversation  eating  i have tried it before and the entire time i just felt rushed and like i would get in trouble  i can't enjoy the lunch break because i'm worried about not making it back within the 1 hour time slot  the expectation of working 9-5 and a 1 hour lunch break makes it pretty much impossible to socialise and do pleasurable things during the day  that's such a simple fact  but i feel robbed of that because i've been a student for so long and i'm just entering the work force   even if the only activity you do is eat your own lunch on your lunch break  1 hour isn't enough  you can't decompress from work and psych yourself up again in that time and have it be relaxing     amp x200b   what i wrote here is based on summer office jobs i've had  i'm lucky enough that i got my first real job during the pandemic - so it's been totally remote  i am amazed at how much time i can get back this way - no transit time  i can make lunch during work pretty much  putting pasta on and leaving it etc  so i can actually take a full lunch break to myself  i can walk my dog for 40 min during my lunch break  i can do errands in down time  i am lucky that i have a really amazing boss  and i'm doing a job that i think puts good things into the world - but man its crazy how many hours in the week are not your own    my ideal work week would be 5 days of just mornings    amp x200b   i'm rambling now - but let me know what you think of the 1 hour lunch break and what you do in yours ,pctp7w

585,I sometimes wonder what the point of all this is.,if you link about the average life of a human it all seems pointless at times  you spend most of you childhood going to school roughly 8-5 year after year   sound familiar  and when your finally done what do you get a in the end  a high school diploma which it turns out to be pretty fucking useless   so what are the options  well you could go into the military but it looks like we might be headed back to afghanistan for another 20 years so maybe not such a good idea   what about a trade  trades are good to get into and you can make some pretty decent money  the world needs electricians  plumber and mechanics  the problem is that most trade labor is hard manual work again nothing wrong with that but if you plan on working in the trades your entire working career but the time you hit retirement you body is going to be so worn out and broken down you probably won't have much of a retirement or i should say a pain free retirement    what about college  sure sink yourself into an insane amount of debt for most likely a useless degree  not all college degrees are useless just most of them   sound familiar  then after acquiring said degree you have to battle it out in the same job market with hundreds of other people with useless degrees battling for the same job with shit pay  shit benefits  and shit management  but at least the company can brag every quarter about all the insane profits they are making and then when it come time for a raise what do you get  a couple of percent   i use to find it strange that in in high school they never really taught you how to start your own business but now i'm pretty sure it's all by design  fml,pctipp

Here is my resignation letter,i had received multiple requests for an update from my post last week where i gave a very professional  fuck you  pay me  letter  with grammar mistakes  due to a final conflict that was the final straw for me  so here is what happened following    the next day we had an 8a m call that everyone was required to attend  which i obviously did not  however since i sent the letter around 7p m the night before i didn't know if my manager would have called me asking where i was  8 30 came by and i received a response from hr     they responded thanking me for their time  and stated that after performing an audit they noticed  20 hours of overtime that was unpaid and will be included on my final paycheck   it was as simple as that  no back and forth  no arguing  they did a simple count and paid out  there were plenty of hours i probably could have gotten but those would have been a little more difficult to prove since it wasn't  tracked  on the desktop software  however  i was not worried about it    i did notice they didn't include my bonus in there and responded stating  i did not see the final paycheck breakdown include my bonus for closed loans  per our contract and the report  which i pulled the night before and attached  i am entitled to a  250 bonus  please include this    manager responded  glad you caught that  that's literally it  my immediate team lead  one of the ones that butted heads called  and i didn't answer  he left a voice-mail asking me to call him back and i never did  two of the los called  these two were on a team and were the only 2 people i got along with  asking what happened and if everything was okay  i explained the situation to them and it turns out that the company has been through  8 mortgage processors in the past year for the same reason  the loan processors that quit before me with a 2 weeks notice the company let go on the spot anyway  both of these loan officers stated i could use them for a reference and wished me luck and they understood which meant a lot to me     i had a recruiter i worked with in the past open my file back up  and had an interview scheduled 2 days later  today i heard back from them for a remote job offer making  5 hr more and a slightly better loan bonus structure  1 500ish a month  the company averages a smaller workload than i'm used to which means less work and the recruiter had a long relationship with them  apparently they all are the  laid back  easy going  types     so  all in all i got what was owed to me - i had a week off  albeit stressful  and i got a new job offer making more  while also causing the old job to be in a tough spot due to the  urgent  loan closings i had  i'm happy with the results    so  a happy ending for this one  and because i knew my rights and stood up for myself i got what was rightfully owed  shouldn't have to but it is what it is  thanks all for the support ,pc6z12

748,Four month unpaid internship that encouraged me to keep on studying [Long],this happened a couple of years ago  but i am still super salty about it since it kinda changed the plans i made for myself on a personal and a professional level for the next five years  it is still the worst working experience i had so far and i've had plenty of internships and student jobs since   in the first half of 2016  i was finishing my bachelor's degree in legal practise  with this degree  i was planning on becoming a paralegal  hoping to become a legal counsel after a couple years of experience  part of the three year program was a nearly full semester  mandatory  internship whilst writing a bachelor dissertation   i found an internship at the headquarters of one of the biggest banks in my country in a department that deals with the assets of it's deceased clients  i had two conversations before my starting date with the head of department  who was a lawyer  there is a certain kind of lawyers that looks down on paralegals  put a pin that   my first day  the head of department showed me my desk and   asked what the purpose of the internship was  even though the school send her loads of information  i told her that i was suppose to perform tasks that someone with my degree would do  she told me okay but that my laptop and account weren't there yet and that it could take another day or two  no problem  i brought my own laptop in case i needed to do some kind of research    no  no  you won't be doing any research  that's for the  actual  legally trained  take a seat next to  colleague's name  you can observe and assist until your laptop arrives tomorrow and your account is ready  okay  no problem  i guess  but  tomorrow  turned out to mean  two months from now  so half my internship  i was seated next to a colleague  just watching them work  eight hours a day  for two months  watching someone perform tasks i wasn't allowed to do    no big deal  you'd think  considering i wasn't getting paid anyway  but the problem was that the head of department needed to evaluate my performances every month and send a report to the school  since i didn't perform any tasks  however  she gave me bad grades on all marks    after two months i finally got my laptop  which turned out was already waiting for me on day 1  as was the account  the head of department just didn't bother to check  i then thought i was able to do some actual  para legal work  she told me i could answer incoming phone calls of clients  read  next of kin  and answer their questions  i was okay with this  considering many of them had  semi- legal questions  occasionally  a lawyer or notary would call  so that was fun    one day a colleague of mine got a question from a client concerning a specific legal matter  our head of department  lawyer  and the other legal counsel were not present  so she feared she couldn't help the client  however  since i had training as a paralegal  i was actually able to help out  i was kinda proud of myself that since it was a fairly complicated matter  i explained the client and he was happy    the next day  however  my head of department found out that i helped a client with a legal matter and she was livid  remember when i said that some lawyers look down on paralegals  yeah  shit hit the proverbial fan and i was right in the splash zone  how dare i answer a legal question when i was not a lawyer  how dare i diminish her degree and make a fool of lawyers by thinking i could perform their job  yadiyada  all of the  usual  things  after that day i was no longer allowed to answer incoming calls and only was allowed to do outgoing calls    these outgoing calls consisted of calling the next of kin of a recently deceased   recently  meant that the deceased had been death for one week  some people are able to answer questions about their deceased loved one one week after their passing  some are not  though i was a bit hesitant to call the family of a recently deceased one week after their passing  it was my job so i did it  i was polite  and understanding if people broke down  which happened regularly  i was just happy to be doing something  only  i was only allowed to make max  5 calls each day  after they were done  i had to  observe  colleagues for tasks she did not allow me to do  my chef made sure that the clients i did call were always the most difficult conversations to have  like the mother of a 14 year old who killed himself or a father whose daughter got killed in an accident    the final month of the internship  the head of department instructed the entire team to increase the numbers on the booklets we send out  these booklets was a free  informational brochure with more information about what needed to happen with the banking accounts  insurances    etc of the deceased  she instructed us to always ask  read  push  the clients if they were interested in the brochure and send as many as possible  the other headquarter offices had sent about 120 out past month  since my head of department and i weren't really seeing eye to eye after the whole deal with the phone call  i thought i'd to an effort to amp up our office's numbers  by the end of my internship  our office had sent out 157 of these booklets  101 of them were sent out by me  the other 56 were divided over twelve other employers  the head of department never even acknowledged the work i had done to sent out these shitty booklets and even congratulated herself that we had the highest number of all firms     after the above mentioned call  people were also shifting blame to me for files i wasn't even working on  i could here people over the phone saying  oh  yeah  we've an intern  must have been his fault  i wasn't allowed to do anything besides answering phone calls  how could anything be my fault  complaining to my chef wasn't an option since any time i went over to her she sighed and rolled her eyes  i just kept on working the best i could for the little work i head  she also shifted blame on me  though she frigging knew she didn't allowed me to do anything    remember the bachelor dissertation  she was supposed to read it and ask questions on my presentation which she new prior to me starting  when someone from the school came for the presentation  she  threw  my dissertation on the desk in front of her and ask  was i supposed to do anything with this 'cause i didn't really care about it  as if she didn't knew  after the presentation was done  the representative from the school asked what my plans were after graduating  i told her i was fiddling with the idea of going to university and try to complete the bridging program so i could hopefully obtain my master of laws and become a lawyer  'cause  y'know  i was treated as shit as a paralegal  my head of department scoffed and said  are you sure you wanna do that  cause that's only for a select few  y'know  i don't think you have the maturity for that    perhaps i was a bit na ve to think she'd like the fact that i sent out almost as much booklets on my own than the other office did with their entire team  that i was there each and every day  often staying late in case something came up that i could help with  but alas  the grade she gave me was barely enough to pass  since the internship was 25  of the entire credit of the entire program  she made sure i wasn't getting any kind of distinction on my grade  which in our line of work is always a big plus on your resume  i was so fed up and distraught by the way she treated me  i thought  if this is how paralegals are treated  i am not having it    so yeah  i enrolled in the bridging program for the master of laws  even though it was  only for a select few and i wasn't mature enough  completed the bridging program  cum laude  earned my master of laws  cum laude  and just now an advanced master    this set me back 5 years  as i wasn't planning on studying after graduating as a paralegal  in stead of working for five years and gaining working experience  earning money to being my life as i was planning  i went to uni for the next five years  continuing to study and proving this woman wrong and that i could actually achieve something ,pbc2k3

765,Moral Dilemma: Should I Strike October 15?,hello  antiwork     i am a government employee in a major american city  i have worked in welfare for four years now  amp  have seen the myriad ways in which people fall through the cracks  are criminally neglected  and ultimately are betrayed by their communities and government  the experience has made me jaded  to say the least  and my instinct is to participate in a general strike  since clinton's welfare reforms in the mid-'90s  welfare  or 'self-sufficiency programs' as they like to heinously brand them  has served to provide toxic employers with a large  pliable supply of labor   there are far less people receiving cash assistance today than before the reforms https scheerpost com 2021 08 23 peter-edelman-what-democrats-did-to-welfare-is-coming-back-to-haunt-them  i know from our own government budgets that we take most of the money  if we get  100 to spend on these programs  my organization takes  55 for ourselves and gives  45 to the clients  i think that's grotesque  considering all we do is manage information  take applications renewals periodic reports in  dole out benefits  we don't perform surgeries  we don't actually hire or train people  we push them into the dystopian  modern american workplace at all costs       on the other hand  we do give the people something  even if it is paltry  and many of the work requirements have been waived since covid-19 was declared an emergency  strikers aren't allowed to receive benefits  but we barely verify anything  you could all just  inadvertently  omit that from your applications  us government workers are either too overworked underpaid to diligently do that  or we're too corrupt and preoccupied with counting down the days until we get our pensions to care  it's about half evil  half stupid in here  still  i am torn on whether i should continue to support a corrupt system because of the meager benefits it may provide to others       what do you recommend  antiwork  keep doling out food stamps or take a walk outside on october 15      p s   our union is corrupt  bought-off  and has repeatedly sold out its members https www wsws org en articles 2017 09 19 sdco-s19 html  i don't think we've had a strike since 1994  so  i won't be working with them too closely  i've already voiced my opinion to strike with them  amp  will address them in person in a couple weeks       amp x200b   cheers      some goon who couldn't find better work in this shit economy,pbjivh

Thoughts?,so i discovered this old song about when metallica attempted being a superband  and i can't tell if it's the bastardization of music  or a huge accomplishment of the system    then the more you hear the lyrics  it sounds like what goes on in rich detached peoples minds  like  you thought it was over  hahaha here we go and do it again   it's confusing because metallica is this symbol of working class and rage against the machine is about raging against the machine  but yet here they are laughing about this    the making of we did it again by metallica and ja rule https m youtube com watch v vif1umz7wrw ,pb6q6j

the new boss who chastises u for time theft when u clock in late by 2mins yet punch out 10mins late every shift  the one who loves to invasively bagcheck every customer they can  because woe betide the company losing the revenue from a loaf of bread that a clearly struggling single mum tried to hide under her trolley   i worked at a large supermarket chain and would sometimes wish that people with real financial struggles just went ahead and shoplifted more  seriously - by the time an item is being scanned any losses to damage theft impact primarily on the business's revenue as they are the final stage before a consumer pays for a product  the farmer  shelf stocker  truckdriver etc have all been compensated already  and while i know losses from theft are passed on to the consumer via higher prices  but somehow never via cutting executive bonuses  hmm  if you knew how much we write off as wastage every single day you'd understand  shoplifting losses where i am barely dent the bottom line    so i cheer for the thieves  i dont do it myself as no product would come close to being worth losing my job  but i do however often notice  ignore  and then internally cheer for a shoplifter if i see them doing their thing and they're being kind  not rude and otherwise pleasant then i often pretend not to notice and just wish them a good day    i mean  do they think i would be enthusiastic to confront a petty thief  zero training is provided on how to go about this btw  because he's stealing some shit from a billion dollar company when the stolen items comined value is a tenth of our daily writeoff stock value  nah bro  i aint a bootlicker like that    which brings me to my true rant of rage  has anyone else worked with those retail workers  often in middle manager - type positions at megacorporations like coles-myer group or similar giants like aldi  woolies etc who will fire a struggling employee over a stolen pack of gum and then feel good about it  they seriously disgust me -literally serving as corporate lapdogs being manipulated to enrich their masters and all without the self awarenes or humility to ever see the company-employee relationship for how subtly abusive nd exploitative it is  or to recognise how large corporations cleverly exploit their employees psychology and emotions to breed loyalty to company and incentivise behaviours which produce maximum profits for the top executives   if only i knew how to show them  the company-koolaid-drinkers i mean  the confronting reality of their embarassing waste of their one go at existance  the bootlickers often trading a third or more of each of their days - irrecoverable  'single use only' days - of which they'll never  ever get back  priceless memories and rich  human experiences  all traded for the sycophantic pursuit of enriching someone whom they're unlikely to have ever even met  whose personal drive to acquire wealth has surpassed their practical needs and caused currency itself to alter its primary role for them  from a redeemable promisory note entitling the bearer to a quantity of gold or silver  to simply a medium of amassing power  influence and immunity from the laws and restrictions that are intended to apply to all citizens equally     other immoral yet legal things such as the ability to influence legislature and policies in self serving ways through political donations and deals  as well as gain access to other arbiters of wealth and power  which can then pool their financial and political influence synergistically to not only form a positive feedback loop of gaining wealth and power simply for wealth and powers' sake  to the detriment of the rest of society  but also to directly influence geopolitics  public policy and even public opinion on specific issues by simply utillising their own media companies to generate support of their agenda  and paying for the same from any they dont yet own  this enables ceos of megacorps and the ultrarich to directly influence the very tone and direction of society  just look at murdoch and the effect he's had on aus  uk and us  he helped elect trump  boris and scomo  indirectly causing nearly a million dead individuals who may have survived had competent governments been in power  how could anybody work for him  knowing not just that your paycheck funds originate from the suffering of others and the degredation of society  but that none of the extra money he gains from your work makes any difference to his enormous net worth anyway   i view those retail workers  u know the type  who drink the company koolaid and then rigorously work towards a goal of enriching their corporate overlords  the same way i view murdoch journalists working hard to spread his harmful  manipulative agenda  both groups are large groups of pathetic and essentially inconsequential individuals who are either so gullible that they swallow and accept corporate propoganda unironically  so dumb as to be convinced that a small group of ultrarich being worshipped  rewarded and given huge amounts of money and power is a desirable ideal situation  or are otherwise simply psychopaths who genuinely value their own bank balance and or career progression more than they value the wellbeing of the rest of society   because of these beliefs i find it hard to give a shit about customers shoplifting unless its just disrespectful or egregious or negatively affects others somehow  otherwise  deep down i cheer for shoplifters  and honestly hope they steal more   and then go and use those savings to shop honestly at local stores  and help support your community instead of megacorporation ceos for whom your money doesnt even have meaning anymore  sure  they account for losses to theft in pricing  but if everyone just stole 1 thing every shopping trip  the losses might lead to prices rising and local shops becoming able to compete with prices again    tl dr  fuck giant conglomerate corporations  i work for one and i secretly cheer company losses and am curious whether mine is a radical and or misinformed perspective that makes me an asshole  or if other retail workers sometimes feel this way too ,pas5va

907,Thoughts on anti-work..., i  see  antiwork  as a kind of counter-weight to balance out some of the more corrosive aspects of our work-obsessed culture  the one we live and breathe every day   according to anthropologists  in times not very long ago in historical terms   humans in hunter-gather societies enjoyed a 15-hour workweek   true   survival was hard back then  but this reveals how our ancestors thrived more by being adaptable and smart rather than merely working harder   after all  you only need to kill one bison to feed your entire village -- what's the point of doing more than is prudent and necessary   even  henry ford recognized the need for  antiwork  when he advanced the idea of a 40-hour workweek in the early 20th century -- upon seeing how   reducing  the hours of work  from 48 to 40 per week  actually increased worker productivity by a significant margin   just as the great economist john maynard keynes predicted decades ago  we find ourselves living at a time of enormous abundance  thanks to technology and automation on a global scale   our times are unprecedented in human history  which means we don't really have historical parallels with which to compare and make sense of our world today   the story of the last 2  decades has been that the vast majority of wealth gains produced from major advances in technology and globalization have been realized by a  tiny fraction of people -- just a few hundred wealthy families in the world  in fact   for the rest of us  the vast  vast majority  barely any gains at all   i believe a wise  and prudent discussion on the meaning and future of work in the 21st  century is not only good for us today but beneficial for future generations as well ,patv9v

919,The Horse that put itself down,in 2011  i graduated with a bachelor's in mechanical engineering with nothing to show for it except a job at one of the big 3 automakers  four years of studying engineering had not instilled a sense of wonder at the sublime beauty of an automobile differential  my lecturers had done a miserable job at teaching an outdated pedagogy to a cohort of students driven by the insecurities of their parents  who had viewed getting a job as the ultimate marker of a good education   i hated my first job  all everybody cared about was output  fuck employee development  fuck mental health  fuck engagement  fuck you if you can't give me those files by the end of the day   what ground my gears worst of all is that the company called laptops  assets  and employees  resources   the only thing that kept me going was a guaranteed seat in one of my country's best management programs  i was too scared to scuttle my prospects of a  bright  career by jumping jobs or trying something new  i was scared   after a year-long mba that i will cherish forever  i joined one of the big 4 consulting firms  my year there was marked by a hierarchy that treated young consultants as prostitutes who were encouraged to  network  and keep up their  utilization  if they didn't  they were screwed  and that's what happened to me  right in the middle of the covid pandemic  i was put into a performance improvement program that was nothing but an excuse to provide grounds for firing  if they really wanted to improve my performance  i never knew  nobody had a conversation with me about what i was doing wrong  nobody wanted to hear my side about what had been going on over the year  three months after that  i was fired - in the same week that i had a breakup  those last six months put me into a spiral of anxiety and depression that still resurfaces from time to time    those months of unemployment actually helped me regain my self-image to an extent  i no longer had the pressure of deadlines and the need to keep up appearances of competence  i could finally tell myself that  yes  i sucked at the job  but it's okay to suck at something  you could suck because of a lack of skills  an unsupportive team  the job not engaging you  or maybe even issues outside of work entirely  but  parents  friends  teachers  influencers  entrepreneurs and politicians drill this idea in your head that it's your responsibility to not suck  you're fed this rhetoric of a dog eat dog world where even a moment of reflection or vulnerability with your boss is an admission of failure  this turns a simple lack of knowledge or skill into a weakness to be eliminated with nobody to lean on but yourself   and so  companies save a lot of money by placing the onus of upskilling on the employees   fortunately  my unemployment lasted only three months and i'm working for an e-commerce major  but the hamster wheel doesn't change  everyone's out to cover their asses and new employees are supposed to do the job from day 1 with just a few basic pointers and a goody bag  i don't imagine that my self-image will separate from the work i do at any point    after all  we're trained to be horses that will put themselves down when they break a leg ,pahlls
920,"Serious post: midlife crisis, are there alternatives?",it was great to find this sub  i've had many of these feelings since i started working as a teenager  now i'm in my mid thirties and the reality of having to work grinding full time jobs until i die basically is really causing me a ton of anxiety   when i was younger  working sucked but it was a good way to meet people  it didn't feel physically draining and being 22 and broke can be kind of exciting as long as you don't have adult responsibilities   i never went to college  i don't have any valuable job skills and i work in a hotel  i've thought about going to school or getting a certification in some proper profession but i just don't feel up for it  have zero desire to do some other job that will suck  and i don't have the mental energy or fortitude to make it happen   i'm fortunate because i'm financially comfortable  to some extent  but buying a home  planning a retirement or leaving my kid something one-day are all just slowly evaporating in front of eyes and it doesn't seem like there's anything i can do about it unless i devote more time and energy to the thing i hate most  working ,pajgj1
921,Left My Job After 2 Months,i was working as a community manager for a totally new videogame studio with 7 employees that's working on it's first game   they had a  core hours  policy where we have to be online and reachable for 2 hours a day but work whenever the rest of the day  which was neat at first to be honest   my main responsibility was to create a community for the game to hype it up by creating some social media campaigns and interact with the audience till release   the thing is  there is no game yet  i had zero content to work with  so they added another responsibilities to do like managing all the social media accounts  facebook  twitter  reddit  instgram  organizing a content plan for the studio's youtube channel where they post a weekly podcast that i also edit  reaching for people in the videogame industry to appear as guests in that said podcast  designing thumbnails  they also tasked me with creating a fundraiser campaign on kickstarter to raise fund for the upcoming game   i never under delivered though  and delivered my tasks on time  attended the daily sprint meeting on time  when they tried to reach me outside of the core hours i was available  yet the senior developer which was also my team leader was always passive aggressive and spoke to me in a condescending way  but i brushed it of as jokes and moved on   one day i had a very important errand to do before the daily meeting  so i gave them a heads up that i am gonna be slightly late  and i was 3 minutes late  the meeting was normal but then i saw the team lead's reply to my heads up message where he's giving crap about me being late and i should have planned better as its easier with the  core hours  system  in another day he told me that  my grammar is off  because of a video title i wrote that was missing a question mark   started to burn out  i reported to the ceo that i didn't appreciate the team lead's tone with me and he stood strongly with me and he agreed it wasn't acceptable  but the day after all the three of us had a call where i was basically in  the naughty corner  both of them kept agreeing with other against me and how wrong i was  and said the work environment doesn't have to be friendly all the time with some aggressiveness in between to keep people in check  but i didn't like that at all  so i quit a day later   some time after i left the studio i saw a podcast where they were discussing which way will they place the computers whether the developers facing the office or the wall  they decided to let the developers face the wall so they can see the screen clearly to know if he's slacking off  with them saying  their privacy doesn't matter   i am glad i quit in the probation period before everything went sideways  my biggest red flag was when we were discussing how late i was for the meeting  i told them that many times before you reached me outside work hours and i was available  they responded with  you could have said you're not working right now  which is true but the fact they are negating the fact that i didn't is really making me feel mad and underappreciated ,pakb3b

941,"My Boss Is a Creep, a Manipulator and a Real-Life Nazi — It’s time to burn some bridges!",i ll try to keep this short  if only to protect myself  i started waitressing on the side last year  because i m still a student and barely got assignments in my preferred profession due to covid   i was really happy at the beginning  because the staff was mostly nice  i even made a good friend  she has left ever since but we keep in touch  and i make a lot of tips at this place  it can double my already nice salary on a good day    but then we had our end of the year staff dinner  not only did my boss grab my ass but he let a bunch of regulars shout nazi chants and hold racist speeches   when restaurants opened again in spring i politely announced that i have started a new degree  additionally to the one i m about to finish  and while i loved the opportunity they gave me  i would stop working in august september to focus on that   now my boss loves talking shit in front of people to hurt them  all staff foreigners tonight  racism  all women  sexism    he s not subtle but this takes the cake  on my last shift he watched me all evening and even tried to send me home after 2-3 hours  which would have meant going home in the middle of service and not making any tips  then he started telling one of the regulars  they were right in front of my station  that  finishing  a degree is not a guarantee for getting a job  apparently there s too many people with diplomas now and we all still have to prove that we can  actually  work  because we re just lazy academics  right   i almost started laughing out loud at how obvious he was   he can t get new staff despite the good salaries because everyone knows by now that he s a fucking terrorist and he knows i m way over qualified for the job by now   so i m home now finishing writing my my little lazy thesis about the shitty work conditions in my preferred profession while scheming to retire early so i can have more time for the important things  quality time with my loved ones and half a dozen hobbies  more travels and more sex   and mayyybe i ve started writing reports to the respective authorities about him  amp  his bullshit   keeping safe  one investigation is already under way    i hope karma slaps you back to 1933 where you belong  b ,paeo8z

972,Fired for 'Dress Code' from Hospital that didn't take COVID seriously,just wanted to share my current unemployment story   during the height of the 2020 pandemic  i was working at an it help desk office in my small midwest town's local hospital   i learned quickly to repress any sort of expression or personality  and to not chime in when i heard coworkers expressing what i found to be ignorant and unprofessional views   our office was packed to capacity in a relatively small enclosed area   our hospital's ceo had implemented mask mandates for all on-site employees  but there were still many in the office who refused to wear their masks   having had a previous stint with cancer  i brought my concerns to my office manager multiple times   after weeks of no enforcement  i decided to 'anonymously' contact hr  hr showed up unannounced at my office  and we got dinged failed audit   my boss called me into her office  revealed she knows it was me who alerted hr and that she was disappointed because she was 'just about to' address the office about mask enforcement   whatever you say   our office had a rotating 'office runner' role where if it was your day to be runner  you were allowed to wear jeans and tennis shoes due to the physical nature of the role as long as you had a shirt displaying the hospital's logo   my other coworkers very often got away without wearing shirts with hospital logo  and so i never really bothered to go out of my way to order shirts i'd have to pay for myself   i had been runner many times without wearing a logo shirt  just like the others   i finally ordered some shirts just to be on the safe side  and it takes several weeks for them to arrive   a month or so after reporting safety noncompliance to hr  i was performing runner duties when my manager approached me in front of the rest of the office to make sure everyone heard and told me i needed to go home and change into dress pants and shoes because i wasn't wearing a logo shirt   i told her not only were my shirts were ordered and arriving soon  but nobody else seems to be held to this standard   never mind the fucking obvious hospital photo id badge clipped and displayed on my shirt pocket   i'd put up with way too much bullshit overall at this job at that point to not reply with  i'm not going to perform runner duties in dress clothes   so i did  and in front of the whole office she told me to clock out and go home for the day   without a word i stood up and walked out   the next day  i showed up and sat at my desk and was called into a conference room where my manager and hr rep told me i'd been fired for dress code noncompliance   in the 2 minutes that took  i came back out to my desk and found in those 2 minutes  my entire desk was dismantled and all of my personal effects were packed up and dumped into a box waiting for me on my chair   good   riddance   i've been riding the unemployment train ever since december 2020  and i honestly feel like i earned it  and i don't allow family or friends to shame me for it   fuck you  i earned this mental break   when i decide to return to work  i can promise you i will only look for 100  remote positions - there's no need to go to a physical building every day to sit at a computer being forced to listen to what i find to be horrifically ignorant political banter    no  i don't want to go to go bowling as a team builder   no  i don't want to come in this weekend for coverage when i'm burnt out telling myself all week 'just make it to the weekend - you got this'   no  i'm not here to make friends and i don't want to hang out with you outside of work   i'll gladly elect to work a pizza delivery job before i ever subject myself to anymore of this in-person office horseshit ,para6k

1010,Way out of the misery,i cannot resist to write this  but as i have been following this subreddit and reading all the posts and rants about working  soul sucking slaving  not having time or passion for other activities  it makes me wonder    what s the solution to get rid of these bad feelings    a little of my background  i am 26  from europe  with bachelors degree - so luckily without a debt   student s loan  i chose the field i studied and now work in by very much random  it pays quite well  hours are okay  but it s stresfull and i do not like it much  i come home after 8 hours in the office often more tired and miserable than when i had two mentally easy jobs and worked 70 - 80 hours per week    i quite liked working as a waiter or customer service in car rental company  driving around the city  to aiports   meeting people made me happy    however this is age when i and i believe other people start think about family  buying their own place future  security perhaps health both mental and physical  and i know that working easy job would not allow me to consider getting a mortgage or take care of 3 people if i had a girlfriend and a kid  which i don t have because i either don t have time or will to be actively meeting many new people   i need time to get along with people  so most of my friends i met in school and jobs and we have known each other for a long time  moreover my colleagues now are mostly 40    working for the company 10  years and taking it quite seriously - no fun part in working included  you get the point  nothing much to look for in the morning    i don t want to live with my parents forever or rent cheap flats when having an easy job where i am happy  but don t earn much  i am not from a family that has that much money to allow me not to work for it  so if i want to be independent  from family  i need to earn more and be dependant on the higher paycheck that will allow me to save more  sometimes i feel that as i get older and more used to the workplace it will get better and easier and more enjoyable even though it s not a dream-job  maybe with experience i will be able to get an offer that suits me better and will be happier   i could write so much more about my thoughts on this consumerism and not wanting to work  but i will be just going in circles   if you made it here  thank you and congrats  let me know your thoughts and i would love to chat and look for solutions to happier work life balance   ,pa8q5v

1031,The desire to underpay people is a remnant of the slavery mentality,just a realization i just had  every employer  manager or whatever that underpays people acts like they are entitled to the fruit of your labor but you are not  if they could get away with it they would definitely have slaves  they wish we could be their slaves  but since they can t they will do the closest thing they can  pay people as little as possible  keep people desperate so they are trapped and they  employers  can take an objectively unfair share of the profits ,pa3vwr

1037,Question about being locked in the store after shifts.,we recently had a new store manager start in our store who  in his previous store  used to lock the exit doors if work was left unfinished so that people had to stay until everything was completed   i have been told that he is likely to do this as we have been falling behind with work  due partly to some slow workers but mostly lack of staff hours  recently  i don't plan on staying behind to finish other people's work since overtime is optional in our store   i assume the whole locking people in the store isn't legal right  idk just thought it would be funny to share ,p9q94e

1047,Not sure if I can stomach much more of boomers blaming younger generations for the shitty work cultures and broken economy that they’re leaving us.,i was fired from my job in retail last week  an assistant store manager had been sexually harassing me so i reported it  corporate demoted her to the lower management position of my department  and then they fired me  for time theft  because i took a few extra minutes on my break a few times and someone reported it  no verbal or written warning  no coaching  no suspension  just  you re fired  but she got to keep her job   fast forward to today  i go over to my parents  house to do some laundry and hang out  i love them dearly and they re good people  but i don t think they ll ever understand what it s like for younger generations to hold down a job in the workplaces that they re leaving us   to be clear  i know i didn t get fired for time theft  i got fired because i told a superior to stop treating me inappropriately  i confronted a boss and reported their awful  predatory behavior  i stuck up for myself and made it clear that i wouldn t tolerate unprofessionalism or hostility from a colleague  it sucks and i hate that it happened to me   but the fucked up thing that hurts worse than losing my job is how little empathy my parents and other boomers have for me and others like me  they know it s a different world than the one they grew up in  but they act like we re whiny  lazy  bad with money  and  just don t want to work anymore  meanwhile we re being systemically crushed and depleted by a system that was supposed to reward us for hard work and provide us with a sustaining quality of life  yet has done the exact opposite   it s a system that they were able to buy into at our age  they maintained it  cultivated its atmosphere  and shaped its culture  and now they re cashing in their chips while judging us for their failures   why don t you work more hours  why can t you save money  why aren t you buying a house  you shouldn t be struggling to make a car payment  just cancel your spotify   when i told my parents why i was fired  their response was   well that s not surprising  it literally made sense to them that i was sexually harassed by my boss and lost my job because i reported it  but they can t wrap their heads around why i might have trouble saving money or making ends meet in this current economy   this entire incident has effected me financially  socially  personally  and professionally  i am deeply depressed and stressed about all of it  and after four hours of trying to put it all in terms that my parents might understand  i m feeling very hopeless that they ever will  my dad has been white collar management since i can remember  my mom has never had a job  i really shouldn t be shocked   but it still hurts  and it really makes me not want to hang out with them or any other oblivious boomers anymore ,p9qi5j
1048,I had an antiwork dream last night and I thought I'd share because it was honestly lovely,i was at my actual workplace  nearly finished with work for the day  when i came across someone sitting on the third-floor fire escape and smoking   just one cigarette   they invited me to smoke with them and i did  for like five minutes  during that time  we started chatting  and our conversation got deeper and more soul-healing by the minute   at the end of my smoke break  there was the choice to bugger off and continue the conversation -- forming a connection and memories that i knew would last my whole life -- or to sacrifice that beautiful golden moment for a boss who would just be crabby with me for taking five minutes in the first place   we buggered off down the fire escape  sat in an empty parking lot and talked for ages about  everything         i'm not really doing it justice here  but 11 10 would dream about that kindred spirit again   unfortunately i wouldn't have the guts to follow them in real life ,pa1fp4

1051,My advice for some people on this sub (hear me out)...,i'll start by saying a few things  firstly  this is definitely not going to be for everyone  and isn't even an option for everyone  second  this isn't gonna be about policy or philosophy  its simply a suggestion to certain people  anyway  here's my suggestion for something you may wanna try   play poker   hear me out  first an obvious side note  this is of course not for everyone  this is for people a  that don't have any history of problems with gambling and have have some amount of self discipline  make no mistake this is indeed gambling  but so is the stock market or any number of other  real  jobs  gambling where you have the edge is still gambling  b  for whom a day job is just not an option or they desperately need a way out  and don't know how  c  that don't have ambitions of being rich  i think this is most of you  people that only want to make enough money so they can get by and have the rest of their time to themselves  d  enjoy the game  if its something you find extremely boring then obviously this isn't for you as it would just be work  i think most people generally enjoy the game but haven't really given it much consideration  this post is for those people   i'm not going to go into many details or name any specific resources in regards to where to play or where the best place to learn and improve is  besides saying that twitch is probably a good start  there are an endless number of resources and information available with a simple google search and thats not the point of this post  i'll also say that online is the best main way to play  and you likely do have options to play online  if you live in most of europe or certain us states  there are plenty of regulated options  otherwise  its still legal and safe for you to play on a number of sites  you are not breaking any laws buy doing so  and whether or not these  unregulated   meaning the government isn't watching  sites are breaking any laws is contested  what is not contested is that as a player  you are not breaking any laws whatsoever   here are the main reason i'm suggesting this  1  you can start from 0  and my advice here is to do so exclusively  never put your own money in  contrary to popular belief  you need absolutely no startup money  every single online platform offers multiple freerolls daily  meaning a tournament that is free to enter and has cash prizes  usually under 5  and only for the top 20 or so players depending on how many enter  this will serve a dual purpose  as a way to start your bankroll and also getting your beginner practice for free  it'll take a while  but once you make your first little bit you can move on to micro-stakes  where you play for 1 -2 cents  and 2  is a full buy-in for most games  it's also much easier to beat the early levels  no matter what so losing players will tell you  they're just looking for an excuse  2  this might be the most meaningful here  your progress are dependent on only yourself and your brain  you work for no one  no one is exploiting you  you are completely outside the system  if you stick to the basic principles  mainly  bankroll management  then you will progress if you get better  when you fail  its on you  when you succeed  it's on you  3  you'll find that 99  of the pitfalls  especially in your early stages  is just fallacies your own brain tries to trick you into  if you are confident in yourself and your discipline  and approach it from that viewpoint  you will already be further ahead than 99  of the field  4  poker is a zero-sum game  meaning yes  when you win  it will come from other players  however the main difference between poker and the big game of capitalism or life or whatever you wanna call it  is that absolutely no one is forced to play it  100  of players does so voluntarily  in a way  poker is one of the most fair things there is  nothing about you matters except your skill  there is no way to take advantage of others except by being better at the thing you both agreed to play  poker doesn't care about what you think or who you are  or what class of society you where born into  it only cares about the cards and your skill   and no  players with more money hold absolutely no advantage over you  likely the opposite  that is  not if you follow the basic principles  sure  if you break the most fundamental of principles and buy in with your whole bankroll and are too scared to really play with it then yea technically someone less scared can push you around  but we're never gonna be in that situation because we are not idiots   this whole process will likely take a few months  and by then you'll know if this is something you really love  something thats not for you  or something in the middle  like maybe a side source of income  worst case scenario is you spend a couple of months playing a game you like  if you follow the instructions above it should cost you no money  but i will say one more time that you have to have the self-discipline not to do anything stupid  i made this post here because most people here say that they do have self-motivation  so i leave this as a humble suggestion of something to try   cheers ,pa4uam

1068,Looking for ideas for what to do next,for background  i'm 29m with a bachelor's degree in accounting  and another in music  performance  been working in accounting since 2015  first job out of college was at a small firm for about 5 years  then covid happened  shifted to wfh and burnt out on the workload craziness of everything going on  resigned  moved back to home state  il  and went unemployed for about 5 months  picked up a bookkeeping position  in office mandatory  in nov '20 which is where i'm at currently  big decrease in pay but i just needed a job at that point  it's also pathetically easy  but comes with drama and poor management  so i'm considering leaving and looking for a new job   i didn't want to post on any career advice subs because i didn't want the typical  eye-rolling responses like  work towards your cpa certification  or  ask for more responsibility and they'll reward you with more pay and higher satisfaction  the reason i'm here is because the very idea of trading your life for the luxury of affording to live is asinine   i've hesitated to update my resume and start the search again because the motivation to do so just isn't there  it's really hard to imagine a job i could ever enjoy  my best guesses would be playing piano somewhere  streaming  piano or gaming  or maybe something park forestry related   i feel like the problem with those is either risk or lack of experience  music gigs  even in orchestras  aren't even always paid  and i'm not super talented enough to land any permanent positions  i just like playing  been doing it for 21 years  trying streaming would basically mean negative income for an indeterminate amount of time with no guarantee of payoff  and i feel unqualified for nature related fields  i only had a summer job doing various landscaping for a park district in college for a couple years  i just feel like being outside and in nature seems nice   any position i do go for would ideally pay at least  40k  which is what i'm making now  looking for ideas of jobs i could do with my experience  or lack thereof  happy to answer any questions in the comments ,pa4xii

1144,My satisfying revenge on an employer who wanted me to beg him for a job.,  this was a few years back but it is still the most satisfying moment against an employer in my life    i had just left university and was struggling to find a job related to my degree  my dad passed just before graduation and i was desperate for money  a job came up  it was a temp job for about 6 months and very low pay but i needed to take on anything  i was offered an interview and honestly  looking back i feel such pity for my younger self  i was trying so hard to dress and act grown up for my first real job   on the day there was a big storm in my town  the bus only took me half the way  i got there looking like a hybrid of the girl from the ring and a drowned rat  everything felt like it was against me   it was a tiny start up run by this arrogant but obviously insecure 30 year old man  he saw me and laughed before even saying hello  i was already humiliated but followed him into the room   he sat me down and leaned back in his big chair with his armed crossed over his beer belly and said    so tell me  why should  i  hire   you   the rest of the interview had the same tone  he really seemed like he wanted me to beg him for it  he would swing the money  which was extremely low  in my face because he knew i needed this  he would laugh and smirk when i showed him my work and even after all questions were asked  he seemed to really just want to drag it out longer because he was enjoying the power trip   when i got home and changed out of my damp cold clothes i just felt humiliated and dirty  i checked my mail to see that he already sent me a rejection email  saying something like  i feel your work wasn t up to our standards and you lack the experience  i shut it off and went to bed trying to forget about it   and keep in mind the position was temp and only 6 months   the very morning after  i got a very surprise email from a large company i jokingly applied for weeks ago  because i thought i had zero chance  asking me to head out to another country for an interview with them  all paid for  long story short  it went well and within 3 weeks i was told that i had landed my first real job   2 weeks after that i was already packing up my life  relieved and excited to finally get started in my career  when i noticed a new email from the start-up company that rejected me  the email said  hi  we would like to invite you to another interview as our recent hire didn t live up to our expectations   so they wanted me back   i accepted and went back to them within days of getting the email  the same guy greeted me and took me into his office  only this time i wasn t nervous or trying to impress  i was just being me and you could feel his discomfort   why isn t she intimidated by me  running though his head   he started saying  so  luckily for you i m going to give you another chanc -  and i cut him off and delivered the most satisfying line of my life    sorry but let me just stop you there  i have actually just been hired by  lt insert big company gt  so i will not be needing this temp position  i wanted to come down here to let you know in person rather than reject your offer by mail  i feel that this position at your company isn t right for my needs or skill level  whereas this new company is  also your pay is 3x less than what i will earn over there in a junior position  but thank you for the interview experience   he was a mix of pissed off and broken  as if his inner lack of confidence in the real world had shown it s face in his shitty little office that day  he said fine ok and then walked me out   to this day i still feel that tingle of joy when i think of it  also if anyone is wondering  the company went bust not long after ,p9e4kd

I wonder what the higher ups make.,dear valued customer   is this crazy world we are living in continues to create many challenges  it seems letters like this are arriving daily  most companies do not even take the time to inform  they just increase the price  one the less  we too have no choice but to follow suit  is all of you know the price of everything has been rising very rapidly  the price of our raw materials and more significantly  labor  has skyrocketed to points where we cannot continue to absorb them   most of you are aware  our lead time on orders is longer than at any time in our history and our lack of employees has tied our hands on being able to increase our production  employees are a major problem for all companies right now and with a palmar distribution center only 15 minutes from the manner  they are buying up all the labor in this rural area  his is a major case of a big corporation stepping on small town america  hence  we are doing all we can to hire with a major emphasis on retaining the employees we have while doing so   west assured we are doing all we can to make good quality leather faster in order to serve you better  after all  the more leather we make the better we can provide for our families  daily  we are doing our best to keep all our customers in leather by ratifying to keep everyone cutting  he too are not happy with the amount of leather we are able to currently produce  ,p9i0yq
1191,Capitalists complaining about capitalism,i have seen loads of posts on reddit  news articles  etc about a shortage of low wage jobs like restaurants  a lot of complaints from owners and managers is about people not wanting to work  collecting unemployment  etc   the fact that people are saying no to abysmal wages is nothing more than a market economy correcting wages in the way capitalism is supposed to work  in a sense  those complaining about not being able to get workers want capitalism  but only when it works in their favor  nobody would risk their life savings to start a business if the best they could hope to do is equivalent of minimum wage  why do they expect people to waste their time working and still be too broke to have food  shelter  and medicine   tldr  managers complaining they can't get workers are capitalists complaining about capitalism actually working  i wonder how many of them are aware of this ,p9kz9c

1237,Rant—fuck the restaurant industry,just saw the owner of a local chain on the tv complaining about how they can t find help because  people are sitting home getting checks from the government  two saturdays ago  my 16 year old son was called in to do a  nine hour  shift on his day off at a the local franchise sandwich shop let s call it elevated train and  good little doobie he is  agrees to go in  about an hour later  he starts to feel sick  feverish and nauseous  he texts his manager to let her know what s up  she tells him to  just sit down  he does  but it s getting worse  he texts her again and she tells him he  can t just send yourself home  and there s no one else to cover    he texts us  his parents  and we tell him  do what you gotta do  so he walks out    i know he didn t have covid or the norovirus or anything contagious it was a reaction to getting the meningitis vaccine the day before  his manager sure didn t know that  so not only was she willing to make my son work while he was sick  she was willing to risk him infecting his co-worker and customers   enjoy that sub   on top of all that  it turns out he was never getting his legally-required breaks  since he was often alone in the shop or  when he was working with someone else  they were  too busy   so  fuck anyone from the restaurant industry who says  no one wants to work any more  when what they really mean is  no one wants to be abused for shit wages ,p9ce1i

1245,"I’m starting college again in the next few days, and I feel like it will be a complete waste of time",so  i went to community college for two years in order to get my associate's degree  i mainly went to community college to delay being an adult  as well as explore different potential career paths  i graduated last year  and i feel like i didn t really get anything out of it  the only thing that was reinforced is my desire to be an artist  which has been a dream of mine my whole life  the thing is  i kind of dislike the actual process of creating art  i only like seeing the finishing result  i speculate this has to do with dopamine because when i am in class or if i have no access to technology  i enjoy doodling and drawing a lot more than when i am around my computer  or phone  or gaming console   anyways  it s pretty unrealistic that i will ever be an artist because i never draw  which means i am not getting any better at it  and even if i did choose that career path  i probably wouldn t be financially stable enough to solely have that as my job  looking at all of the other available career paths to choose from  none of them sound interesting to me at all  i m a pretty nihilistic person  so i don t really see any value in any of these career paths  because of this  i feel like i am just going to have to choose a career path in order to survive and have a stable life  i feel like i am doing this for other people and not myself  i could care less if i live or die  so i am doing this for those who care about me living   i chose the career path of ui ux design and graphic design because i feel like i am good at things that are artistic creative in nature  from the experience i ve had with these things  i really dislike them  people always tell me that i will probably become more interested in these activities as i go along  but i really doubt it  i feel like with this career path  and with any other career path i end up with  i will probably just suffer for the next 40 years in order to survive  and then drop dead   it really feels like i am just not suited for work  i feel like i was supposed to be born as a mountain or a tree  not a human being in the modern world  i just really don t fit in with society s expectation to work in order to live   i really wish i was magically super interested in making art  and i got good enough at art to get in a cool art career like being an animation showrunner  or an art youtuber  or a comic artist  but unfortunately  that s not the case  and i am just going to have to buckle down and just do things that i find zero value in and things that i really don t want to do   how do i survive college when i find zero value in attending  how do i find value in working a career that i dislike just to survive to make people happy ,p8mqes

1250,Labor Shortages in a Capitalists' America moving towards the future.,for the past few months  we've seen many business owners  especially in the food service industries  along with particular occupations  especially agriculture  that have been enduring an extended labor shortage   we often hear some business owners  consumers  and even right-wing pundits talking head go to the tired cliches of    everyone is getting handouts from the government or are still benefiting from stimulus money    we need more people to pull themselves up by the boot-strap and find work to fill this vacant position       even though  many states are back to or have exceeded unemployment numbers  pre covid-19 pandemic  it's not any of the employees' fault  the laid-off or furloughed workers who decided not to come back to these business  or even the consumers   if your business model was to bank on always having enough  hungry dogs  as jon taffer expressed in his fox news interview -- isn't your business model setting  itself up for failure        first  it's a narrow-minded and presumptuous plan to have with a business in the first place  especially if you need a good number of people to be employees in your company   that's pure and simple that if you decide to run any operations  you have to consider the human element of your business   if you don't feel you can pay your workers minimum wage or a decent living income  then how can you expect to keep people in case there's a catastrophe  changing economic cycles or trends  or an overall reduction in active workers   alot of business owners or talking-heads pundits  mostly on the right  seem to only understand one aspect of capitalism or any given economic system  how can the business owner  especially if they are wealthy  survive at any given cost   i'd often say by keeping wages low  while not offering too many benefits  they almost speak as if they are gaslighting all workers  regardless if they are extremely poor to somewhat wealthy  the people are   terrible  lazy  and only want handout  arguments are swimming past lazy and tired to absolutely laughable      many states are maintaining high levels of employment  even as many baby boomers with few gen-x ers are retiring or leaving the general work force  there's nothing society can do to help this businesses  unfortunately  except maybe grants  loans  tax cuts  or bailouts   for many of the business who have gotten these benefits  what happened to the extra money   people benefited from the stimulus checks and are starting to move on  but what is the problem for this companies      i know certain individuals  like to harp on  socialist  and  marxist  programs are making people think they have to be taken care of by the government  or demanding exorbitant wages  just to do a job for  high-schoolers  people with no skills  immigrants  or people too lazy to pick up new skills    so  there's a worker shortage  now  the people that you've mocked also don't want to work or need to work at these jobs   it seems like you would update your business model  or change the direction of your company  that would be the logical things to do  also  as many people have said that system works fine  as it is  but  at this moment  the system is now flawed  because business owners are getting what they want with minimal effort  if you cannot adapt  doesn't that mean your business just dies a slow painful death  if your profits weren't much to begin with  how are you expecting to survive in the first place   employees are never obligated to stay  just like all of the consumers who are not required to use your services   https www bls gov web laus lauhsthl htm  https www bls gov web laus laumstrk htm  it's like any relationship  you can have a person  or people  be with you and you aren't offering them  very much to begin with  they might be or wanting to ask for more out of the relationship  yet you are expecting more out of them  during a troubled time  pandemic  let's say some people lay them off furlough them  temporary breakup  because you cannot afford  by your own account  then  you come back when everything is a little bit better and ask them to re-start the relationship with you  on the same term from before  even though they may have found something better or moved on ,p89rz1

1266,Friday Inspiration: Be your own boss,i really love this sub  thank you all for being here  i feel like many folks here are just beginning to see the world as the stupid fucked up thing that i saw it as in 2008 where i began my journey away from capitalism and it's model of  sucessful person  i hope to inspire you to somehow walk away from the death trap as well  however you can  your journey will be your own  this is mine   tldr  i still work but on my own terms  in 2008 i was 27 and was slaving away in marketing  renting a condo in a multi-level building  just bought a comfy leather couch  new flat screen tv and i don't know what happened but i just realized this was not the way  i quit my perfectly fine job out of the blue and went in search of a job that i liked to do  luckily there was a river near by and i found whitewater rafting  a lot of the guides lived on property in old school buses and for me it just clicked  i'm in   the pay was awful  the boss was awful but the job absolutely did not suck  no one cared how you dressed and living on site i had practically no expenses so i did that for a while  heck i did that for a decade and went to different rivers all over the country just getting paid to play   other guides travel the world doing this  but living on site means that your entire existence relies on you keeping that job with that employer or renting a place when you want to move states seasonally is a bit difficult too  so i started looking for land i could afford anywhere in the us that was close to a river    in 2011 i found my piece of land at a tax auction and paid cash  this was my big break and it is important to do a ton of research but also not impossible to do  i bought the land for  2 100  about  7 500 under value  i was absolutely shocked no one else bid on it    made the essential improvements to make it  livable  in a tipi with an outdoor kitchen and outhouse  the tipi was 2k and the other buildings were made of whatever i could get my hands on  old wood  palm fronds  discarded tin  free table from the side of the road  i even straightened nails  moved there and saved all the money that would have been spent on rent  electricity  internet  water etc  took showers elsewhere for a while  friends or pay showers  step one complete  housing that is mine that doesn't suck money out of me constantly  i continued to guide rivers and wait tables  keep my expenses super low but i still did not have enough income to qualify for aca so that's when i made the leap to not work at all for anybody else  cause fuck that  i'm working 2 jobs and still cannot afford basic healthcare benefits  plus i need to build a house too  2017 income was  10 189 according to my tax return    the business i started was based on a specific need in my community but also benefited me and my existence to do it  i picked up recycling from people who would pay me a monthly fee to do so  then i would use what i could to build my house  sell aluminum cans  steel and batteries for scrap  and take the rest to the bigger recycling center  i did not make bank doing this but i got a ton of stuff to build my house  windows  wood beams  doors  re-bar  shredded paper  i make into papercrete bricks  steel roofing  wine bottles  copper pipe  2x4's my house is probably 80  recycled stuff  i made my own schedule  it was a super easy job just to drive around and sort stuff and listen to music   i have had some bumps in the road of course  i pulled all money out of my ira at one point and just started over recently  recycling industry basically fell apart when china stopped accepting plastic  it still gets wet inside a tipi when it rains and no flushing toilet  but i never got into debt with any of this and that has been a key point in my own journey   anyway  i had to pivot into something else so i just went with one of my other talents which is native plants and landscape installations  i still do that today and work out of my recycled house  two people also help me and we all get paid the same  i just have more office hours  we choose our own work schedule  i recently changed my schedule so i only work monday-thursday  thanks to this sub for that  a lot of my normal expenses are now tax deductible like computer  cell phone  mileage for my truck  hey actually the whole truck  internet  printer  office paper  oh yeah and plants  soil  mulch  chainsaw  weed whacker  jackhammer  any fucking tool i ever need    the way i look at it  as long as the three of us are all getting the money we need to get and the amount of work we want to do  then it's a success  the business does not need to be profitable because there are no investers  or loans to pay  or any expenses other than the normal living stuff  okay there is some software and insurance that is directly business expense related  very minimal that i make sure that is covered in the rates  if we need more money for our time  hell i'll just raise the rates    there will be no getting rich  no pto but also no fucked up schedules  or meaningless tasks or any of the other bullshit that comes with corporate capitalism  its just the 3 of us trying to live    our society needs more people to drop out and be their own boss  please consider it  the people in this sub are the exact people that can do it without expoliting people to get

Found a new job that seems more promising — sharing my story here to hopefully inspire one person to keep fighting against corporate bs,desperate for a job during the pandemic  i settled for a call center job that promised to be better than the others  i was naive and totally drank the company kool-aid  thinking it was great because it was remote and the people are nice  it took awhile until i started seeing the red flags  and i ve been following this sub for awhile which helped me see how i was being exploited  they severely underpay every single employee regardless of their title  promotions don t come with pay raises  and there is no clear pay raise structure  to list a few  the managers didn t do anything all day  and workers were frequently infantilized and often interrogated for not hitting certain performance metrics even though the company said those metrics aren t important  they constantly kept adding more and more responsibilities  and even had the audacity recently to lower the wage for new hires in an expensive city while all the older hires are all quitting because what they originally paid wasn t even enough to pay rent  rather than paying the workers more  they are trying to force everyone into a new office even though they were hired remotely and have been doing fine the past year working remotely   anyways  this was slowly eating away at my mental health  i wanted to quit but didn t know what to do next  i absolutely dreaded applying for jobs because the process is so de-humanizing  i decided to muster the energy and apply to some new jobs anyways  and i got many rejections but i also got lucky and found a job description that was actually transparent and listed the pay  which is 2x what i was currently paid  i applied and found out recently that i got the job  this new job actually has sick days  whereas the old one didn t  this new job also explicitly said they care more about the employees than the customers  and it s fully remote and it felt like i finally saw some light  i quit my old job and start the new one soon  and i m really glad i didn t settle for less  i will likely delete this post soon because i don t want this up forever but i m happy to share more details in my inbox to try my best and answer any questions you may have  love this sub and i hope together we can make change or at least help some individuals improve their own situation ,p8oiha

1382,"Boss says theres a federal that I must receive covid test results within 24 hours, is this so?",tldr  my boss insists that theres a federal law mandating that all covid test results must be available within 24 hrs  is this actually true or nah       hey all  looking for advice clarification  so last week i wasnt feeling well  and after several days i decided to take a covid test since numbers are skyrocketing in my area right now   i'm vaxed  but so was my other friend who got it last week  the test came back negative and i'm feeling better so all is well  but when i told my boss that i'd be taking a covid test on monday  and that i'd have results by wednesday he insisted that its a federal law that all covid test results are available within 24 hours  this didnt sound right to me  so i asked him to clarify if he was talking about the rapid test and he said no  and that federal law mandates that all covid tests of any kind must give results with in 24 hours  so i went to cvs to get my drive thru test done like i've done many times by now  and i asked the pharmacist if she had ever heard about this federal law before and she said she hadn't  well low and behold  it took almost 48 hours to get my results back  meaning i did miss a day of work waiting  but i work as a vendor so i can easily make up the time before the end of the month  this morning i went back to work  and when i joined the virtual meeting my boss was again telling the whole team about this supposed federal law  and even said there was a  10 000 fine for any testing site that didn't get you your results within 24 hours  after the call we spoke on the phone and he asked me where i went to get the test and i told him and much to my absolute horror he told me he was going to go to that cvs and talk to their manager and potentially report them  i objected saying i didnt want to get anyone in trouble and i was fine but he was really insistent  i felt super uncomfortable having my boss go hassle some cvs pharmacist  especially because they only administer the test  they dont do the lab work anyway  it goes in a drop box and gets picked up and then you get the results from the lab directly so it has nothing to do with the pharmacy at all  i was so freaked out i called the cvs pharmacy to warn them  luckily the pharmacist i talked to was really cool about it  he was like  yeah cool send him over so i can tell him myself that hes wrong lol  i deal with people like this all day   he confirmed that he had never heard of such a  federal law  and that sometimes test took up to 72 hours or more  and that theres only so many hours in a day and thousands of test pouring in  it would be impossible to process every single test within 24 hours  not to mention if there was a law like that he would be aware of it by now  he thanked me for the heads up and assured me that there are laws preventing them from even confirming to my boss i ever took a test there anyway so i'm starting to calm down a little but i've been stressing about this so i wanted to ask y'all  has anyone else ever heard of this  federal law  or anything even remotely similar  googled it and found nothing so i thought the reddit hivemind might know  and this is the only work related subreddit i trust lolol,p7sbj9

1385,"A simple explanation for why you will never be wealthy, and that's a good thing.",society as it is is a game  with points and levels and values and such  but only some of us are aware it's a game  those who are power hungry  and  aware of the game  sociopaths  mostly  will rig the game in their favor  turning as many players as possible into their personal wealth-manufacturers    the interesting part of this game is that it only works if a sizable portion of the population is not aware that there's a game at all  but instead believe that all the rules of society are based on natural laws of good and bad  valuable and not valuable  they  have to  believe that if they follow the rules and work hard enough  they can be rich too  these people become upper management or owners of small companies  earning enough money to feel good about but always having to work so much that they never get to enjoy the fruits of their efforts  until  maybe  retirement when they're old tired and close to death   the only thing stopping these second people from becoming truly rich  owning the means of production  having value generated while they do nothing  being able to create the rules themselves  is their honesty  which leaves the sociopaths to rule the whole show    look at any industry  follow it to the top  and there will be just a few assholes doing almost no work and making 100s to 1000s of times what their employees do  what's more  they have created their own rules to create their wealth  in the stock markets it's hedge fund managers who abuse the system to the point of global economic collapse  in the chicken meat industry it's conglomerate owners who abuse farmers into slavery  this is true anywhere you look    there are also honest people who know it's a game  but don't have the greed to try and manipulate it  that's us  in this sub  we know it's a trap to try and work hard for a better life  since we will only gather more costs and debt and have to work even harder to gain any margin of comfort  we don't have the will to subjugate or fellow humans to wage slavery so we know we can't become truly rich  yet we can't exit the game  there's no  opt out  choice  so we work menial jobs to secure our survival and find real meaning in the space around our work    i wish i had some solution  i guess it's just gratifying to know that i'm not worthless for not being able to achieve wealth in this society  in fact  i know my worth better than most ,p7oeho

1439,Was I in the wrong ?,hey guys  former bartender here  so  i've worked at some of the best cocktail bars in the world and in the last job i had  my boss was a useless piece of shit  yet i was the one they thought was a bad worker simply because i didn't want to fix his fuckups  for example  if i had the 9-5 shift  one of the persons that closed would come in at noon  leaving at around 8pm  which rarely happened because it'd get quite busy  but  the problem was that  coming in at 9 i should be leaving at around 5pm when there was almost no movement but instead of being able to do that right around 4 45  my boss would ask me to do a bunch of shit or to cover for the noon shift guy to do it  when we could've easily done in between the time he got in and my clocking out time  given that from 12 to 5 we were both standing behind the bar simply doing some side work cause two people were barely needed at that moment but no  he would always wait and make me have to stay in an extra 2 or three hours sometimes  without it being cause the bar was busy  it was always because his organizational skills were shit and he simply never could message us to tell us he needed something done  no  he had to fucking wait till i said i was leaving to even remember that shit needed to get done  and then he'd ask us to do it  i'd tell him i couldn't stay for that much longer if it wasn't busy and that he could improve the way he communicates things but his answer was that i should be a better team worker and help out whenever needed  mind you  this would happen almost every single day  eventually i got tired of it and told them to fuck off  what are your thoughts on this    was i on the wrong  ,p7hxqc

1463,Why the worker shortage,the shortage is due to boomers finally leaving the work force   for years millennials couldn't get most entry-level jobs or jobs with flexible schedules cause they were all tired up with boomers being hired  they either got more money cause of there  experience  or they worked for lesser wages cause they had their social security  a pension  or some other source of income coming in  also the company's had no need to worry paying health insurance cause they are entitled to medicare   company's got away with this for years and now the newer work force needs more cause houses  groceries and all daily things needed for living are through the roof   more then enough people are applying for jobs but they wanna get paid and well these business have no interest in loosing any bottom line ,p83g7f
1464,2+ Years Without a Raise,i apologize if this is the wrong sub for this but seems to be the best one for venting about work   i work for a multi-national engineering consulting company and have been with the company for just over two years  the pay 2 years ago was average for my position and experience  but after 8 months when i asked if they would be giving raises they said  they re coming  we just haven t determined when  one year after that  having not received a raise yet  i scheduled a salary review with my manager and in summary he said  we re not giving raises to anyone right now    my frustration is with a couple of things  1  the cost of living   inflation has skyrocketed in the last two years so even if i continued to provide the same level of value to the company  without even a cost of living raise they are effectively paying me less   2  i have taken on a different role entirely from when i started that carries so much more responsibility including dealing with an absolute prick of a client and managing up to 30 projects for him   better pay is what motivates people to put up with bullshit and at this point i m having a hard time caring at work  i understand that you usually have to ask for a raise but getting denied a basic 2  raise after one year to offset the more realistic 8-10  inflation that s going on destroys my motivation to work hard ,p7n5g4

1476,I walked out of my job the other day.,will try to keep this as concise as possible    i work as a ta during term time  but don t get pay during holidays so i got a job as bank staff at a private nursery during the holidays so i could afford to live   i had not yet completed a full month of employment due to my second job  and i was moved to a different room  with different age groups almost every day  on one occasion moved to a separate building  this meant i had to learn a new routine and new names every day  as well as gain the kids  trust and build a positive relationship with them  i have limited experience in a nursery daycare  and only very recently qualified  regardless  i managed  was i told the routine  no  i figured it out on my own  i did numerous tasks without being asked  mostly cleaning  sweeping floor and cleaning tables after mealtimes  set up activities for children on my own  the 3-4 age group in particular was extremely unruly and i managed to get some of them to calm down with a drawing activity    a child came to me and told me some kids had escaped into an empty room  i found five children unsupervised  and yet there were two extra staff there that didn t notice    another child bumped his head  i took the initiative to help him and report the accident  give him an ice pack  standard procedure  the nursery has an app that you report accidents on  nobody had shown me how to use the app  again  there were two extra members of staff in the room    every new room i started in  i also seemed to have a positive working relationship with the other staff  or so i thought  they expressed gratitude at the end of my shift  and disappointment that i was moved to a different room each day    i submitted a new starter form  which gave my emergency contact as my partner  who had a clearly female name  i thought nothing of it at first  it s illegal to fire someone for their sexual orientation but it s not unheard of to find ways around it and throwing someone under the bus  so that it appears that you are sacking someone for a good reason   cue getting called into the managers office and being told that staff had complained about a so called lack of initiative  that i just sit around and wait to be told what to do  which is of course  bullshit  i was not allowed a chance to explain  this was clearly not an opportunity to hear my side of the story  the way she spoke to me as if i had committed some heinous crime  i m not exaggerating  she abruptly dismissed any attempts to defend myself  and even scoffed at me when i started to show that i was visibly upset   then just said  that s all you can go   i cried in the toilet for a bit then took off my uniform  grabbed my coat  signed out and left  she just said  that s your choice   sent a very long resignation letter explaining all this  i only just received acknowledgement of the letter and told that my feedback has been forwarded this afternoon   i have no proof that my sexuality had something to do with it but the circumstances and timing is very suspicious   if it s not about my sexual orientation  it s still clear that this is not an environment i want to work in    i m glad this sub exists  i have had the bad luck of having to work with some of the most abusive people  i know i m not the problem  because i have worked with some great people as well  although it s not as common  this sub has been so validating  i had no problems with my mental health at all  until i started working  if you read all of it  thanks  i really just needed to unload    tl dr  thrown under a bus  suspect that it may have been due to my sexual orientation but have no proof  walked out before it could escalate ,p8437f

1484,My dad is permanantly physically affected by a horribly stressful job he had 14 years ago,longish story  my dad told me this story last night and all i could think of was this sub  at the time i was pretty young and was totally unaware of what was going on  14 years ago  my father was moved from a position he loved to a higher position that he felt completely unqualified for  he had to manage a team and lead a project after the unfortunate death of the previous manager  told the project had to go live in march that year  he worked his ass off - between 18 and 20 hours per day  day and night  he worked and stressed and became increasingly distant from his family  despite my mom being pregnant with my youngest sister  the project was delayed time and time again  with the final date being the 16th of july  when it finally wrapped up  my dad took family time off for my mom  just 2 days before my sister was born  he tried to sleep  10 minutes passed and he's woken up suddenly by a rush of adrenaline  he tries again  snaps awake  he had been worked so hard that his body became accustomed to not allowing him to relax at all  still in the mindset of needing to stress over this project that he knew full well he wasn't qualified for  the bursts of anxiety kept him awake until he realized he needed to see a doctor  the next day he was perscribed xanax to help with his shot nerves  the day my sister was born  he was so high on xanax that he nearly missed it  i'm glad to say that he is doing quite well now  and fully understands not to ever take on a job like that again  however  every now and again he will have small  short  violent anxiety attacks as a grim reminder of that horrible time when his job threw him into a position full of horrible stress  it's stories like these that make me further embrace the views of this sub and appreciate that more people are starting to see the bullshit that our bosses and managers try to put us through    thanks for making it this far  have a lovely day,p7g3q1

1489,"I'm out sick, but don't let that stop you from bothering me.",please forgive the rant  but i need to get this off my chest before i climb a building and screech   i work in an office in which 95  of our employees are vaccinated  my direct co-worker is not vaccinated and has no interest in getting the covid vaccine  it's also worth mentioning that i absolutely hate germs and being around sick people  so you can imagine my displeasure when she came into work last thursday coughing up a storm  our boss made several comments about my co-worker coughing  but that's as far as it went   on monday  our boss began her vacation and is out this entire week  monday evening  i started to feel odd and left my friend's house after  according to him  looking as white as a ghost  followed by throwing up  over the course of the night  i started to feel progressively worse  when i woke up tuesday morning  my nose was blocked  my throat was on fire  i was sweating like a stripper in church  and i had severe sinus pressure  i sent a text message to our acting supervisor and let her know i would not be in due to the aforementioned   i scheduled a covid test that afternoon and was told it would be between 48-72 hours for results  with a chance they'd come back sooner than that  i screenshotted the appointment confirmation and the  pending results  section to our acting supervisor to show that i both scheduled and attended said appointment  when i was hired  i was told i could work from home once and awhile  and figuring that this is an important week for us since i work in the billing department  that instead of being out sick and not contributing in any way  that i work from home to ensure everything gets done in time for friday   the acting supervisor didn't get back to me until this morning and said that the big boss who's on vacation isn't thrilled about the idea of me working from home as the work isn't  quantifiable  but given the circumstances  they'll allow it for today and we'll revisit the situation tomorrow  i was also instructed to keep a log of what work i've performed throughout the day  i guess as some measure of justification or efficiency  great  thanks  since  you know  i didn't ask to get sick and my co-worker was the one who came to work coughing like some sort of animal   while i'm sat at home on my computer getting caught up on my e-mails and getting everything sorted  i get this passive-aggressive e-mail from my co-worker saying   you have two accounts with billing that's been sitting here since tuesday   i've been fucking out sick since tuesday  haven't i  not to mention i literally just got the approval to work from home  so pipe the fuck down and give me some time to catch up on everything  if i didn't get the approval and was told to take another sick day  those accounts would have sat there for another day   so now all i can think about is the fact that if i don't have a negative covid result feel well enough to return to the office tomorrow  i'll most likely have to take another sick day opposed to working from home  since they weren't entirely on board with me working remote  which begs the question as to why it was even pitched as a perk during the hiring process if it was going to be this much of a problem   not to mention the fact that knowing how my boss is  she's going to come back from vacation next week and bitch about how i wasn't at work to get everything done properly  as if it's my fucking fault that this bitch came to work sick  most likely got me sick  and i'm the one bleeding sick time during the busiest week of the month because of my co-worker's poor choice to come to work sick and my boss' poor choice of not sending the bitch home   and all these employers wonder why no one wants to work  who the fuck wants to deal with bullshit stemming from situations well out of their control ,p6t05l

1492,"I'm out sick because of my co-worker, but please, by all means, make me feel like I'm inconveniencing the company.",please forgive the rant  but i need to get this off my chest before i climb a building and screech   i work in an office in which 95  of our employees are vaccinated  my direct co-worker is not vaccinated and has no interest in getting the covid vaccine  it's also worth mentioning that i absolutely hate germs and being around sick people  so you can imagine my displeasure when she came into work last thursday coughing up a storm  our boss made several comments about my co-worker coughing  but that's as far as it went   on monday  our boss began her vacation and is out this entire week  monday evening  i started to feel odd and left my friend's house after  according to him  looking as white as a ghost  followed by throwing up  over the course of the night  i started to feel progressively worse  when i woke up tuesday morning  my nose was blocked  my throat was on fire  i was sweating like a stripper in church  and i had severe sinus pressure  i sent a text message to our acting supervisor and let her know i would not be in due to the aforementioned   i scheduled a covid test that afternoon and was told it would be between 48-72 hours for results  with a chance they'd come back sooner than that  i screenshotted the appointment confirmation and the  pending results  section to our acting supervisor to show that i both scheduled and attended said appointment  when i was hired  i was told i could work from home once and awhile  and figuring that this is an important week for us since i work in the billing department  that instead of being out sick and not contributing in any way  that i work from home to ensure everything gets done in time for friday   the acting supervisor didn't get back to me until this morning and said that the big boss who's on vacation isn't thrilled about the idea of me working from home as the work isn't  quantifiable  but given the circumstances  they'll allow it for today and we'll revisit the situation tomorrow  i was also instructed to keep a log of what work i've performed throughout the day  i guess as some measure of justification or efficiency  great  thanks  since  you know  i didn't ask to get sick and my co-worker was the one who came to work coughing like some sort of animal   while i'm sat at home on my computer getting caught up on my e-mails and getting everything sorted  i get this passive-aggressive e-mail from my co-worker saying   you have two accounts with billing that's been sitting here since tuesday   i've been fucking out sick since tuesday  haven't i  not to mention i literally just got the approval to work from home  so pipe the fuck down and give me some time to catch up on everything  if i didn't get the approval and was told to take another sick day  those accounts would have sat there for another day   so now all i can think about is the fact that if i don't have a negative covid result feel well enough to return to the office tomorrow  i'll most likely have to take another sick day opposed to working from home  since they weren't entirely on board with me working remote  which begs the question as to why it was even pitched as a perk during the hiring process if it was going to be this much of a problem   not to mention the fact that knowing how my boss is  she's going to come back from vacation next week and bitch about how i wasn't at work to get everything done properly  as if it's my fucking fault that this bitch came to work sick  most likely got me sick  and i'm the one bleeding sick time during the busiest week of the month because of my co-worker's poor choice to come to work sick and my boss' poor choice of not sending the bitch home   and all these employers wonder why no one wants to work  who the fuck wants to deal with bullshit stemming from situations well out of their control ,p6t14j

1501,My father told me that his self-esteem depends almost entirely on his work. Our conversation about work and self-esteem made me anti-work before I even found this sub.,a couple months back  i was having a conversation with my mother  father  and sister about finding a job  working while in school  etc  my parents place a large emphasis on work and praise me for working 30 hours a week while taking summer classes but would ridicule my sister for being lazy and working less  discussing this with my parents  it's clear that for them and their generation  baby boomers  your intrinsic value derives from how much you work or how much you make  during this conversation  my dad directly told me that he would feel useless and purposeless without going to work  it was not solely a matter of enjoying his work and how it fulfilled him  but that he would feel less valued or important for even working less  my father has worked incredibly hard for his entire life  even into his sixties  he works 13 days in a row  drives an hour there and back  and works 50 hours a week  i was taken aback when he told me this straight out  and it made me take a step back from all the work i do at work and school to question where i'm getting my self-worth from   what's even crazier to me is that my mom is struggling to maintain a relationship with my dad because of his work  she tells me all the time that he's a  workaholic  and she wants to spend more time with him and all of us as a family  but even for her  she can't seem to escape her reliance on house work and chores to bolster her self-esteem  i just see both my parents trapped in cycles where they work so hard and it benefits nothing in their lives but their self-esteem   having an objective perspective of their situations  i hope to build my self-esteem on things outside of my work  such as building positive relationships and growing my self-confidence through my hobbies  no matter how hard i work  my value comes from me just existing  i think younger generations are picking up on this  so i hope people stuck like my parents can become un-stuck and find reasons to value themselves outside of their work ,p71kn9

1550,A little rant and request for advice,i work for the state of new york in a field that requires a minimum number of staff on shift for safety reasons  so if there's a hole in the schedule for any reason  somebody on shift is forced to work another shift up to 16 total hours  i understood going in that this would occasionally happen  if someone calls in an hour before their shift  and you can't find someone willing to work it  it is what it is  but the agency's personnel department has never been competent at adequately staffing the agency  in ten years i've worked for it i've seen locations where everybody gets mandated every day and i've seen vacant positions go unfilled for years  the pandemic has made the already bad staffing issues much worse and i've been working multiple non-consensual double shifts per week for over a year and a half  they're required to give 8 hours off between shifts  i have an hour commute so for me  this 8 hours is six hours  then i have to do personal things like shower and eat when get i get home and give myself an hour before i leave for work to get ready  so this six hours turns into a maximum of four hours of sleep in-between 16 hour non-consensual shifts  this is not sustainable and i see now that the agency will not ever get it's shit together and this situation will not get any better so i've been calling in after i get mandated and refusing and doing precursory searches for what other jobs are out there  some of the the agency's actions have been and continue to be unethical and abusive  there had been a policy that mandation was a last resort  only to be done when there was no other possible way to meet the staffing minimums  but last year they instituted a new policy that part time employees would be mandated before full time workers could volunteer to pick up a shift to save the state some money on overtime  i didn't even think this was legal  i checked with the union and they said it was  it's highly unethical to put money before consent and i think whoever thought of this policy belongs in jail  morally if they're not technically breaking any laws  they've counterproductively instituted hiring freezes  and they're supposed to get someone to relieve you if you're facing a fourth consecutive non-consensual double shift but my boss's boss had made it clear verbally in writing that they don't have to  i've made it clear to my immediate supervisors that i don't give a fuck and i'll call in when i need to and i'm done sacrificing my wellness because of the agency's lack of competence or ethics and i don't care if i get fired   i'm going to a doctor later today to try to get a note that says i need reasonable accomodations and can't work like that   sorry for the long rant  mostly why i'm posting is for some advice about my future being uncertain  the most responsible thing to do would probably be to line up another job  then quit my current one  but i'm wondering if getting fired  getting unemployment for a while  then getting a new job would be a good move  do i still need to be fired to collect unemployment  when i looked into it 20 years ago  a person was not eligible for any benefits if they'd voluntarily left their last job  should i worry about the reference  i know there is very limited information a former employer can give and they probably do only confirm employment dates but i'm a little worried they'd say i was terminated and not rehireable and this job is ten years of work experience for me so i don't want to burn the reference  please help,p7cuqo

1604,I go for a walk in the park every morning and it has seriously helped my mood,lately i had been feeling so depressed regarding work  especially after over a year locked in the house  that i decided that something had to change  every morning i get up i dread having to start the day with nothing but teams meetings and stand up calls with bosses breathing down my neck on the updates for the day and work that needs doing   my regular day begins at 9 but now i wake up at 7 and head off to the park by 7-30  it s a 15 min commute from home but really worth it  and spend about 30-45 minutes in fresh air under the huge trees  i am lucky to live in an area that has a fairly decent and safe park around me and am making the most use of it    changing my routine to start the day with something that isn t work and is just my own time feels very refreshing  i also get a good nights sleep and waking up is no problem at all  the best part is taking a novel with me and reading for that little time so when i am back i have done something that brings me joy  that way am better prepared to take all the heat of the day from my bosses    tl dr  if you live near a park or can walk to a small green area near you just do it early morning before you start work  it brings positive vibes and is also good for your mental health,p699bt

1636,Addiction to instant gratification is a symptom of burnout caused by work,i would estimate people have about 3 hours to themselves  roughly  during a weekday   8 hours sleep 8 hours at work  low estimate usually higher  1 hour meal  cooking  eating  cleanup  if you're cooking every meal so 3 hrs cooking 2 hours commute total  so basic estimation you have about 3 hours to yourself  3 hours to soothe the physical and or mental strains of the work day   this is less than 20  of your waking hours   because personal time is so scarce on working days  working people naturally tend towards activities that provide a large amount of relief and entertainment without much time investment   moreover  because the workday and time spent maintaining yourself as a worker takes up so much of the day  you have a limited amount of energy  attention  mental space to spend towards any particular activity   this only leaves room for a particular type of activity  low time investment  low difficulty  with high returns on chemical stimulation   reality tv  netflix serials  video games  online pornography  drug use  etc   all fulfill the chemical needs as best they can  and as the 8 hours of work becomes more dense with tasks over time  one looks to even leaner time investment  lower difficulty  and higher returns   you can certainly engage yourself in other types of activities  but you sacrifice other aspects of maintaining yourself as a worker in the long term  like sleep or nutrition   work culture itself creates the consumption culture by profiting from your suffering at work   by suffering at work we feed both mouths of the monster  with our labor at work  and purchasing the salves for our suffering at home ,p65b5x

1641,Quitting white collar work rant,i left my job a few years ago and am just floating  all the work i have ever done  i could have easily done straight out of junior high      in my last role  i was with the federal government as a human rights desk officer covering several countries in southeast asia  sounds great but this meant my days and occasional nights and weekends were dedicated to writing talking points  summarizing research  coordinating on the assistant secretary's travel plans    literally coordinating with other diplomats to make sure he got his favorite room at a hotel and restaurant reservations for some meetings   and there was the soccer game he wanted arranged so he could kick the ball around with local kids in that country   of course i would have to share note taking duties during meetings  none of this was intellectually demanding or required specialized skills   the work is what it is  but why require experienced people with graduate degrees to perform glorified executive assistant roles  i am not disparaging executive assistants  rather highlighting qualification inflation and creating expectations of fulfilling jobs that just aren't   maybe my disillusionment is more specific to foreign public policy type work  but after having witnessed a colleague being berated during a meeting because the travel itinerary for her country was not finalized while i received praise for my travel itinerary  i decided that my forty something back aching body with graduate degrees has had enough of this ridiculousness   i was so insulted by the work and then to be praised for being a good summarizer and travel itinerary coordinator was just extra vinegar   i resigned with no plans   now i'm an older forty something with a several year gap on the resume   most likely will never be hired again and it terrifies me and i don't care at the same time   i love not working in a hierarchy or performing menial tasks  but i also feel guilty for not using my knowledge for some good   do you have a story   how did you pivot into a new life ,p6kfzs

1779,Work frustration rant,rant based on my frustration with work culture     i hate how we re made to work so much  during the week most of us don t have time to do anything else  because we re tired and still got chores to do  people working a lot always say how it s for the future  to ensure a good future  but what about now   we give our best years to working  so what  so we d have time when we re retired  you know what my grandma did once she retired  fucking nothing  because over the years her health became so bad her heart condition doesn t even allow her to get a fucking massage  she worked years  and doesn t even get a pension that could allow her to do anything but barely get by  this is the future i m supposed to look forward to   besides you don t know how long you re going to live  you could get into an accident at any moment  people die  get sick and become disabled every day for so many unexpected reasons  your family could also die   and what s ironic  is that when someone dies  what do people say   i wish i had more time with them  but you did  it s just that our current work culture made you spend countless hours at work and not with the people you love  how many parents have you heard say that they wish they could have more time with their kids  but instead they re working because they need to provide and everything s so expensive  while the wages stay low  how many parents are missing out on their kids growing up and not bonding as close as they wish to   i m not against work  i m against the amount of work we re supposed to do  while our best years are flying by and we can t enjoy them as much as we should  i m against being a fucking slave to companies that don t give a flying fuck about us  i m against having to make work the center of my life for my whole life  i m against sacrificing myself  my health  my life for a job  we get one life  our close ones get one life  we don t know how long we have left  but we can t do shit about the work culture  companies love to say how they re all into letting their employees have work-life balance  but that s just not true  it s not a balance if 5 out of 7 days of my week are dedicated to work only  and it s not like for the two days i can do nothing   i have to do chores  i couldn t do during the week because i didn t have time for them   yes  there are people who are fortunate and they love their work or have money  or whatever  but that s just not the case for most of us  i hate that this is my life and it s going to be because it s forced on us ,p5d8u5
1780,Can we call homelessness what it really is?,the pc way to address this isn't  houselessness  what a useless term   they aren't homeless  they're houseless  i hear  like it does anything  how about  displaced persons  or  refugees of an exploitative housing market   homelessness is the threat that bosses and landlords use to force you to work  the persistent reminder that you are two paychecks away from being out on the streets  and then where will you be  homeless people get cleared away by the cops and get robbed by people passing by  houseless people don't own property but displaced persons have displacers   not to mention that if we were all promised a dedicated place to live and food to eat  we could turn our collective attention to correcting the climate crisis  all the big manufacturing corporations would have to do is reduce plastic production like they should have done decades ago and enthusiastic volunteers could handle the rest  it is not our fault we are all to busy and too tired to clean up their mess  we are too busy scrounging to survive to organize and they cultivated this outcome on purpose    i'm trying to reach out where i can  the anonymity of the internet helps and doesn't help simultaneously  i know i have allies  i just don't know where they are  i want to protect them and myself from trolls and belligerent attacks but how can i reach out and stay shielded at the same time   sorry about the tangent  but action must be taken and protests just get shut down so i'm trying to come at the problem from another angle  i'm not scared of hard work and i can't argue with every idiot but i can certainly stare down the world's problems and roll up my sleeves  crude oil is finite but elbow grease is a renewable resource and i can use my supply to help people that don't exploit me  if you've gotten this far  thank you ,p5lqop

1824,"For as bad as you think healthcare is, it’s even worse.",i ve never felt more de-humanized in my life  i m 32 and have worked in various industries  all of them pretty bad but healthcare is a whole different level of soulless  crushing defeat    like most  i got into healthcare to feel satisfied with what i do for money  to feel like i was making a difference  helping people    the truth couldn t be more opposite  healthcare workers are exploited so that the huge companies can make billions  turnover is outrageous as people are desperate to find a facility that isn t going to work them to death  publicly  they call us heroes  day to day we are overworked  underpaid  emotionally  physically  and psychologically abused    i won t make this too long but i just can t believe the lengths these companies will go to wring every penny out of patients using the blood  sweat and tears of its employees  all in the name of  fighting the good fight  and  serving their communities  don t fall for it ,p55ucy
1825,Question: Life Expectations,i have been reading this forum  and i come across quite a bit of people with a similiar attitude  my question for you guys is  what is your expectation of how life should be      i hear people call working  slavery  because you have to work to survive  but by that logic is every animal ever born a slave   each animal has to do tons of hard work to get enough food  find a mate  raise children  if its that kind of animal  so my question is  what is the expectation for human life  i always make analogues to the animal world as that helps me make sense of things  so it sounds like people want the life of a pet animal  who doesn't really do anything  but wouldn't that be boring  if all your needs are always provided for  personally i think id prefer being a wild wolf with a lower life expectancy   then a dog stuck in an apartment all day  with all these amazing amenities  that it takes for granted and cant appreciate anymore      but perhaps i am thinking of this incorrectly  i would love it if you could explain why i am wrong  or your perspectives,p5h6yg

1828,Reflections on the Lost American Dream,sitting at my nanny job while the toddler sleeps    i am over the american ideal of  success   the idea of staying in a job and having no control of my days off  vacation  or where and when i work makes me want to curl up and die   the american dream is lost on me    i want to make my schedule  i want to take breaks and see the world  i want multiple streams of income    i don't feel that healthcare and retirement are even attractive perks for me    i would rather pay my own catastrophic plan and invest my extra time in exercise  meditation  yoga  cannabis  and cooking for myself    i don't think the world will be livable by the time i reach retirement  so why buy into a company's 401k when they can yeet me at any time for any reason  no  i'm investing in myself  and maybe a roth ira that no one can take away from me    being beholden to pto approval and public holidays makes me panic   why should some incompetent middle manager get to decide when i can have time off    i'm a strong leftist   but i feel that this oppressive culture is pushing me to have to fend for myself because no employer gives a damn about retaining talent anymore   they don't care about your well being  you are just a tool   a tool to be used until you are ragged and must be thrown away   fast fashion employment  the revolving door   fuck that shit  i am not lazy  i have so much energy and ideas to invest in things that align with my ethics and values    i am no longer being a captive tho    i will no longer live to work    i will take control  even though it's scary   i will live life on my terms   not hr's   i will liberate as many as will come w me    s lo el pueblo salva el pueblo  ,p5i0uw

1833,feeling worthless,i ve worked at a very big very known grocery store as a cashier for a year and have had 3 different assistant managers  i used to get around 10 hours a week which was low but not too bad considering im 17 and living with my parents but since i ve been working under the current manager i ve been slowly getting less hours on my only shift per week  this week it s just 4 hours  and i can t do it anymore  i messaged her asking for more hours and she ignored it completely  i tried to talk to her in person but she seems to never be in when i need her  i asked the store manager for more hours after that and he said he would talk to her about it but i haven t heard anything since   i always thought of myself as someone who can separate my labour from who i am as a person but hearing about the new people hired every day while my paycheques get smaller has put my mental health at an all time low  it feels as though ive already lost the game i never started playing  i don t have bills and i don t have to pay for my own food  but having to beg the manager for hours and other employees for their unwanted shifts is exhausting and embarrassing  i feel this huge weight in my chest like my time is worth nothing and i m on the verge of being thrown out  i have to move out next year and go to college but the insecurity i feel right now is brutal it feels like i have no chance at avoiding poverty ,p5b3xn

1850,What i think about Hustle Culture?,fair warning  i'm a guy that is in between minimum wage jobs  i don't have one right now and currently living with my parents  so just if you're reading this and i'm think i'm a loser  i have to agree with you  you don't have to read the rest of this post  i just wanted to get this of my chest   what i think about hustle culture  its selling hope  hope that you will succeed if you just work hard  build yourself more  and maybe  just maybe you'll finally get your millions to buy the things you always wanted in life   what they don't tell you  i mean the media  news outlets  youtube  reddit  instagram  twitter  basically everything  is that you  the average joe or jane  most likely won't get there  why  its simple logic  in a game  there's always winner and losers  and more often than not  there are more losers than winners  the more successful the winner  the bigger the pool of losers  you'll never hear from them  well because their losers   if everyone is successful  no one is  not everyone can be millionaires  you need a lot of poor people to have little millionaires   the same thing can be said with the job market today  way back then  you didn't need a college degree to succeed  or have a stable life and family  now that the whole market is filled with college degrees  college degrees have become a minimum requirement for most high paying jobs  eventually there will come a time when masters degrees are the new minimum requirement   what these people who promote hustle culture have one thing in common  they sell you hope in a continuous loop  the people on youtube who promote hustle culture sell you hope in pieces so that if you fail  which most likely you will  you will come back to their channel and continue watching the videos that they make    its a continuous cycle of failing- gt hustle culture videos- gt failing- gt hustle culture videos that they want you to experience  eventually some people like me decide it isn't worth it anymore and drop out  in which we become the prime example of being a loser  and everyone else should work harder unlike us  thereby passively continuing the hustle culture    but why does everybody promote this  well because whether you're working for someone or owning a  business  you most likely have to pay taxes  taxes means higher income for the government  which stimulates the economy  it also means bigger bailouts for billionaires  and whoever is the 1  at the time    and since most of us are not at the top or the middle we will continue to work till our body breaks down  this also forces us to seek expensive medical attention later which costs money which also stimulates the economy  debt is also good for the economy   now i am not saying you will not succeed if you work hard  you just might just succeed to move yourself up to the middle or upper class if you try hard enough   but don't beat yourself up thinking that its sorely your fault if you fail despite trying  people get burnout   which can sometime lead to laziness like me  not everyone can be winners  its just how the world works ,p4v4iu

1853,A real life analogy for how life favors the rich,don't take this wrong  it's not a humble brag  but it's something i've noticed about upvotes  i was on reddit for a long time   i'd get an upvote or two here and there  if i got a few more all at once that was nice  then one night i said some simple thing in passing and when i woke up the next day i had a lot  well hell ngl that made me feel good  but mostly i just say stuff that matters to me or trying to help or whatever   but then as a couple years have gone by  i've said maybe a few more things that people liked but what i've noticed is that now it's a steady trickle  even if i don't comment for ages or get downvoted or whatever  it's just from the past    and that is  exactly  like rich people's money  i mean i knew it before in theory but it never happened to me because i make minimum wage and my bank account only ever gets smaller lol  they have this big amount and no matter what they do on any given day it gets bigger  this has to be the most obvious and simple truth about life  and yet it makes them believe that because of this  somehow they are better  it's irrational ,p51uw8

1855,Avoid being a city mail carrier for the USPS,today was my breaking point  i began training to be a city mail carrier for the usps in early july  but in mid august  i've had all i can take    if you not familiar with this position  you basically drive to various blocks in the city  park and walk a loop  you can walk up to 14 miles a day   now that in itself isn't bad  but when you have one day off a week that could magically disappear  it doesn't make better  nor does getting done with a long day of work  looking forward that date with a beautiful girl only to be told to go and deliver more shit    the pay is good  but i probably could make a decent amount money in an easier office job and still have a work life balance   i was also told to not talk about my interest and moving into an office position  because some may not take kindly to me not working myself to death   i use to think that being a mail carrier would be better than working for jeff bezos  but the usps has a amazon day  and i kid you not  that's my easiest day of the week other than the day i'm off  luckily  people at my former minimal effort minimum wage job still like me  so that's where i'm going until i get an office job  i will get me one of those cozy office jobs or die trying   i'm not going into the post office tomorrow or ever again ,p4nem3

1858,Finally quit... Residential MFT Therapist,i'm a therapist working at a residential treatment center for teens  teens have been impacted by the lockdowns more than anyone and its amazing to try to help them get their lives back on track  the problem is the cost cutting management and backbiting employees  they offer such low wages that they attract the bottom of the barrel and routinely  fail  to do the background checks and drug testing that i had to go through  the toxic and understaffed environment caused most of the good people to quit and only the insane and those with something to hide have been sticking around for the jobs like medical assistant etc    this leads to a bizarre environment of people completely unqualified to be working with mental ill teens forming cliques and creating toxic environments of gossip and reporting innocent things to management  things like buying the kids a board game or getting them a bottle of water on a outing   if these lazy fucking greedy management paid living wages for people with student debt sunk education costs then the place could be amazing but instead its a pit of gossiping vipers where the teens are treated as dogs to be ordered around  they get 800  per day per kid but the majority of that goes the ceo's private jet  real thing  and the inflated salaries of the few at the top  it's impossible to do good in an environment whos main purpose is greed  i don't know that i hate capitalism but i hate unregulated croney capitalism and i hate the venomous nature of for profit healthcare     amp x200b   i have so much more i could say if people are interested ,p4m0hh

1903,My work just demanded a 75%-100% productivity increase for all employees with no raises and I’m done…,so i work at a very well known sandwich place that rhymes with hubmay  i ve worked for this corporation off and on at various locations for a decade at this point  i ve worked as a manager so i know the ins and outs but it s bs so i decided to go back to being a regular employee at a different location    now i m still not sure if this is coming from corporate or the owners i m currently working for but i am pissed  the metric has been 7 units minimum per employee per hour plus doing all the side work to reach the target productivity for as long as i can remember  then suddenly this week we have 1 person less on every shift and are absolutely getting our asses kicked and being told our metric is 12-14 units per person per hour    i called them out on changing it and got a shrug and a  yeah we changed it  deal with it  response  needless to say i am livid  we ve been promised bonuses and raises for a year with nothing but bs for why it doesn t happen  now they have the balls to demand a 75-100  productivity increase with no raises in the middle of a pandemic and a labor shortage    oh hell no  eat the fattest of dicks and fuck off  i m not doing this shit  so yeah  this will be my last week for good dealing with that stack of rotten bologna ,p4jimz

1905,We are not indentured servants and have no obligation to work. Yet this is how the state treats us and the best example is unemployment.,unemployment insurance is payed through payroll taxes  a lot like social security  these are taxes payed by our employers in lieu of direct compensation  yet when a person goes to collect their benefits  and they are described as benefits  they need to jump through a number of hoops  some states cut off federal benefits  others talk about drug testing  most all states have work search requirements  and others provide mandatory seminars which provide bullshit advice on resumes  interview skills  etc  to get you back to work  why do they want to get you back to work  well they already collected the tax and they want to keep it  they want to keep the money that you paid in to unemployment ins  and they would like you and everyone to believe if you are not currently selling your soul that you are lazy and a drag on society   fuck that  i paid in and i m collecting my benefits for as long as allowed   that shit is my fucking money  i worked and paid into a system since 11 when i got my first paper route and i want my fucking money back without any bullshit ,p540aq

1929,My internship experience as part of my education [loooong rant],i just needed to vent about this  sorry about the super long post  might be a lil disjointed    i'm studying engineering in polytechnic  currently in an internship semester  where students have a choice to go source for a company and get  800 a month or stay in-house working on a project of our choosing for zero dollars  working hours for both are 0800 to 1730 on weekdays for 22 weeks     800 might as well be nothing  plus the school grades your impact outcome based on your contributions in your internship period  seeing as a random company aren't guaranteed to have meaningful projects to work on  students usually end up at start-ups  and we know how well those go  so i opted for the in-house option    this probably was the right decision in hindsight  my friend went with an outside company and they got him doing menial tasks and fixing xerox printers  in 2021  what's he gonna write in his report   anyway  the project i was assigned to was hella unorganised  the previous batch of student interns were trusted to document their progress and come up with manuals on how to operate the machines  areas of improvement  etc  and the current batch was just given a crash course by the former interns  the ones who showed up anyway  and left there with no supervision  the project supervisors are often doing lectures or whatever it is they're so busy with and only visit for 10 minutes maybe once a week    ok  my school's pretty big on the whole  self-learning  thing so i guess we'll just pull ourselves up by the bootstraps and whatnot  we dealt with automation  my station had conveyors  assembly lines  and robot arms  i learnt what i could  programmed the plc  robot control  though the real engineers would come in if i ran into something i couldn't do    but there wasn't always something to do  i'm pretty confident with plc programming and could eventually finish most tasks quickly  then it's counting hours for the day  at one point  the 20 year-old pneumatic compressor supplying air to my station broke and i was left with even less to fill my time  i had the longest days of my life during this semester    fast-forward multiple weeks and a merciful  for us  lockdown caused by covid spikes  and i'm in my last week of internship  they fixed the compressor  i finished my work  my station is fully autonomous  reports and documentation done  i did everything i needed to ahead of schedule    my batch must've been hardworking because the director decided he wanted to meet all the in-house interns across all projects  he said his thanks and whatever   we hope you will continue your learning journey and come back to work on your respective projects  projects are never done   to show our appreciation  we'll be providing free lunch for today  yada yada yada    through the session  i was left wondering what a school director's does for their job  that they could take the time to do this  i could be watching anime in my lab  it was my last day anyway  but wait  there's more    the director and management board decided they wanted to see our group's project in-person  out of all the others  and they would greatly appreciate if we could come back next week for a demo  i doubt they'll be providing free lunch this time    i feel like they don't respect the students' time  we were forced to skip our holidays and work for you  without pay  while other students were on holiday  we were coming back 0800 to 1730  and now on our last day  you want us to come back and personally show you our work  couldn't have read our reports  watched the videos that showed the operation processes  anything besides stealing more of our off-time    this just reeks of shit  i had to quit my part-time video-editing job to for this internship  i had to solve every problem that arose myself  22 weeks for a  6 lunch set  like paying your interns isn't a sign of appreciation    the other interns in my project group didn't seem affected  but they defo should be  fuck the director and his nothing job  the management board can manage deez nuts    my internship is finished  give me my grade and i'll enjoy my life with 22 weeks i'll never get back ,p55t1t

1970,I think COVID-19 gave us the revolution,it's not like we could've demanded higher wages that effectively  yes in some parts of the us they were getting the 15 hour that was mocked by republicans  now due to people not wanting to work and  people on unemployment the wages were raised   at this point you literally cannot pay me enough to work at your shitty restaurant job  but you're still needing workers  so you have to pay better    covid-19 did some of the same things that the black plague did for serfs in the dark ages  because lower class serfs rebelled against the lower wages they became something called the middle class    i don't know how it will all play out with covid-19 but i doubt we are ever going back to  7- 9 an hour    despite all the people who died the wage increase is one thing that covid-19 was able to get the rich fools to do for us in the lower class    make no mistake  we live in a class system in america  we still very much have leftover feudal age lifestyles ,p4ysvp

2001,I quit a job that almost made me kill myself,hi reddit  i'm glad i found this subreddit so i have a place to vent about this    i've been working at this company for 3 years now  casual  i was desperate for work back then and took what i could get  i became good at what i did   front shop pharmacy   and for 3 years i put work before myself  worked harder and harder everyday for r50 an hour  converted thats  3 38 and hour    anyways  for 3 years my salary was never once reviewed  thereafter they had me working 4-5 different sections of the pharmacy on a weekend  even delivering for the drivers       nd eventually weeks   during these years i tried to work myself up to a permanent position  i spoke to my boss more than i can count on my fingers  everytime a new position opened up i saw a new face  this happened 4 times where they didn't even consider me  making me think  what's wrong with me  am i that bad  so i kept working and pushing   some days i'd be opening  capturing and invoicing stock  then i'd have to pack the shelves  replace all of the physical labels  etc  they also had me work the tills and make sure parels are sent out  etc  keep in mind there are more than enough staff to do this  but because i kept on doing what they wanted with no questions or complaints they kept piling it on me  more and more  never upping my salary and still hiring people they had never met over me  all whilst still paying me  3 38    come 2021  i have been doing such a good job they ask me to come in everyday  hell yeah   i think to myself  it's finally coming  i'm going to get a full time job  when i arrived there the next week i was expecting to be spoken to about full time contracts  etc  2 weeks pass  i'm thinking ok it's covid pandemic  we are busy  i'm sure they 2ill remember  come 6 weeks  nothing   no pay increase  no health benefits   3 38 an hour working 8-18 00 with one hour lunch  sometimes no lunch  at this point i felt like i was managing the place for the manager  everybody was just blaming me for their mistakes  it was always me no matter what  upon asking my boss again about working full time i got the same thing i'd been hearing for 3 years  i am trying to fit you in  find a place  then what about the previous positions that opened up  i just at there thinking to myself  me  too scared to ask for a raise because i'm just a casual  anyways  weeks pass after i'd been working every day  the depression is kicking in  i want to kill myself    i planned it  knew what i wanted to do and started to prepare slowly but surely  i gave myself a week to say goodbye and spend time with my family after my boss said i wasn't needed that week because it's not busy  anyways  time almost arrived  before i could do anything i wanted to talk to my mom one last time  my partner  my dad  etc  as we were sitting there  my mom just bursts out into tears  followed by the news that a very close friend of mine had just killed himself  distraught  i turned pale and broke down  that night i still get hounded by my boss telling me to come into work because i'm needed  whatever  i do it  i feel more depressed than ever  got my salary for working so much  same hourly rate  yet i couldn't afford things i just needed  closer and closer to snapping   then my friend's funeral service hit  they were talking about him and how his job drove him to taking his own life  the unhappiness  i broke down in tears  still in tears    anyways  lastnight was enough  i sent my boss a message without notice  telling her that i quit  we didn't burn any bridges between us though  people seem sad that i quit but that's probably because they don't have one person to do all the work they don't want to do anymore  i finally freed myself from the place that's been holding me back for nearly 4 years   i quit  i feel good  but also  i'm just scared  for the future  i still have the privilege of living in my parents home at the moment  this morning people from work were trying to phone me and i felt guilty not answering why should i   at this point i feel so relieved that that chapter is closed now  i just don't know what to do from here   but i do want to say this  in a work space  we are all unfortunatelt easily replaceable   but there's only one of you to those that matter     as of now in definitely scared to start fresh but also excited  i'm finally free   tldr  quit a job that made me suicidal   got paid horribly  worked multiple job sections  i was being used  now i have quit and i feel scared and lost    sorry for the long ass  post guys  and for any spelling errors ,p3iog8
2002,I’ve worked for FedEx for 11 months and I’m finally quitting,i  m23  started working for fedex ground last september  at the height of the pandemic  i was a package handler in a hub  meaning my job was to load trucks that were going to be distributed out to other hubs all over the country  very physically demanding and fast paced work  but i enjoyed it when i started   it was fulfilling to get to the end of a sort and feel accomplished in what we finished  and the physical benefits were also great  i was basically getting paid to work out for six hours every day  and over the course of 6-7 months  i lost 50-60lbs  i m stronger and in better shape now than i ve ever been in my life  and i have nothing but that job to thank for that    i made it through the insanely busy christmas season  peak season  just fine  and was looking forward to getting back to normal come january  and for about a month and a half  it did kinda go back to normal  but in mid february  things changed  our hub and sort managers both left  and the new managers were  less than stellar  there was a tangible shift in morale almost overnight as soon as they took over  and as time went on  shit kept getting worse and worse  the amount of work we were asked to do everyday was insane  and they d be constantly asking people to come in early  and stay late to help finish it  i was part time  but the full time people would routinely put in 12-15 hour days  sure they were getting paid really well  but at what cost  they had just enough time to go home and sleep for 7 hours before they would have to get up and do it all over again   that  and they started pulling random unscheduled  mandatory  shifts out of their asses  even on holidays  and said we needed to show up for them even if it was on a day we normally have off  i never went to a single one  fuck that noise    so i finally decided to quit this week  my friend who worked there too quit last week and so i was there  on my own  in blistering and suffocating heat  trying to figure out anything that would make staying worth it  and i couldn t think of anything  this job lives or dies by the managers you have and the people you work with  so decided i m done   ultimately  fedex can be a nice place to work if the conditions and managers are good  otherwise it fucking sucks and you d be better off doing literally anything else   if you have any questions about specifics and what led me to decide to leave  ask away ,p3t9o8

2004,Bitcoin is Anti-Work,in a fiat money system the value of human labor is stolen through an invisible tax called inflation  which is effectuated through currency debasement and money printing  the system has dug itself so far into a debt hole that we cannot stop or the whole system will collapse    in an inflationary money system  the value of your labor goes down every year  the position this puts you in as an employee  is an endless cycle of trying to figure out how to work more  work longer hours   and earn more literally just so you can maintain the exact same standard of living that you had the year prior  you have to go to your corporate overlords and beg them to pretty please give you a higher wage  because you automatically get a wage cut every year due to money printing stealing your purchasing power    this brings us to bitcoin  bitcoin is a fixed supply monetary system that cannot be debased at-will by self-interested monetary overlords  it cannot be debased  and because of the natural growth of technological innovation which is a strong deflationary force in the modern world  under a bitcoin based money system  we would enter into a deflationary economic environment  that favors the middle and lower classes   no longer do you have to beg for a raise  you automatically get a raise in purchasing power every year  because goods and services are allowed to benefit from the deflationary forces of technological innovation  groceries become cheaper  housing becomes cheaper    everything you need to survive becomes more affordable  because no longer is your surplus value and the innovation of technology being siphoned and stolen from you through endless money printing by centralized entities and used for inefficient central planning   under a deflationary bitcoin monetary system  you could work less and have more time to pursue your interests and spend time with your loved ones  because you would be more financially free   bitcoin is financial freedom from an economic system designed to exploit you for your value  bitcoin is freedom from financial slavery   bitcoin is anti-work ,p3ytxc

2007,I sincerely love you all,i don t ever really post stuff like this  but this sub and the people who ve contributed to it have in a very real way saved my life  every day since 2016 when i graduated from college and started the rat race i felt both trapped and suicidal  i couldn t extract the faintest glimmer of meaning from my daily experiences with work  no matter what job i got it all seemed the same to me  in essence transferring from one prison to another just to live  i felt so incredibly alone and thought i was just one of the weak malcontents of society   thank you so much for showing me that i m not alone nor am i insane  every time i m on this sub and i see it grow i feel like some kind of widespread change is possible despite how utterly hopeless it all seems  in the words of the late great philosopher mark fisher     the very pervasiveness of capitalist realism means that even glimmers of alternative politics and economic possibilities can have a disproportionately great effect  the tiniest event can tear a hole in the grey curtain of reaction which has marked the horizons of possibility under capitalist realism  from a situation in which nothing can happen  sudd not anything is possible again  - capitalist realism  is there no alternative ,p3rtdm
2008,Today has been a collassal waste of my time for no reason other than my boss thinks people can't be trusted to work from home.,as i write this  it is currently 4 p m  local time  the phones and internet went down in my office today at noon  i have a stack of work sitting on my desk that i am literally incapable of doing in the office  and yet my boss wont let me leave to work from home  i have been sitting at my desk on my phone for 4 hours  watching youtube and browsing reddit right in front of my boss just to press the point that this is a waste of my time  but i know that in the end  he'll get the last laugh because i'll either have to come in over the weekend to do everything i can't do today  or  and this is the best part  i'll end up taking it home and doing it tonight on my time instead of during the day on his time  the worst part is that this is a salary job so i don't even get paid for working late or on the weekend ,p3sx6t

2011,Hate my job after transfer.,in february i got a job at a convenience store after being fired the previous year from a 18 yr desk job  i actually really enjoyed it  it was a complete 180  as i am now constantly moving and getting to see and talk to people all day long  i was thriving  no one in 5 months yelled at me  made me feel stupid  treated me like a child  and they were all super nice  the store was non-stop most of the time  but it was very low stress because of how management and supervisors treated everyone   i transferred back to where i have a support system at the beginning of the month  yesterday was my first day at my new store  it was horrible  first off i was told before that their store is super busy  and it may very well be based on numbers  but they have so much staff that i had time to literally just stand around several times  it certainly was not as fast paced as my last store  which you think might be good but the manager was in a constant state of being frazzled  it was ridiculous  i was reprimanded for cashing a lottery voucher that i had been cashing daily for 5 months at my old store because  only managers do that here  apparently it's because the salespeople are seen as too stupid to do it correctly as i was told there ere  too many mistakes when everyone could do it   there is a time from 11a-2pm referred to as ahod  meaning all hands in deck  for the first hour i was on register and they they wanted me to move to kitchen  so i take a sup of my drink in the break room before washing my hands  something that was literally as much as a non-issue as breathing at my last store  and this was the resulting  conversation   asst  manager  am  olive  what are you doing  me  om  i'm headed to the kitchen  am  no  what are you doing in here   meaning the break room  om  ummm  getting a drink before i was my hands  am  this is ahod  no one leaves their posts  you don't get a drink  you don't use the bathroom  you don't enter the break room for anything  om  o  k  i was just getting a drink  i'll head back now   i then wash hands head to the kitchen and after doing a walk-through stand around for 10 minutes with nothing to do   at the end of the shift i went to the  actual  manager to ask a question  she snapped  do you need something  i asked her how she thought the day went and then a question about whether i was allowed to do something or not   since i was allowed at my last store but  obviously  that isn't a guarantee at this one  she  still a frazzled fucking mess snaps   i haven't had a moment to even think about today  and then waived me off saying yeah whatever to my question   i am 40 fucking years old  i know how to do my job  i know when not to take a quick break and when i can take one  i'm not about to be told i'm not allowed to take a drink or go to the bathroom  as i am not currently  not have i ever been  incarcerated   5 months of an amazing job  and in 1 day i know i'm leaving  came home last night and put in 8 applications  quite honestly  i'm tempted to text her  as she's obviously too busy for a face to face conversation or phone call  and just saying  i quit  and never going back  or hell  maybe just email hr  tell them everything i've written here and saying i resign immediately ,p4cgtv

2013,I can’t handle work anymore,i m so sick and tired of working  i ve had 8 different jobs since 2017 and the longest i was able to keep one was only a year  i ve worked both full and part time  in fast food and retail but i get so frustrated and burnt out that i either call out to the point of getting fired for it or i end up quitting  i ve been suicidal on and off because of my jobs    currently i work overnight at a grocery store but the managers are so demanding and there been coworkers shit talking about me  i overheard them on my first day  and again last time i was on lunch  it s also really draining me physically  last time i think i was truly happy was when i was on unemployment last year    i m living with my in-laws and i m terrified of being a burden  my father in law is a workoholic that would rather be at work than at home  and i m scared he probably thinks i m a lazy bum because i can t handle working  my poor boyfriend has stuck to my side this whole time and has helped me a ton during the times i wasn t  working but i feel like i m just a pain in the ass  unfortunately i m also impulsive  i ended up racking up 9k of debt  well my boyfriend is a part of it  he has his name on one of my cards but isn t fully responsible for the debt  during a period where i was like  fuck it  nothing matters because everything is gonna crash and burn in 20 years so i might as well enjoy my life now  but now i m freaking tf out over the debt  i wanted to try filing bankruptcy but my boyfriend begged and cried for me not to and said he s gonna help pay it all off   at this point tho i m probably gonna file anyways and hope for the best   i really want to move out of his parents house but with all this debt over our heads  plus the fact that i can t keep a job and apartments and homes are stupid expensive where we live makes it impossible  but my mental health is draining even more by staying here   few examples of what goes on  roaches  dirty sibling in laws that don t clean up after themselves  my stuff keeps going missing but everyone denies it   i got diagnosed with adhd and depression at 15 but i don t have any of my medical info for that  my parents have it but i m no contact with them  i also have my suspicions that i m on the autism spectrum and have ptsd from my childhood and borderline personality disorder  i saw a doctor a few days ago and she said she would refer me to a psychiatrist  and now i m also going to a  talk group  starting today  but that s all that s happened so far   i m currently on leave from my job because my boyfriend tested positive from covid  i m supposed to go back in a week and a half   my leave got extended so i could take care of my bf  but i really don t wanna go back  what the hell can i do  cuz at this point i m feeling worthless as hell  and even thinking about going back to work is making my stomach churn    i want to see if i qualify for disability or something but i doubt i d get approved  i m just now seeing a psychiatrist and i heard for mental illness you re supposed to be on treatment for 2 years before they consider you ,p3j6h1

2030,I automated the vast majority of both my job and my wife's job and now we only have about an hour of real work everyday.,i made this throwaway account because some of my coworkers know of my original reddit account and i don't want anyone finding out about this  i have been lurking on this subreddit  but never posted due to that reason   we both have bas in economics and after we graduated  we got decently paying  but extremely boring and repetitive desk jobs where are roles are extremely similar   when covid hit  we all went remote and then they decided that aren't actually needed in person will stay remote permanently  this includes my wife and i   i've always liked computers  but never learned how to program  however  around the beginning of the year  i decided to try and teach myself  i decided on starting with python and started with a great course i found on reddit  not sure if i should mention the name  i don't want to seem like a shill    i started doing this just to learn programming  but as i went through it i realized that i could use so much of what i was learning to automate my own job  i did the course for about 30-60 minutes per day and finished after about a month and a half  after i finished that  i had to learn a bit more on my own in order to properly write the scripts  after that i helped my wife automate her job as well  and now we both work about an hour per day doing stuff that i haven't been able to automate   initially i was thinking of going to my boss and telling him for a raise  but i'm sure they'd just cut costs  have me automate other peoples jobs  and then keep 90  of the profits so i decided against it   i have been so nervous over the past few months that i'd get caught  but so far i have been safe  no one has noticed at all  i've been thinking of getting a second similar job and then automating that  but i am worried that would be pushing it and i'd be killing the goose that lays the golden eggs  instead  i might keep learning more programming and doing some part-time freelancing   i am mostly using pandas  selenium  and a few other tools  i don't want to go into too much specifics about what i do exactly just due to a fear of someone finding out who i am   if you think your job can be similarly automated  feel free to comment message me for advice  i have a lot more free time now and i could use it to help others here get started with python and automating their job  also  let me know if you think i should post the name of the course i used  i wanted to give as much information and help in my post as possible  but i also didn't want to seem like a shill so i wasn't sure whether or not to mention it ,p3wvdy

2036,"IT, Homeoffice",i hope this belongs here  it's about work and not working  simultaneously   got up at 7 am  although i originally intended 6 am  but who cares  my colleagues don't  and my manager wont show up until 9 am anyway  alarm clocks are a thing of the past since the onset of covid  as i don't commute anymore   logged into a variety of remote teamware stuff  so everyone can see that i'm here  got into some pants  and went outside to get some energy drinks to fire me up  -- oh  look  there's some pizza left  yess  a man needs to eat breakfast   checked all the news  forum posts etc that accumulated while i slept  this will keep me busy until 10 am  when the great department meeting via zoom starts  i have no actual part in that  besides one or another canny remark if opportunity arises   this will last one hour  or one and a half  maybe some colleague wants to know something  or some urgent test or other special task needs to be done  of course i'll hurry to comply  but that's it  around 1 pm  i'm gonna log out of everything  and let the weekend begin    this kind of anti-work comes with the great advantage of paying rather well  -- it just requires 20 years of  actual  work experience plus a 2 year degree in some engineering magic to keep a rather positive attitude towards  work  while not doing very much of it anymore   in our company  we have some people like that  something like eternal employees  everyone knows they don't do much work anymore  but they can't be fired because they accumulated too much knowledge -- their experience with products and processes is valuable and dangerous at the same time  karl marx called them  worker aristocracy  working class people like everyone else  but in privileged positions compared to all those interns and newbs with too little experience and cunningness to navigate the shitty rat race like a fish in the water   some of those poor souls once will rise up to be in such positions eventually  but most will drop out of the race before  burned out and sucked empty    the system is shit  but it's far from invincible ,p3i58a

2141,Why has the pandemic given workers an excuse for to do a shitty job?,i am very anti-work and i don't really like working  but it's my opinion if you are employed  you should at least do the bare minimum of what is required    in between buying a home  getting carpet put down  and a few other things  i've lost track of how many times people have either given me a window of time of when they will call back or a specific time  and never call back    i almost lost out on our mortgage because one employee involved in the process  i literally had to call and track them down a day or two after a time frame was given  not once  not twice  but over 8 separate times   go to get carpet installed  and i asked the salesperson when i would expect a call back with a quote  and was told  if not the same day  tomorrow  not only did this person not call back  at all  she fucking went on vacation without giving any of my info to another salesperson  again  if i didn't take time out of my day to have to call back myself  this would of never been done   these are just two of many different examples  which have all been given excuses similar to  well we are in the pandemic so things take longer   alright  i totally understand that  but if the pandemic is making it take longer to do your job  then you need to communicate that with your clients  don't tell someone your going to call them back tuesday at 2pm if you are too back-logged to do so  tell them it will be thursday    to me  it's almost like these places are extremely behind  but handing out false promises and expectations like candy in order to create a facade of things being normal     i'm very patient and don't mind waiting  but between my own self-employment job and renovating a house we just bought  if you give me a time to expect a call  i can't very well be 8 foot up a ladder with a paint roller and masking tape and take your call  so i set aside some time  since no one called during that time  that's my own time i'm wasting not getting shit done   what really puts the dingleberry on the entire shit cake is no one apologizes for their behavior either  so not only is the pandemic given an excuse  it's normalizing it as well   if you don't want to work  then don't  if you want to quit  then quit  i fully support it  but if you are in the middle of something when you quit  at least have the decency to make sure someone else has that information    there is a clear difference between quitting and quitting like an idiot  i honestly don't think some of these people have any empathy to consider what impact their quitting has on other people  it's fine if you don't care about the other workers  but it's the people who depend on that company for their service or product being left behind    because i can guarantee you that if the roles were reversed and someone quitting impacted their life in some way  they wouldn't be very happy either  how would you like if you took your car to get its oil changed and the person changing it walked off the job  and they didn't have anyone else available to change it for 3 days ,p3bequ

2168,Labor Revolt of the White River Utes,so  i m reading this book on 19th century native american u s  relations  bury my heart at wounded knee  by dee brown  and came across a bit of anti-work history involving the white river utes of western colorado   note  the following contains sensitive content  discriminatory language and reference to violent events in u s  history    at the time  late-1870s  the white river utes were being displaced from their land through a series of broken treaties that allowed miners to flood into colorado in search of gold  as usual  the u s  government coerced the utes onto a nearby reservation  but the tribe still maintained a strong hunter-gatherer culture   in comes their newly appointed  indian agent a position tasked  essentially  with communicating to tribes on behalf of the u s  government  at best an agent could help petition the government for more food and provisions  obtain more consistent annuity payments  for previously seized land  maybe even secure weapons for off-reservation buffalo hunting  at worst  well  meet nathan meeker    gt nathan meeker  was possessed of a missionary fervor and sincerely believed that it was his duty as a member of the superior race to  elevate and enlighten  the utes    in his humorless and overbearing way  meeker set out systematically to destroy everything the utes cherished  to make them over into his own image  as he believed he had been made in god's image  his first unpopular action was to move the agency fifteen miles down white river  where there was fine pastureland suitable for plowing  here meeker planned to build a cooperative agrarian colony for ute indians  but he overlooked the fact that the utes had been using the area as a hunting ground and for pasturing their horses  the site he chose to build agency buildings on was a traditional racing strip where the utes enjoyed their favorite sport of betting on pony races      gt     gt by the spring of 1879 meeker had a few agency buildings under construction and forty acres of land plowed   most of the work was done by his white employees  who were paid money for their efforts   meeker could not understand why the utes also expected money for building their very own cooperative agrarian community  but in order to get his irrigation ditches dug  he agreed to pay money to thirty utes  they were willing workers until meeker s funds were exhausted  then they went away to hunt or attend pony races   their needs are so few that they do not wish to adopt civilized habits   meeker complained to the commissioner of indian affairs   what we call conveniences and comforts are not sufficiently valued by them to cause them to undertake to obtain them by their own efforts   the great majority look upon the white man s ways with indifference and contempt   he proposed a course of action to correct this barbaric condition  first  take away the utes  hundreds of ponies with a few draft horses for plowing and hauling  and then as soon as the utes were thus forced to abandon the hunt and remain near the agency  he would issue no more rations to those who would not work   i shall cut every indian down to the bare starvation point   he wrote colorado s senator henry m  teller   if he will not work   concurrently  the governor of denver  william b  vickers  began a propaganda campaign to have the utes removed from the entirety of colorado  thereby leaving their valuable reservation land open for the taking  he publicly supported meeker in the  denver tribune  and made some  lets just say  eerily familiar political racist remarks about the utes and their relationship to work     gt the utes are actual  practical communists and the government should be ashamed to foster and encourage them in their idleness and wonton waste of property   living off the bounty of a paternal but idiotic indian bureau  they actually become too lazy to draw their rations in the regular way but insist on taking what they want wherever they find it  removed to indian territory  the utes could be fed and clothed for about one half what it now costs the government       gt     gt honorable n c  meeker  the well-known superintendent of the white river agency  was formerly a fast friend and ardent admirer of the indians  he went to the agency in the firm belief that he could manage the indians successfully by kind treatment  patient precept and good example   but utter failure marked his efforts and at last he reluctantly accepted the truth of the broader truism that the only truly good indians are dead ones   eventually  meeker s attempt to force agriculture on the utes would lead to a dispute with a ute chief  prompting him to  wire for military assistance  as the u s  cavalry

2176,Why Do Countries Like America Value Economic Growth Over Quality Of Life?,it seems like the quality of life for like 99  of people could be greatly improved if we as a society valued that over the gdp or absurd levels of economic growth  besides the very few who does it really benefit    the standard workweek is still 40  hours with only two weeks mandatory vacation which is outdated and absurd  all for the sake of productivity  yet society could function completely fine if the average workweek was reduced  like 30hrs instead  and if vacation was a minimum of one month per year  especially because of the added productivity from technological advances and automation  those changes would make full time employment way more sustainable and be beneficial to a vast majority of people within our society  it would make things harder on small business owners but there are ways around that like giving extra incentives and deductions  also large corporations that already make billions in profits can surely handle it   overall i think making changes to greatly improve most peoples quality of life at the expensive of the few would absolutely be worth it  do you guys think anything will ever change  will there ever be people in power who have the same mindset  i don't think the ways things are now is sustainable for people's mental health and wellbeing ,p2p2g6

2302,My wife is quitting her job soon and I'm really happy for her.,my wife actually loves working  she used to love working at her current place of employment  but at some point  her co-workers started getting sick and had to take off for weeks at a time  this meant lots of extra work for those still healthy with no extra pay    this was the beginning of the end for her love of working there  the higher-ups took notice of everybody's extra hard work  what do you think they offered as gratitude  was it a bonus  was it a pizza party  nope  it was two bags of gummy bears to be shared among the office  that made her feel massively underappreciated   recently  she got her vaccination  but it turns out she was a bit too late in getting it  so she's been recovering at home  however  she's made herself far too important at work  everybody is just so lost without her there  so rather than just letting her rest  she is getting constantly messaged on her phone looking for help  co-workers  nurses  she works in the medical field in an office setting  and admin all harass her  she has been stressing the hell out about work because it just follows her home  this really dampened her mental stability  i think our baby has noticed her decline in happiness  so our baby has been acting extra cranky towards her  won't eat much  etc  this further put my wife in a downward spiral   she's been crying to me the past few days that she's anxious and afraid that she's going to be depressed soon  she hasn't slept the past few days because of it  she's terrified and stressing about how there's going to be massive amounts of work for her when she's well again   today  she decided she's just going to quit  it was like a flip switched inside her  her mood immediately improved  i told her to go ahead and quit  we have several months of savings thankfully  if we didn't  she'd be screwed  she's going to quit and have a full month off to get back to normal  then she's going to easily find work elsewhere that won't follow her home ,p24ari

2304,Anti-work is the oldest ideology in the world - change my mind,research has shown  that paleolithic hunter-gatherers worked far less than people living in agrarian  industrial and post-industrial societies  all the hunting  cooking  sewing of clothes  crafting of flint spears  etc  in just 4 hours of work per day  the rest of the day was spent sleeping  playing  singing  dancing  telling stories  and doing all sorts of other communal activities   during the middle ages  peasants worked a maximum of 150 days a year  as opposed to the 230  we have to do in the modern-day developed world  like hungary and the usa  yet they still rebelled  not wanting to work on land they didn't own  not wanting to pay more than a certain amount of their crops as income taxes  etc   not sure about islam  but the other two abrahamic religions  christianity and judaism  clearly state in the bible  that work is god's punishment for the original sin  diogenes of sinope wanted us to reject the superficiality of civilization and return to a simpler  more naturalistic time  socrates wrote  that  he who works too much has no time to be a good father  friend or citizen  ancient greeks clearly despised work  and the ancient roman writer cicero wrote that  he who sells his labour for gold degrades himself to the rank of slaves  basically inventing the term  wageslave  true spartan citizens weren't involved in any menial work - their only duty was to get military training and be warriors   pro-work ideology seems to be a relatively recent invention  the whole  he who does not work shall not eat  and  idle hands are the devil's playground  mentality originate in calvinism  which came into existence during the 16th century  as a matter of fact  i find the term  protestant work ethic  highly offensive  since i'm a  lutheran https abolishwork com anti-work-and-leftist-lutheran-theology-an-overview-by-luke-st-peter   the other branch of protestantism  and it really is just calvinist work ethic   so  is it just me  or anti-work really is the most ancient ideology out there ,p28zyn

2379,Government Union Jobs - Specifically in the University system,hello   i am somebody who is at the end of the line in terms of my ability to productively work an 8 hour day  day in and day out  due to burn out and some mental health issues   i am in my early 40s and have had a long  tiring career in an industry i do not care about    i get that i need to have those issues treated  but at the end of the day  it's obvious to me that i do not want  nor am i capable of  any sort of dynamic job that requires excessive attention to detail  focus  deadlines  presentations  strict schedules  etc   a long break or a vacation i don't believe will move the needle  i am actually starting to suffer memory loss  reduction in the ability to abide by what i would have earlier considered basic norms  i barely even comb my hair and i just wear whatever clothes i take out of the dryer  i care nothing about the comments of my co-workers   i literally feel as if i am just in a daze most of the day and this is not sustainable for me    i lock myself in my office and just do what i need to to get by     i get no joy from work and feel as if it is a waste of my life   i am concerned about global warming for the future of the planet and what that means for my small children   i simply choose not to care about career advancement productivity etc any longer   this is not a temporary issue  this is foundational to my psyche at this point     i have managed to save some money and have been very lucky with some investments that i've made  so i am in a position where i can probably live on  3k mo  going forward  plus health insurance     i live in a university down in the pacific northwest   i am considering going to work there and trying to back my way into a remote job for low-ish pay at entry level   i have a number of doubts about the prospect of this happening   i know it's not just going to be rainbows and unicorns  but i feel as though it would have to be better than this     my question boils down to  and i feel as if this is a space i can ask this question without being attacked for being  lazy  - can anybody chime in on the reality  or not  of jobs where people  essentially  can have little enough to do that they don't feel like it's even really working hard - or that  if the workload becomes more than i can reasonably handle due to my limitations have union support to help save my job   i don't want to just sit on reddit all day  but i also want to be able to browse the news  maybe lave the house from time to time and not worry about it  be around my kids   the key is i don't want to earn a lot of money  i don't want to get something for nothing  but just a basically  easy  job would be perfect for me now   thoughts ,p16kdx

2388,everyone is faking it,tw  this is kinda depressing so if you re already on this forum about to lose it i suggest not reading this  i know a big theme in some of these anti-work posts is how isolated we feel  but really everyone has just been conditioned to take it and suppress how unhappy we are  we re isolated because we aren t taught that it s okay to share our feelings and instead have to pretend we re fine for the sake of the other pretenders and the efficiency of the machine   today i caught one of the best coworkers at my job  living well  always on top of things  reliable  outgoing  successful and with expensive material possessions to show for his success  for lunch  if you can even call it that  he always only gets coffee  and we ended up getting into a heavy conversation about work  he was so distressed and eventually admitted that every day because of this job he thinks about killing himself  he s unhappy and mad at himself for staying in this career  he wishes he went out to live and be happy  and  on top of that  he said he doesn t understand why people want to be him or do what he does because he s so miserable  it really hit me by surprise because you d never expect it coming from him  he s the type of person that companies like ours use as the  example  i don t know  i just keep thinking about the conversation and how happiness really isn t guaranteed at all even if we do find ourselves in a situation where we get paid enough lol   tldr  capitalism is killing all of us and even if you make enough money to support yourself you still can t escape the time theft ,p16oln

2394,Vent about HR,and the way employers deal with mental health in general  this was from a previous job which was also wfh  which makes it even more frustrating that it was this much of a fiasco   so as anyone who has regularly read my posts comments on here  i struggle very brutally with mental health issues  depression  anxiety  substance abuse  sex addiction  the latter two started as coping mechanisms for the former two  funny how that works right  basically just a smorgasbord of fucked up brain chemicals  this makes it extremely difficult to function normally sometimes  to the point where even doing basic hygiene routines is like scaling mt  everest  last year i had an especially bad flare up that actually scared me into trying to find a therapist  because i was thinking more realistically about potentially killing myself than i had since my one actual attempt back in 2014  i shopped around but most therapists weren't taking my insurance  and then i remembered there was an eap program available through my company  i reached out to them  the rep was very polite and supportive and got back to me quickly with a few different therapists she thought would be a good fit for me  i made my pick and we set up the first appointment   it was immediately obvious that i was going to need to be allowed an hour off per week for these sessions  all virtual  since it was a call center job and there wasn't a lot of wiggle room or down time  so i spoke to hr  she had the idea that we could schedule my appointments on my lunch break  30 mins  and then just give me an additional half hour to fill the one hour appointment schedule  i was like  okay  that sounds like a good idea  hr goes yeah so we'll just need to put in a request for an accommodation   the way it was worded was already a red flag  but it was even worse than i thought  i was instructed to send my therapist  the therapist i had only had a single session with so far  a multi-page packet detailing extensive long-term therapy  she was to read over it  sign it  and send a copy to me and to hr  who would then put in the accommodation request  that's right  even with all that  i wasn't even guaranteed to get it  and if it was denied  the extension of my lunch would be unapproved and thus eventually lead to me getting fired  which means no more insurance  which means no therapist   this was for half a fucking hour once a week  i could see them wanting to go through a whole spiel like that if i needed a whole week off every month or something  that's reasonable  but this was just batshit crazy for thirty fucking minutes  when i sent my therapist that packet she was floored that they were making such a huge deal out of extending my lunch by half an hour  she also didn't feel comfortable signing it because we had only had one session and that's not nearly enough time to gauge whether we're a good fit  whether i need to be referred to a psychiatrist for possible medication  whether i just need a different type of therapist  etc  it was ridiculous  i ended up only doing three sessions before giving up because knowing my time was unexcused and thus getting me closer to termination just stressed me out even more  the very act of seeking help made my mental issues worse  i guess that's what i get for trying to find help through my fucking job    amp x200b   the point of this whole rant is just to underscore how fucking ridiculously difficult it is to even be considered as  needing  help with any kind of mental trauma you're facing  and even if you can somehow get the stars to align so you can find a therapist who works for you and takes your insurance   you still have to schedule sessions around your fucking job  of course  this wouldn't be an issue if we weren't  needlessly working nine hours a day five days a fucking week forever   i'm at the point where i've stopped giving a fuck  i'll take my time off when my mental health gets especially bad and if you don't like it and you want to fire me then fucking fire me  you'll be doing me a favor anyway  it infuriates me to no end that in this fucking country of  freedom  something as simple as extending your lunch by thirty fucking minutes so you can hopefully not have a mental breakdown and kill yourself requires you to pole vault sideways through a row of flaming fucking hoops being tossed around by elephants balanced on giant balls during an earthquake   fuck this shit ,p1t4q0

2407,I'm just stressed out I guess,i think i need to vent to like-minded people  more than anything  but maybe some advice would help  this is long-winded and not exactly as organized as i'd like but my brain is a mess   i have a pretty standard office job  i do 730-4  1 2 hour un-paid lunch  decent pay  benefits  etc  i am the bookkeeper for small medium sized event business in canada  yes  events  its been a rough year but i have stayed employed full time throughout the pandemic  even when were at a total shutdown    this job was a fluke for me - it's not in my field and they were willing to do all my training  etc  and i worked my way from an entry-level position to the only bookkeeper in the company  i'm now at the top of my job in my current workplace  but not necessarily qualified to move elsewhere as i do not have any official training  i have a ba in psychology and have previously worked in human services  mostly working with at-risk youth  homelessness  addictions  mental health  etc  at that time i had to work two jobs to barely scrape by  working crazy hours and brining home the emotional stress of working with these populations on top of having my own mental health issues  i was not doing okay and really just lest effective in my work  when my part time data-entry job offered me a full time position  monday to friday with benefits  i couldn't say no   i sold out for a cushy office job and sometimes i hate myself for it because i want to be doing meaningful work  but then i remember how drained that left me and still unable to care for myself financially and mentally   my whole life i had wanted to help people but when i finally got the chance i was far too burnt out    this is a good time to thank every human service worker out there - you guys are underpaid and underappreciated  thank you for your sacrifices    so now i am at this point in my life where i don't want to work anymore  not like this - but i have to  i can go look for work in my preferred field  still underpaying and would have to take on shift work if not multiple jobs  i would lose my two day weekend and likely my benefits  but my work might have meaning  i can go look for work in a new field  domino's locally currently pays more than my current occupation so i figure delivering pizzas is a viable option  only half  s    or i can stick it out here  my first plan of action is to talk to my boss and hr about a four day work week  or at least five days with the fifth working from home  i'm not sure if they will go for this - my boss has always made it apparent that he  needs  me in the office  even though a lot of stuff i could do from home and only come in maybe 2-3 days  but that's the thing  they do  need  me  as i am the only one trained to do some of the work  i feel bad for wanting to leave and potentially leaving them high and dry with no one to replace me  it would effect peoples payroll if they couldn't find a replacement in time    cons with my jobs      i am the only one in my department - this is both nice  i'm an introvert  and shitty because there is no backup if i want to call in sick  so i don't  if i am really sick i will  but sometimes i need a mental health day and i feel like i cannot take them  i literally cried at work this morning  prompting this write-up  i am the only one here that can do payroll - if i want to take a day off i need to fit it into the payroll schedule    covid - we're an event company and as long as restrictions are on we are essentially shut down  where i am located we just entered another lockdown  its been a slow year or so  with many days i am required to be here even though there is no work  i've done small make-work projects and organized the shit out of everything but i honestly feel burnt-out from the nothingness that my job has become  that being said - they still pay me full hours for very minimal work - i do have it pretty easy    nowhere left to go - i am essentially at the top of my game here unless i want to go back to school and study accounting  haha  i have further up the pay scale to go but the work will not change     not meaningful to me  i am literally just here to get a pay cheque  pros with my job     easy  i am literally writing this  essay  at work  this last year made me lazy and i am embracing it whole-heartedly here in a way that i likely would  not be able to at another workplace   standard hours  benefits  pay  etc   compensation    when it's not covid it actually is pretty good - things are busier and there are the occasional perks like free events   small business  i work directly with the owner and we have a fairly small staff that i get to know personally  my boss is  for the most part  really great and understanding  but he is still a boss  i guess aside from the vent i'd like a little insight - do you guys think i should stick it out or should i start looking elsewhere  i am going to talk about a reduced work week first  but if they don't go for it  i might be out of here   a little bit more about me  i'm 25f  i have a few major mental health issues and see a therapist bi-weekly  this is covered by my benefits as is my medication  benefits   important   i am anti-capitalist  still identifying what exactly that is for me but i hate the society we live in  i don't feel i should have to work to earn my existence   i went from high school to uni to work  all while working almost full time jobs to get by  i've never had more than a week off from anything in my life and i honestly would have gladly taken a lay-off last year  but they needed me  i'm exhausted  if i could quit my job and doing nothing  even for a month  i would  all of this - i think it all comes down to me needing a true break  but even that scares me because if i'm not working i'm not making rent  groceries  counselling appts  medication  i'd have to use that time looking for a new job  doing interviews - the whole  break  would be stress  i'm stressed out   thanks for reading if you made it this far  whew ,p15gue

2409,The Reality,i love this page and all of these posts  it s so satisfying to see so many people awake to realize these companies are just out here to use you  but  in the thick of it all  none of us speaking up is ever truly going to change anything unfortunately  when it comes down to it  the 1  will always win  if we chant that we want more  they ll just take more  it ll always be an infinite loop of us staying at the bottom and the very few at the top  the only way to truly solve this is to put a cap on how much a person can make within a year  no one person truly needs more than a million dollars a year  yachts  multiple homes  cars  jets  etc  they ll always want more if we don t limit to how much they can spend  with a million dollar cap on any single person  the revenue of the business can reach more of the employees keeping it running  we re talking trillions of dollars coming down from the top to the hard working  imagine how much of that money can also go back into the business  investing into ways to make our hard work not as stressful and painful  employees can go to work knowing they are providing for their family and most likely be able to work less and retire earlier  this is the real way to change everything  let me know what you think about this ,p1hs07

2454,"Sometimes this sub wanders into ""I'm 14 and this is deep"" territory.",here's what i appreciate about this sub and what i think it's really about   the notion that nobody's self worth should be tied to their job title  or lack thereof   that nobody should be working a job they hate just to afford basic necessities   that those who do choose to work ought to have basic worker's rights and respect  which includes fair pay   that the 40 hour work week is totally outdated and arbitrary  and that the  look busy push a broom around  if there's no actual work to do philosophy is total insanity   that the current political climate and economic system of the united states  and elsewhere  is problematic to say the least   that if you want to go live in a van down by the river and say  fuck all of this  that's totally fine and even maybe admirable   here's what i don't think the sub is   children espousing  i've never worked a day in my life and i have no intention to start now  i'll continue relying on family and friends to support me financially   demonizing other generations   outlandish ideas about how economics actually work   to be clear- i'm not referring to socialist or even communist ideologies here  i'm talking  let's power the economy with unicorn farts  level of delusion   outrageous senses of entitlement   this is the sort of shit that gives this sub a bad rep among some  and i think this sub is more important than people might think right now  we're in a crucial point in history where worker's rights and worth are actively being reexamined  it seems to be a turning point where the working class is finally sticking up for themselves after decades of abuse   so let's not fuck this up or lose credibility by making and upvoting childish posts ,p1p1d0

2460,Fuck you admin lady,she used my vacation hours to make up for some lost wages without telling me and then didn't update the system so i spent the past couple months thinking that i had 40 hours paid vacation only to find out when i'm attempting to schedule my vacation that i actually only have 4 hours because she's incompetent and didn't update the system for several months  she made a unilateral decision to use my vacation time to make my paycheck seem normal but now those hours that i was really looking forward to are gone at a time when i need them most i was going to use those hours for mental wellness and a important family gathering and a birthday vacation for my fiance now i can't do any of that and it makes me feel broken  i feel robbed i never gave her permission to do this the least she could have done is do her fucking job and update the system so that i would have been aware of the situation as it occurred rather than losing all of my vacation hours at once because she decided to update the system just this week i went from having 40 hours to 4 hours in a instant if she had done her job the way she was supposed to i would have seen a decrease in my available hours overtime rather than such a drastic change this isn't the first time she's been incompetent she's fucked up on payroll she's done this exact scenario to other people i hate her and she's the only hr lady for the whole business so it's not like i can go complaining to somebody not that i would have any valid complaints this is more of a personal issue but still this is fucking trifling,p1bgfp

2472,As free as I can be,hello all  lots of negativity on here  i joined because i love not working  being able to completely detach from the work force for a little while and enjoy the simple things in life i think is my true passion  taking a nap on a tuesday afternoon and not having anything to do for 2 weeks is the best feeling in the world to me  i dont think that that is a realistic option for our entire lives though  human beings have been  working  in one way or another since day one  we live in a system where money is the middle man for everything we need to survive  very few of us have to build our own shelters or hunt for our own food anymore  these things have been replaced by buying these things with money now  with that being said i think it is possible to find a middle ground and not be totally burned out with existance   i had a job  been a carpenter most of my life  with a company for 6 years  my boss bragged about his brand new ford raptor and his vacation house in florida and told me a raise just  wasn't in the budget  that year  everytime my manager called me i instantly lit up with anger  i was made to feel guilty for not wanting to work for 7 days a week and was supposed to be happy with running a crew for  18 an hour  it was killing me   opportunity arose  i was working on a commercial project building landings to get into pools at a gym and the building owner asked if i wanted to do some work at his home  i said sure  i wound up making what i made at my job in 2 weeks in one day  cash  i ran with it  i quit a couple months later and started my own business  nothing crazy  a guy with some tools and a pickup truck building decks  my only regret is not doing it sooner   it's not a perfect life but it beats the shit out of dreading phone calls from managers and bosses in know are getting rich off of me breaking my back  i found it pretty simple  stay away from stupid materialistic purchases  dont finance a brand new vehicle  buy a used one and learn how to work on it  dont max yourself out trying to buy a home  get a fixer upper  anything you could possibly want to do can be learned on youtube   my mortgage is  825 a month in nj nonethenless  live small  skip the bullshit and be happy  no credit cards either   that's how i found my way out best of luck to you,p1bmzv

2488,Corporations are Experiencing the Five Stages of Grief over Remote Work,on linkedin  i don't really do much  but i do follow a few tags  namely  futureofwork   returntooffice  and  workfromhome  over the last almost two years now  i've seen articles trickle in  commented on a few  and voted on various polls  i'm very pro-remote myself  and i support the optional model  that being said  spending all this time reading articles  i've come to a conclusion   i believe we are witnessing corporations go through the five stages of grief over remote work   now  they haven't gone through all the steps  we're actually just leaving anger  and beginning bargaining  there was a poll the other day  with over 600 replies  that said  what would you be willing to give up to stay remote  the only answers were  part of my paycheck   some pto vacation time  and  nothing  i'd faster go back  each with some cute emoji following it  i don't really know what any of those options did to warrant a fun emoji  seeing as they're all completely horrible  but i digress  what was amazing that  of the hundreds of comments  the vast majority were complaining that there was no option to give up nothing  people really  really hated that poll  and today  there was an article about how goldman sachs is giving away food to people who come in  once again with unearned goofy taglines like  the fastest way to a banker's heart is through their stomach  looking at that article  besides being offended that they think free food is enough to tempt people back during a literal global pandemic  it made me start thinking of the five stages of grief  that's when i realized  this is bargaining   taking a step back  when lockdowns started  the big corporations were still in the driver's seat  there was no labor shortage  this whole thing was an anomaly  and we'd all be back in the office soon  it was unthinkable that we'd still be working from home by may  hell  president trump even loudly declared that he expected the whole thing to blow over in april  you know  like a miracle  but then of course it didn't  and worse for the corporates  people were happier working from home  anxiety was down  productivity was up  so we started getting a slew of articles about how we should all remember that this was just temporary  jamie dimon went off about how he hated zoom  david solomon called wfh an 'aberration'  etc  the resounding message from wall street was 'this is not the new normal'  their entire front against remote work was denial  in reality  they had no control over what was going on  moreover  with the hurdle of an requiring an office to appear legitimate gone  start-ups found themselves with giant wads of cash and a new perk people loved -- remote forever   we don't even have an office  morphed into a selling point  and the extra money they had went to scouting top talent  remote work and series a startups became a match made in heaven   so of course  after denial comes anger  we've seen this all over the place  mostly with articles headlined with loaded questions   could remote-work damage your chances to be promoted   could remote-work destroy the economy   are people who work from home unhappier  you know the ones  article after article just fearmongering and lashing out against remote work  hell  i'd even include the forced mandates to return-to-office as part of this phase -- such comtempt for people working at home  they demand people come back under threat of them losing their jobs  for a while  it was unclear what was going to happen with remote work post-vaccine  that is  if all of this wasn't actually the  new normal  and that we would resume our daily commuting routine as we had always done  but then  bless  the great resignation started  people  bailed  all over the place  voting with their feet  recruiters started shopping around the banks for talent like they were in walmart  work from home wasn't a perk  it was a  lifestyle  and those with a strong taste for it quickly started looking for new jobs  then  big companies began declaring their intents  facebook would be optional forever  twitter would be optional forever  linkedin would be optional forever  even google  who had originally wanted to bring back everyone in september  reversed course completely and now plans to let essentially any employee work from home indefinitely   the banks never gave up this fight  they're locked in a war they lost over a year ago to stop all this from becoming the  new normal  and honestly  yea  i get why they're angry  they puffed out their chests and demanded compliance  and their best people just left  worse  they pushed out their wave of anti-wfh propaganda  and it just fell flat  the banks have spent years doing the absolute minimum effort for their workers  putting them in creatively sterile environments and embracing a seating layout somehow worse than cubefarms  now people don't want to come back and quit when forced  and all the big corporations can do is be upset no one cares how they feel   all that being said  i suspect we're going to start seeing more 'negotiation' articles  will you come back for food  will you let us not pay you if you stay home  stuff like that  i'm interested to see what other weird angles they'll come at with this  i suspect most of what will be offered will be at best useless and at worst offensive  but it's still a nice change to see corporates attempting to kowtow ,p15azv

2501,i need advice - is it ok for my work to treat me this way?,hello  this is my first post on here  bear with me  i m 19f  a sophomore in college for computer science  and i got a job at what i thought would be a kickstart to getting experience in my field while in school  i was ecstatic to say the least  i ve been here since may   this job has maybe 300 employees   all in different areas of production  when i got hired on  i let them know that 1  i was in college and i may need schedule adjustments while still staying full time  for zoom classes  as i pay for my own school and it s very expensive  live on my own  etc  and 2  may need to work remote since i have a number of health issues as well as school  the workplace is also about 40 minutes away from me with traffic and it s just not worth the drive for  11 an hour  they agreed and understood both of those things upon hiring me  i got hired on as a remote employee  90  if not more of the employees worked off site to begin with  and i honestly felt spoiled  it was great working from home and getting my needs accommodated for the first time at a job    so fast forward a few months - early july  they tell me i need to come back on site and i m not allowed to wfh anymore for no good reason  which  isn t a huge issue  i liked the job enough at this time  but the real kicker is  they tell me word for word  that i  need to get my priorities straight when it comes to work and school   so i was like   what does that mean  they hired me on knowing i m a college student and they agreed to all of my schedule things and whatnot  a few days previously i had sent an email to my supervisor saying that school was starting back up in a couple of weeks and i may need adjustments to my schedule here and there to make room for class time    ever since then  everyone in my department has been super passive aggressive at me  treating me unfairly  and my supervisors are trying to take back everything they told me about working with my schedule my needs when i got hired on    for example  at my job we have to meet a quota every day as far as production accuracy  i ve been pretty damn good at meeting if not exceeding that quota  i ve been getting emails criticizing every little detail about my work there that i didn t get previously  even though my production accuracy is almost perfect  and it s all so condescending    i got an email also saying they couldn t work with my requests anymore from when i got hired because it wouldn t be fair to the other people who have been there longer than me  whatever that means    at work we also have a thing kinda like discord we use to talk to each other  it has channels for each department and there s one specific to my department to ask questions about things we have to complete work-wise   now  every time i ask a question i get zero response  every  time  they ll answer other peoples questions in there though  just not mine  i feel like they re ignoring me and it just feels so awkward    one of my other friends worked for this company previously  and they did some pretty awful stuff to him when he tried to leave and eventually got fired  pretty much the same situation with me  he asked for an adjustment that was previously agreed on  and they ignored him and started ghosting him at the work place as well    it goes deeper than that  but tl dr i picked up a job  really liked it  got my work schedule to work with my school schedule  everything was great until i remind them that my school is starting back and i may need adjustments to keep up with my classes  after i remind them of that  they start treating me unfair and ignoring me   my question now is  i got a new job offer for higher pay doing something i really like  that will be more convenient for me  i know people there and it should be way less stressful on me   should i  a  put my two weeks in and just tough it out even though i m getting no help at all and everyone at my work is being petty towards me and ignoring me etc  take the job offer after the 2 weeks is up or b  just leave  bring their work computers back and everything they lent to me at the end of today  tell them i m quitting and that i returned everything   explain that working with them was the opposite of a pleasure  and take up the new job which i would start this week   i hope this makes sense  please let me know if i m being too much of a baby over this  i just don t like the weird drama at my work place now for the most part  i email one person  my supervisor that i need an adjustment  then all of a sudden everyone at work starts ignoring me and talking about me behind my back and it s just not worth my stress ,p12n3q

Feeling like quitting.,man the past year has been amazing  take that with a grain of salt as i know all the horrors that have befallen us  but as someone who works in education  best year of my life    work from home  2  hours of commute saved a day    every communication with parents done by email  so verified trail of what was said so no  you lied and said this  excuses were never possible    all the students did amazing in my class  i know this isn t the case for everyone but this post isn t about the classroom versus zoom debate  it s about my personal working experience    basically amazing time for me  i was able to save so much money working at home that i now have a decent savings    now  school is back in session  i spent 10 5 hours at the school on thursday  9 on friday  i got yelled at by parents  literally screamed at  over information that we sent out no less than five times via the internet and two automated phone calls  one teacher actually got physically assaulted by a parent  several others got hit  spit  and kicked on by students that have had a year of no consequences by their parents    i m already over it  again  this isn t a post about the merits of school versus home based curriculum  it s just a rant on working itself    this year i m actually a student teacher  and not just an rbt  so not only do i have four months of this to look forward to  i m also having to do it unpaid  40-50 hours a week of this stuff unpaid  or else i don t get the degree i ve been working so hard on for the last four years    as the name implies  yeah i have an anxiety disorder and it sucks  i m not allowed disability unless i let it completely let it take over my life  so here s my options   keep working unpaid for this degree via the internship and wake up to a literal living hell in my mind every day as i fight my own demons to keep living life    stop fighting and let it consume me to the point of hospitalization and ruin my life and education  but hey i might qualify for help then  maybe  even then it s not guaranteed    what kind of sick world is this i ve gotten into  where my options are either work unpaid as i drown  or let myself drown for the possibility of government help  the savings i was so proud of is draining fast    my university didn t tell me until too late that there would be no help for me at this point of my degree  if i quit  my  40k in student loans becomes due  i m not allowed to take another job in the education field as it goes against the university program rules as a conflict of interest    how do i cope with this existential crisis of realizing i basically signed myself up to indentured servitude all with the promise of  oh an education is what you need to be able to afford a house one day  sign up now and we will help you  -the university  they re purposely bankrupting me and ensuring i won t be able to afford a house for decades    i want to quit work  i want to quit life ,p0rkb4

2533,How can I actually make a difference? When it comes to this?,so i have my super anti capitalist  anti work beliefs  but what do i do now    i don t have a following online  i have a private instagram account with not many followers and that s it  there s already loads of accounts i follow that post about my same beliefs and they have tons of followers already  i used to use tiktok as well and there were tons of high profile anti capitalist accounts    in my town there s not really groups that get together to rally or organize when it comes to being anti capitalist  where i live is pretty rural   i guess my passion and anger about this has left me feeling lost and paranoid about what i can actually do to make a difference  change things  and spread this information to people who may not be aware how fucked this system in     what are some things i can do as someone who doesn t have an online presence or much of a community in real life  i feel so helpless ,p0n86r
2534,Employees are always wrong,hello everyone   i'm working as a programmer  working from home because of the pandemic   i'm not satisfied in this team because   1 - tech lead doesn't help  2 - too many meetings  3 - other programmers talk trash behind my back   4 - the tech lead is not good technically and the code is poorly written  in the same time he and the other main developer don't admit the code is bad even if i give good arguments  i think it is because they play politics while working other freelance jobs at the same time  people don't know about them working for other people in the company time   because of these reasons i've asked to switch teams in a meeting with the team leader  i said it's mainly because there are too many meetings   the day after he said he talked about it with a higher manager that said it's not simple to switch teams  but they'll talk about it with the cto   the company has about 200 employees   what i think is that they will try make me forget about switching teams and give me almost nothing  like decreasing the number of meetings in a small percentage to looks like they're doing something  i'm thinking about it because the moment i asked they already started talking about this not being simple    so i was thinking about how little power we do have  i was thinking about working fewer hours  now i'm 5 hours positive  i was thinking about change this to 10 hours negative  my intention was to show my demotivation in another way to increase my chances to switch teams   i've talked about it with a friend and he told me it's not a good idea because the company would see this as something negative   so  imagine that the company can say   we'll reduce the meetings and try to work about it without the need to switch teams because it would be bad for the company to lose you in this project  in practice  they will do nothing to solve my problem and if i said something like   i would prefer to switch teams and i don't like this option  they will treat me as  not a team player  ignoring my history   it's impossible to win in the corporate game  companies have the power   rant over,p12p4b

2543,Toxic Motivation and Bullshit Positivity,corporate culture is rife with these  feel good  videos  they usually have some motivational speaker talking over some dramatic music in an overly serious and dramatic way as they list off statistics     so much time is wasted everyday  think of how much you can achieve if you just focused your mind   and there is nothing wrong with this  there is nothing wrong with cultivating inner self-discipline and focusing on your goals  but the distinction here is that it always is linked with productivity  as if your job stats are the length and measure of your individual worth    it s also subtly commodifying time - getting to live by the mantra that time is indeed money    but it isn t  it s a made up concept  this idea that you must be doing something in order to be fulfilled  that you be ashamed of playing on your phone or watching a movie or doing anything that can t be marketed and sold   they prey on vulnerable people and give them false hope - false expectations of reality  they deny people the tools of introspection and self actualization   be the person you wish to be    don t let others define you - define yourself ,p0nudo

2570,Has any US state made a push for mandatory minimum paid vacation days yet?,i work at a job where i'm lucky enough to have almost a month worth of vacation days with my 8 years of seniority  and it's one of the things i fear losing the most if i ever had to get another job   i know that congress probably won't bother for quite some time if ever  to address this issue federally  but have any us states tried to make their own push on this issue through state law   i know that some of them require rollover of vacation sick leave if it is offered by a company  but as far as i know  none of them have legally compelled companies to offer at least a certain amount of paid or even unpaid vacation time  only sick leave in certain states   it would really suck to think that 0 progress is even being attempted to be made on this issue  everybody deserves at least some recovery time every so often   i'm just wondering if there's even been a bill that was introduced anywhere that probably died in committee or something   i feel like the 20 days mandated by the eu is a good minimum to go by  i would hate to have any less than that but from what i've read  it seems to be a regular thing in this country to either offer significantly less than that  or of course just none at all ,p0zti4

2580,I'm an engineer and I've had enough already.,i'm a production engineer working at a small family owned engineering firm in texas  being the sole engineer in the company  i am constantly on my feet and the work is physically demanding on most days  i used to work on cargo vessels as a marine engineer  but due to personal reasons decided to pursue my masters and switch to shore based industries   i make  12 an hour  yeah  that's what my employer pays me and he is a true hypocrite  he talks down to me in front of everyone else on the floor during production hours  my mistakes are examined using a magnifying glass  but mistakes made by others are shrugged off    i am constantly told that despite my two degrees i am ineffective at my work and how i keep missing out on tasks that i should complete despite me running around trying to accomplish multiple tasks at once  i have a 10 - 12 hour work day on most days and i'm absolutely exhausted when i come back home   the walking around i mentioned above easily runs up to 8 - 9 miles a day   i was told that a performance review would be done at the end of 3 months  but surprise  it never happened  i went up to him and his wife  both share ownership of the company  on multiple occasions to discuss my review and the matter was aways flagged as not urgent  they have a worker shortage - no surprise - because they don't pay skilled workers enough  due to production priorities    blame is always quick to be handed out and one has to keep a constant eye over their should to make sure they are clear  they hire folks for some tasks  but i've seen 4 quit within the first week of employment   one lady didn't bother showing up after three days  naturally  they make the reminder of employees cover for the work  don't pay extra  blame them for incompetence when mistakes are made  as this is a fabrication shop and not every employee knows each area of work  and refuse to pay extra for the additional work  i had never worked in manufacturing fabrication positions before and i try my best every day  but it's never enough  no one appreciates my work  instead i get the usual bullshit of why it wasn't done faster or earlier    i cannot take it anymore  i really can't  the bullshit is too much to take at times and my health has been in a constant decline ever since i joined  i can't quit due to financial obligations back home  but i have been trying to switch onto something better  i'm waiting for the day i can just get up and walk out of that hellhole  tell my boss to go fuck himself and that his cherished business is nothing but a dump  and flip off his wife for giving me corporate bullshit during meetings  just wanted to share this with everyone here  fuck these owners    p s i forgot the best part  they make their employees clean their respective restrooms  never seen them provide soap  which one employee brings some from home  and also clean the owners restrooms too ,p0fp5i
2581,Work(ism) is a religion/cult. Change my mind.,humanity's relationship to work can be best summed up as a clear example of  orwellian doublethink https en wikipedia org wiki doublethink  when you hold two contradictory beliefs at the same time   work is the reason why we hate mondays so much and can't wait for the weekend to arrive  work is the reason why we curse the weekday morning and bless the evening   late-afternoon  mankind's hatred of work has compelled her scientists to keep on inventing new labour-saving and automation technologies   yet  at the same time  we have a culture  so-called  protestant work ethic  - a label i find offensive as a   lutheran https abolishwork com anti-work-and-leftist-lutheran-theology-an-overview-by-luke-st-peter  since it's actually calvinist work ethic  that teaches that a man is only worth as much as he works  that  he who does not work shall not eat  that  idle hands are the devil's playground  etc   but this is not the only work-related contradiction and instance of doublethink  we as a society hold the belief that people absolutely loooooove working  that it's dignifying and fills your life with meaning  yet  simultaneously  we as a society also hold the belief  that if we implemented universal basic income  everyone would stop working  become lazy  and refuse to engage in any kind of productive labour  guilty as charged  i'd need a long break to get over the trauma of having been a wageslave for over a year  which one is it  work-cultists   workism is not a rational set of beliefs  but instead a  cult   a death cult that has murdered millions of people since the dawn of mankind   people often say  that statism is the deadliest ideology out there  as throughout history  far more people have been killed by their own governments than by any hostile armies - i don't debate that  i accept that statement as true  so i say this   workism is the deadliest death cult in the history of mankind ,p0dwsy

2591,sometimes it takes a little bit of inspiration and a maverick,tl dr  i actually somehow changed my work culture  and learned that it's possible to influence others to make positive changes in work-life   i worked a job where it was very common for all my coworkers to stay late  well after close  and even if they had completely finished their department's tasks    also keep in mind there were many other abuses  such as neglecting to give me breaks that i was legally entitled to  but that's another story  i remember being the sorta new guy  although i'd been there for a few months already  and one night i asked one of the coworkers i had a somewhat friendship with   do we have to stay  like  i don't remember them ever mentioning this in the job description or interview even though i asked  and i thought they were sticklers for following schedule and the time clock    remember  business only care about their time  not yours   he said it's just normal and  you'd appreciate it too if your work wasn't entirely done and needed help to go home  the thing is  i was often employee of the month and i never needed this help because i did my work and finished on time like a good time-managing person should  so one night  it was well over an hour past closing time and i was there again helping some other department  i asked this same coworker   what would happen if i clocked out and left  i'm not trying to be a jerk  i just need to be somewhere and didn't expect that i would be at work this late    keep in mind that i --like many unfortunate workers--did not own a car and relied on other's help for commute  don't get me started on how fucking completely stupid america is with its urban sprawl and forced car-dependency  so i was in a position where no matter what i did  it would be rude to someone   he says   i wouldn't leave until we're done  you'd probably get in big trouble  and i don't want to see that happen to you  ok  i thought  if i'm still on the clock i'm still getting paid   not overtime though  because in order to correct this situation they gave me fewer hours  go figure   but when this happened again  and it was way too late after close  and i really respected the person helping me get to and from work  i made the decision to leave   everyone around me had either a look of disbelief or resentment  i'm sure there might have even been jealousy  but i wasn't going to divest myself of my own dignity any longer  so i went to the break room  clocked out  got my stuff  and left   the next time i went in the head manager had a talk with me and said effectively that he was going to let me keep that job but that i'm on thin ice  and he ended up doubling my workload  in addition to having me train three new people  and fewer hours  i wasn't having it any more  i planned to leave and never look back  so i informed the scheduling manager that in about a month i would be taking a week off to go out of state  that date came  and instead of going back to work i simply never returned and never spoke to any of them again   as it turned out  about a year after i quit  i found myself back  accompanying a relative as she was doing business there   there were a lot of workers i didn't recognize  luckily thanks to the lovely turnover  but one person was working that i did remember and i asked him about their closing situation and what they do when a department has run-over tasks that they needed to finish before they could clock out and leave   as it turns out  my leaving that one night inspired others to do the same  and as a result management had to create a solution  instead of having everyone stay well over their scheduled time and do work that wasn't their responsibility  or punish employees that worked efficiently and got their tasks done  they had the managers complete it  and eventually created a new overnight position come in and put everything in order   in the end  it's never that company's  can't  do the right thing and respect their employees  it's that they don't  want  to  and won't unless forced   this taught me a valuable lesson   no one wants to be the nail that sticks up  no one feels comfortable being the  bad  disobedient worker  who will then be reprimanded or get their job  and sense of security  taken away  but sometimes all it takes is some inspiration  and people  who are emboldened by another's taking the step forward and setting new precedents  can collectively make a change for themselves toward the better  we can hold better standards  value ourselves higher  and accept less abuse and exploitation   change is possible if we take the steps and let it   and i brought this lesson to a later job that i had  for so long i envied and longed for the work-life balance of a country like france or italy  where workers are more at ease and don't have to degrade themselves like people do in america  so one day i just pretended like i was in italy  with those standards and expectations  i didn't let customers walk over me  i acted like my employer was lucky to have me work there  and it was a privilege that they could even have someone do their job well  let alone above and beyond like i did  and eventually i noticed change in the work culture among my coworkers  after a year  i got to train people and instill in them the philosophy i had  and how to approach the job  and i even told people in higher positions than me how i think they should respond to certain problems they were having with management   i couldn't even hardly recognize this job from when i first started  and it was almost scary to see how much better things were by my coworkers imitating me or listening to my advice  everyone was happier  and that made my life so much less stressful   when covid hit  for whatever reason we got even more slammed with clients than ever before  all the karens and entitled shitheads came out of the woodwork  but i just reminded myself that my health and safety are important  and it's just a service  it's not actually important at the end of the day  and certainty not worth dying over   i had money saved up  and with the stimulus check  the insanely hightened stress was just not worth it anymore  i was not going to put up with it  so i quit  but i was thankful knowing that coworkers i left behind would have a slightly less stressed job thanks to the culture i helped to instill   imagine what we could do as a society with higher expectations  higher self-worth  and no more tolerance for capitalist bull shit  the changes that i helped make were nothing  and i'm sorry if i've sounded like i'm bragging  but in all honesty that stuff is irrelevant compared to the vast systematic problems at hand  i just want to think that we can have hope in humanity and in each other to make things better and get justice  hopefully it takes a little bit of inspiration and a few trailblazers  and  of course much less tolerance for abuse ,ozdoax
2592,Roughly 80 some full days of every year are lost to work,i ran some numbers using this formula   365 -  holiday and vacation days  x  hours worked per week    7  and assuming someone works 40 hour work weeks with 2 weeks of vacation and a few holidays off  they would spend 83  rounded  full  twenty four hour days at work  that doesn't really sound like a lot  but if you figure a worker works like that from the age of 25 to 65  that's over 9  full  years  january 1st straight through to december 31st with no days off  given to someone else who most likely doesn't even know their name     obviously hours worked and extra days off vary wildly for everyone  and none of this accounts for time to prepare or commuting  but i think it's definitely a good conversation starter if nothing else ,ozhkj4

2601,"Out of money, out of options, no plays in hand, don't know what to do",it's another one of those posts   i'm a field service technician by morning  and a violin teacher in a shop by afternoon  at least for two days a week  i'm paid a decent wage but only am assigned about 20 hours of tech work a week  because that's the entire volume of where i live  in asheville  the teaching job also pays a decent wage but also lacks work  so i wind up teaching for 8 hours a week  i technically have another teaching job in another shop for the other 3 weekdays  but it's been about 2 months since i got the job  and i still don't have a single student   i'm able to get by  just by the skin of my teeth  but there's been some drama at my tech job that is causing problems with that  let me explain   since i work out of peoples' houses  my work typically expects the defective parts to be shipped back to the manufacturer  after having some problems with the return shipping  because i was never trained on it  i discovered that the point of sale system would allow me to mark things as being left with the customer  giving me the the  processing successful  screen and allowing me to close the call  i called my supervisor and asked if the system would ever erroneously display this screen  allowing me to screw myself over by leaving a part onsite that actually isn't supposed to be left  and he said no  as long as i got to the  processing successful  screen  i'm good   well  that was a fucking lie  and despite that i did this for months with no problems  suddenly the manufacturers start wanting the parts back  my supervisor calls me and asks me where those parts are  i tell him i left them onsite and that i confirmed with him that it was okay to do this  he said i was never supposed to leave anything onsite  and that that button was only supposed to be used in very specific circumstances  later  while they were investigating the issue  they discovered that the system used to not let you do that  but had been changed recently and now allows you to erroneously post parts   they have me recover as many parts as i could  but i couldn't get all of them  and suddenly work starts talking about docking my paycheck for the parts when the manufacturers come to collect  they assure me that they'll work something out to do it little by little  and that it would be okay  it would just suck for a while  and that they're on my side   then  on payday  i get an invoice with no paycheck  a week later i start asking where my paycheck is  and the bookkeeper apparently just forgot  or had something come up  and that she would get right on it  literally days later  my pay-stub comes in  and not only do they decide  to just roll it into my next paycheck  they decided to  dock me 300  for these parts  without ever confirming with me or telling me how much i need to pay off   on sub 30 hours a week  even with a decent wage i'm still struggling to pay my bills  i have no savings  i run out of money every paycheck  so 300  takes me from being just barely covered to missing bills  i don't know  how the bookkeeper doesn't know this  considering that she sees my paycheck and it's obvious that i can't sustain on that amount   it just never ends  i can never get enough tickets to support myself  but i can't get another day job because i have to leave before 2pm to go teach  and in it that's a no go   i don't know what to do  i can't just get another it job because of the scheduling  and i'm not gaining students at either of my teaching jobs  my degree is in music  and it's what i love more than anything  so i can't just quit  not even 6 months after i actually stumbled my way into an actual job in the field  they even pay a really good wage compared to my previous jobs   i have such a strong urge to just quit all of it  to give my violin to some needy but talented kid  to never listen to another piece of music ever again  and just move on and try to forget it all happened  but i don't even have any options for this either  i'm already in debt from music school  and on top of that  my partner says that we cannot move out of asheville and it's non-negotiable  despite being a nurse who could literally work in any town  we don't even have any friends in town  just her family  i  moved away  from my family just to come here to be with her   i could say fuck it and go back to school to be an aerospace engineer like i wanted to as a kid  but there are no schools here  and the job would require moving out of asheville    k-12 music teacher  no graduate programs here  would need to move to get a job   collegiate music teacher  no programs  need to move   same thing to become an a amp p  debt  can't work in asheville   she says to go work at petsmart or something  which must be easy for her to say  she has 10s of thousands in savings  even after dropping 10k towards a down payment on a car  i end each paycheck with under 100  in my account   i'm just trying to be a regular adult  i'm fucking 24  i go to sangha every week  i run 5ks to stay healthy and i don't drink anything that's not coffee or water  i'm smart  dedicated to my both of my crafts  am really good at both of them  and show up on time  i'm not asking for much but nobody has any place in society for me  it feels like i should just walk out into the mountains to die like i'm supposed to ,p02iya

2739,Written 100 years ago. How little has changed,when the worker gets his first job the world about him takes off its mask  he sees it as it is  hours are long and most work is monotonous  any child or young person naturally very much dislikes this first harsh experience of the world of the working class  his games and fun-making are given up  his physical growth is stunted and his mind dwarfed more or less  long ago nearly all of the young men who went to work for wages  began by learning a trade  this trade was very often extremely interesting to them  it educated their minds and developed their bodies  if they were apprenticed at eighteen  then  perhaps at twenty one  they were sure of steady work and good wages  today very few of the working people learn a trade  they work in some factory  store or office at tasks which they perform as well in a month as they do in ten years  if the young wage earner is vigorous in mind and body he revolts at this labor and makes a desperate struggle to secure an education or otherwise make it possible for himself to rise out of the working class  the stronger and healthier his body and the keener his mind  the harder does he fight  but he finds  except in very rare instances  that the doors of opportunity are closed to the children of the workers   if the young worker learns one of the trades which still remain in modern industry  he finds after he has learned it that it also is being abolished by the invention of new machinery  he may go to night school and complete a course of study  or take a correspondence course in mechanics or some other form of applied science  if he does he will discover that his knowledge  gotten at such sacrifice of time  savings and effort  will not raise his wages  there are now so many educated poor people that their pay is on the average much less than that of skilled workers in the trades  another hope of the young workers  men and women  is to save money and start in some small business  others have riseni and become wealthy  why not they  so  by giving up all pleasures  by overwork and pitiful economies  does the young worker make his start in business  if he has been fortunate enough not to lose his money through  some bank swindle  he at last  after years of effort  tries his luck  the best data we have show that more than nine-tenths of those who engage in small business fail utterly  the small portion who  succeed  do so by working night and day  sundays and holidays  even they make but meager livings  no better on the average than the wage-workers   the hearts and minds of nearly all young american working people are full of hope  they cannot conceive that it would be possible for them to toil on throughout their lifetime 'for small wages and every day find the work getting harder  they do not at first realize what it is to be a wage-worker  they are unmarried and hence often have a little more money than is absolutely necessary to keep them  this the young workers usually spend for good clothes and for an occasional holiday  the daily grind of labor has not yet deadened their minds nor crushed their spirits  plans for advancement are constantly being formed   then come marriage and responsibility for a family  perhaps the care of aged parents adds to the burden  in any case by the time the worker is twenty-five years of age he has lost his grip on his hope for something better  at thirty  with growing burdens  he gets to be quite content to work along day by day without looking forward to anything but his saturday pay envelope  he is likely to be afflicted by some chronic illness due to the nature of his work or the insanitary condition of his factory or home  perhaps illness in his family  or the birth of a number of children  so increase his burden that his struggle becomes a pitiless daily conflict to live at thirty-five years of age these conditions  coupled with occasional unemployment  drive the worker often to despair  but later he gets used to it  poor food  shoddy clothing  a shack to live in  unemployment-these are his lot in life and he makes the best of it  the old saying of the poet   hope springs eternal in the human breast  is not at all true of the working people of today  in them hope dies  at forty or fifty years of age the average worker plods along rather carelessly  if he suffers an injury in the factory he eats without worry the bread of charity  which  twenty years before  he would have despised  lie knows that he cannot educate his children  lie may see them go early to work and injure their health  but he is so happy to receive their weekly wage to help out at home that he forgets that they are young and should be at play or at school   this man is exactly what the owners and rulers of america now wish him to be  he is strong enough to do the work they want done  he does not demand vacations and amusement  a better home and education for his children  so he will not strike for more wages  the vast majority of the american working people over forty years of age cannot be made to understand their condition  life for them has lost all light and beauty and hence all desire for more of its good things  quite as hopeless is the 'state of mind of some of the younger workers  a portion of these  born of parents broken and weary from work  and themselves underfed and sent early to factories  are as careless about their conditions of life as are their parents  but with a majority of the young and a considerable minority of the older folks this is not true  they want more wages and less work  they desire rest and leisure  a chance to know their family and friends better  and an occasional vacation in the country  they wish to read  hear good musicand go to theaters  above all they crave better food and more of it and they know that their limbs are stiff because of the lack of enough rest and exercise   to such  and such only  are the following pages addressed  those who are utterly broken in body and decayed in mind  those who are deadened beyond being moved by the facts of life  those who think that they somehow deserve all the labor and pain and misery of the world and that a few others should enjoy plenty and peace and opportunity  we earnestly request to at once pass this booklet along to someone else  for it can be of no interest to themselves   we see today a working class bowed down by labor  we see it starved by poverty  we see all its efforts to improve its condition met by blows in the face  we see babies dying because their parents cannot support them  we see tender children enslaved because they toil for low wages  we see strong men committing crimes because they cannot find masters  we see the aged  after lives of long and loving service  begging for bread and craving death   socialism is a message of hope  it is addressed to the working class  it will save the working class  or rather  show the working class how to save itself  the world does not need to be cursed by long labor  by low wages  by starvation  by worry  and by disease  millions now know that these conditions may be completely changed  when enough of the workers understand socialism  believe in it  and are firmly resolved to have it  the time will be ripe for the change  that change is coming  it is coming soon every added recruit who will read and think  brings it nearer    on we march then  we the workers and the rumor that ye hear is the blended sound of battle and deliv'rance drawing near  for the hope of every creature is the banner that we bear  and the world is marching on   https archive iww org history library haywood indsocialism 1 ,oyxrkp

2785,My company is having its managers buy shopping bags for the stores. (Question),sorry if this isn't meant to be posted here    is that allowed  i work at a beauty supply store in southern illinois  only licensed cosmetologists can shop here  so we're not a major shopping experience for the town  but over the last two months  my specific store hasn't recieved shopping bags from our warehouse  it's lead to us using boxes for customer's items  or reusing bags another customer brought in  which is a terrible idea because of covid  at this same time we haven't recieved banking deposit bags  receipt paper  or paper towels    we've explained to the district manager and the regional manager how we're out of these supplies but they've kept us on read  literally  there's a group chat on the company ipad with all the managers  that everyone can read  and multiple stores have expressed how they have no bags receipt paper deposit bags etc  and neither manager has commented on it  i'm assuming it's because if they comment then they'll be held liable to actually get something done    my co-worker called our tech support about what if we don't have receipt paper  and he explained it would make our store non-operation  he have us a ticket number and explained if we got the receipt paper we'd be owed a payout  i got my payout    but  these store managers have also expressed that they had to go out and buy their own supplies  and a store told us she had used over  300 in amazon gift cards to buy over 6 stores shopping bags  we put our for down about buying bags   i'm assuming this is all technically allowed because the regional and district managers haven't explicitly said for us to buy or own bags  but this entire situation feels out of bounds  like  wal-mart wouldn't ask their own workers to buy bags  right  am i over thinking this situation or is this a reasonable concern  i don't think anyone could get a payout since the company never asked anyone to buy these supplies  but idk ,oyn9z4

2826,Enjoy live now or early retirement?,so i am 30  and live in the netherlands  i am considering to work 4 days  32 hours  a week  i have a well paying job and am childfree so if i would do it  i would still be able to take care of myself   have money to save    but if i leave it as it is now  i would have a few hundred euros dollars extra to save  which adds up to a few thousand after a year  if i would save this i could retire a few years earlier    what would you guys and gals do  enjoy time off now or hang in there but retire a bit earlier    note  now that i am writing it out it actually is a no-brainer to me but i still value your opinion insight   also  the rules in the netherlands apply  so i will still save for retirement  just less  and have health insurance ,oye57m
2827,I broke down at work today,i work in fast food service  my boss is extremely rude and treats us all like shit  we work in terrible conditions  get constantly belittled and berated  and are expected to do everything with a smile on our faces  we also aren't allowed breaks even on an 8 hour shift and aren't allowed to eat  we also get our phones locked up and aren't allowed to have them even if we're clocked out    today was the day everything got to be too much  i was taking care of customers  and it seemed everyone in town wanted our food and everyone was in a bad mood  i was tired  overwhelmed  stressed  and anxious and everything in between   for better context into my mental health  i have multiple severe diagnosed anxiety and depressive disorders that aren't being treated because i'm not paid enough to get treatment  back when i was in therapy  my therapist told me that my only choices were to either be on medicine or be hospitalised  i did neither because i couldn't afford it  my mental illness makes it difficult to function on a daily basis  but i try my best to make it through every day and take care of myself    well  a customer complained and i went back to fix the order so there wasn't going to be a fuss  it was a small complaint that didn't need to be made into a big deal  but  of course  my boss tries to make everything i do into a reason to scream at me  he had already yelled at me right before that for another thing  but then he was yelling at me more about this  saying how dare i fix an order for free   even though that's what they tell us at training  the customer is always right and we need to fix orders for free    i broke down and said  i can't do this anymore  and next thing i know i'm curled up on the floor of the men's toilet sobbing like a baby  a ton of customers and my co-workers saw the entire thing  afterwards he ignored me all day but acted really fake nice towards everyone else  he's like a petty  passive aggressive child in a man's body   there's a lot of other worse things that happen there  many of my co-workers have gotten heat stroke and the boss doesn't care  we regularly have people get sick  a girl once cut herself and bled everywhere  she had to keep making food and i just had to mop up her blood  employees who menstruate aren't allowed to take a break to change their sanitary products  we're not allowed to stop at all and if we even hesitate for a moment to keep our hands busy we're screamed at  i've been told that i don't deserve my paycheck    there's a lot of hard  physical labour in this job and every day my back muscles ache horrifically and everything hurts  we all have burns and cuts and bruises everywhere  i had an old hip injury that healed and doesn't bother me much anymore  except when i work long hours  then it flares up again and i start limping around like an old man    there's also weird  dystopian signs on the walls that say things like  laziness is a symptom of dead minds  customers sense dead minds  don't be lazy  and other odd things  it's just a strange  miserable place   i was looking forward to only having to do a short shift tomorrow but they just called me while i was writing this saying i have to do a longer  later shift tomorrow  i'm currently crying again     i may struggle with my mental health but i can say one good thing about myself and that's that i'm a good  creative  smart person  i had goals of becoming an artist  and living a happy  fulfilling life  but this culture of work and mistreatment has worn me down  capitalism has worn me down  i'm a bitter  mean person now  i snap at my people that i love  i cry at the blink of an eye  i'm too tired and drained to paint  and when i do it doesn't suit to make money off of so i cry and throw it away  i don't pursue my hobbies anymore because they don't make me money  i don't sleep much    someday i think we can all have a better life  i've even had an idea to track little steps i've taken towards anti-capitalism  it won't be much but if you guys want maybe i can make a monthly post about what i've done  i want to see what actions you guys take too  let's make it a thing  let's inspire other people to both better their situation and help other people better theirs  i don't think that's so unrealistic    i know a lot of you on this sub have it way worse but i wanted to share what i was going through  i hate this job so much but i don't really have any other jobs lined up although i'm looking  as soon as i get hired somewhere else i'm out without hesitation  i wish i could quit right now but i have bills to pay    i ask myself every day  all this for fast food  i don't care what capitalism says  this suffering isn't necessary  this is not furthering the human race  this is making people  particularly young people  angry and disillusioned and miserable  this is destroying the planet and people   thank you for reading to the end of my rant  i'm sorry for this long post about how miserable i am  have a good day guys ,oy69mx

2897,The time I worked at a call center…,one year i started january with no job and no money  so i got myself a gig in a warehouse  which lasted 6 weeks  it was a weird warehouse in a very old building  close to a subway station  with plenty of nooks and crannies to explore so it was interesting  but hardly a good job   meanwhile i look for other jobs  and when the warehouse gig was over  i got called to work in a call center for a cell phone company  yay  office work   three weeks into training  i got called in the middle of the shift and told to go home while they  investigate  me   three days later  they call me into the office where a nervous guy i never saw before tells me that i was fired for things i never have done and it was obvious that the guy had no idea either what he was talking about    the kid was obviously fresh off the boat from africa and then it dawned on me that manglement was coward enough to have their firing done by underlings  so i got up  told the kid that they always give the shitty jobs to immigrants and gave him a hug  like they do in africa  and i left   when i got home  as i put my key in the lock  the phone rang  it was a recruiter with a job for ibm  which i got  and where it went very well while it lasted  so there is no point talking about it here   but it was cool one day passing in front of the call center and seeing my old boss on a smoke break outside  and telling him i worked at ibm now and showing him my work laptop - which i had to bring home in case i would have to work from home  ah  pre-pandemic times ,oxs8xi
2898,Yep. Fuck this.,my job is bullshit  on paper  i am a finish carpenter  i get up at 5 am  typically drive an hour or more and somehow still get stuck in traffic  and arrive at whatever job site i've been assigned  oh  and i often don't know if i'm working at all  or where  until  like  9 pm the night before  anyway  my hourly rate is dependent on my company's negotiations with the client  if a client has less than favorable things to say  it leads to lower rates with future clients    these clients are contractors who do not  and will not  take the time to get to know me or my skill set  so any mistake leads to them bitching to my rep about how much they're paying  basically  i need to blow them away on day one  but if they only have me doing bullshit grunt work  then they're never going to see what i can do  and if i have questions about more complex projects  they have incentive to interpret it as a lack of knowledge because it has the potential to save them money   there have apparently been complaints about me from two clients  so far  the first guy was already paying more than my theoretical minimum  and had me doing some pretty advanced stuff  i asked a lot of questions because i'd never worked with him before and i wanted to know how he liked things done  in the end he was satisfied with my work  he then turned around and told my rep that i had the makings of a good carpenter  but i wasn't worth what he was paying    the second guy literally had me sweeping the floor half the time  he treated me like a helper  rather than a skilled professional  there is absolutely no way he could have any frame of reference for what i can do  based on what he saw over the course of a week  but he said basically the same thing as the first guy  just to recap  this man hired a finish carpenter  exclusively had me doing stuff that anyone could do  and then bitched about paying too much  that's like ordering the prime rib  eating the whole thing  and then complaining it was overcooked and demanding a refund   and now my rep is saying he's going to have a hard time selling clients on me without lowering my rate  i already hated this job  the only reason i didn't quit on the spot is i'm still working on my osha certification  which the company pays for  i figure i can leverage that into something that sucks a little less ,oxo46g
2899,"I'm 24, lost, and confused.

2964,"""It Is No Measure of Health to be Well-Adjusted to a Profoundly Sick Society"" Essay by Charles Eisenstein",    it s no measure of health to be adjusted to a profoundly sick society   transcript   so i believe that is a krishnamurti quote   it is no measure of  health to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society  if you re  well-adjusted  like  adjusted to what  you know  you re able to go along  with program  you re able to make yourself study hard  and get good  grades  take the ap classes  sign up for extra-curriculars  to make a  good resume so that you can get into the good college  where you study  hard some more  and you play by the rules  and you re okay with that   you re adjusted to it  you re a creature of that system  and that way of  being  which is fine if we agree that that system is the system that we  should have  and that the world you re participating in is the world  that we want  and that the direction that you are helping take us is the  direction that we want to go   if you were  a  you know  a white  middle-class person in the 1950s   1960s 1970s  it was pretty easy to believe those things  that society  was basically on the right track  that science was solving our problems   that modern medicine was conquering one disease after another  that we  were progressing  life was getting better and better  since then  it s  become harder and harder to maintain the belief that we are living in  the right world   this is something that  maybe like really sensitive  prescient people  have seen this for forever  but  i believe that it began to take on a  mass character  i mean  i hesitate to put a date on it  but certainly  when i was a kid  it was starting to wear thin a little bit  i certainly  sensed a wrongness in the world that pervaded everything  i couldn t  make myself adjust  i couldn t make myself be well-adjusted  i could   and well-adjusted can mean going through the motions and at least  complying with the explicit requirements of participation  and i  couldn t even quite do that  and a lot of people in my generation  couldn t do that  either   so we became slackers  or we became addicted to things  or we became  fuck-ups  or we d procrastinate and not study hard and get drunk  you  know  like  if you really believed in the program  you wouldn t be  getting drunk every weekend in college  because you d have an aim  you d  have a goal  you d have something you cared about  the drunkenness  the  addiction  the squandering of endless hours in front of video games and  mindless pursuits  these are not some problem that must be overcome to  make us better participants in society  these are symptoms  these would  not exist if we were in a life we really cared about   without that aim  without that magnetic pole that directs our actions  and that gives us this filter   ok  what am i going to do today  what  makes sense  without that  then we are lost  then we kind of reach for  this  we reach for that  and the emptiness that we feel  we fill it up   we are driven then to fill it up with whatever can distract us from it   or maybe we take on fake goals  substitutes for the life-aim  or the  life purpose that we are really craving  higher levels in world of  warcraft  or something like that  more points in the video game  more  money  more  more  more  more of something  but not the real thing that  we really want   so whether it s laziness  procrastination  addiction  self-sabotage   greed  materialism  all these things that we judge and say is the  problem  these are the symptoms  it s not because there is something  wrong with you that you just can t make yourself get with the program   it s that there is something wrong with the program  so of course you  don t want to participate  of course you get depressed and just want to  withdraw  and just can t make yourself do it  it s not because you re  unhealthy  it s a mutiny of the soul   or you get anxious  something is wrong around here  and the  authorities say   no  no  no  everything is just fine  the problem is  with you  here are some meds  now  i understand that  immersed within  this reality  there may be no obvious alternative to the medications  that enables a person to keep going  this is a very  very hot button  topic  because many people will say that   the meds saved me  they  turned my life around  they saved me from depression  and maybe am not  qualified to pass judgment on whether or not they are universally a bad  thing  but i can see what their general function is  it s to keep people  operational in the world that is given to them   and it s a catch-22  how do you get out of that world  what  alternative do you have to simply coping with it  simply adjusting to  it   i can t offer a recipe for how to get out of it  but i can say that  the desire to get out of it  the question of   how do i get out of it   the prayer to be liberated from it  will be heard and will bring  results  in the end    https charleseisenstein org video it-is-no-measure-of-health-to-be-well-adjusted-to-a-profoundly-sick-society https charleseisenstein org video

3001,A story of my best friend and her evil employer who cut her salary and gave it back.,in 2020  my best friends employer fired almost everyone in her office because the company s sales were affected due to covid  they gave majority of the responsibilities to her  they also closed down the office and told her to just work from home   then  they cut her salary by about  20 000  so she went from making  55 000 to  25 000  they justified it of course by saying low sales   so now she s working almost twice as much and harder for way less pay   then in 2021  after about 11 months  she told me they gave her back the  20 000 and a  2 000 bonus   i used to work there years ago  and i know damn well this company could easily survive without firing a single person  she still works there  sadly ,oxn59y

3010,"For Filipinos, why not address recruitment malpractices?", r phcareers is too vanilla for me to post this and want to seemingly attract an employer-focused subreddit rather than an employee one   my biggest letdown in the vicious cycle of bpo industries is the number of exploitative baits they still flail at you  even if the pool is intelligent enough to sense it  i tried to tap the market just for fun  customer service rep  and i had one of the worst interviews with a well-respected bpo company in ph   well they do curate images so what do i expect  i got it but declined it without hesitation for alarming reasons  if that was the  best  what's left to it   for starters  they advertised misleading work setups  required me to have a pc  internet  even ridiculed one of the candidates in front of us for not having one  it was so sad  when in fact it was onsite  and the recruiter even said  and i quote  y'know  there's no such thing as bpo work from home  are you aware of that  that's impossible  it's not meant to be that way  we will never offer this option  in a condescending tone while he hisses at his dogs  crying baby  and the screeching cars in front of his house  maybe for you  i guess  no company help for you during the pandemic  unlike mine  why advertise it then   anyway  he even gave his high strung opinion on my previous work   you won't excel nor grow from that field  i tried it before  there are no opportunities and no learning whatsoever  you should consider this position today i have your contract ready immediately  do i need to hear your own failures when it's not relevant to the conversation  when in fact i do excel  i am still striving and that's why you considered me for the job and guess what  i'm a virtual assistant who earns more than him  relaxes more than him  40-hour workweek kami  and even has a better-invested set up than him because i care about my job  i'm in awe how he could casually judge a position so similar to what he's doing right now  working all odds against him  shockingly  their salary decreased by 7k  200  on their usual offer on jobstreet in a span of 5 years  i've been observing that company for a long time  i couldn't negotiate my salary because they will  invest more in the safety and work environment of the offices so the base is what we could offer  why not give a work-from-home option rather than bothering with that  to end the sour encounter  i sent my letter of declining the offer  and to my surprise  he made it look like i didn't pass  just to save face  the desperation was present in the interview and he made me look like i didn't even qualify  what a power trip big boy  the pretentiousness reeks  what a relief when you try to tap a seemingly good company on the outside but rotten on the inside   brain fart  why is there an nsfw option in our subreddit when we don't like work lol  anyway  just a rant ,oxm48r

3094,Punishment and annoying job statements,for me as someone who hasn't had a stable long term permanent job since 2018 it really angers me that businesses  companies  employers etc punish you for not having a job every day of the year every single year  like if you explain to people that you job hunted for a job for over a year and didn't find anything they blame it on you or punish  you for not finding a job or not just taking a job to have a job  or if you didn't want to work at a job during the period of time when covid19 started out because you didn't have healthcare at that point and the job wasn't offering healthcare and so if you got covid you were sol and more so could potentially die from it but no they punish you and blame you for that  and lastly i want to have a job like i had in from 2013 to 2017 and again in 2018  i hunt daily for jobs like that  and because i am of the mindset that i don't want to take for example an entry level customer service job just to have a job until i can find a job that is where i was in 2018 that somehow that's on me and i should be punished for that  so i work crap retail jobs in the mean time living with a roommate or with friends until i can get back to where i was in 2013-2017 and in 2018     but it just annoys me to the highest levels that my job being outsourced in 2018 and me being unable to find a job between the end of 2018 and dec 2019 is my fault  i hunted  i searched  i applied  i interviewed  i got nothing out of it  and its my fault  the blame is on me  i should be punished because i didn't want to work in an environment where i could get covid19 one and two get covid19 without healthcare  and now that i have been vaccinated and i'm trying to get back out there i should be punished for not doing the above things  like the retail job i work at could care less about me getting covid  could care less about employees and customers wearing mask indoors or social distancing or even the smallest levels of trying to reduce any chance of getting covid this was when covid19 first hit and even up until now  but all of that is my fault     and in truth all of this makes me hate work  hate how businesses hire  and hate how the people in charge of hiring people handle all of the processes involved in hiring someone  i hate all of it and i hate the people in charge of it      i know this is more of a rant but it also felt antiwork  i'm just tired of playing these games you have to play to get hired these days  not really looking for any advice just wanted to vent out my frustrations ,owo4ky

3148,Starting to feel despair,i've always struggled with maintaining jobs  not because i'm lazy or incompetent  but because i tend to give jobs my all and then i get burnt out after about a year or two  i've tried a couple of different career paths  and one thing that has stuck out with me is the pressure not only your bosses put you through but also your coworkers  not only in terms of meeting demands that seem to grow exponentially  but depending on the field  socially as well  so i said fuck all that noise i just want something that i can do all by myself and not have to deal with  bosses and coworkers  so i found a job as a delivery associate for a certain company run by the richest prick in the world  i knew going in that amazon is hell  but i told myself i'd use it as a stepping stone to get into something better  well as time went on i climbed up the ranks in my position ended up with a lead role  getting paid more than i ever have  i was expected to work on my own time with no pay  and lecture coworkers who weren't performing as well  and perform my actual job perfectly  the smallest of mistakes would count against you and could get you fired  the demands of the job just wouldn't stop  we were practically doing double the amount of work from when i had started  the culture of this job was so toxic  it made me truly depressed and i became an asshole to my coworkers  who were basically ass kissing bootlickers for amazon   i hated my life and thought about killing myself daily  well something had to give and it wasn't going to be me  so i took a week off and told my boss i would not be coming back after that week  i decided to try and work for myself  doing various gig work and odd jobs  i'm still doing it to this day  i've never been happier in terms of work  i don't have any asshole bosses or shit coworkers and i work when i want  which is basically all the time  well there just has to be a catch  and that's tax season  i've never had to deal with doing taxes myself up until now and come to find out it's pretty different  i have to file with 1099 forms and report all of my earnings of course that is to be expected  what i'd didn't expect is that the amount i would owe would be so damn high  now i understand i'm making money that isn't being taxed and for that you owe your fair share  but to owe an amount that is nearly twice the amount i had in my savings has just broken me man  i was barely making enough to get by and that's with setting some aside for taxes because i thought it would be reasonable  now i have to make monthly payments on my taxes and i'm having to do the bare minimum not to break the bank  and i'm fucking struggling  all i wanted was to earn some money in a way that i could feel content with my life  and i thought i found it but nope  and now i'm thinking of stepping back into the corporate world  and it just makes me want scream  i'm sorry i know this is a long rant but i have to get it out somehow  i feel like a pressure cooker  i'm just so done with this whole system  i've never expected handouts  i don't ever borrow money from anyone  and i actually enjoy doing hard work at times  but i feel like this whole system has chewed me up and spit me out  okay i'm done bitching now,owkp4j

3188,How the Rich get Cash out of their Shares,alright  i'm mad because i just read a post about elon musks' wealth gains and the comments are all fucking wrong   in particular  this idea that oh   musk's 138 billion gains in net worth aren't liquid   somehow  this idea's been accepted by a lot of people as a counterargument despite being utterly wrong     amp x200b   here's the reality  elon musk  has  converted the appreciation in his stock to cash  he already does it   let's start by setting the groundwork first  there are two assumptions that need to hold in order for the system i'm going to describe to work   1  interest rates remain at around 0  this has been true for quite a long time since 2008  and there seems to be no hurry to raise it up again  2  stocks  in general  rise at around 7  per year  this is the long-run trend of the market  including the great depression  and i highly doubt this will fail    amp x200b   how does he do it  let's start with simple round numbers as an illustration    let's say you have 100 billion dollars worth of shares in tesla  you can't sell them because then you'd have to pay taxes  and you'd probably negatively affect the share price if you tried to sell that many all at once   what do you do  instead of approaching the investment bank to sell off your shares in block orders  you instead go to their lending department and ask for a loan   you secure the loan using your shares in the publicly-traded company as collateral  a similar process is going to the bank for a mortgage on a house   in both cases  the bank keeps your shares house as collateral for the loan  the bank provides you with 50  of the value you just put up with them   in our case  we've just been handed 50 billion dollars in cash  sure  we owe the bank 50 billion  but it's secured by around 100 billion dollars worth of shares  it's a relatively safe loan  so the bank loans to us at an absurdly low rate  say 1 4    amp x200b   go out and enjoy your  tax-free  50 billion dollars in cash    amp x200b   well  let's say another year passes  your 100 billion worth of shares has grown to 107 billion because the market generally grows at 7  you call up the bank and say  hey  i'd like to refinance my loan  and they nod their head and then you get a new loan for the new net worth of your shares   so this year  you walk out of the bank with 3 5 billion in cash just from the appreciation of your shares  note that this applies if the company rose by 7  tesla goes up by some fucking absurd percentage   this is sustainable  indefinitely  so long as the stock market outruns the interest rate    amp x200b   now  this all sounds good in theory  some of you might state  well  i'd like to prove that the rich already do this     elon musk owes  507 million to banks helping tesla raise capital    https www cnbc com 2019 05 03 elon-musk-owes-507-million-to-banks-helping-tesla-raise-capital html https www cnbc com 2019 05 03 elon-musk-owes-507-million-to-banks-helping-tesla-raise-capital html    goldman sachs group inc has  213 million in loans outstanding to musk  while he owes morgan stanley  209 million  and another  85 million to bank of america corp    buy  borrow  die  how rich americans live off their paper wealth    https www wsj com articles buy-borrow-die-how-rich-americans-live-off-their-paper-wealth-11625909583 https www wsj com articles buy-borrow-die-how-rich-americans-live-off-their-paper-wealth-11625909583    wall street doubles down on lending  cheap money  to the rich    https www ft com content 8a328af4-b8f2-48c5-82a9-d7dc1c345e1c https www ft com content 8a328af4-b8f2-48c5-82a9-d7dc1c345e1c    amp x200b    the combined value of loans made by the wealth management arms of jpmorgan chase  bank of america  citigroup  and morgan stanley surpassed  600bn in the second quarter  up 17 5 percent from a year earlier    this represented 22 5 percent of the banks  total loan books  up from 16 3 percent in mid-2017    for a two-year loan against liquid investments such as stocks  wealth management clients can expect to pay a rate of about 1 4 percent  according to bankers and advisers    instead of selling assets to raise cash   and facing a capital gains tax bill   high net-worth clients obtain funding by borrowing against the value of their investments    amp x200b   in short  the rich already get the benefits of any appreciation in their capital  by taking advantage of low interest rates  they're able to get cash to spend while  avoiding taxes  because they haven't liquidated their holdings at all   this whole idea that  oh an increase in their net wealth isn't liquid  is utterly false  and i'm going to challenge it at every opportunity ,ovnfbs

3198,"How does a society of ""antiwork"" people function exactly? If no one is contributing to society, how does it run?",title summarizes my question quite well  the only reason society functions as we know it is because people work and contribute towards it in an extremely diverse amount of ways  whether you're picking fruit on a farm  in construction or an accountant  there is work that needs to be done for the world to operate  and it's not necessarily fun   before people get the wrong idea  i'm not supporting the current system  obviously massive wealth discrepancies are a problem - this post has nothing to do with capitalism or the current system  however  all societies need people to contribute to it in the form of work  even in a hunter-gatherer society people need to forage  hunt  create tools and structures  etc   so in an  antiwork  society  how exactly does anything get done  and if only some people work and others don't choose to work  why should those who choose not to work be entitled to the benefits of those who are contributing  going back to hunter-gatherer  that'd be like your community going out and foraging hunting while you lay down and sleep  and then you eat the food they worked to acquire  and you do this consistently  does that sound like something you want to aspire towards ,ovo9tb

3200,My recent experience with working really long hours and quitting.,i was working a job as a heavy duty mechanic repairing construction equipment   i would work for 3-4 weeks straight 8-12 hours a day  the job was 7 hours away from home  the pay was good  45 an hour but no over time pay  which i just found out was illegal    i was given a warning that i'd be fired for not leaving drip trays under equipment and apparently having too many equipment not in functional condition because of repairs and waiting for parts which was not true  i found that quite pitty so i just quit in the middle of a shift   i had been looking for work in my home town but not much luck  the second day i got home i received a job offer just for a month of work but i might have the opportunity to work part time after    i wish more people would realize that they have been manipulated and brainwashed into loving capitalism  there are other ways  money and the economy isn't real  fuck long hours ,ovvqz3
3201,Starting new job,i do mostly contract work as a freelancer but i have tried  real jobs  a few times and it never works out well  i'm a great worker but not a great employee apparently    real job  1 i got fired after 4 months because i  question authority        real job  2 was in a call center and i ended up quitting after me and my work bestie who sat in the cubicle behind me talked about getting out of there everyday  we really hyped each other up  lol   she did it first and then i did it a couple weeks after  job wasn't even that bad but sitting in a cubicle everyday really messed me up    real job  3 was great except i had to drive a lot in my own car and they didn't reimbursement mileage or anything  i went back and forth with my manager on how it's not fair because if an in-office worker makes the same as me then i actually take home less since i have to pay for all my own gas and car maintenance  after i quit i found out that they maxed out my annual salary on hire and i was never gonna get a raise  or mileage  because i couldn't make more than my manager  so basically my manager badly negotiated his own pay and that affected my ability to get paid more  i quit because i couldn't get over the no mileage reimbursement thing after driving like 700 miles in a week    real job  4 starts next week  i'll be working from home so no worries about mileage  but i am worried about a regular 8-5 work week  i signed a one year contract this time so i can't just quit  i gotta make it through the whole year  it's possible i'll get called in mid year but with the delta variant maybe not    not excited about working in this type of arrangement  however  as we all know  that's the scam if you want health insurance and benefits  contract work is its own thing  i do prefer working as i please  however i don't always have health insurance and no sick days  gotta know how to save in order to pay all those taxes at the end of the year  yada yada  pros cons    all in all i'm fortunate to not have to worry about getting work  but man  y'all know how it is ,ovlk8d
