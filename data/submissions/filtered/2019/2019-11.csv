10,My boss gaslit me tonight :),since it was the day before thanksgiving we were packed and even with three cashiers we had a rush that was over an hour when it finally stopped i took a minute to see how empty the front end was and then went about emptying the garbage as i had been told its part of my job and have been doing it since i started last week   while doing the garbage my co worker was looking at the list of things to do shed been given and mentioned that it was weird they gave us to do lists she saw that they wanted her to sweep and she said okay cool dont know how im supposed to do that when i have to use a cane and i responded jokingly with what you dont know how to grow a third arm how dare you she replied half jokingly that shes not going to be able to work under those kinds of conditions   the next thing i know my store manager is pulling me and another cashier into the office and is literally screaming at us that we havent been doing our jobs and hes tired of it he singled me out repeatedly and even let the other employee go to yell at me more saying since ive started working i havent been doing my job   aside from tonight and my interview ive literally only fucking seen this guy in passing like three other times he kept insisting that hes been constantly telling me to do things and that i havent done them he got mad because i did the garbage asking why i did it when no one told you to do that but you have time to stand around up here complaining about what youre being paid  no one said anything about what we were being paid which even if we fucking did mention salary the fucking company code of conducts specifies were allowed to discuss not only that but also working conditions   he also ended up sending everyone else home at their scheduled time to leave and forced me to stay an extra half hour doing restocking because it hasnt been done so no one gets to leave until it is   i kept trying to mention that he literally has not told me except for one time to do restocking and the reason i ended up back at my register and not getting it done is because i was called back by the other manager and he kept while not outright calling me a liar implying that i was lying   i ended up upset the rest of my shift and im fucking pissed but i dont know what to do no one told me doing fucking restock is apparently more important than fucking cashiering which is what i got hired to do this fucking guy literally told me to ignore lines of customers to do restock and berated me that i should know that because ive worked retail before if i fucking walked away from three or four people in a line to do something else at my old jobs i would have been written up for it   i just dont know what to do ive dealt with asshole bosses before but this mother fucker was literally gaslighting me and i didnt know how to react what the fuck,e2u06i

44,There is no way to win in employment as long as competition is accepted as the norm.,ive been reading 22 immutable laws of marketing and zero to one and decided to apply what i learned to work culture here is why it is impossible to win being an employee   the law of competition  when entering a competitive market such as an industry or a certain field one must automatically adjust to the rules this means taking on the same rate and expectations however to achieve excellence in that field one must offer exceptional value which means higher returns at a lower cost when labor is evaluated on hourly basis the person who does it then becomes a commodity thus the competition doesnt become over what the person can do but rather over the person themselves squeezed for resources until they cannot give anymore they are discarded for not being able to handle a high stress environment this revolving wheel of exploitation leads to lower rates higher expectations and higher profits to those who hire hourly labor to create a product that brings them value when workers are forced to compete between themselves only the owners benefit   the law of leadership   the opposite of competition is leadership being a leader in a certain market segment allows one to charge a premium rate until competition catches up in employment carving out a new niche is the best way to increase earnings the challenges here are originally and charisma one not only must invent a new market segment but drive a demand to it in essence a new specialist is an entrepreneur   the reason why its so difficult to win in employment is not due to the lack of education or skills not enough jobs or terrible bosses but due to harsh competition between employees themselves breaking away from the norm rather than striving for excellence is the only way out of the downward spiral,e2pwmd

60,America was founded by people who hated work.,i learned from an article entitled our forefathers failurehttpwwwlibertyunboundcomsitesfilesprintarchivelibertymagazinemarch2010pdf at libertyunboundcomhttpwwwlibertyunboundcom that the colonies at plymouth rock and jamestown tried both freemarket and communist systemslong before karl marx was born the liberty unbound article appears to have been based on a 1985 mises institute article by richard j maybury entitled the great thanksgiving hoaxhttpsmisesorglibrarygreatthanksgivinghoax0 and on a 2000 article by dr judd w patton entitled the pilgrim story vital lessons and insights for todayhttpjpattonbellevueedubiblicaleconomicspilgrimstoryhtml  the pilgrims landed at plymouth rock in december 1620 and in spite of help from the native americans half of them died the first year as a result of their initial system during the second year more of them died they would quickly learn that their initial system was tragically incompatible with human nature it was simply unnatural  the colonists had the ideal conditions for their initial system because they all had a reputation as virtuous hard working people they were all of the same race religion politics and nationality and of course they all had agreed to this system voluntarily although somewhat reluctantly they also knew that failure meant death  nevertheless under their initial system they simply werent producing and storing enough food which lead to starvation disease and discontent their first solution in their second year was to institute beatings for those who did not work hard enough but this had little effect on productivity and it further increased discontent  the colonists astutely observed that their system tended to retard productivity while breeding confusion and discontent we know this because they wrote about it in their journals clearly their initial system was incompatible with human nature  by the spring of 1623 the pilgrims feared they would not survive another winter so in desperation they adopted a radically different system and it saved their lives productivity increased and in 1623 they didnt have just another harvest feast that would have to be when they had the first real thanksgiving  which system failed the colonists initially and which radically different system saved them which system was so incompatible with human nature and which system was so compatible with human nature which system was so ugly and which system was so beautiful  in order to escape persecution and establish the plymouth colony in america the puritan separatists who would later be known as pilgrims made a somewhat reluctant agreement with their investors the virginia company of london and the virginia company of plymouth aka the adventurers in this contract not the mayflower compact they agreed to share everything produced by any one of themfrom each according to his abilityto each according to his need and then after 7 years they would divide the common accumulated wealth and property with the adventurers according to dr judd pattons article based on the 1647 book by governor bradford  gtthe contract between the adventurers and the pilgrims consisted of ten points the most critical of which stated that all such persons as are of this colony are to have their meat drink apparel and all provisions out of the common stock and goods of the said colony further it was agreed that during the first seven years all profits and benefits that are got by trade traffic trucking working fishing or any other means of any persons remain still in the common stock until the division  the result was that only a small percentage of them worked hard and the rest were freeloaders to varying degrees because they would rather risk death than be exploited by others they were so reluctant to work that they even left food rotting on the vine the result was indeed death half of them died this reminds me of the saying by the people of the ussr they pretend to pay us and we pretend to work  then in the spring of 1623 the surviving colonists decided to let each person keep the fruits of his labor and the colonys total output increased so much that they were never hungry again  the governor wrote in his journal that under their initial communist system some of them claimed to be too weak or sick to work and they were so convincing that it would have been the height of tyranny to force them work then after they learned they could keep the fruits of their labor those who were too sick to walk suddenly recovered and began working the fields  communism was killing the colonists at plymouth rock and by switching to a freemarket system they became more productive and saved themselvesin a single growing season  the transition from communism to free markets still lacked full property rights however whereas each individual owned the fruits of his labor he did not own the land he worked and thus he did not own any improvements he made to that land  in 1623 the colonists were still growing food on parcels of land that were reassigned by random lots each year which they astutely observed was a disincentive for each farmer to make permanent improvements to his parcel of land because in the following year someone else would inherit the fruits of any labor he devoted to improvements therefore in 1624 they adopted full property rights where everyone owned the land he worked and the result was another productivity boost whereas the first step toward property rights and the free market had increased productivity enough to feed everyone the move to full property rights produced enough extra food to export and trade for furs and other goods  the article goes on to explain the similar experience in jamestown  gtjamestown the first permanent english colony in america established in virginia in 1607 had an experience similar to the pilgrims at plymouth early years of starvation were followed by converting to a system of property rights and a free market which brought abundance under collectivism less than half of every shipload of settlers survived the first 12 months at jamestown most of the work was done by only onefifth of the men to whom the socialist system gave the same rations as to the others during the winter of 160910 called the starving time the population fell from 500 to 60but when jamestown converted to a free market there was plenty of food which every man by his own industry may easily and doth procure wrote the colony secretary ralph hamor in 1614 under the previous system he said we reaped not so much corn from the labors of thirty men as three men have done for themselves now  ralph hamor friend of john rolfe whose wife was pocahontas also described the failure of communism in jamestown like this for formerly when our people were fed out of the common store and labored jointly in the manuring of the ground and planting corn glad was the man that could slip from his labor nay the most honest of them in a general business would not take so much faithful and true pains in a week as now he will do in a day  governor bradford of plymouth further explained the fatal conceit of communism there by saying the experience that was had in this common course and condition tried sundry years and that amongst godly and sober men may well evince the vanity of that conceit of platos and other ancients applauded by some of later times that the taking away of property and bringing in community into a commonwealth would make them happy and flourishing as if they were wiser than god  none of these articles mentioned the roanoke colony whose people simply disappeared and many speculate that they were killed by the native americans but i think we can all deduce that it is more likely they were killed by communism given how they disappeared without any sign of a struggle an even more likely explanation is that they merged with the native americans but one can easily imagine how such a desperate move may have been precipitated by the failure of communism  although both my first hand experience and observations as well as my research and analysis have long since led me to conclude that the free market and property rights are superior to communism i would have believed that communism could have worked in the case of the first american colonies because they had every advantage one could give communism they had already unanimously agreed to communism they all shared the same race nationality religion political views and economic views failure meant starvation and slackers were beaten but in spite of every advantage possible communism was a catastrophic and systemic failure in the first american colonies  consider that the colonists at plymouth rock had no historical precedent on which to evaluate communism vs the free market and yet when communism failed them they invented and adopted a complete free market system with full property rights in just two years  in just four years the colonists proved that that communism was a very unnatural and ugly thing and that freemarkets and property rights were a very natural and beautiful thing  our ancestors understanding of the superiority of the free market and property rights made us the dominant nation on earth whereas today we are rapidly losing that status americans have forgotten the hard won knowledge of our ancestors  consider that barack obama the us president as of this writing had 400 years of additional historical precedent as well as a harvard education and yet he still doesnt understand how the free market is superior to communism contrary to the myth of obamahttpendofinnocencecomthemythofobamabusted he says when you spread the wealth around its good for everybodyhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrhotivisuduampt19s  those colonists at plymouth rock who seem so much more in touch with reality than the president of the united states remind me of small town americans of my childhood of course the president sees small town americans as basically racists who have antipathy toward those who are different and who cling to their guns and religion  although barack obama is a dilettante whose image was manufactured by the mediahttpendofinnocencecomthemythofobamabusted progressiveshttpendofinnocencecomamericanprogressivemanifestofascism have told me that he is right because communism in early america was too soon they claim that it is not human nature to be a freeloader and that the people themselves have learned a lot since then and would no longer be freeloaders in case anyone cannot see that the progressive argument is bs then consider that the danish recently proved that 90 still prefer to be freeloaders when they canhttpendofinnocencecomunemploymentbenefitsincreaseunemploymenteven when they can make more money working  one has to ask why this critical lessonhttpendofinnocencecomcommunismfreemarketsplymouthrockjamestown is not taught to every american and every human multiple times per yeareven in government schoolsespecially in government schools

81,The great contradiction of the current work system,i think 100 years old 8 hours workday and bullshit like that is only secondary to this one regarding salaried employees  the employer wants to extract the maximum amount of work from the employee in the shortest time possible while its in the best interent of the employee to provide minimum work output possible across all their allocated hours they get paid the same no matter the output so there is no motivation and better save the energy for things that actually matter  the empoyer is aware of this and tries to fight it deploying various tools like company culture industrial psychology events organized by hr useless benefits like table football employee of the month award and so on  raising salary actually doesnt help in the long run at all raising salary doesnt solve this contradiction so if your salary gets raised you will feel momentary happiness and then its back to normal  this in my opinion is one of the biggest reasons not the only one of course why people are so miserable at work,e4ao1b
82,Here’s my suggestion of how to fix the whole system of the rich hoarding money.,make a maximum net worth cap it could be a ridiculous amount like 100mil but once you hit that you cant earn any more you can go on holidays and spend a whole lot of it for the opportunity to earn more when you spend some   obviously would never happen but do yall think it could work,e2qrm6
83,"Condolences to anyone working today,",its thanksgiving for fucks sake the fact that the usa has no real holidays  as in the entire country is off of work to celebrate is a damned disgrace  i recently got out of working in grocery retail and i was lucky for the past 6 years i worked somewhere that remained closed on thanksgiving fuck all these stores that gotta open up on thanksgiving in case some idiot forgot to thaw their turkey forgot the pumpkin pie dropped the eggs or what the fuck ever itd be nice if there really was a holiday at least most places still close on christmas but i bet that will change in the future  anyway my sincere condolences and sympathy for anyone who has to go to work instead of hanging out with their family and friends or whatever the hell youd rather be doing,e2z5sb

88,Should I send a cease and desist letter to ex-boss for defamation?,i just found out the reason why i wanst getting a call back from job applications in the last six months is because my exboss my only reference had been talking crap about me unfairly i found out because a family member works for the same company and her manager told her that she was spreading bad things about me i did absolutely nothing wrong in this job but i got fucked either way   i only got called in the office once because i was a bit slow but i explained to her that i have hypothyroidism and depression which im being treated for with medication  and that i come into work feeling pretty crappy since hypothyroidism slows your body functions and makes you feel zombie like but that i would try to be faster she said it was ok but apparently it wasnt and when i left she just run her stupid mouth   i would feel pretty crappy about myself if i stopped someone with a disability from getting another job and defaming her name and reputation and making them struggle financially i would feel like a fing monster as a matter of fact but that is capitalism right only the strongest survive and the weak become weaker  internet lawyers say i should send a cease and desist letter but would that make things worse,e1kp41

92,Time Based Pricing,heres an idea to fix the mess were living in  time based pricing  below some examples  a cup of coffee costs everyone 1 minute of working  a bag of groceries enough for one household 4 persons for one day costs everyone 1 hour of working  a new commuter car costs everyone 2 months of working  a ferrari costs everyone 1 year of working  an apartment costs everyone 1 year of working  a house costs everyone 15 years of working  a large mansion costs everyone 4 years of working    before people start to rage that this is a bad idea take time no pun intended to think about it and give reasons why this would be a bad idea in your opinion im absolutely not dogmatic about this idea and it could be that im missing something very important that this idea might in fact be dangerous or something    everyone is always saying time  money  with time worked as a way of paying things get more equal for everyone  but then everyone is going to be an uber driver  toilet cleaner  painter  crapart maker  etc  by that same logic everyone would be a doctor or pilot right now  i assure you id never want to work as a doctor or pilot too much responsibility for me even if the education for these jobfunctions were free i wouldnt do it    if businesses decide to ask 2 days of working for a cup of coffee then they probably wont get much business  other than how its managed now landlords cant ask one month of working as the renting price unless they allow 10 persons in the house    how are people going to be able to spend their worked hours  pretty much the same as it is now 1 credit per minute or something    who controls the credit system  who controls it now    it means theres an unlimited amount to spend inflation etc  not sure about that as one needs to work no work means no credits the more people work the more credits there will be    what if there isnt enough work to do  we need to realize that this is already the case with automationrobots taking over it means we either should all benefit from these robots or cost of living should be far more reasonable and affordable    this idea is extremely dangerous  why    what about the people who are doing labor that they can only do for 4 hours a day  why should we work more than 4 hours a day anyway    its an idea obviously its never going to be implemented because tptb wont let it happen but its an idea  just thinking out loud what say ye,e2u9lw
93,Super frustrated. My boss won’t get off my ass,so ive been working at a small business for over a year now and almost out of no where the ownerboss started getting on my ass for slip ups and minor mistakes some of it is perfectly warranted and ive tried to adjust accordingly but other issues hes raised are nitpicks like  1 why dont you come in early anymore are you starting to slip   when i first started i used to come in early eventually i saw that there was absolutely no benefit to continue to do this fyi im the only employee who continually comes in on time or early the other employees are either 15min late every day or an hour late every day my complaints to the bossowner about the tardiness of my coworkers that leaves me alone on shifts sometimes were met with excuses and double standards about how long theyve worked here im being too harsh blah blah  when i was coming in early i ended up fulfilling duties they shouldve been doing if they were on time so i decided to just come in on time when scheduled but still not late  2 why dont you clean like you used to are you getting complacent  when i was first hired the first thing i noticed was that the place was a disgusting mess so in order to show leadership and initiative i began to clean the store at least once a week as well as attempt to clean whenever theres down time my coworkers stations wereare so disgusting and cluttered that i couldnt even begin to clean without bothering their daily routines my suggestion for them to help me fell on deaf ears  a year later and im still the only one who cleans so i decided that im only going to straighten up the bare minimum once a week and nothing else i have the same responsibilities as my coworkers and i get paid less than them what am i the personal maid around here  3 miscellaneous issues with my timesheet  so this one really bothers me at this backwards ass job we have to calculate everything with our timesheets our hours our labor commissions our floor sales commissions receipt numbers people we worked with etc etc and email them to the ownerboss who submits it to a third party payroll company that pays us ive never been at a place that operated this way usually theres someone like a manager who calculates most of this stuff with the assistance of a time clock program or something anyway over the last 3 weeks my boss has been riding me about errors ive made with my math when it comes to my commissions again some of these complaints seemed to make sense at first as i know ive made a mistake or two in the past but now im beginning to get suspicious or at least paranoid that hes trying to rip me off or something its happening far too often despite how careful ive been  now my complaints  1 we dont get breaks we just dont im tired of being unable to get through a meal without interruption  2 were on camera all day and were watched by the bossowner and micromanaged on occasion  3 im tired of being messaged about work shit on my time off or day off  4 one coworker in particular is hostile he demeans everyone is blatantly racist sexist etc and loses his temper whenever hes slightly inconvenienced i could have a line of customers and he wont help he just stays in the back      i dont know why my boss is suddenly on my ass i dont know if im making errors that are serious or not and im not sure i care im just feeling burned out,e1oa2q

102,Economic Possibilities For Our Grandchildren,recently i read an essay by john maynard keynes called economic possibilities for our grandchildren which was pretty depressing in the essay he states that because of improving technology efficiency and productivity by the time his grandchildren are his age which is now the average worker will only have to work 15 hours a week and they will be paid more than they were in his time obviously this hasnt happened but its not because he was too far off base  ever since the industrial revolution there was a trend of workers working less and being paid more while the overall production of the economy increased due to improvements in technology and productivity at the beginning of the industrial revolution the average worker had to work pretty much constantly just to barely scrape by by 1900 it was around 65 hours a week and by 1930 it was about 55 hours at the same time the average income for the middle and lower class was slowly but steadily gaining but around the 1950s1960s time period this trend all but stopped  wages stagnated and havent really grown since and the hours worked has barely budged and has even increased in several industries and professions basically the worker is working just as hard as they were 60 years ago with no gains to show for it this isnt because the economy hasnt grown keynes predicted that by this time technology and productivity improvements may have caused the economy to multiply by eight times this was actually a low estimate and the surplus wealth in the economy has multiplied many dozens of times since then so why hasnt the well being of the worker increased along with it  if you follow this subreddit you probably already know the vast majority of the incredible gains of the american economy over the past 60 years have gone straight to the pockets of the wealthy while the workers position has remained stagnant decade after decade the rich have doubled their wealth year after year after year   to further confirm this a study showed that the average worker today produces the same amount of product in 11 hours that a worker in 1950 could produce in 40 hours and though consumption has obviously increased in recent decades that doesnt even come close to accounting for this the worker today has come to accept that they will never see their lives improve they will never get a break and they will never see the value created by their labor they accept that they are being exploited and its a travesty  the main thing we can do is try to organize and educate our fellow workers both within the workplace and in politics im currently nearing the end of college and when i graduate im going to join the labor force full time rather than just part time as im doing now after a few years of experience in the private sector i am going to run for city council in houston texas my hometown on a platform of workers rights,e41egp

house nor flat no bonds or shares no jewellery or works of art no savings of any kind if i sold everything i own i might get maybe 3k hard to tell  a dated gaming pc some tools and power tools some kitchen stuff stacks of books  i dont have a car or a licence  i did a course years ago so i know how to but never did the exam because money and also didnt have money for the car anyway and i wouldnt use it daily as public transport was and is much quicker  i dont drink alcohol i dont do any kind of drugs i dont smoke tobacco i admittedly vape i might spend up to a 100 per month on games  humble bundles some dlc to my favourites but of pay2win crap elsewhere  i wear clothes i have im not bothered by labels i dont have anything of a recognisable brand i buy just quality clothes that will last me a long time and usually only replace them trends dont apply to me im either jeans and tshirt most of the days and tweed if i feel fancy  i rent a flat id say in the middle of a price range 1 bedroom rather cramped but good commute and safe neighbourhood  i spend probably a bit too much on takeout because as much as i love cooking after a full day of work its not very enjoyable but still its maybe 56 times a month and its pizza or mcdonalds nothing fancy  i also spend a bit too much on food i could go for italian style hard cheese instead of parmesan or just bacon instead of pancetta but did i mention i love cooking also candies and pastries  im a sweet tooth sue me  i havent had a steak in months beef is too expensive usually the meat is either sausage bacon or sometimes mince often theres no meat just legumes cheese eggs and dairy as a source of fat and protein  i have stopped going to starbucks and other crap coffee establishments switched to black tea with milk i stopped eating lunch at work ill just bring something from home to keep me going until the evening  and im still just spiralling down well i kind of know why i have two people who are financially dependent on

work as well  im a diy enthusiast while i highly enjoyed it i also did it for money some bucks here some bucks there usually i just say with perfect honesty that im not a registered self employed person so i cannot ask for any money but i can accept a gift people are quite generous when they are happy with what i do and im an honest and conscientious guy i show up on time i get stuff done i dont bullshit  however as ive mentioned i dont have a car i also dont want to incur wrath of the tax authorities so i only just offer my services outside of my day job hours on the neighbour board when someone is looking for something i can do i dont advertise because i feel it would be silly to be a handyman on the weekends and late evenings only but im happy to do some actual work with my hands interact with people and put the tools to use as im currently renting a flat they dont see any real use  im at the end of a rope really i probably could hail mary get a loan from my bank and continue the status quo few more months but that is not a solution  i will probably be forced to hang one of the people who are dependent on me out to dry and its killing me i worked hard for over a decade im really good at what i do i kept away from most vices i spend my free time either doing some side gigs for spare change or doing things for friends for free  tutoring helping you name it  i tried to live my life as my mother taught me dont lie dont cheat dont backstab love people help others be happy with what you have i also listened to my dad work hard do your best bear the cross  im now on heavy antidepressants after over 15 years of battling depression on my own i never surrendered to the demons inside me which propose such simple and alluring solutions to my anguish it did help to think that my life has meaning to others and thats why it is so hard right now im presented with a choice of basically betraying the way i lived my life and abandon someone or keep trying to carry that cross of mine hoping it doesnt crush me   but ive tried and tried and just cant i did some math recently in the past 5 years at my company ive had two pay rises one of them due to a promotion ive applied the inflation the taxes and i now earn 2 less than 5 years ago in actual purchasing power the game is rigged the inflation is and the power of the government but the salaries at the hands of the private and yes i could play that game leverage the employer hunt for better paying job start my own business but all those things require money to start with and with no savings only debt its a no go and to build the capital id have to implement radical cost saving measures which in turn bring me back to abandoning another human in need  i wont lie id gladly work more to make ends meet i hate working in general im an ubi supporter and proponent i can do a lot of things for the world outside of my job but id be lying if i said that i wouldnt work more  however no paid overtime at my company just toil time off inlieu and finding another employer in my field who would want my services during my free time proved to be very hard i did offer around some freelance services so work whenever deliver on agreed time but thats also rare and a lot of that stuff can be outsourced for cheap  this is incredibly long and if you got to the end thank you i really just needed to vent to put my thoughts in order and i dont like to write things that will never see the light of day thank you,e0y0tq

123,It's been over a 100 years and we still have an 8 hour work day. You'd think with all the advances in technology we could all be working less,the eighthour day movement or 40hour week movement also known as the shorttime movement was a social movement to regulate the length of a working day preventing excesses and abuses it had its origins in the industrial revolution in britain where industrial production in large factories transformed working life the use of child labour was common the working day could range from 10 to 16 hours and the work week was typically six days a week   from wikipedia  so how come we are not fighting for our rights anymore really interested in your thoughts on this,e0fzvd

126,How to Appeal to More Moderates,this is a great sub but here are some tips to get more people on your side  1 were all in agreement that the work week is much too long 40 hours is overkill  especially for people in the knowledge economy 2 more telecommuting options are needed there is no need to commute to an office five days a week anymore wake up fucking boomers theres this thing called the internet  now some of us expect to get living wages from minimum wage jobs that aint gonna happen sorry automation will just replace those jobs anyway eventually besides less than 3 of the total work force in the usa makes minimum wage jobs source bls so it isnt this massive block of people making crappy wages  to get more people on your side you need less of the minimum wage whiners and more of the people making 60000100000 a year on your side  to do that you really need to focus on 1 and 2 above a lot of people including me love our jobs were just overworked and have outdated ways of doing work going to an office for example,e0l8a7

128,I need to rant about call centres,i absolutely killed myself working for a telecoms company i took pride in my work and pushed for the best stats in the place i got a badge for being top 100  not an actual monetary benefit   every time i peaked and hit a target they switched the goal posts and pushed me harder for the next threshold  there is no endgame no completion or reward they just squeeze and push you on repeat  my immune system was shattered by stress so i took some sick days to recover they put me in a room and had me justify the sicknesses infront of three managers they put me on a sickness stage which is essentially a disciplinary after weeks of hounding because i didnt want to take strong painkillers to get me back into work   i was micro managed to a ridiculous extent penalised for taking too many pee breaks basically forcing me into a state of permanent dehydration i was placed in an evaluation where i again had to justify the amount of times a day i urinate these meetings play out like police interrogations   any sort of career progression involves being a manager on secondment this is something id never heard of before working there what it essentially means is you are a manager with all of the responsibilities but none of the pay you do the exact same job as managers youve got all these desperate people wanting a better wage absolutely killing themselves for the title theyre taking their work home with them living and breathing the company in the hopes of getting paid for what theyre already doing i knew secondment managers that hadnt been offered the actual job for 5 years   the company would fend us off against other call centres in stat competitions and reward us for winning they gave us little packets of haribo one year they put a ferris wheel in the carpark theyd give us a spin on a roulette wheel for transferring to sales 1 in 10 chance of a 2 minute break        im just so sick of being treated like a fucking child with these pseudo rewards so they dont have to fork out for any meaningful rewardsynolike money or being fairly paid for the work you do  the absolute worst thing of all is the people around me eat this shit up they love it youre taught to think youre some sort of grinch if you dont play along with a smile on your face if you dont take the overtime when asked youre considered a maverick  and the long term managersholy shit the personality types they hire for these positions are uniform these small people who milk situations of hierarchy and a minuscule amount of power for all its worth you can tell they relish their position because it gives them the opportunity to talk to you poorly   i managed to get out of there and into a more traditional office job where they treat you like an adult but to all my brothers and sisters still in the trenches please know that you come first   your mental and physical well being must be a priority they will make you feel guilty and shame you into pushing past your own boundaries just because they did the same dont let them normalise this toxic awful culture they dont care about you,dzgrjk
129,The Belmont School,ampx200b  born to a family in americas lower middle class i worked my way through a bachelors in mathematics for whatever reason i had loads of trouble finding internships throughout university i got one but it was volunteer the work was good i was helping organize bee farms in a village in africa but as i needed money i couldnt dedicate much to that i had to work i worked in restaurants and did manual labor mostly after i graduated i still couldnt find meaningful read high paying andor interesting so i got a job with a moving company moving things  it was here that i felt the most horrible reality i had ever had to face so far in my life it was here i realized no matter how much i worked no matter how much i studied no matter how much i appreciated the world and culture that i would never be able to leave my caste i was set far behind from the bourgeoisie and i was low class end of story this moving company allowed me to feel the full weight of that  one saturday the crew and i had to empty a high end private elementary school in a very wealthy town i got there about 6am with my team and we started emptying it out people started showing up for whatever reason there were two ways we were looked at by the people within the establishment 1 with pity 2 with disgust it was plainly obvious that we were different first of all our group was a motley one varying races and ethniccultural backgrounds i mean our masters on the other hand were entirely white the older women who looked at us almost uniformly did it with pity and they even attempted to tip us personally i find that extremely degrading so i was put in a horribly bad mood already almost all the men and many of the middleaged women looked at us with disgust almost as if they did not recognize us as human i should mention at this point that the vast majority of folks here did not even notice us or ignored us this is a fairly small minority of people i am talking about with disgustpity i say this because at least three of us were almost hit by cars as though we were rodents in the way of their escalades in the parking lot   the day was wearing on and we were all exhausted i became almost physically ill when the manager of our company came and brownnosed the super of the school and i even heard him apologize for some of the mens appearance i was appalled and disgusted now it is about ninetyfive degrees and i am exhausted i start walking back towards the cigarette scented semi that took me here when i hear something very nice it was part of mozarts 40th symphony neither the tonality nor musicality was there but i love art pretty much always it was very refreshing after a day of work to hear the piece i fell into the gravitational field of the music and wandered closer unconsciously finally i saw a bunch of children playing the piece with a woman probably in her fifties conducting it i watched for a few moments and went from happy to hear the music to completely dejected it was as though i had become awakened from a dream i realized in that moment i could not be like them i love their music i love their art i love their easy lifestyle i desperately want to have their educations and opportunities but right then i realized that those things arent for me they are for them i am a utility i help their communities run i do the work they dont want to and what do i get for it i get ignored i get pitied i remembered all the times i spoke to people above my caste oh wow you know schoenberg i am very surprised or the most memorable one i believe that even people like you could achieve in an elite university the realization crushed me with an immense weight almost making me drop to my knees  i have never felt more worthless or hopeless than in that moment i wept when i got home until i fell asleep when i woke up i went to the next job  postscript  this was written about a year ago i would like to raise everyones spirits a bit with an update i still cant find work and now my student loans are due also as a result of the nature of my work i have a severe back injury as well as nerve and muscle damage in my thumb hope that this post brings everyone up ,dzpp61

132,From “The Glass Escalator Revisiting: Gender Inequality in Neoliberal Times” by Christine Williams,however upbraiding these jobs may not be in the interests of all women i do not assume that the women at the top of the occupational pyramid share common cause with the women at the bottom any more than men do it exxonmobil corporate headquarters in houston for example janitors who currently am 835 an hour are fighting for a pay raise of course because of the neoliberal work organization they dont actually work for exxonmobil they work for cleaning subcontractors who bid on temporary contracts to provide cleaning services and who employ lesions of women workers on an as needed basis consequently the spokesperson for exxonmobil can claim that his company doesnt have anything to do with the low wages paid to janitors who clean their offices but there is no question that the immense profits of the oil and gas industry and the high pay of the geoscientists who work for it come from squeezing the workers on the bottom outsourcing temporalizing and shifting risk onto workers is the essence of the neoliberal business model  for these reasons i believe that feminist demands for gender equality in the workplace are not enough to women janitors deserve to be treated the same as men janitors yes of course they do but they also deserve more than 835 an hour which will not happen unless their employers are forced to pay them more that is why a critique of capitalism must accord any our critique of gender inequality his is my new feminist agenda for the sociology of work  his new agenda is in fact at least 40 years old hardening back to the socialist feminist of the 1970s that agenda has been lost in recent years overcome by what fancy fraser has called the feminist romance with capitalism 2009 110 his is the idea that womens emancipation requires their entry into paid work his idea has been used to motivate women around the world to seek dignity and equality in the labor marketeven though for the vast majority of women paid work is son anonymous with extreme exploitation and family hardship feminist school as rightly criticize womens economic dependency on men and the evaluation of womens daring labor in the home but we must not ignore the fact that the alternative can be just as bad capitalists rely on womens unpaid work in the home to reproduce the labor force and they exploit womens labor to generate enormous profits in effect they have had passed the dream of womens liberation to the engine of capitalist act emulation feminist have been implicit with this insular as we endorse the model of competitive individuals in the marketplace for women collins and layer 2010 eisenstein 2010 i now believe that a feminist  his content download from 128119168112 on due 01 act 2019 072717 utc clause subject fo itsabout just orgterms  626 gender  society  october 2013  that is divorced from a critique of capitalism will only make things worse for most women  the glass escalator explains the advantages that straight white men receive in professional jobs in traditional work organizations because it analyze male privilege without critiquing capitalist exploitation it loses sight of the diminishing rewards available to most workers it may be time to retire the concept he need new metaphor to explain gender inequality in our neoliberal age ,dzdusn

137,Employment Agencies Where You Are?,hello there im from australia and im very much underemployed so ive been at an employment agency for several months now and my god theyre so inefficient and almost perfectly not helpful   our government is run by the liberal party who are our right wing conservatives and i know that our job agencies use public money to make profits for private companies  luckily the whole place seems to be moving into an onlineonly model  which sucks for the workers there but at least i wont have to come in every single day to fill out pointless sheets and look for jobs under their supervision  what theyve got people doing is this you have an obligation to apply for a set number of jobs per month  i was on 20 but its been lowered to 11 for the time being theyve got a lot of us to come in every day monday to friday and spend about 3 hours  basically cold calling employers  what sort of approach is this employers must hate it they also promise to get us all the licenses and qualifications we need but very often theyll just tell us to not bother because we dont have a job lined up  its clear the whole system is purposely designed to demoralize and demonize job seekers to make them so fed up with it all that they stop coming to appointments and then get their welfare payments cut i used to think that places like this where just inefficient and broken in the way that lots of places just are because people are stupid but damn im now fully aware that the inefficiency and cruelty is built into the system the liberal party hates poor people and is actively punishing them with cruel systems like our job agencies     rant over i was just wondering what the employment agencies are like where youre from are they the same better worse  cheers,dylfp4

146,Am I in some kind of nightmare?,the adult working environment will be looked back at with amazement one day in the future if there is a longterm future ive been to many job interviews recently talking to my interviewers youd think they werent even human maybe lizard people do exist they were all cold brainwashed by this system known as capitalism ill never forget the demented look in their eyes no sense of humor or humanity 100 self centered ive not heard from either of them i think their senses told them deep down im not that interested it feels like everyone is obsessed with a fake social hierarchy rather than seeing the benefit of individual traits everyone has their strengths we evolved this way i would never call someone my boss or my manager  how can you claim someone is your boss to use the word of conservative suck ups yes that makes you the biggest cuck of all in the animal kingdom  everyone says this is the best time to be alive just because capitalism is at its peak and the world is economically better off than it was 50 years ago it doesnt mean were better off in fact people have never been more unhappy suicide rates are at their highest levels look at the proportion of people in the west taking antidepressants whilst money is a more efficient tool than barter its a human invention and makes up only a tiny part of life yet its all people care about no one has time for anyone just their own greed so they can consume more things that supposedly make happy when it reality it makes them miserable and unhealthy people use sorry but im at work as an excuse to get out of everything but can you blame them because i understand its exhausting wearing a fake corporate mask all day around people who wouldnt be phased if you died working a lot doesnt make you a hero it makes you a sad sheep stop bragging about all the overtime you worked when i look around most people arent healthy look at the deadness in their eyes the blackness underneath they have to take stimulants just to keep going downing multiple coffees throughout the day drinking alcohol at the weekend to mask their pain  consumerism strongly goes against the evolution of humans it kills our morality and opposes our natural requirements of good health you cant be healthy working all the time in most jobs family and community maybe there is something wrong with me but ive never been interested in consuming plastic junk what do i need it for it doesnt make me happy expensive products just are a burden and a liability   with the technology and scientific understanding we have we could constantly strive for perfection but people always have to be doing something interfering with and destroying their surroundings heres a beautiful river lets purchase a loud boat to spew out diesel fumes into the water and effect the whole ecosystem isnt this beautiful thats a nice forest let me burn these trees down and cover it in concrete dont you love my home we no longer live amongst the natural environment we live fighting against it there is no peace or silence ever simplicity is better once men used to be just hunters instead theyll scam their neighbor just for money  when i sit at standstill in traffic i cannot help but think in what way are we benefiting the world as we are at the moment were a major burden in so many ways casting pain and fear throughout planet earth most jobs dont benefit humanity at all they go against it noise pollution unhealthy chemicals are pumped out of their metal boxes breathed in by the same people cities were designed for cars not walking cars that are paid for and maintained by the employee just so they can get to work theres always only one person in each car how is that supposedly efficient or sustainable as capitalism tells us  the poorest countries in the world have the lowest suicide rates out of all countries the evidence is there if neoliberalism is the most effective system then how come im at my happiest when i have nothing when i walk through the forest is the only time im truly happy  im not against all work just work in the way it is now many jobs need not exist at all a lot of people spend their time just pretending to look busy society would be much better off if we worked for the best interests of the future of the planet for humanity rather than soulless corporations if people followed the laws of science of nature of whats best for all of us we could develop in a healthy and sustainable way  the problem is everyone just goes along with it without question they even enjoy it spouting nonsense and lies fed to them by advertisements and the media since birth sucking on the feet of the wealthy voting against their own interests in the hope one day they will be rich the media is obsessed with identity politics divide and conquer has never gotten old and has never been more effective  id rather die than live in this mess count me out,e0ffpf

my life i studied a lot and got very good grades my classmates called me a nerd there were two main reasons for which i dedicated myself to study 1 to have more days of vacation and 2 to achieve my dreams since i was a small child ive dreamed of moving abroad some times it would be america other times the uk other times canada and a few times japan im from brazil btw all my life ive lived in fear i cant leave the door of my house and go for walk unless i want to be robbed i cant use headphones in the parking lot of the mall unless i want to attract the eyes of robbers the mere sight of a motorcycle on a street sends shivers down my spine stories of burglaries and robberies are something i hear often from acquaintances and ive experienced it directly since ive been robbed once thats why ive always wanted to escape from all that shit i didnt want to live in constant fear for the rest of my life i dont think thats a life with dignity i thought if i studied and worked hard enough id be able to move to an idyllic place where id live a happy and fulfilling life surrounded by great people   my energy was sucked by school but i was still satisfied because i was always looking forward to the next holiday the next winter break and in the more distant future a happy life in a place i loved my mental health started deteriorating in my sophomore year of hs i had to go biking twice a week at night to clear my mind of all the stress it was hard but i kept moving forward when the time came to choose my future path i chose computer science i liked coding and the idea of having a highpaying job in california sounded nice to me  my first semester in college was pretty cool i had more free time than when i was in hs and i liked the subjects i was studying then things started to change it became much more demanding and i started hating my life it wears me down every day that i have to go to those dulllooking classrooms and watch lectures for 6 hours sucks my life energy a bit more i spend my weekdays thinking of my weekends which i mainly use for studying and doing assignments but they make me feel a lot better than going every single day to college fortunately whenever im feeling completely worn out i can simply miss classes i dont need to explain to anyone why i missed because its our right to miss 25 of all the class hours in a semester thats what keeps me sane   and then it struck me some time ago im not going to have this luxury when i start working i wont work for just 6 hours every day ill work 8 hours i only have 4 days of class per week but that numbers going to increase to 6 when i start working fulltime i wont have 4 months of vacation per year ill only have 1 thats assuming i live in brazil if i move to america its going to be half that number i wont be able to simply miss work whenever i want ill have to justify it every time and i know ill feel guilty and afraid of calling in sick when i get sick   this leaves very little time for the things that make us humans happy and healthy exercise either squeeze it in the morning and neglect sleeping or do at night when youre exhausted from spending the entire day working sunlight better get used to spending 57 of your life not seeing the sun socializing the best youll get is hanging out with your friends on sunday with each passing hour weighing on your mind as you get closer and closer to monday   work is not sunshine and rainbows like i thought it was its actually the complete opposite of it i hear adults saying it all the time i thought i had it bad in hs until i went to college then i thought i had it bad in college until i started working now i understand why i look at the fulltime working adults around me and maybe im wrong none of them looks really happy they either look like tired all the time or stressed all the time some of them keep their sanity by thinking of retirement but the thought of spending my entire life unhappily surviving until i can retire at 65 is frankly depressing  no matter where you live even if its not a crimeridden shithole like the one i live thats a miserable existence  i found this sub yesterday and im thankful that there are other people who arent being fooled by the lies they feed us every day now it makes me even more sick in the stomach when i hear people like my dad who have miserable lives singing praises to capitalism and spewing the bullshit they watch on youtube farright channels   the worst thing ive realized is that all my hard work was in vain i cant believe society led me to believe being a corporate slave was a dream worth pursuing i wasnt any wiser than the people who spent their teenage years having fun in the end were all going to end up equally miserable   i guess now this realization will haunt me for the rest of my life that im putting all my talent and energy into making a rich person richer and destroying my mental health in the process this isnt right,dz7yk2

243,"I recently quit my job because it was destroying my mental health, but even in my final week the company found another reason to convince me that leaving was the right thing.",my job didnt used to be so bad the work itself wasnt too taxing or too boring the people were nice the money was good and the office was only a 10 minute commute from my house but over the years the company decided to implement rounds of voluntary redundancies in order to cut costs so you can see exactly where this is going fewer people to do the same amount of work so everyone had to pick up extra workload and take on additional responsibilities in order to pick up the slack for the same amount of money naturally as a result of all this the company became obsessed with productivity management so it became a world of stats targets performance monitoring everything that you did being constantly recorded and scrutinised etc etc im the sort of person who takes pride in their work and that attitude eventually started to get me in trouble the company didnt want people taking the time to do things right they wanted people to just churn out reams of complete garbage in order to satisfy their completely arbitrary and everchanging targets couple that with the fact that i cant stand working with someone figuratively looking over my shoulder all the time so their drive for maximising productivity had the complete opposite effect for me the more pressure i was under to hit targets the more stressed and less effective i became when i started at the company my productivity was fine but after years of these changes it ended up in the toilet  this eventually led to me having to take a total of 9 months off work in the last 2 years due to what it was doing to my mental health and ultimately led me to handing in my notice i feel relieved at having left but also guilty im leaving behind a lot of good people whore in the same situation as me battling with stressdepressionanxiety and regularly having to take time off as a result but who cant quit because they have more responsibilities supporting their families etc to think about it sucks  so thats my rant but what did the company do in my final week as its last fuck you well my manager was off on one of her many holidays that week and it was decided that someone else needed to be in charge in the interim because obviously we couldnt be trusted to get on with things by ourselves now on my team there were about a dozen people with 5 of us each having over a decades experience of the job myself included so who did they put in charge thats right they chose the temp the guy whod been there for 3 months i know what youre thinking that thats insane but dont worry its ok apparently his family are very good friends with our director of business services so im sure that hes got a bright future ahead of him at the company i even heard that he and the director had started playing golf together so thats nice in fact its quite incredible how well family friends do there and if your surname happens to be the same as someone else higher up youre pretty much guaranteed to rise through the ranks hmm  but now thankfully i dont have to put up with that bullshit anymore at least until i get a job somewhere else and have to deal with whatever dysfunction that particular company has looking forward to it,dxquc4

253,The struggle to date in this hellscape we call society,my antiwork persona and overall disdain for the chore of the modern day existence was what caused my previous relationship to crumble my lover unfortunately had to field constant questions from her older brother and other respected family members about my unwillingness to work full time and also my comfort in making just enough to get by i made enough to support my small hobbies of cooking playing video games going to movies playing park basketball hiking and smoking that good denver grass my relationship was one of stories of old we were best friends all through our high school years and both attended our local community college and remained close this developed to full scale lovers through the natural love we held for each other once she moved states away once the questions started to come down about my direction in life seeing that i wasnt going to university because i refused to take on the debt she would defend me and take my side but during my brief period as a pizza delivery driver even she mentioned not feeling good about having to tell others what i did for a living i told her how hurt i was because i thought she saw through that useless identifier and how i thought of myself as so much more than a pizza delivery driver her older brother was also our roommate so it uncomfortable him taking issue with my lifestyle and never having the balls to say it to my face instead just preaching to my love about how it was eventually going to get old a majority of this time my girlfriend worked 40 hours in the kitchen at a restaurant downtown which was badass as a lady and meanwhile i was putting in around 25 as a banquet server and this did not sit well with him even though i made enough for rent and my immediate priorities eventually the stress and anxiety it was putting me through would have me leaving the house for no reason at all driving aimlessly or sitting in my car for hours pretending to have more going on than i did because otherwise they her brother and his fiance would silent judge me for not maximizing my time to the capitalist definition wasting time on a video games or watching basketball im somebody who has put a lot of time and effort into my spiritual and intellectual growth so this weighed a lot on my soul to be so heavily misunderstood i want to be a positive giving light of a person and this feeling of being unequal because of my financials became too much to bear i left and me and my girlfriend grieved the situation recognizing me going back home and finishing my associates would be better for my longterm capabilities and after getting in a car accident  losing my job i really had no other choice eventually after being given the space and succumbing to inadequacy of a long distance relationship she broke it off with me and neither of us have been entirely whole again in the year thats followed ive managed to successfully move out of my parents house again and got that associates degree and now work a full time job where i relocated to after that experience im in fear of dating ive yet to meet the woman who shares mindset like mine against the stupidity of modern societies work to live problem it makes me feel like ill be forever alone or forced to sacrifice myself this is a great tragedy as someone who considers deep love the best life has to offer but ive been hurt in various long term relationships because of my lifestyle anyway the point of this post is i just want deep love again im only 23 but meeting the right people just gets harder and harder do any of you antiworkers relate to this struggle,dw74mg

270,"Work Time, Live Time",antiwage labour piece from italian left communists   the battle in which the proletariat has been engaged for a couple of centuries to shorten the duration of the working day is part of the historical heritage of all humanity what today is normally considered a trade union claim among many is in reality one of the greatest achievements that our species will have to make the future man will not be content to simply increase the socalled free time but will eliminate from his own life those activities that most of the species have dedicated for millennia to a tiny fraction of themselves and in the specific capitalist mode of production exclusively to the enhancement of capital not only that but also the equally inhuman one that man dedicates to the realization of this value that is to the foolish consumption of goods of all kinds will be eliminated therefore the elimination of work time which today means unemployment will be a conquest of the proletariat not only for itself but for the whole human species   the objective prolongation of the working day has today different effects than in the past it no longer occurs in a backward world where masses of men are torn from the earth and sent to the factory where it is enough to increase the number of workers and make them work longer to increase surplus value today the many hours of work are accompanied by the introduction of very modern and scientifically organized production processes so an enormous amount of surplus value is obtained with double exploitation absolute and relative to produce longer and with machines and procedures that increase performance of work the immediate result is that productive work is increasingly concentrated on a few individuals while the rest of the population is dedicated to the useless work of immense social waste or simply remains unemployed  an increasingly high part of the world population is completely superfluous  and the adjective has nothing to do with chatter about demographic control in this society overpopulation is relative that is it is a surplus of humanity only in relation to the possibility of capital to use labor power the ratio between productive workers and unproductive mass is always given in percentage never in absolute figures of living men on the earths crust the question of the balance between the number of men and the space existing on the earth arises on our part according to completely different criteria than those of ecologists or followers of religions it is not a problem of absolute number or even of the relationship between man on the one hand and nature on the other but of a global vision that integrates man and nature in an inseparable whole as indeed it has been for millions of years and how it will still be with the use of greater future knowledge obviously every exponential growth ecologists or not is in contradiction over time with any mannature harmony   in his book the woman and socialism  bebel recalls the calculations of an austrian economist of the nineteenth century t hertzka who in his book the laws of social progress  proceeds to a very exact research on what was the working energy necessary to maintain the population of austria with the standard of living of the time the method used is that of calculating large aggregates average fertility is assumed for the entire cultivated countryside and sufficient food production is obtained by applying capital and laborpower to the land an average productivity is assumed for the whole industry and the production necessary for the entire population is obtained on which the work is distributed excluding women children and the elderly the result which is certainly realistic for the data available at the time is nevertheless surprising for those addicted to the capitalist propaganda of life dedicated to work every valid man would have to work an hour and a half a day for 300 days a year  of course hertzka who is only a national economist  as bebel says and certainly not a communist also takes into account the voluptuous needs of the most educated people  therefore he adds the production of luxury goods with the related employees bringing the overall result at two and a half hours a day  for 750 hours a year if we compare with the contractual 2400 of our postwar period or with the current 1900 we have the real measure of how increasingly the divinization of work in this society is increasingly aberrant otherwise so unwilling to the divine and rather devoted to the trivial  today the calculation of hertzka would take into account other parameters given the general better organization of work the socialization of production and the integration between the productive spheres due to the communications network then almost irrelevant above all it would take into account the fact that this is the era of major state interventions in the social field for which a certain distribution of labor is already effective although obviously based on criteria for safeguarding the production of surplus value and social cushioning   in france the law of 35 hours has been in force since january of this year it will be from january 2002 for companies with less than 20 employees but the possibilities to apply a longer timetable are such that in practice this law works more than anything else as a regulation for overtime but you only pay 10 more than ordinary hours the law is completely generic specifies nothing other than the field of application and tax relief for companies leaving all specific legislation to bargaining between industry and trade unions it is therefore not surprising that even before final approval there were many companies that applied the criteria of the law to come in advance with 2418300 workers already subject to the 35hour timetable that is about 30 of all those who they worked in companies with more than 20 employees it is even less surprising that the first practical effect of the law has been to make the exploitation of the workforce even more flexible through derogations from previous contracts  in germany there have been many reductions in local time the most notable of which is that of volkswagen where the time was lowered to 28 hours a week with a limited salary reduction that is not proportional to the hours cut many factories have adopted the 32 hours a week  the figures show that it is one thing to launch a social plan for the generalized reduction in hours another is to organize the latter within a factory while the french labor minister states that the 35hour law has produced 200000 new jobs for now volkswagen claims to have saved about 30000 as you can see there is a noticeable disproportion 200000 out of about 26 million french workers  076 and 30000 out of 250000 workers in the automobile factory  12 this means that the mechanism of time reduction can be better controlled with respect to the result within the perimeter of an organized unit such as industry which is able to scientifically plan the consequences rather than in the whole capitalist society by definition anarchic and unpredictable but above all it means that the industry is able to reabsorb when it wants every reduction of time obtained in exchange for the free hand in terms of flexibility  ampx200b

292,I’ve been lurking on this subreddit for a few days and this is what I have to say (rant/advice),i am very young still in college i will be graduating around spring 2021 and this subreddit has made me think quite a lot about where i want my life to go after graduation since childhood i have always been artistically minded loving to sing and dance and write and express myself however i could i have maintained that mindset to this day though with college i rarely take the time to hone my skills   and i have known since i was a teenager that i never ever ever ever wanted an office job cubicle job 9 to 5 deal whatever you want to call it i have said aloud many times that id rather be a waitress who works on music in her spare time or even homeless than work a desk job   my parents set me up from the beginning that being successful was the most important thing in the world and that is what they want fromfor me but their idea of success is quite different from mine theyre less strict than the typical parents youd think of but still prioritized my grades and success in classes over everything while hypocritically at the same time trying to tell me to pursue my singing and writing interests   i have dreams of being a singer making albums and touring and sharing my music with the world on top of that i have dreams of writing novels and tv scripts and movie scripts and sharing those with the world too   but guess what my major is russian yes russian the language i do like it a lot and am good at it but it has literally nothing to do with my true dreams i have literally no intention of getting a job in the translatorgovernment whatever the fuck russian field i will not do it i blatantly refuse because its not what i want  no one besides me knows this but since perusing this sub and seeing how miserable it is to be stuck in this workallday system i have decided i am going to join a commune after graduation i spent a lot of time yesterday going through many in several states and have bookmarked a few im interested in for further research i will do whatever it takes to join one of these and contribute to a community whose goals arent productivity and profit but rather reconnecting with nature and the natural world around us with other human beings taking time to actually breathe and go outside for once in a damn while it might sound hippy dippy but to me it also sounds like a dream come true   i see myself living on this commune doing physical labor in exchange for my shelter and just enjoying the sunshine and i have no problem with that and im a tiny physically weak girl whos lived in the suburbs nearly her whole life still id rather work on a farm with other individuals than work a desk job thats how terrified and disgusted i am with the work culture we have  i dont want my life to end up a dead end before it even starts i see myself living on a commune for maybe about a year working on the land and then coming inside to writesingmake instrumentalscookcleanmaybe even paint or draw even though im not very experienced with it no morning alarms no commute no fluorescent lighting replacing sunshine no meaningless slog whenever i get bored i can just pick up another hobbyinterest or go out to the field and work some more is it going to be utopia of course not i dont expect my life to suddenly become perfect but is it much better than any alternative i can think of absolutely   here is the site i used to look up communes httpswwwicorg  i see a lot of people saying they wish they could just pack up one day and leave and i think one way to do that would be to join a commune easier said than done of course but there are so many options out there and ways to earn money on the commune by working on the farmland or doing other tasks if anyone reading this finds the idea of joining commune interesting take some time to go on this site and research ones in your state or even in a state youd like to live in the site splits up the communes by many many factors so you can narrow your choices down by a lot keep in mind there are some communes that require membership fees and monthly fees to keep things running so if youre seriously considering this make sure you can scrape together the money if necessary i myself have to figure out how im going to do that as well   maybe im just a naive kid but having these communes bookmarked gives me some sense of hope that i dont have to run my life into the ground and i can take my time for myself and do whatever the hell i want instead of joining the traditional workforce the second im hot off the college graduation press i cant see many downsides to joining just for a year or two or even a few months and again maybe thats just my dreams clouding my judgment but i still think its worth some consideration hope this helps some of you thank you for reading my emotional word dump,dwcaku

420,What's the worst job you've ever had and why?,im not sure if this is the right subreddit but here goes  ill start i managed to land a job earlier this year and was impressed that i even managed to get a job to begin with after having spent 2 years trying to get one the job sounded pretty decent i get to maintain this small companys social media accounts and online presence as well as making them have a better rep cool  but boy was i wrong i had some experience with interviews since i went to university interviews and assumed that they were more or less the same as job interviews but for different situations but the interview i had for this job wasnt what i expected since they pretty much told me about the job rather than asking questions the boss didnt seem interested in me at all  anyway i somehow managed to get the job and was eager to start since i was finally able to get some sort of income as well as getting the all important work experience it started off okay i got some training on how to use some software and quickly got the hang of it thats when it started to go downhill that was the only training i got being trained in something so stupidly easy like learning how to use new software for the first time since it was my first job i wasnt sure if it was normal to get trained on one thing each month so i stuck with it i mastered that aspect and got bored quickly idk if its because i have adhd or because of how companies work in general so i asked to get training in other areas only for the guy training me to sarcastically and bluntly say its a workplace not school  so i spend the next couple of weeks doing nothing but mindlessly uploading content to their crappy website using that software i was trained to use trying to avoid doing it but also not getting caught for slacking at the same time i ask time and time again if i can get trained in other areas but the guy who trained me or was supposed to but didnt want to claims to be extremely busy which i kind of understood since it was a small business of about 10 people  fast forward to mid august my boss reappears after mysteriously going away on holiday to another country for about a month and tells me my performance was bad even though i asked to be trained in things other than uploading things to their site all day long i get ignored and i get told that im underperforming although i did every task that was set during my time at that awful place i was encouraged to ask for help so therefore i did only for the guy who was supposed to train me to say that i needed to understand things better despite the fact that they gave me vague and unclear instructions to begin with and this is why im reluctant to ask for help  all of this just to work full time i worked about 3035 hours a week and be paid a measly 390 an hour it was an apprenticeship with a legitimate provider and training was due to start in september not to mention that they cut my hours first they took off half an hour each day which meant i worked 65 hours rather than 7 then they did the same again which meant i worked 6 hours each day and reduced my wage from 460hr to 390hr during my first week there for no reason at all i lasted 6 weeks there got sacked in the end but im glad to be out of there since i managed to get to go to university instead and that was pretty much my summer down the drain but hey at least i got work experience and money although ive pretty much spent it all on places where ive had to spend money ie food rent etc  ampx200b  tldr  i worked 3035 hours a week for just over a month this past summer for below the minimum wage they told me it was an apprenticeship and that training was due to start in september doing nothing but uploading items to a small companys website and getting sacked for poor performance although i did the best i could not the best experience for a first job but im guessing first jobs are like that,duxm3w

424,Year 11 in the teaching profession. Just some thoughts.,how school creates workers school was created to produce workers the bells that signal class changes were put in place to help children get accustomed to the bells that signaled break or shift changes in factories and other industrial settings ive taught in three countries and only one korea didnt come out and say that our job is to produce taxpayers and korea may well have if i wasnt just their guest english teacher we claim to teach critical thinking when what we mostly do is socialize them to comply with authority as the authority in my room i choose to be honest with them in that were all in the same boat we all have to be here i have to be here because my husband and i both have severe illnesses and live in a heartless country that requires that at least one of us works for health insurance and they have to attend school until they are 18 by law or lose their drivers license in a rural state with 0 transit which means no independence etc   im in a posiiton to help students think about how things are and how they can be we read a lot of orwell but last march i started having seizures ive had 3 in less than 6 months and got news a couple of days ago that my eeg is abnormal so it seems its something i will always have to deal with my most recent seizure occured at school during school yet i was left by myself to roam the building and parking lot alone for nearly 2 hours until a police officer found me and called an ambulance the 400 dollar bill for that 15 minute ride is sitting on my coffee table and i do not plan to pay it   self care is the answer nope this is another aspect of capitalism lets make people miserable to the point that they think the only thing that will help them is to consume our products and media i have been given a written warning about my absences in spite of the fact that they were all related to either my or my husbands well documented medical issues edit forgot to finish this thought missing this work means we are out of paid leave and we dont have money or time for self care  can a job kill you i guess im going to find out i thought it was just the school the district the state dont get me wrong they all suck beyond understanding but places i applied to vegas nashville a few others paid more but the clark county school district where vegas is went on strike the first week of school so its hard to imagine myself doing this job in a non shitty environment i am desperately looking for other work online teaching higher ed etc people with education degrees are downright fucked since nobody really wants to consider us for anything outside of our field ive considered going back to school for a medical billing and coding certificate but i dont know it is probably my best bet particularly since my goal is to someday work from home but i have 0 savings and would have to somehow obtain additional student loans to complete the program   on life i feel 30 years older than i am my marriage has suffered my relationships with family and friends has suffered i cant afford a vacation i can barely afford a night out and even if i could my husbands coping mechanism gets in the way heavy drinking   if i had a chance to do it all over again well its hard to say in a world that is ran by capitalism ideally we would have a basic income and universal healthcare and i would go back to my loves of writing and singing i would have the chance to spend more time with my family and help my ailing mother and husband i could get the treatment i need to have a child or be able to adopt a child without thousands of dollars   but for now here i am im just sad and tired and wanted to get some stuff out and i figured you guys would get it sorry that its long and thanks to anyone who read i hope everyone has as good a day as they can in this capitalist hellhole,dszq5b

460,Life kinda sucks...,i find it devastatingly sad that we spend about 13 of our lives asleep another 13 working a job we dont like so we can afford to live in a house and drive a car to the job we work to afford the house we arnt at all day the other 13 of the day is spent doing maintenance work and reestablishing for the next day over and over until you die there has to be more than just brief moments of happiness and distraction there has to be more to actual life right,dspx4l

466,Just need support,hello all  so for most of my life ive been unemployed or semi employed that has had it ups and its downs i have never made enough to support myself with these odd and random jobs ive had help from my family  recently i left the us i was just tired of the extra extra extra bad shit so i came to europe where supposedly workers have more rights and better treatment  it is true that in general there are more benefits here and by benefits i mean health insurance sadly that doesnt translate into actual healthy work environments work is just as toxic here as in the us  in order to stay where i am i need to have a job it is a work visa after all i have been unemployed for a while but found something that allows me to stay  sadly this job like most of ky other jobs is bottom of the barrel yes im supposedly a qualified professional of some kind but i hate it  i mean i really dont get how work is supposed to be fullfiling idk what need is filled by having a screaming boss and a business that wants your 24 hour attention  still i want to stay here rather then the us i hate the us so much in the end often i think the only way to be allowed to exist and not be forced to exploited at work is to die  it is legit the only solution no job here means being deported and i wont have any life in the us its a shame   i suppose many other feel this way and it sucks becuase then there is no chance to enjoy whatever things might be good on planet earth  that plus deep personal issues make it hard to want to exist its the worst situation now ill have to try and hold on for another month so maybe i can get a different visa type and just work a few hours   im so sad not angry not deeply depressed just sad and resigned to a faith as bad as death with no real solution   i do wish i knew if someone really enjoys work they like to wake up at 7am go to sleep at 9 stay in a chair all day and spend decades of existence in that holding pattern,dt1y11

473,"How come most of society is so willfully ignorant, does time just beat us into complacency?",i mean im a 26 year old male i got my workers permit at 1415 and worked ever since but over these last few years it kind of hit me harder than ever the pressure of what the fuck am i doing with my life one may call it a quarter life crisis its almost as if we are born and forced into a life that almost everything depends on this magical thing called money that spins all of the developed world  i feel like almost 80 of jobs are monotonous and repetitive and you have to almost forcefully dumb yourself down to convince yourself youre making an impact  but like that impact for our quote on quote communities are people we dont even know strangers we have no connection to we evolved in deeply connected tribes where everyone you knew and mattered to you and was a part of your team even if you didnt like them now we all work with strangers are surrounded by strangers on a daily basis and it feels like everyone is simply out for their own to get head to make more money  i cant seem to see how older people who have been in the work force for so long dont stop and think what in the fuck am i doing my one life my one existence i spend half if not more sleeping working commuting preparing for the next day etc its like our own lives where we actually get to love laugh create relax be human is such a small portion of out actual one existence before we disappear into blackness and nothingness   ive worked in machine shops i recently got hired and quit my first day at a factory that madebottle caps fucking bottle caps plastic any free moment i had i would look up almost screaming for help internally at all the people who seemed content satisfied even proud to be there a good ol fashioned hard worker which to me seems like an adaptation people had to make in order to live with themselves doing back breaking work for shit pay literally the job was working a line where this machine spit out bottle caps so fast you couldnt see them and it never stopped on break someone had to replace you you couldnt stop just bagging boxes taping them labeling them putting them on a pallet and trying to keep up with the conveyor as the boxes kept filling i stopped in the moments i could looking at my fellow humans some old some youngjust likewhat the fuck are we doing we are replaceable robots filling boxes with caps but unfortunately this type of work is a commonplace for many so we leave exhausted to do it again tomorrow to hardly get by on our bills only to have a day or two off to sleep and do it again   so people ask why are we all on anti depressants why is mental illness so fucking rampant why is suicide so sky rocketed why are there mass shooters why does everyone look for escaping in drugs and alcohol  i think from this post alone you know exactly why  how can we be aware of our own demise our own death and spend so much time just trying to simply survive are people just blissfully ignorant to the system we are apart of  the funny thing is this is all new industrialization is so new couple hundred generations  for millions of years we existed in a much different way we are living against our own nature it is making us sick  and you reader me writer this is our one life our one experience on earth and its spent stressed worried working ourselves exhaustedjust to live  fuck me  can anyone relate,dst4nw

481,"A conversation about work, wealth, and morality.",so ive been rolling this around in my head a lot lately and i dont have all that many people in my life that seem willing to consider the idea id like to ask the good people at rantiwork since we seem to be of similar philosophy  its probably going to be long so dont feel bad if you dont read it if you do read it im honestly looking for your feedback and thoughts on it and awaaaaaay we go  christopher columbus landed in the americas in the year 1492 so well use the last day of that year as a starting point it has been 192425 days since that date if you started working on december 31 1492 and you made 5000 dollars a day every day without a single day off youd have 96212500000 usd to put that in context if you made 5 grand a day every day for the last 527 years youd still be worth less than 1100th of jeff bezos you wouldnt even be a billionaire  so it is apparent from that alone that work in the traditional modern sense of the word is not the way to aquire wealth  so why should we aquire wealth well to quote wallace d wattles  a person develops in mind soul and body by making use of things and society is so organized that man must have money in order to become the possessor of things therefore the basis of all advancement must be the science of getting rich the object of all life is development and everything that lives have an inalienable right to all the development it is capable of attaining a persons right to life means to have the free and unrestricted use of all things which may be necessary to his fullest mental spiritual and physical unfoldment or in other words his right to be rich  if we are to adhere to this philosophy from the work the science of getting rich which for this post at least we are going to then we can infer two things   1 a society that inhibits the acquisition of wealth for the majority of its population also inhibits the mental spiritual and physical growth of its population and 2 the penultimate goal for that population should be to aquire as much wealth as possible among as many people as possible in order to maximize their own mental spiritual and physical growth because the alternative is to accept a life of controlled mediocrity enacted by the money making elite  so at this point weve established a few points that are important to the conversation that working will not make you rich that not being rich is an alienation of your potential that you deserve to be rich and feel all its benefits that the system is rigged to keep you from being rich and acceptance of that system is acceptance of failure to reach your potential  i feel it important at this point to mention from empirical evidence that the system is indeed rigged i know many people my age late 20s with college degrees some are bartenders some baristas some carpenters you want to know the one thing they all have in common not one of them is using their degree for employment i know many retirees who paid their taxes and did their time and now struggle to stay afloat off of their social security allotments you know the one thing they all have in common not one of them has enough money to live their golden years in comfort your degree wont get you a job and even if it does your job wont make your retirement comfortable and one day youll be writing a food budget and realize you wasted it all they lied to you and you bought it and now your life is gone and they didnt even pay you well enough to retire right and they got away with it  so this has all been the preamble to the actual subject of the post  to get rich in a 2019 capitalist landscape it appears that one must sacrifice their sense of right and wrong good and bad and look only at one metric profit and loss i say this meaning to say that should you be writing books or making music or acting you will not meet success until your product or service is one that people will buy this means that more often than not the moral standpoint is not the selling point of a person or service to reference bezos again look at the working conditions of his warehouses straight up unfiltered slavery and so many people know this yet so many of us still order frivolities with one day shipping from amazon the morality of the company is less important than the convenience of its service   as more evidence watch stock prices when a large company like gm rolls back benefits to its employees thousands of people losing health insurance at a job theyve worked for decades obviously a moral deficit but it makes the companys numbers better so stock prices invariably rise wealth being generated by the disenfranchisement of the working class the economy in action  what this means is doing the right thing for people is not going to make you rich doing the right thing for money will and therein lies the moral ambiguity  i find it of utmost importance to free myself and as many others as i can from the grips of salary slavery but to do so would be to sacrifice my conscience the stocks that make money are often not the stocks that hold a moral high ground the products that sell often encourage the masses to remain small stay high and drunk and have sex so they never see the part theyre playing in a system working against them and to top it all off the goal seems so insurmountable that i often lose hope it can be achieved and the only motivation ive found that has any real staying power is greed   my greed tells me to win no matter the cost lives might be ruined but others will be saved it tells me the only way to win is to play the game that the only way to make an omelette is to break some eggs   but were not talking about eggs were talking about human suffering in countries around the world where the poor get poorer as the rich get richer but to really enact change i first must become unimaginably wealthy but to become unimaginably wealthy i must first play part in the game that so direly needs to change and no matter the motivation those who have not been fortunate enough to be guided by a burning and undying greed they will hate me   this all comes up because i see a path now i know how to do it develop products and services that people will buy invest in stocks that make money innovate with ideas make my money make money and do all of this without any regard for others as long as im looking at that one all important metric profit and loss and it can be done by any of us all we have to do is develop products that will sell sell them invest the money rinse and repeat regardless of your current condition or circumstance you can do it too find a gap in a market fill it reinvest in that formula lies the potential for exponential growth  but it also means investing in companies that profit off of  tragedy the ones who make money on cancer the ones who experience growth after mass shootings the ones who steal healthcare from employees and guard their bottom line before anything else the system is inherently evil and regardless of the motivation doesnt knowingly playing part in it make one evil as well  if youre still here i really appreciate your time and id love to hear your thoughts tell me what im missing fill in my blind spots ive found myself a moral paradox that i cant seem to unravel on my own power,drp66s

600,quick note I've been dying to make for ages,im not a fool  i dont think every single mcdonalds franchise is raking it in hand over frickin fist and paying their workers peanuts though certainly im sure every fast food worker is drastically underpaid and is indeed paid peanuts that part actually is true i know often enough namely in food the profit margin can be about 6 if that or even 1 in groceries but when they have so many stores etc that theyre still doing 2 billion in profit at freaking grocery stores some of that 2 billion absolutely needs to go to the workers   this of course is saying nothing of the absurdly profitable disgustingly marked up products from apple and nike the furniture industry at large and so on  corporations do seem to have a stranglehold on this economy and it gets my gut and haunts and chills the hell out of me when i read the profit the top few corporations make versus the puny paltry number of people they employ im a lucky jerk whos somehow someway treading water for the second but i guess your only hope is to get yer butt to a big city with actual job prospects and be employed by merely a small business tyrant instead of corporate stooge thats my big hope for myself anyway shrug,dq4415

611,The extent of brainwashing,should i just give up today i had a chat with my mother about post graduation plans and its been making me feel worse than ive already been feeling  firstly a bit of background for myself family wise i come from a lower middleclass neighborhood with nigerian immigrant parents incomewise my father is muddle class as a self employed attorney  and my mother is very much working class as a permanent substitute teacher and parttime retail associate im a minority black though i dont like thinking about people in such arbitrary and useless classifications  my father is a abusive man both physically and mentally to practically everyone he meets myself and my sister were typically subject to beatings and insults whenever we didnt behave in a way that he found acceptable and he sometimes had huge arguments with my mother my mother used to join him in his abuse though in a lighter scale but ever since an incident long story short mother had a medical hernia bill that needed to be paid father started getting angry that she didnt get a job with health insurance for the family hes self employed so he didnt have insurance he then started talking down to my mother for making a pitiful wage as a substitute teacher to which my mom replied that she spent most of her years as a stay at home mom making sure that the house was in order my fathers nightly meals were cooked and that the children were looked after the argument ended with my father threatening a divorce this happened 8 years ago to this day hes still in this house because he doesnt want to go through the financial hell that divorce courts would put him through so he simply moved to another room in the house my mother started putting her focus more on her children and basically started being a lot more supportive of me and my sister especially me since feels that im impacted the worst by my father though she stills has her quirks inherited from her culture like expecting me to say good morning to him even though my father and i have not been on speaking terms since i was 16 due to another incident she herself still greets my father despite their separated status i now have a decent positively leaning relationship with my mother though im eternally frustrated at the fact that she cant see what i believe i see  school wise im now in the final year of university majoring in music the problems with the education system itself make this barely tolerable but honestly i went to college because of high school propaganda and parental pressure 18 year old me practically believed that the world would end if he didnt go to college not realizing my mistake i dont know how i did this considering i really went through a lot of hell just to graduate high school antiauthoritarianism started manifesting within me skipping classes having to be sent to counselors for oppositional defiant disorder or whatever etc rowdy students that tend to be a feature of disadvantaged communities etc back in high school i was kept sane by my feelings of belonging to a music group among others as well as my blindness to how the world worked   throughout my college years i by means of continuously growing daily bullshit was more or less forced to see our society for the absolute mess that it is for the first two years i went to community college now normally i should be debt free but of course my naive younger self took on debt to try and cover the costs of selfpublishing a book that i wanted to write because of that and university tuitiondorming costs i will graduate with a debt of around 35k my goal back then was to make a lot of money though im not sure i truly understood why even back then i utterly despised the educational system its one of the traits of my novels protagonist though back then i only thought about the restrictive feeling of school and i wasnt as acutely aware of the economic system that practically needed school to work capitalism however back then i was alarmingly materialistic my plans were to become a super rich author and buy cars and jet planes and such things i wasnt quite aware why i wanted these things because clearly theyre far beyond what i valued now though now i believe that my past materialism as well as peoples current materialism is because of the social respect associated with having things being the analytical person i am i feel like i can understand why with the soul crushing 5 day 40 hour work week my mother sporadically works depending on what her two jobs demand and my father typically works 12 hours 6 days a week we cant settle for social fulfillment by being things hobbies talents so we have to settle for having things and an entire culture of materialism grew from that i suppose interestingly my plans towards owning the expensive vehicles were mostly to just pilotdrive them on my own which kind of makes me realize that at the very least my will to pilot planes is genuine though now i can think of better ways to achieve this   everything thing changed when i transferred to university some top ranked state school in ny i felt completely alienated from the people around me i felt like they grew up in lives and backgrounds that i could never begin to understand of course it doesnt help that ive been encountering rich chinese students every now and then with their fancy clothes and cars while other people worldwide are struggling im in school because belief that i need it for a better future and theyre practically here for fun dont ask me how anyone could see school as fun but i guess that when you grow up with a lot of money you can find a way to make anything fun i suppose i dont have any friends here to this day it feels like every day here some new thing would bring me in a worse mood and i would be continuously and endlessly trying to analyze why much analyzing and an existential crisis and depression later i deduced that all the problems that i feel exist in my life can be traced back to capitalism eventually as i started to think about my future i started regretting choices that i wasnt aware that i made when i was fourteen i started regretting not being a top student since 14 so that i could get a scholarship to go to an aviation college so that i wouldnt have to suffer more after graduation i started feeling guilty for daring to try and find peace in my rough childhood with video games and music as my hobbies instead of studying to get good grades i think about my future life and i realize that theres not hope for me since theres now that many jobs that id be willing to do currently my goal is to be an airline pilot one of the few jobs that i believe i could enjoy or at least tolerate but theres a massive barrier to entry in the form of 80100k for training the only way i can make the money needed for that is to have an income from a corporate job thats all i imagine i can do given my useless major though i feel better when i remind myself that most computer science jobs are still corporate helljobs so that i can have a high enough income for the loan or paying it directly however assuming that the cards are right that i can live with my parents rent free as long as my mother is present my father wont do anything to me though as part of my father retirement plan he wants to sell the house after my sisters graduation in two years so ill have to figure out housing by then i might still have to live with my mother but knowing that my mother will be strained to afford an apartment by herself we live in the ny metropolitan area i would probably have to contribute to rent supporting my mother as a concept doesnt bother me but having to extend my time in the corporate world would i would be in a corporate hellscape for at least two years ive realized that corporate culture is an extension of everything i despise about college whose real purpose is to make you a corporate drone in college unfettered liberalism is rampant note that i dont support either liberals conservatives or any political leanings for the most post i tend to imagine an anarchocommunist society but their terms are still useful for outlining my frustrations liberals are typically middle class or higher people like the demographics of my school who seem to pretend to care about social progress but will never do anything to address the underlying issue in the fear of it uprooting their content lifestyle as an analogy think of it like how psychiatry and therapy treats the symptoms of depression but not the root which is our broken society they will talk about the environment but not point the blame to the capitalist system that causes environmental damage they will talk about oppressed immigrants but not talk about the fact that we live in a world that necessitates people being in worse off conditions they live in some fantasy world and seem to pride themselves with adopting corporate doublespeak best practices work as family etc to be honest i pity them  now today i just got back from a dental operation which was needed because i put off needed dental care for too long 3 years which happened because of my fear of getting into more debt the tooth now requires an extraction ive been in a lot of pain right now im wondering if my gum abscess will spread to the rest of my body and kill me im on antibiotics but still and i cant stop myself from feeling like there is absolutely no hope of things getting better either for myself or the world this whole experience has taught me that if i dont develop an obsession towards making money soon ill have to waste my days eroding the remainder of my soul making corporate dollars if i ever hope to become a pilot one of the few jobs is be willing to do in this broken world plan b if im medically incapable of being a pilot or if i cant take shit anymore is getting out of this wicked country to tefl somewhere else i would have considered being a music teacher and in a perfect world i wouldnt mind something like that at all minus the authorial educational system part but that requires grad school and i really dont want to go through that  i was talking with my mother about graduation and she went on ad gave the drivel about how a college degree will guarantee that youre never poor as long as you make the degree work for you you know i really have to wonder how an immigrant who has strong ties to her own hone culture can be socaught up in american propaganda this is a woman who seems to base her entire life on what other people tell her regardless if its truly right for her or not she got into huge debt to have a us masters degree in esl simply because her cousin told her it would be a good idea the school my former high school that shes been working in as a permanent sub refuses to make her anything more than a permanent sub my mother suspects racism in the hiring practices which im inclined to believe is a valid reason the school despite typically being 99 blacks and hispanics apparently refuses to hire or promote anyone who isnt black or hispanic or rather that at the least it rarely happens she got her degree 7 years ago so i suspect that shes no longer fresh in the job market she didnt take a teaching position in maryland after graduation because she wanted to make sure she was near myself and my sister and had she moved away my father would have definitely uprooted our lives shes also in her mid fifties so im inclined to believe that its too late for her to have any chance with another school and im pretty sure that my high school knows this which means they know that she seriously cant challenge them lest she damages her remaining livelyhood shes also still working after school at retail  tldr feeling untold dread and hopelessness  wondering how people around me dont see anything is wrong and have no clue if there is no real escape for myself or other people  my apologies for the very long post i typically aim to be as concise as possible for people to understand things more easily thank you for reading,dqdevs
