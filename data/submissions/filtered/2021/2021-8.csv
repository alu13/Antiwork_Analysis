17,Does anyone else feel like this sub is harming their mental health?,hi all i am a longtime follower of this sub but ive been having a few conflicts about it and im curious what others thoughts are on it  like many i subscribed to rantiwork in 2020 during the early days of the pandemic i dont remember how exactly i discovered it but i was instantly hooked by the content theres mountains of literature out there about how the pandemic shattered any remaining vestiges of capitalism being even a somewhat sustainable model for humanity also like many i moved to 100 remote from march 2020  august 2021 and my life improved 100fold  now life is returning to normal which means commuting being stuck in an office for 8hours a day lugging food missing my family  the list goes on and on all of this personal stuff completely leaves out the rampant exploitation of workers in this system which was laid completely bare  heres the problem prior to the pandemic i accepted although somewhat begrudgingly at times that my life was going to be marked by 40 more years of commuting to an office 5x a week making work that i now find boring uninspired and frankly bullshit it was an intractable part of life the pandemic and the problems this sub helped expose has opened my eyes to the sheer oppression of this system and how horrible companies are pretty much across the board but now the content just depresses me  there isnt a way out for me whether i like it or not im going to have to work in this field else i suffer in at least some way sure i could just leave and do something else with my life but that would mean no insurance no or less amenities of modern life losing my house and any number of things its scary and with the debts i have its almost impossible and the return on it isnt guaranteed  now the content here just depresses me more than it empowers me were just the ants being crushed under the wheel and knowing that wheel is coming down or not does not matter  were all going to to get crushed anyway in some ways the pre2020 ignorance was bliss now im just frustrated anxious and depressed,pf7fmw

19,Should I quit or let them fire me?,i have a meeting tomorrow with my manager where im 90 sure i am going to get fired i was written up twice this year once for taking long breaks and another for violating a rule about using work tools for personal reasons i did not steal or break any law here my question is should i just quit before the meeting tomorrow or just let them fire me from my brief understanding about unemployment this would count as a termination for cause or misconduct which would make me ineligible for unemployment benefits i live in california id like unemployment benefits but if this makes me ineligible i may as well just quit to make it easier to explain my exit from the company i have enough saved up to last at least a year with no additional income appreciate any advice,pfeb30
20,Should I Quit My Job?,i initially applied to my job in texas over a year ago and got the role as one of the dance teachers i got paid 11 an hour and now im getting paid 12 an hour since ive been working there over a year since then ive also gained the responsibility of running not only the dance program but also the parkour program at the beginning of our class semester i was never given a schedule nor any updates as to what classes i teach for the past two weeks im practically just told what classes i teach on a daytoday basis   for any of my teachers whether in physical or regular education yall must know that not having a consistent schedule makes it near impossible to teach not only that but they also stopped listening to my wishes about separating kids into different difficulty levels so i can teach they also have left me in the building alone with 26 other kids for hours at a time without any type of assistance   my boss is also my landlord and ive been living in their rv with a rent of 550 a month i dont have hot water or access to wifi and im only working 15 hours a week i got a second job to help pay rent and help pay for my college classes but he said that in order to teach classes the way i want to i cant work at that other job   my second job has also said that i can work there full time and i have a place to live if i have to move out i just want to know if these are probable reasons to quit,pfgmv3
21,My partner got fired for calling in sick.,i need to vent my partner was working for a security company the boss always seemed off to me but i didnt say anything because i did not want to discourage him well today he wakes up and immediatly feels miserable he has to puke and can barely get of the toilet probably food poisoning    he writes his boss to tell him that he probably cant make todays shift but will try anyway to get better by  sleeping hell breaks loose he gets a call while on toilet has to justify himself an hour later another call this time by the second in command telling him he has to do the shift that he does not believe he is even sick that he should take some medicine against the diarrhoea and go  my partner tried explaining that he feels bad and he wants to work but he cant stand and guard a building if he spends the entire time on the toilet losing every body fluid    at this point the second in command and his brother who is first in command got even angrier said that they need him to go to the company so that they can confirm he is sick despite them having no training as doctorswhatsoever    it escalates further my partner is told that they are done with it and told him to bring them his work clothes within the next week because he is fired    im fuming the contract states that they can both terminate work at any time but the utter disrespect of their side is insane assuming he is lying yelling at him threatening his job and trying to somehow coerce him into working while being miserable what assholes,pfbzxh

34,It's not just Retail Jobs that suck,i see a lot of posts here focusing on retail jobs and to be sure they suck too i dont want to take away from that but the work culture problem extends into all waged jobs including salaried positions one of the biggest problems with work culture is their seizure of our surplus value of labor from this they are able to perpetuate the 40 he work week minimum because you cant afford to work less than that for those of you who are in familiar the surplus value of labor is the difference between the value of your work versus what they pay you ie you make 10 worth of product but they only pay you 3 for it your surplus value is 7  so i work as an engineer for a government contractor i wont specify further because i dont want to share any identifying information im salaried but broken down i make around 31hr good money right heres the thing though my company charges 125hr to the government for my man hours they are charging about 4x what they pay me for the work that i do and that number is just for man hours that doesnt include supplies or facilities many of which are directly supplied by the govt even if you account for future raises even if were generous and include training and time off task into that figure youd be hard pressed to justify such an extreme discrepancy   and even as engineer ill be quite frank my job qualifies as what david graeber calls a bullshit job most of what i do is busy work to satisfy uniformed managers about the little real work i do actually do so they can make decisions above my head even though they directly affect me and my work   when i started i genuinely thought i was doing something important but the longer i stay here the more i realize im just a cog in a money churning machine for my bosses and i dont even get a fair stake in it for my effort i know a lot of other office workers feel this too but may feel like they shouldnt complain because they are making a decent living but you should recognize that this work culture is exploiting you too work culture hurts us all and even if you make a good salary you should still show solidarity with your fellow working class neighbors and ask yourself what your surplus value is because im willing to bet it exceeds your salary  ps this is also a good reason for removing private interests from government work since the government could just hire me directly for triple my salary and still save money to say nothing of money wasted on our expensive executive officers,pfcz33
35,What can i do to have a livable life?,ive been working since i was 13 ive always believed that if i work hard enough from a young age i can be successful i quickly realized that it doesnt really work that way living costs money and considering that ive had to buy pretty much all of my necessities since i was young due to shitty parents clothes food even had to pay rent i was pretty much going paycheck to paycheck at like 13 yrs old im 18 now i didnt graduate high school i guess u could say im homeless and im not getting paid much better than when i was 13 i work at an oil change shop making 11 an hour not livable under any circumstances im going back to school next week but im starting to ask myself if any of this is even worth it ive been working pretty much since i could and ive tried so hard to save money and make the right choices yet ive gotten no where driving off the grand canyon seems like a much better fate than working all my life and not getting to the financial freedom i desperately dream of,pfjb7i

52,Top management are the worst kind of Karens,i work in a consulting type job due to which i meet the top management of different companies  i have learnt a few obvious things because of this  1 their major concern is the shareholders with maybe 2 concern for manipulating the consumer they dont give a fuck about their employees  2 they have to be coddled so much you cant critique their decisions even though thats what youre paid to do everything either has to have a positive spin or be eliminated mostly because they just copy paste that bs to the shareholders   3 they really truly believe the world revolves around them they will tell not even ask you to work over a long weekend because they need it on monday even though the deliverables date is for the next week their on vacation next week you see so they cant see it then   4 they will throw tantrums to get their way one such client went to my manager because i wouldnt do work outside of my job scope my manager told him it wasnt my job so he complained to her manager and when that didnt work escalated it to my company vp  unfortunately this tactic works sometimes   they are the worst kind of people,pf9gan

103,what is the point,i posted this as a response to a post about why the sudden shift in views on work someone said to post it   so why are people now viewing work as a scam  simplepeople were previously content to work and spend their money their way even exchange metaphorically speaking i work for money you pay me money for work and then i spend that money how i want   then covid happened and most people couldnt spend their money the way they wanted no movies no bars no clubs no vacations no gyms no new cars gunssold out ammo gone home gym equipment on ebay for 100 markup   but even worse people previously content to do service jobs were tossed out by employers like two day old fishduring the middle of a pandemic  even white collar jobs so employers desperately trying to cling to the falsehood that wfh did not work and then it turns out that not only does it work but people are more efficient and happier that way then as if a bad job was being done they are trying to force people back into the office  there is no more exchange i paid off debts during the pandemic and now realize that when i dont have loans to pay off credit cards to keep paying and im not spending money on frivolous things i can actually live off less  my commute to the office was 35 miles each way two gallons of gas every day just to get to work and back home between gas oil changes normal wear and tear etcit cost me 5000 a year to just to get to work 5k of post tax incomeso why wouldnt i take a lower paying job that gives me total freedom or at least 100 work from home  then add in the fact that the housing market continues to inflate simultaneous to the renting market breaking all laws of economics and substitute goods  wages are the same as they were when our parents joined the workforce rich people are buying up homes at 1 and 2 mortgages but students are paying 8 to 15 on education loans theres no snow on mountains covered in snow year round and flooding in places that it never rains half the country is taking animal dewormer instead of a vaccine and groceries that cost 75 a week two years ago now cost 100   the shift we are seeing is what happens when an entire generation says whats the fucking point  like take a 401k for example why the fuck should i contribute to a 401k when each and every day i grow more and more confident none of us will be alive when i am old enough to collect it,pf8yxg

112,Afraid of finally stepping into the real world and becoming part of the work force,i will try to keep this as short as possible i am now 23 years old and have been in college for the last 5 years living in a students dorm i have not worked a day in my life so far the closest i got to it was when i had to be a intern for 2 weeks at my dads company as a engineer   the people there were very welcoming and nice to me and generally the environment was chill because its was a government facility so there were no quotas that you would need to fulfil so not a lot of pressure most of the time people would leisure there and work 34h maybe daily unless there were some serious business that needed doing again these are just my superficial experiences from being there for 2 weeks  but now comes the main issue it takes me from one hour to a hour and a half to get there so around two to three hours a day i spend in a bus and its the worst when coming back cause it was super sunny outside so everybody was sweating and as usual it was super packed inside  and i would come home dead tiered go to sleep immediately and wake up like 2h later play a bit of games with my friends online and did the usual eating showering and stuff and that was about it  and the only reason i got through the two weeks was because i kept reminding myself its just two weeks of this and then you get to go back to your dorm   and thats why i am afraid of finally having to get a proper job after finishing college cause whats the point in living if more then half of my day is spend on work besides studying for engineering degree i also spend a lot of my time drawing and used to do 3d modeling and it just hurts me to think that with work its gonna be hard to fit everything in that i would either not have energy or time and even when i would do it i would be advancing at twice the slower rate than before  and that is currently giving me some mental issues but this isnt the place to expand on that  i read somewhere that there are places that work 6h a day and to me that seams a lot better and should be normalized across the world cause then you would have four 6h shifts instead of three 8h shifts i mean its still a lot of time lost each weak on work and transport but i feel that the current 8h is just too much  and i know that there are people who work even more and i honestly dont know how you do it all thoughts and prayers go to you,pfbs2h

130,My favorite time quitting,back in the late 90s i used to work for a regional chain of comic book shops in th dc area i liked the customers i liked the job the only thing i despised was management the store manager and assistant manger were fine but the 6 store chain had 3 regional managers who all had overlapping jurisdiction  this was the death knell of the store but i didnt know it at the time see we would frequently get in really odd shipments of product rather than our main sellers of comicbooks ccgs and rpgs we would get really low grade toys and other weird stuff like incense it basically never sold until we marked it down to 80 off  now as i said i actually liked working there and i tried to make the business thrive i asked my manager if we could spend some money on fliers to distribute at two local universities to help drum up business he said he didnt have authority to do it and passed me on to the regional manager i gave him my proposal he asked me which way we should spend money on more product to sell or advertising i said advertising becuase we cant sell what we already have in stock his response wrong answer thats why im the manager and youre the employee well im not your employee any longer i quit go fuck yourself  now heres the great part about a year later the whole chain went under when they did the bankruptcy sale apparently there was like 50  1 ton palletes of unsellible crap in the warehouse the same incense knockoff toys etc it turns out that the three regional managers were all issued corporate credit cards these shitheads would go to tradeshows and such and agree to buy product in exchange for the wholesaler taking them out to dinner or a stripclub they basically were badly robbing the company they worked for so a steak dinner for one of these assholes ends up costing the company ten thousand dollars,per3wi

179,Only when it effects the boss,so this little rant is for my mom since she has been dealing with it for 20 years she told me this story  so my mom has been working at her company doing accounts receivable since before i can remember she was in the same cubicle for 20 years she was fine with it other than her neighboring coworkers constantly she would complain about a chewing so loudly or playing with candy wrappers and b singing to her music all day or c not answering the phone so my mom has to stop and do it  20 years of her trying to deal with all this while handling million sometimes billion dollar accounts and not being able to focus  of course that wasnt until her boss came to her with this billion dollar account and wanted to work together to make sure it got done right he came to my mom with it because she was the best one for it and knows her shit so for about 6 hours one day he wheeled his desk chair out into the hall to sit next to her cubicle and help about an hour in he was getting somewhat annoyed because a was playing with another candy wrapper and b was singing loudly to her music he gave offhanded comments about it and they continued   this continue for the next 4 hours until he finally stood up visibly upset and just said how can you work with all this noise my mom gave him a blank look and just said this is how its been for 20 years theres nothing i can do the work needs done so i get it done despite the distractions he shook his head and just said im sorry but i cant have you working on these accounts when you cant focus properly it could lose us money   of course my mom was heartbroken because she thought she was losing out on these accounts because of her coworkers even though she gets the work done her boss walked away for awhile and came back about an hour later  go ahead and start packing up your cubicle my mom of course is shocked and said what do you mean he laughed and said youre getting an office you need quiet to focus and you cant do that out hear   20 years she had been in that cubicle and not until her boss sits where she sits and deals with the same shit does she finally get the office she deserves  hope you enjoyed the happy ending for my mom she loves her office and even has a window,peinso

274,How to tell a manager no?,this is going to sound stupid to a lot of people here i am trying very hard to put my internal feelings about work more externally so its not eating me up inside my manager is very nice but of course he is 100 a manager and i know he doesnt personally care about me and does what management asks him to he asked me to show someone best practices of my workflow so that person could improve their productivity and i dont know how to say no without sounding like a terrible employee  being a team player and helping out obviously ties in with raises so i cant just say lol no thanks but i want to escape this stupid i have to do x on top of my already duties to be a good worker  but i want to be better about refusing to say yes to everything doing something to help others work faster when this job gives me anxiety and panic attacks and makes me cry on my lunches because were pushed so hard to do stupid robotic lifeless worki dont want to do it i think i would breakdown trying to explain to someone how to be good at it when it kills my soul   has anyone struggled to tell their managers no how did it work out does it become easier do you ever regret it,pdwvtb

280,What in the fuck is wrong with management culture?,we know the richest in the world have nothing but genocidal contempt for the poor we know that   but the professional managerial class they often do not truly make much more than the people they are managing yet they are some of the worst abusers anyone is likely to deal with today fastidious in their obtuse pernicious behavior and downright zealous in their enforcement of the cult of work the cult of the company the cult of obedience and profit   in other words managers are in great majority some of the worst people you will ever have the misfortune of knowing   my first instinct is that the reason for this is structural our culture our incentive structures our socioeconomic pressures ensure the creation of this class of managers who exist to torture laborers at a slightly higher rate for the bourgeoisie books can and no doubt have been written about all the minutia that go into these systems of control every manager is not a necessarily a nightmare but by and large middle managers are chosen for their slavish dedication to their masters and their vicious whims translation managers are often chosen not because they are truly exceptional human beings but because they are the right level of mediocre stupid and venal   within the above could go down a labyrinthine path considering how human nature  however we should wish to define it  interacts negatively with the acquisition of power and how said systems generate these petty tyrants  whatever the case research has demonstrated for years that people leave managers more than they leave their duties it is long past time we as a culture fully recognize the inhumane and intolerable quality of these abuses and cease to permit it as a people and a culture in the late 19th to early 20th century many an american did recognize this in the form of militant labor movements   the owners and the managerial class which serves them are enemies of every working individual period   i would be interested to hear peoples own experiences and theories as to why management culture is so staggeringly toxic,pe6e8z

357,How to rip a team apart,so the company i worked for was taken over last year and the new company promised that our positions would be safe for two years roll on april and a couple weeks after the transition was finalised the new company announced that there was going to be a restructure and were expecting 30 job losses needless to say this didnt go down very well with everyone coinciding with the fact that they invited people to the meeting less than an hour before it was due to take place so lots of people couldnt make it and had to find out from word of mouth and they then just palmed off our questions to our team leaders who themselves had no idea about this announcement and were not consulted at any point not even our regional manager had any idea about it  a few weeks later and they release the new structure of the organisation and we find that our position has been renamed as administrator  bearing in mind that my job is a technical and professional position which requires a degree we felt this was a bit of an insult we were also informed we would have to reinterview for a job that ive done for the past 6 years  after we analysed the new structure as a team we realised large parts of our job role was unaccounted for and we were told that under no circumstances we would be required to do this part of the job anymore in the new job role but a couple months later these duties made their way back to us  we also noticed that on the new job profile there was no mention of where this job would be based we enquired about this but did not get an answer enquired again no answer it got to 1 week before the deadline and still no answer as to where the job would be based so i got in touch with an employment advice service and explained this and they were staggered that they wouldnt tell us this basic level of information along with everything else and advised me to raise an official complaint i raised the complaint and was told that the job would be based out of another office approx 100 miles 45 hour commute there and back away from where it is now and no explanation as to why or other than working as a team is more productive but was told at the same time that the new office isnt big enough to accommodate the whole team and also weve been working from home for 18 months and the team has been more productive in this period then ever before so the move in my mind makes no sense at all other than to justify the company building this new office we also found out that 3 people from outside the team had been assigned three of our positions without interview or assessment which we thought was unfair  why do we have to reinterview for our own job but someone who doesnt do our job gets the job without the interview  anyway to present day and approximately half of our team have left the company and the other half are wanting to leave from conversations ive had with them we had a team briefing basically saying as a company we are way behind target to where we have ever been before but they couldnt seem to connect the dots that this might be because half the team has left and the other half have zero motivation to work for this company anymore and are desperate to leave as a result of all of this the company has now had to put in a recovery plan because we are behind target asking us to do overtime to recover the deficit you can imagine how that went down its been clear from the very beginning that the senior management didnt value us as employees or as a team thinking that our jobs were a basic administrative job role but actually requires a degree and a deep knowledge and understanding of the industry  now that they are so far behind target they might be starting to realise how valuable we are but too little too late as half the team are already gone and the other half cant wait to get out of the door its going to be interesting to see how things are in a few months time   ive secured a new job elsewhere and just waiting for the paperwork to be done before i can leave looking forward to telling them why im leaving ive been wanting to change jobs for a while but this gave me the motivation to look for a new career which im excited about starting so thanks for that   ok that was a long post longer than i was expecting guess i needed to rant and get this off my chest haha so this is my first time posting anything like this so please so let me know if i need to change anything  thanks for reading,pdvddt

373,Is having a good reference even worth it,i worked for a video production company for 2 years as the lead video editor on our tv shows my position quickly extended to other things due to understaffing like singlehandedly editing and updating the website fixing all of the computer issues and basically being my boss personal tech support agent he even gave me his daughters laptop expecting id take it home and fix it for him which i did for all of this i was paid 12hr and hired as a contractor so i didnt get any rights days off or benefits also if i went overtime it was not paid   eventually i couldnt take it anymore and once my photography business started taking off i tried to quit instead of being allowed to quit my boss said that its important i keep him on my side so i had to stay until he found a replacement and train them i ended up staying for 6 extra weeks and then after leaving continually trained the new employee over the phone whenever he had any questions or didnt know how to do something of course im not being paid for this   in the meantime photographing weddings and doing portraits has paid far better and been genuinely rewarding for me i put together a website for my business and thought id also include some videos i edited when i worked at that company since i should use my talents in video production to make some extra money well one day my old boss asked me to do more free work for him this time helping manage a project with one of his producers i jumped on email and assisted to the best of my ability this time with my new email that has my website in it well after ccing my old boss he saw the website and dug through it he found that i had included my video work in my portfolio and immediately went into a cease and desist i had to scrub all my work from my website that he owned the copyright to that day or else hed get a lawyer involved   after that ive lost all motivation to keep him happy yesterday he asked i literally code and design a new page for his website again unpaid since i literally dont work for him anymore and i simply havent responded to him i know i want to settle down into another job eventually and feel like i need references but im not sure if my dignity is worth it am i in the wrong for refusing to help at this point,peh0ir

383,I got a job working for Apple. It pays less than 15 dollars an hour. Lets talk a little about it.,phew okay where to start firstly lets talk about the job i am an ios tier one technical support advisor im the first person you get when you call apple support to talk about iphone issues while apple maintains that all of its technical support advisors are apple trained they dont tell you the whole story i work for apple but they dont pay me technically i am employed by a company called conduent with whom apple has outsourced its tech support they do this so they can maintain a low wage for their tech support workers but keep it off of apples books my trainer more or less told me honestly all of this is fine with me i get it companies do what companies do i am thankful to have the job as i have massive amounts of student loan debt and an irrelevant degree but there are little things that just feel demeaning and insulting they preach the idea that you are engine by which apple generates its revenue this could be seen as complimentary however the presentation goes on to make the case that if you are not 100 committed to perfection in job performance that you will end up costing millions of dollars the question goes like this there are roughly 3000 agents employed in our call center if all of them were late from lunch by two minutes the company would lose nearly 14 million dollars in revenue all from just two minutes away they push the idea that its just two minutes that cost 14 million dollars when in reality it is 6000 minutes which is 100 hours they want to guilt you into your time commitment with them just kinda rubbed me the wrong way still thankful to have a job i suppose its more than a lot can say but we deserve better,pecelj

412,My parents want me to find a job,a rant sorry  im 23 and im still living with my parents thats very normal in my country where it is merely impossible to find a job if you are young or to pay rent with the shitty pay they give you because you are young  for at least 4 years ive been struggling with severely depression and i had to dump college because i was incapable to function and i was very suicidal my parents blame me constantly because i wasted so many years and money in college and i could already be independent if i didnt left at least in their mind because i entered a very stupid major with no value because no one told me how life worked when i was young and i though you could make a living with your passions  i am grateful that they accepted me back at home after i failed my studies even if they completely ignored my psychological issues and told me that depression was for weak and childish people and they though that with that information i will be suddenly cured  now i am embarked again in other studies because i am worried about my future and i want to be able to find a stable job in a couple of years i am finally emotional stable and i was planning to use my free time to develop some hobbies and enjoy life after so many years of horror nevertheless they want me to find a job to combine with my studies so i can pay them rent i dont want to perish again between classes and the humiliating task of interviews to get a retailer job and lost all of my free time i just want to live a bit  my parents are very controlling they get angry if i go out without permission or if i dont tell them with whom i am going out i cannot sleep out of home etc so imagine trying to date men  they just think they are doing me a favour and that i am an ungrateful brat that at least i should pay them something,pdfxjo
413,Unemployment,can i get unemployment even if i quit my job after i quit my job 1 month ago my boss gave me 3600 i quit because i had been wanting to work part time to take care of my kids  he told me he would let me go part time at some point but he kept promising for a whole year i found out he hired someone else and was paying her more than me after i had been with them for the past 6 years it made me very upset so i put in my notice and been happy home with my kids i do not want to work if i do it will be from home i want to raise my kids,pd6kdw
414,Quit after 2 weeks,recently graduated university and got an upper management position in my field that i was pretty excited about upon being hired my only request was that i couldnt work sundays of course the boss told me i had to work sundays for now as they were low on staff and thats a shift the guy i was replacing worked one of my responsibilities was to do the schedule for my department but i needed my schedule first the director handled managements schedules before being able to schedule my staff  when i asked my boss for my schedule she legit told me i dont get the schedule out 2 weeks in advance its usually not until maybe a day or two before you need yours my department to be done and laughed about it i thought to myself how do you expect me to be successful when you cant even give me my schedule in advance or let me do my own that among other things demonstrated to me that this was a poorly run operation and explained why staff was so minimal aside from covid i ended up quitting on a monday 2 weeks into my employment and stated i would finish my shifts for the week by the end of my shift though i was informed that my remaining shifts for the week had been filled i guess she was capable of scheduling quickly after all,pdcomy
415,A lot of you should be in public service,i worked for plenty of corporations in the past and hated it for many of the reasons described in this subreddit  but now im a government employee in a designated national security position have been for a good 10 years and love it   the benefits eg 401k health dental pension are crazy good i can telework two days out of the week and theyre paying 100 of the cost of my masters degree  i can also take paid time off basically whenever i want annual or sick leave  the bottom line is fulfilling the mission not profit  the best part is that if i end up hating my boss coworkers andor agency i can just transfer somewhere else  once youre in as a government employee especially if you have a security clearance a whole host of options become available to you  it took me a while to get to this position plenty of shitty government jobs and of course the pay could be better but imo it beats working for a private company that pretends youre family  consider county state or federal employment,pdahny

427,So I applied for a new position in a different department at my job and HR fucked it up. Now I’m laughing my ass off watching my managers pick up the pieces,so i decided to apply for a higher paying position in a different department at my company since shit hit the fan when my director left  he basically ran the entire company all the executives are leaving and a lot of other folks leaving at every level too i am aware that this is a red flag but i know this company is not going anywhere anytime soon   my current job is pretty easy im the youngest person working there and have made reputation for doing a good job despite me putting in the minimum effort 90 of the time the new department i applied for is much more workstress and less freedom but the pay is a lot better  about 40 higher pay after applying i was guaranteed the position since they wanted me so badly   after a couple weeks i come to find out that hr sent my offer letter to the wrong person someone who has the same first name and a similar last name as me the manager of the wrong guy hr sent it to got involved and told my associate manager associate manager came to me about it and said i could do whatever but he would like me to stay i told him im not committing to anything until i see a job offer to review my manager comes back from vacation and panics when he finds out what happened and has a long ass convo with me about getting me a promotion to stay in my current department i simply tell him i am making no commitments until i have a job offer in hand to review if he wants to keep me i told him to talk with his boss and give me an offer to stay   now there are rumors going around of me switching departments and everyone is begging me to stay where i am or else they will leave too lol all i say is i dont know what youre talking about i know nothing i somehow managed to get all the managers under my thumb thanks to hr fucking up its pretty hilarious to watch since i dont give a fuck about this company they let all their talent leave and the only good ones that are left only stay since the job is close to home or because they are buying their time until they have enough years under their belt to apply elsewhere i only stay since i love my shift 2nd shift four 10 hours shifts and i can leave early if things are dead  i still get full pay regardless of what time i leave the only drawback is i have to do a decent amount of ot  which im fine with since my managers approve my timecard no matter what all ot is paid time and a half if it wasnt i would never do it   being antiwork makes this whole experience so much more fun to watch unfold i plan on staying in my current position and will negotiate a 2 pay bump they want to make me a manager for my current department but there is no way in hell i will ever accept that position knowing how fucked up things are within the company i dont need that much more stress the manager position they were considering me for in my current department is salary instead of hourly too fuck that with the amount of ot i rack in id be losing money  tldr i applied for a higher paying position in a different department at my company got in but my offer letter was sent to the wrong person now my current department is scrambling to make me an offer to stay where i am and become a manager i still have not received my offer letter and i am enjoying watching it all blow up in their faces,pdnywl

540,1 hour for lunch is not enough,i have always thought this and i feel like no one talks about it 1 hour for lunch sounds like a long time but its not if youre using lunch to do an errand you might realistically have 20 mins of transit time from your work to the errand and another 20 min back  leaving you with 20 min to do what you need to do then if you use it for an errand you havent had lunch  so what happens you buy something and eat it at your desk it feels unsanitary and i want to separate where i work and where i live  the idea of going out to lunch with someone sounds great  but realistically you cant fit a social lunch in to 1 hour including transit time ordering conversation eating i have tried it before and the entire time i just felt rushed and like i would get in trouble i cant enjoy the lunch break because im worried about not making it back within the 1 hour time slot the expectation of working 95 and a 1 hour lunch break makes it pretty much impossible to socialise and do pleasurable things during the day thats such a simple fact but i feel robbed of that because ive been a student for so long and im just entering the work force  even if the only activity you do is eat your own lunch on your lunch break 1 hour isnt enough you cant decompress from work and psych yourself up again in that time and have it be relaxing  what i wrote here is based on summer office jobs ive had im lucky enough that i got my first real job during the pandemic  so its been totally remote i am amazed at how much time i can get back this way  no transit time i can make lunch during work pretty much putting pasta on and leaving it etc so i can actually take a full lunch break to myself i can walk my dog for 40 min during my lunch break i can do errands in down time i am lucky that i have a really amazing boss and im doing a job that i think puts good things into the world  but man its crazy how many hours in the week are not your own  my ideal work week would be 5 days of just mornings  im rambling now  but let me know what you think of the 1 hour lunch break and what you do in yours,pctssc

570,Asked to Cover Multiple Shifts,im a security guard who works at a corporate law firm ie the client as far as security jobs go the pay is decent and daytoday work mostly entails surfing the internet   however the client like so many other employers relies on 3rd party security companies in order to avoid liability benefits and others costs that would come with making us inhouse employees long story short the last company was so terrible that the client ditched them for a new one   at first my fellow veteran guard and i were hopeful after all were getting a dollar an hour raise and this company was vetted by the client the last company was a monopoly that just bought out the one the client actually liked so what could possibly go wrong  well the new security company manager failed to provide adequate staff and inform us in advance so now my coworker is being asked to cancel birthday party plans when my coworker refused the manager threw a temper tantrum and slammed doors and now shes texting me on my day off asking me to cover multiple shifts even by corporate lean staffing standards this is pretty appalling   as of now im just refusing to respond because im afraid i would tell her off i also have enough savings to not work for a while so even though id rather not dip into them i dont care too much about getting fired either   anyway thanks for indulging my venting interested in your thoughts and advice,pcwvck

574,Criticizing Kevin Paffrath's proposal of concentration camp for the homeless,though it might sound humane at first kevins idea of using the national guard on civilians in peacetime to remove homeless from californian streets within 3 months is inherently tyrannical hed apparently then force them into new state concentration camps against their will even the language of using the army to keep the streets safe until the homeless are removed is fascistic  i dont like having homeless people on the streets but what he is proposing is crossing the line he was literally proposing having the national guard on the streets picture them carrying assault rifles to keep them secure from the homeless which only works if you actually think were living in fucking afghanistan once he builds his concentration camps hed then shove any hippy who just wanted to sleep under the stars in at gunpoint  even the language of using the army in peacetime on americans to ostensibly keep the streets safe until the homeless are removed is fascistic and it sets a dangerous precedent and then how do we decide who has to go to paffrath camp and who gets to stay at their friends house how do you ever get to leave the camp if you dont even have means to earn money there its just a rich mans sadistic fantasy to put away the undesirables that make him feel dirty  its like how in the not so long ago past in england there were poor laws to criminalize poverty and being unemployed christuan society used to think the unemployed were only lazy so we would imprison them in prisons and force them to do grueling slave labor to make the prison owner a millionaire because not working was considered a malaise these laws didnt apply to the rich unemployed but only the poor and especially for single women and women who were prostitutes  i dont want to bring back forced relocations of people which have never in history been used as a tool to solve economic disparities these heavy handed methods have only accelerated the divide between the haves and the havenots it reminds me of the japanese internment and the relocation of native americans from plentiful forests to barren deserts where they would be jobless and starve  i made a new forum to criticize the man who wants to replace governor newsom in ca,pct816

576,So glad I'm leaving (rant),i accepted a new job this week that starts on 97 the new position pays more allows me to work from home and holds the promise of personal and professional growth far beyond what i could have ever achieved at my current job so needless to say im stoked  against my better judgement i put in 2 weeks notice at my current job week and a half actually so im just lingering here playing out the string i am honestly enjoying this lame duck period knowing that nobody expects anything from me as they are wont to do my shitty employer still found a way to piss me off today though  just a little backstory the ceo of my company makes upwards of 6 million per year last year during the peak of the rona they denied my team our annual merit raises suspended the company 401k match and took away my teams budget for occasional meals supplies etc we were unapologetically stranded onsite while most everyone else was able to work from home then miraculously the company sent out their annual eoy financial disclosures  record profits yay for us bonuses for all the executives seriously fuck these people  on to todays slap in the face though i have 56 hours of pto in my bank that i accrued during the first 8 months of the year i asked hr to confirm whether i would be paid out that remaining balance on my last check considering i earned that time and it belongs to me the answer was a resounding no arizona state law doesnt consider unused pto as wages like other states but individual employers are free to set their own policy of course my greedy shitty employer is going to force me to forfeit 56 hours of earned pto because reasons adding to that i am not allowed to use vacation hours during my notice period and would not be paid for them if i tried   so i told off the hr bitch cause fuck her thats why i also intend to use a couple sick days between now and the end of next week because i have those hours in my bank and sick time is protected by az state law still there goes more than 1500 worth of earned vacationholiday time into the void if they insist on taking their pound of flesh im not going to do jack shit for the remainder of my time here worst company ever  tldr  got a new job put in my 2 weeks current employer is going to screw me out of my earned vacation time even though the ceo makes 6 million per year and they reported record profits because reasons,pcsdx5

611,1 hour is not long enough for lunch,i have always thought this and i feel like no one talks about it 1 hour for lunch sounds like a long time but its not if youre using lunch to do an errand you might realistically have 20 mins of transit time from your work to the errand and another 20 min back  leaving you with 20 min to do what you need to do then if you use it for an errand you havent had lunch  so what happens you buy something and eat it at your desk it feels unsanitary and i want to separate where i work and where i live  the idea of going out to lunch with someone sounds great  but realistically you cant fit a social lunch in to 1 hour including transit time ordering conversation eating i have tried it before and the entire time i just felt rushed and like i would get in trouble i cant enjoy the lunch break because im worried about not making it back within the 1 hour time slot the expectation of working 95 and a 1 hour lunch break makes it pretty much impossible to socialise and do pleasurable things during the day thats such a simple fact but i feel robbed of that because ive been a student for so long and im just entering the work force  even if the only activity you do is eat your own lunch on your lunch break 1 hour isnt enough you cant decompress from work and psych yourself up again in that time and have it be relaxing   ampx200b  what i wrote here is based on summer office jobs ive had im lucky enough that i got my first real job during the pandemic  so its been totally remote i am amazed at how much time i can get back this way  no transit time i can make lunch during work pretty much putting pasta on and leaving it etc so i can actually take a full lunch break to myself i can walk my dog for 40 min during my lunch break i can do errands in down time i am lucky that i have a really amazing boss and im doing a job that i think puts good things into the world  but man its crazy how many hours in the week are not your own   my ideal work week would be 5 days of just mornings  ampx200b  im rambling now  but let me know what you think of the 1 hour lunch break and what you do in yours,pctp7w

615,Work as a personality trait,why is it when you first meet people its always what you doing for work people are so passionate about things that arent their passion amp use work as a vehicle to feel important  we create things we dont need and create jobs for people that dont need them cash is a mere middle man for things we want like primitive societies why not exchange something we dont need for something we do   its easier said than done the younger generation craves eating shit for 8 hours a day to give themselves a pat on the back whilst neglecting their purpose its then flipped as a sort of stockholm syndrome to love to work to feel a sense of purpose or importance   comes the weekend amp they blow cash on alcohol amp drugs and this is life stupid enough to work all week yet the small compromise at 5pm friday makes it seem worthwhile i dont support marxism or communism but capitalism is no way to go   working is just a symptom of life amp society not a trait unless you are doing what you truly love you are experiencing a symptom not a beneficial one,pcgatc

620,I sometimes wonder what the point of all this is.,if you link about the average life of a human it all seems pointless at times you spend most of you childhood going to school roughly 85 year after year sound familiar and when your finally done what do you get a in the end a high school diploma which it turns out to be pretty fucking useless  so what are the options well you could go into the militarybut it looks like we might be headed back to afghanistan for another 20 years so maybe not such a good idea  what about a trade trades are good to get into and you can make some pretty decent money the world needs electricians plumber and mechanics the problem is that most trade labor is hard manual workagain nothing wrong with that but if you plan on working in the trades your entire working career but the time you hit retirement you body is going to be so worn out and broken down you probably wont have much of a retirementor i should say a pain free retirement   what about college sure sink yourself into an insane amount of debt for most likely a useless degree not all college degrees are useless just most of them sound familiar then after acquiring said degree you have to battle it out in the same job market with hundreds of other people with useless degrees battling for the same job with shit pay shit benefits and shit management but at least the company can brag every quarter about all the insane profits they are making and then when it come time for a raise what do you get a couple of percent  i use to find it strange that in in high school they never really taught you how to start your own business but now im pretty sure its all by design fml,pctipp

716,Narcissistic shitty supervisor,so this is just a rant about my very shitty bosssupervisor he is the goddamn embodiment of too much ego and narcissism and no humanity or compassion for anyone else while he behaves in a better way with me probably cause i have a very strong no bullshit filter he is the meanest bastard towards my good friend and only friend i have there who just came back after a pretty long sick leave caused by stress and im so mad that he is making my friend so damn miserable   just  because there are certain things my friend still cant do at work yet and while they work very hard they have to know their limits otherwise they will just end up getting sick again but he still pushes them into work and tight deadlines thats literally causing them stress they could be given all other kinds of other work that needs to be done but isnt as stressful he doesnt give a shit in his mind if you cannot do 100 then you should just pull yourself together he knows nothing about what they have been through and how much they can take and when they explains that to him he just tells them to just do better that he doesnt treat me like this just makes me even more pissed he is going after someone who isnt as mentally strong and is still in a vulnerable state i have no respect for people like this and never will   i have talked to my friend about it and im more than willing to give him a good talk but they dont want me to fight their fight which i respect 100 it just pisses me off i cannot do more than this going to the hr is also a no the last person that did that got fired very conveniently a week after and the worst part is that i might i have to leave the place soon since i have other business in another department leaving them behind is making me even more sad and angry,pc1tn8

739,UPDATE: Got wrote up for working overtime. Fuck predatory companies. Here is my resignation letter,i had received multiple requests for an update from my post last week where i gave a very professional fuck you pay me letter with grammar mistakes due to a final conflict that was the final straw for me so here is what happened following   the next day we had an 8am call that everyone was required to attend which i obviously did not however since i sent the letter around 7pm the night before i didnt know if my manager would have called me asking where i was 830 came by and i received a response from hr    they responded thanking me for their time and stated that after performing an audit they noticed 20 hours of overtime that was unpaid and will be included on my final paycheck it was as simple as that no back and forth no arguing they did a simple count and paid out there were plenty of hours i probably could have gotten but those would have been a little more difficult to prove since it wasnt tracked on the desktop software however i was not worried about it   i did notice they didnt include my bonus in there and responded stating i did not see the final paycheck breakdown include my bonus for closed loans per our contract and the report which i pulled the night before and attached i am entitled to a 250 bonus please include this   manager responded glad you caught that thats literally it my immediate team lead one of the ones that butted heads called and i didnt answer he left a voicemail asking me to call him back and i never did two of the los called these two were on a team and were the only 2 people i got along with asking what happened and if everything was okay i explained the situation to them and it turns out that the company has been through 8 mortgage processors in the past year for the same reason the loan processors that quit before me with a 2 weeks notice the company let go on the spot anyway both of these loan officers stated i could use them for a reference and wished me luck and they understood which meant a lot to me    i had a recruiter i worked with in the past open my file back up and had an interview scheduled 2 days later today i heard back from them for a remote job offer making 5hr more and a slightly better loan bonus structure 1500ish a month the company averages a smaller workload than im used to which means less work and the recruiter had a long relationship with them apparently they all are the laid back easy going types    so all in all i got what was owed to me  i had a week off albeit stressful and i got a new job offer making more while also causing the old job to be in a tough spot due to the urgent loan closings i had im happy with the results   so a happy ending for this one and because i knew my rights and stood up for myself i got what was rightfully owed shouldnt have to but it is what it is thanks all for the support,pc6z12

786,Four month unpaid internship that encouraged me to keep on studying [Long],this happened a couple of years ago but i am still super salty about it since it kinda changed the plans i made for myself on a personal and a professional level for the next five years it is still the worst working experience i had so far and ive had plenty of internships and student jobs since  in the first half of 2016 i was finishing my bachelors degree in legal practise with this degree i was planning on becoming a paralegal hoping to become a legal counsel after a couple years of experience part of the three year program was a nearly full semester mandatory internship whilst writing a bachelor dissertation  i found an internship at the headquarters of one of the biggest banks in my country in a department that deals with the assets of its deceased clients i had two conversations before my starting date with the head of department who was a lawyer there is a certain kind of lawyers that looks down on paralegals put a pin that  my first day the head of department showed me my desk and  asked what the purpose of the internship was even though the school send her loads of information i told her that i was suppose to perform tasks that someone with my degree would do she told me okay but that my laptop and account werent there yet and that it could take another day or two no problem i brought my own laptop in case i needed to do some kind of research  no no you wont be doing any research thats for the actual legally trained take a seat next to colleagues name you can observe and assist until your laptop arrives tomorrow and your account is ready okay no problem i guess but tomorrow turned out to mean two months from now so half my internship i was seated next to a colleague just watching them work eight hours a day for two months watching someone perform tasks i wasnt allowed to do   no big deal youd think considering i wasnt getting paid anyway but the problem was that the head of department needed to evaluate my performances every month and send a report to the school since i didnt perform any tasks however she gave me bad grades on all marks   after two months i finally got my laptop which turned out was already waiting for me on day 1 as was the account the head of department just didnt bother to check i then thought i was able to do some actual paralegal work she told me i could answer incoming phone calls of clients read next of kin and answer their questions i was okay with this considering many of them had semilegal questions occasionally a lawyer or notary would call so that was fun   one day a colleague of mine got a question from a client concerning a specific legal matter our head of department lawyer and the other legal counsel were not present so she feared she couldnt help the client however since i had training as a paralegal i was actually able to help out i was kinda proud of myself that since it was a fairly complicated matter i explained the client and he was happy   the next day however my head of department found out that i helped a client with a legal matter and she was livid remember when i said that some lawyers look down on paralegals yeah shit hit the proverbial fan and i was right in the splash zone how dare i answer a legal question when i was not a lawyer how dare i diminish her degree and make a fool of lawyers by thinking i could perform their job yadiyada all of the usual things after that day i was no longer allowed to answer incoming calls and only was allowed to do outgoing calls   these outgoing calls consisted of calling the next of kin of a recently deceased recently meant that the deceased had been death for one week some people are able to answer questions about their deceased loved one one week after their passing some are not though i was a bit hesitant to call the family of a recently deceased one week after their passing it was my job so i did it i was polite and understanding if people broke down which happened regularly i was just happy to be doing something only i was only allowed to make max 5 calls each day after they were done i had to observe colleagues for tasks she did not allow me to do my chef made sure that the clients i did call were always the most difficult conversations to have like the mother of a 14 year old who killed himself or a father whose daughter got killed in an accident   the final month of the internship the head of department instructed the entire team to increase the numbers on the booklets we send out these booklets was a free informational brochure with more information about what needed to happen with the banking accounts insurances  etc of the deceased she instructed us to always ask read push the clients if they were interested in the brochure and send as many as possible the other headquarter offices had sent about 120 out past month since my head of department and i werent really seeing eye to eye after the whole deal with the phone call i thought id to an effort to amp up our offices numbers by the end of my internship our office had sent out 157 of these booklets 101 of them were sent out by me the other 56 were divided over twelve other employers the head of department never even acknowledged the work i had done to sent out these shitty booklets and even congratulated herself that we had the highest number of all firms    after the above mentioned call people were also shifting blame to me for files i wasnt even working on i could here people over the phone saying oh yeah weve an intern must have been his fault i wasnt allowed to do anything besides answering phone calls how could anything be my fault complaining to my chef wasnt an option since any time i went over to her she sighed and rolled her eyes i just kept on working the best i could for the little work i head she also shifted blame on me though she frigging knew she didnt allowed me to do anything   remember the bachelor dissertation she was supposed to read it and ask questions on my presentation which she new prior to me starting when someone from the school came for the presentation she threw my dissertation on the desk in front of her and ask was i supposed to do anything with this cause i didnt really care about it as if she didnt knew after the presentation was done the representative from the school asked what my plans were after graduating i told her i was fiddling with the idea of going to university and try to complete the bridging program so i could hopefully obtain my master of laws and become a lawyer cause yknow i was treated as shit as a paralegal my head of department scoffed and said are you sure you wanna do that cause thats only for a select few yknow i dont think you have the maturity for that   perhaps i was a bit nave to think shed like the fact that i sent out almost as much booklets on my own than the other office did with their entire team that i was there each and every day often staying late in case something came up that i could help with but alas the grade she gave me was barely enough to pass since the internship was 25 of the entire credit of the entire program she made sure i wasnt getting any kind of distinction on my grade which in our line of work is always a big plus on your resume i was so fed up and distraught by the way she treated me i thought if this is how paralegals are treated i am not having it   so yeah i enrolled in the bridging program for the master of laws even though it was only for a select few and i wasnt mature enough completed the bridging program cum laude earned my master of laws cum laude and just now an advanced master   this set me back 5 years as i wasnt planning on studying after graduating as a paralegal in stead of working for five years and gaining working experience earning money to being my life as i was planning i went to uni for the next five years continuing to study and proving this woman wrong and that i could actually achieve something,pbc2k3

822,Worker “right”,a common sentiment i see here is that workers should be far more involved in the profitability of a company they do most of the ground work to keep a company running so why shouldnt they be shareholders in a sense  this works smoothly when a company or small business is doing well but what happens when it doesnt if quarter 1 brings profits that are majorly redistributed to workers then quarter 2 is rough and costs the company a lot should workers have to share the burden of failure or is it just a one way street  and this goes beyond pay cuts or layoffs if a company or small business goes into debt should the debt be redistributed as well,pbnelu

936,I daydream about how to fix society. One microfix would be consolidating how lunch and dinner are distributed. This might shave one hour or more of work off of everyone's day:,ok this is going to sound communist creepy but it is more in line with a hotel concept   imagine cheap good food and everyone eats the same meal or there are two choices imagine a drive through with six lanes similar to toll booths exiting an airport you just grab your food and drive off it is all ready there are two salad dressings inside  instead of waiting 5 minutes for the order to be customized to your choice of salad dressing you throw away the one you dont want   banquets pop out thousands of meals at the same exact time    now calculate all the restaurants and rent and fast food chains and because everyone is competing instead of collaborating    there is a temple in india that feeds 40000 people a day for free if people would be less picky and collaborate than the food supply chain would be easier   i would love a buffet bag i bet if food delivery and production was more organized people could shave an hour of labor of their life we just pay for high rents and pensions and food broker middlemen,paokij
937,The corporate class is a drug addict that has no intentions of quitting,profit to them is like heroin no amount is ever enough and literally everything they do is in an effort to secure their next fix its like an episode of intervention except theres no breakthrough just endless excuses that justify they way they are and how the way theyve manipulated the peopleworld around them is okay     i cant survive if i cant get high  my business will die if we raise minimum wage     up until this point our society with the help of moneyjunkie politicians have been enthusiastic enablers year by year allowing companies to get away with more and more and more    to cope they try to gaslight us into thinking that theyre not the ones at fault or that they cant and shouldnt have to change like an addict they will use until theres nothing left only the problem with being addicted to money you can never overdose the cycle wont break itself,pap0s8
938,If your HR department is conducting group mental health learning sessions be very skeptical,hr is there to protect the investors first ask if the sessions are mandatory if they arent dont go because its going to some bullshit propaganda without any scientific evidence like mental health first aid theyre going to try to convince you that youre responsible for your emotional well being with one neat trick so they dont have to affect any changes to mitigate the bullshit the company puts you through every day  if its mandatory document your conversation with hr and still decline if its a mandatory group session for all employees then it means they arent singling you out for poor performance and in most jurisdictions an employer cant force psychological counseling on employees they can fire you for poor performance but they cant force you to get blanket psychological treatment  get in touch with a lawyer but dont tell your employer youve done so tell the lawyer whats going on that theyre trying to force you into counseling sessions from unqualified individuals these hr mental health sessions are never conducted by psychologists let the lawyer know hr hasnt even spoken to you about your personal productivity theyre simply forcing the treatment if hr cans you for not attending then call your lawyer upb again youll be making a case of psychological bullying in the workplace not wrongful dismissal it pays out way way more  the lawyer will take about half but the typical payout is about 500k for psychological bullying so youll be in the money use that money to take a nice break from bullshit jobs,pau4pk

940,My Brother's Experience At A New Job Epitomizes Everything Wrong With The System.,background my brother was recently hired at a large grocery store chain in the us during the interview he said that he needs between 2025 hours a week but cant go over that because of his obligations at college the hiring manager said it wouldnt be a problem and even promised him a set schedule everything seemed great until the first day of work  my brother ended up working in the severely understaffed bakery department the woman who was supposed to be training him also had to run the bakery so my brother got little to no training in how to do his job properly this is problem number one i notice in many lowpaying jobs inadequate training from overstressed staff how was this poor woman expected to train him and run the bakery at the same time was my brother just expected to understand everything in one second flat apparently yes  remember how i said he was promised a good schedule it was a lie he ended up working 10 hours on his first two days with no lunch breaks he said management kept coming by telling them how terrible of a job they were doing keep in mind there were two people in the bakeryone of them being a brand new hireand god only knows how many responsibilities a good manager wouldnt have berated them instead the manager wouldve helped them or at the vey least sent someone over from a less busy department to help   naturally my brother decided to quit i suggested that he simply ghost them because they treated him like a pile of horse dung but he decided to go in and tell them he was quitting because he has more integrity then those scummy managers ever will instead of accepting his resignation and wishing him well like a mature adult she called him irresponsible and all sorts of nasty things but the best part of the whole thing is that the manager wanted to call my mom to tattle on my brother for quitting my brother is an adult and my mother encouraged him to quit im honestly surprised my brother didnt go off on her and i think it shows that he really was the bigger person in the situation   he was making 1175 in a state with an extremely high cost of living and this manager thought she had power over him hilarious bad managers cant handle the fact that the labor shortage is allowing people to walk away from shitty jobs in favor of being treated like a human being   he has to go pick up his check in a few days should be fun,paxleq
941,Just quit a crap job,i was working at a dispensary i ran the kitchen and made all the edibles for the entire company for 12 an hour and they refused to give me more than 3 days a week despite the fact that they were hiring for other spots within the company such as budtender the position i worked i should have been paid so much more i worked my ass off producing candy of various forms and packaging it alone doing all the paperwork involved to put it in the state system and all the internal paperwork required then she liked it on my eod report if i wrote down what i did with ever second of my day which i always thought was stupid to begin with and ive never had to do that anywhere else it isnt a state requirement just a personal preference of hers i asked to work up front too they told me that it wasnt a good idea because it would interfere with my work in the back as if im supposed to never work any other hours because it interferes with my other 3 days as if those three days can monopolize my time so i of course told them i would be filling those days at another job then and i would continue to work for them but they would have to rearrange the days i come in at will so that i can work a main job i mean i kind of liked the work so i had to text my boss on monday i need wednesday off there is a hiring event i need to attend for a job that pays what i need it to despite being agreeable to me on this subject all the times in the past that i had brought it up she responds kind of rudely telling me i needed to not be demanding and ask just like any other employee that i needed to understand our relationship and where i stood cool nothing i said was demanding anyway she tells me today to come in to see her for half an hour today is my day off and i had plans i went to that interview early i got in sooner i told her i could not come in as i was busy she got upset about that and was rude again so i just said im done i wasnt rude i just said i felt she put me in the position to have to choose so i did to which she tells me i better come in and get my stuff or it will be disposed of by the end of the day and drop my key off and a couple other messages i havent dared read yet i dont care i think i got the new job anyway and it pays almost double what i made at the damn dispensary anyway ugh it upset me a little to have the boss lady come unglued on me out of the blue   tldr quit job cuz boss was being rude got another job that pays double what i made in the same day with more hours,pat0cw

943,I'm about to quit my job because... life,so i started on a new job about half a year from now this job normally is 40hweek which is a shit already in my opinion but ok its doable also i can pay my stuff and still have time for my 3yo dog   now i am not the type of guy that prioritizes money i like it yes but is not a guide for my life whenever they ask me to do more hours i always refuse i really dont care about if im getting more or less at the end of the month i care if i lose time with my family and my dog  so my boss put me in a new spot for a month where i work 56h week he said it was temporary and it was just this one time of course i didnt mind it was only this month and then everything will go back to normal schedule  heres the thing my dog was the first feeling the change of routine last week i got a call from the police about noise complain my dog was howling and crying i wanted to get the facts checked i installed a camera and recorded while i was away indeed my dog was howling and crying this broke my heart  its been almost 3 years and this was the first complain so this was a big sign that things arent fine and something has to change and between earning a few more money and my dog i dont need to think twice so first measure i took was to get my dog to someone she knows my aunt who also has a dog that loves to play with mine while im working this many hours until i go back to normal schedule like i said  thing is they released the new information about the next month and they put me in the same spot again working 56hweek for me and my dog sake fuck no my dog only has 15  years left to live im not wasting time on getting more money instead i will take that time to spend quality time making memories for both of us   already said im not going to work again the same schedule either they will understand or ill find another job even if it doesnt pay the same i will win with more time for me and my dog   family things need to change we are not bags of money like they see us,pax5qo

945,BOOTLICKERS. Or how i learned to stop worrying and love the shoplifters.,this exhaustion pain and rage filled rant it about those cunts who work for giant corporations like coles myer aldi who for whatever stupid fucken reason take their unimportant role at the local store way way too seriously and engage in excessive adherence to company policies with little consideration for those actual humans that work as employees there occasionally you know the type  the new boss who chastises u for time theft when u clock in late by 2mins yet punch out 10mins late every shift the one who loves to invasively bagcheck every customer they can because woe betide the company losing the revenue from a loaf of bread that a clearly struggling single mum tried to hide under her trolley  i worked at a large supermarket chain and would sometimes wish that people with real financial struggles just went ahead and shoplifted more seriously  by the time an item is being scanned any losses to damagetheft impact primarily on the businesss revenue as they are the final stage before a consumer pays for a product the farmer shelf stocker truckdriver etc have all been compensated already and while i know losses from theft are passed on to the consumer via higher prices but somehow never via cutting executive bonuses hmm if you knew how much we write off as wastage every single day youd understand shoplifting losses where i am barely dent the bottom line   so i cheer for the thieves i dont do it myself as no product would come close to being worth losing my job but i do however often notice ignore and then internally cheer for a shoplifter if i see them doing their thing and theyre being kind not rude and otherwise pleasant then i often pretend not to notice and just wish them a good day   i mean do they think i would be enthusiastic to confront a petty thief zero training is provided on how to go about this btw because hes stealing some shit from a billion dollar company when the stolen items comined value is a tenth of our daily writeoff stock value nah bro i aint a bootlicker like that    which brings me to my true rant of rage has anyone else worked with those retail workers often in middle manager  type positions at megacorporations like colesmyer group or similar giants like aldi woolies etc who will fire a struggling employee over a stolen pack of gum and then feel good about it they seriously disgust me literally serving as corporate lapdogs being manipulated to enrich their masters and all without the self awarenes or humility to ever see the companyemployee relationship for how subtly abusive nd exploitative it is or to recognise how large corporations cleverly exploit their employees psychology and emotions to breed loyalty to company and incentivise behaviours which produce maximum profits for the top executives  if only i knew how to show them the companykoolaiddrinkers i mean the confronting reality of their embarassing waste of their one go at existance the bootlickers often trading a third or more of each of their days  irrecoverable single use only days  of which theyll never ever get back priceless memories and rich human experiences all traded for the sycophantic pursuit of enriching someone whom theyre unlikely to have ever even met whose personal drive to acquire wealth has surpassed their practical needs and caused currency itself to alter its primary role for them from a redeemable promisory note entitling the bearer to a quantity of gold or silver to simply a medium of amassing power influence and immunity from the laws and restrictions that are intended to apply to all citizens equally    other immoral yet legal things such as the ability to influence legislature and policies in self serving ways through political donations and deals as well as gain access to other arbiters of wealth and power which can then pool their financial and political influence synergistically to not only form a positive feedback loop of gaining wealth and power simply for wealth and powers sake to the detriment of the rest of society but also to directly influence geopolitics public policy and even public opinion on specific issues by simply utillising their own media companies to generate support of their agenda and paying for the same from any they dont yet own this enables ceos of megacorps and the ultrarich to directly influence the very tone and direction of society just look at murdoch and the effect hes had on aus uk and us he helped elect trump boris and scomo indirectly causing nearly a million dead individuals who may have survived had competent governments been in power how could anybody work for him knowing not just that your paycheck funds originate from the suffering of others and the degredation of society but that none of the extra money he gains from your work makes any difference to his enormous net worth anyway  i view those retail workers u know the type who drink the company koolaid and then rigorously work towards a goal of enriching their corporate overlords  the same way i view murdoch journalists working hard to spread his harmful manipulative agenda both groups are large groups of pathetic and essentially inconsequential individuals who are either so gullible that they swallow and accept corporate propoganda unironically so dumb as to be convinced that a small group of ultrarich being worshipped rewarded and given huge amounts of money and power is a desirable ideal situation or are otherwise simply psychopaths who genuinely value their own bank balance andor career progression more than they value the wellbeing of the rest of society  because of these beliefs i find it hard to give a shit about customers shoplifting unless its just disrespectful or egregious or negatively affects others somehow otherwise deep down i cheer for shoplifters and honestly hope they steal more  and then go and use those savings to shop honestly at local stores and help support your community instead of megacorporation ceos for whom your money doesnt even have meaning anymore sure they account for losses to theft in pricing but if everyone just stole 1 thing every shopping trip the losses might lead to prices rising and local shops becoming able to compete with prices again   tldr fuck giant conglomerate corporations i work for one and i secretly cheer company losses and am curious whether mine is a radical andor misinformed perspective that makes me an asshole or if other retail workers sometimes feel this way too,pas5va

948,Thoughts on anti-work..., i  see antiwork as a kind of counterweight to balance out some of the more corrosive aspects of our workobsessed culture the one we live and breathe every day  according to anthropologists in times not very long ago in historical terms  humans in huntergather societies enjoyed a 15hour workweek  true  survival was hard back then but this reveals how our ancestors thrived more by being adaptable and smart rather than merely working harder  after all you only need to kill one bison to feed your entire village  whats the point of doing more than is prudent and necessary  even  henry ford recognized the need for antiwork when he advanced the idea of a 40hour workweek in the early 20th century  upon seeing how  reducing the hours of work from 48 to 40 per week actually increased worker productivity by a significant margin  just as the great economist john maynard keynes predicted decades ago we find ourselves living at a time of enormous abundance thanks to technology and automation on a global scale  our times are unprecedented in human history which means we dont really have historical parallels with which to compare and make sense of our world today  the story of the last 2  decades has been that the vast majority of wealth gains produced from major advances in technology and globalization have been realized by a  tiny fraction of people  just a few hundred wealthy families in the world in fact  for the rest of us the vast vast majority barely any gains at all  i believe a wise  and prudent discussion on the meaning and future of work in the 21st  century is not only good for us today but beneficial for future generations as well,patv9v

960,The Horse that put itself down,in 2011 i graduated with a bachelors in mechanical engineering with nothing to show for it except a job at one of the big 3 automakers four years of studying engineering had not instilled a sense of wonder at the sublime beauty of an automobile differential my lecturers had done a miserable job at teaching an outdated pedagogy to a cohort of students driven by the insecurities of their parents who had viewed getting a job as the ultimate marker of a good education  i hated my first job all everybody cared about was output fuck employee development fuck mental health fuck engagement fuck you if you cant give me those files by the end of the day what ground my gears worst of all is that the company called laptops assets and employees resources  the only thing that kept me going was a guaranteed seat in one of my countrys best management programs i was too scared to scuttle my prospects of a bright career by jumping jobs or trying something new i was scared  after a yearlong mba that i will cherish forever i joined one of the big 4 consulting firms my year there was marked by a hierarchy that treated young consultants as prostitutes who were encouraged to network and keep up their utilization if they didnt they were screwed and thats what happened to me right in the middle of the covid pandemic i was put into a performance improvement program that was nothing but an excuse to provide grounds for firing if they really wanted to improve my performance i never knew nobody had a conversation with me about what i was doing wrong nobody wanted to hear my side about what had been going on over the year three months after that i was fired  in the same week that i had a breakup those last six months put me into a spiral of anxiety and depression that still resurfaces from time to time   those months of unemployment actually helped me regain my selfimage to an extent i no longer had the pressure of deadlines and the need to keep up appearances of competence i could finally tell myself that yes i sucked at the job but its okay to suck at something you could suck because of a lack of skills an unsupportive team the job not engaging you or maybe even issues outside of work entirely but  parents friends teachers influencers entrepreneurs and politicians drill this idea in your head that its your responsibility to not suck youre fed this rhetoric of a dog eat dog world where even a moment of reflection or vulnerability with your boss is an admission of failure this turns a simple lack of knowledge or skill into a weakness to be eliminated with nobody to lean on but yourself and so companies save a lot of money by placing the onus of upskilling on the employees  fortunately my unemployment lasted only three months and im working for an ecommerce major but the hamster wheel doesnt change everyones out to cover their asses and new employees are supposed to do the job from day 1 with just a few basic pointers and a goody bag i dont imagine that my selfimage will separate from the work i do at any point  after all were trained to be horses that will put themselves down when they break a leg,pahlls

962,Left My Job After 2 Months,i was working as a community manager for a totally new videogame studio with 7 employees thats working on its first game  they had a core hours policy where we have to be online and reachable for 2 hours a day but work whenever the rest of the day which was neat at first to be honest  my main responsibility was to create a community for the game to hype it up by creating some social media campaigns and interact with the audience till release  the thing is there is no game yet i had zero content to work with so they added another responsibilities to do like managing all the social media accounts facebook twitter reddit instgram organizing a content plan for the studios youtube channel where they post a weekly podcast that i also edit reaching for people in the videogame industry to appear as guests in that said podcast designing thumbnails they also tasked me with creating a fundraiser campaign on kickstarter to raise fund for the upcoming game  i never under delivered though and delivered my tasks on time attended the daily sprint meeting on time when they tried to reach me outside of the core hours i was available yet the senior developer which was also my team leader was always passive aggressive and spoke to me in a condescending way but i brushed it of as jokes and moved on  one day i had a very important errand to do before the daily meeting so i gave them a heads up that i am gonna be slightly late and i was 3 minutes late the meeting was normal but then i saw the team leads reply to my heads up message where hes giving crap about me being late and i should have planned better as its easier with the core hours system in another day he told me that my grammar is off because of a video title i wrote that was missing a question mark  started to burn out i reported to the ceo that i didnt appreciate the team leads tone with me and he stood strongly with me and he agreed it wasnt acceptable but the day after all the three of us had a call where i was basically in the naughty corner both of them kept agreeing with other against me and how wrong i was and said the work environment doesnt have to be friendly all the time with some aggressiveness in between to keep people in check but i didnt like that at all so i quit a day later  some time after i left the studio i saw a podcast where they were discussing which way will they place the computers whether the developers facing the office or the wall they decided to let the developers face the wall so they can see the screen clearly to know if hes slacking off with them saying their privacy doesnt matter  i am glad i quit in the probation period before everything went sideways my biggest red flag was when we were discussing how late i was for the meeting i told them that many times before you reached me outside work hours and i was available they responded with you could have said youre not working right now which is true but the fact they are negating the fact that i didnt is really making me feel mad and underappreciated,pakb3b

968,One too many rules just to take a deuce in my own home.,they have this policy where you need to get permission to call the attendance line to leave early for any reason there is also a policy where you have to clock out just to use the restroom if youre going to be occupied longer than 2 minutes fair enough i guess but in order to clock out  you must call the attendance line before you call the attendance line you must request permission from a supervisor you can see where this is going  queue my gut issues dealing with issues for years but have been having a particularly annoying flare up the last month btw this is a wfh remote position so permission must be asked through the work discord page   asked a supervisor if i were correct in my assumption that we had to ask permission to call and clock they agreed and ask for the reason i provided it then ghost  didnt hear a thing  no confirmation no acknowledgment nothing for nearly 20 mins now i know policy and im quite sure they were expecting me to get back to work until i received an answer   but here is my thing im not asking permission per say im really just providing a courtesy notice because if they denied my request do you really think i was just going to say okay then sht myself   no no  called the line called out called out today will probably call out tomorrow already have 2 interviews tomorrow before the shift if i clock in and an interview set up for the following day  i havent asked for permission to take a sht since high school and ive never experienced that in my own home   i allowed a lot of red flags to slide because i enjoyed the work but not anymore  tf i look like asking for a hall pass in my own home   anyways thanks for letting me vent protect your peace folks protect your peace,paf6mp

973,Took my first vacation ever and now I want to quit and live on an island.,hey everyone i am an attorney and i used to be a workaholic i went straight through college and law school and got admitted to the bar at 25 i started my first litigation job in a government office shortly after that i spent the next three years working 2500 hours a year  sometimes sleeping on a couch in my office just to get work done i will admit at the time it didnt seem like a problem i was a single guy living with my parent and i was very fortunate to benefit from his hard work i went to work went home worked out and saved money but i didnt feel fulfilled   i ended up having an office mate that turned into a friend and is now my fiancee she is the best thing to ever happen to me she has opened my eyes to travel and having new experiences trying new food and just not letting life pass you by we are total opposites lol but she is undoubtedly my soulmate anyway i left that government job never taking a vacation ever i used some sick days but in the end i had 430 hours of personal leave time left i thankfully got it all paid out to me which was nice but i started a new job   my fiancee and i went to the caribbean recently for 7 days and 6 nights it was my first plane trip first time leaving the country and i was terrified when we landed the country was beautiful the atmosphere just hit different waking up the following morning  a monday  and being able to lay in bed in this new place get breakfast at 10am go back to the room to change go to the beach til 3pm go back to the hotel to cuddle and get lunch and get ready for dinner at 7pm made me realize how much you can really enjoy time with your family and loved ones when you are not burdened by an alarm clock travel to work and the constant chime of an office phone or email notification it was an all inclusive and easily the best week of my life   i am now back at work and i miss her every day our time together usually after 7 or 8pm every night is stressful we can barely discuss or wedding or enjoy time without our jobs being there in our minds i just sorely miss the opportunity to sit with her on a beach and relax at least when we were remote during covid we could take some time to just sit with each other and enjoy a quick episode of 90 day fiance   first post here just wanted to share a now disillusioned attorney perspective from someone who was saved from being a workaholic by the woman of my dreams hoping i can work til just past the wedding next year and maybe find a job translating or teaching english in a beautiful island living a relaxing life with my wife,papajv

1011,Promotion AND a pay cut - I’ll see myself out.,title says it all really the company i work for has completely outdone themselves in tone deafness  at the start of the covid situation i took on a hell of a lot more responsibilities and duties that were outside my role in order to help the business while 90 or my colleagues sat at home receiving 100 salary my company topped up their furlough payments which is pretty nice however the ones left working got and have yet to receive any sort of recognition or remuneration despite one of the busiest and toughest periods in the companys history above and beyond doesnt cut it that said over a year later and the director of the company sat me down and told me how hard they worked in the background to get me a promotion despite the current economic climate and i should be thankful they are putting my needs first and showing their appreciation   the catch  they were quick to follow this with now there wont be any salary reviews with this due to the aforementioned economic issues and that we could maybe review it next year if the business continued to overperform notice overperform  despite the down turn we raked in a tidy profit ms and are continuing to do so with normality returning and i personally oversaw a fair portion of that so all in companys doing great on for a record year despite the problems worked harder than ever and getting a paper promotion in title alone which as it turns out was an admin error on the companys part as they accidentally gave out title changes to less senior roles which then upped mine by default  so they essentially lied about the why and underdelivered on the what so they essentially took any negotiation leverage away updated my responsibilities list and are telling me to be thankful or what is essentially an invisible pay cut  ive told them that ive been made a lucrative offer by another company and they have literally bent over backwards to try and keep me and offer me those things which were completely off the table until the threat of pulling the plug came up i do so much and there is no effective succession planning so theyd be screwed   i plan to hand my notice in in two days as ive found another role within a different outfit who sound actually excited to have me and my skills set a new job to escape an old job is essentially just moving prison cells but the takeaway from here is that regardless of how much effort you put in nobody cares until its likely to hit their pocket or increase their workload talk is fr and conglomerates will happily pay you in platitudes  know your worth folks and dont settle for any less  dont be afraid to take a risk to improve your situation when its sensible to do so,pakxqi

1013,Fired for 'Dress Code' from Hospital that didn't take COVID seriously,just wanted to share my current unemployment story  during the height of the 2020 pandemic i was working at an it help desk office in my small midwest towns local hospital  i learned quickly to repress any sort of expression or personality and to not chime in when i heard coworkers expressing what i found to be ignorant and unprofessional views  our office was packed to capacity in a relatively small enclosed area  our hospitals ceo had implemented mask mandates for all onsite employees but there were still many in the office who refused to wear their masks  having had a previous stint with cancer i brought my concerns to my office manager multiple times  after weeks of no enforcement i decided to anonymously contact hr hr showed up unannounced at my office and we got dingedfailed audit  my boss called me into her office revealed she knows it was me who alerted hr and that she was disappointed because she was just about to address the office about mask enforcement  whatever you say  our office had a rotating office runner role where if it was your day to be runner you were allowed to wear jeans and tennis shoes due to the physical nature of the role as long as you had a shirt displaying the hospitals logo  my other coworkers very often got away without wearing shirts with hospital logo and so i never really bothered to go out of my way to order shirts id have to pay for myself  i had been runner many times without wearing a logo shirt just like the others  i finally ordered some shirts just to be on the safe side and it takes several weeks for them to arrive  a month or so after reporting safety noncompliance to hr i was performing runner duties when my manager approached me in front of the rest of the office to make sure everyone heard and told me i needed to go home and change into dress pants and shoes because i wasnt wearing a logo shirt  i told her not only were my shirts were ordered and arriving soon but nobody else seems to be held to this standard  never mind the fucking obvious hospital photo id badge clipped and displayed on my shirt pocket  id put up with way too much bullshit overall at this job at that point to not reply with im not going to perform runner duties in dress clothes  so i did and in front of the whole office she told me to clock out and go home for the day  without a word i stood up and walked out  the next day i showed up and sat at my desk and was called into a conference room where my manager and hr rep told me id been fired for dress code noncompliance  in the 2 minutes that took i came back out to my desk and found in those 2 minutes my entire desk was dismantled and all of my personal effects were packed up and dumped into a box waiting for me on my chair  good  riddance  ive been riding the unemployment train ever since december 2020 and i honestly feel like i earned it and i dont allow family or friends to shame me for it  fuck you i earned this mental break  when i decide to return to work i can promise you i will only look for 100 remote positions  theres no need to go to a physical building every day to sit at a computer being forced to listen to what i find to be horrifically ignorant political banter   no i dont want to go to go bowling as a team builder  no i dont want to come in this weekend for coverage when im burnt out telling myself all week just make it to the weekend  you got this  no im not here to make friends and i dont want to hang out with you outside of work  ill gladly elect to work a pizza delivery job before i ever subject myself to anymore of this inperson office horseshit,para6k

1047,Tips for calling into work when sick,i came down with a cold yesterday and when i call into work i do not get paid time off i usually have trouble getting the day off this is because i supposedly am a very important role in the workplace many people call off and dont receive the same treatment as me for example an employee calls off at least once a week and they dont say much to them about it i call off once maybe every 4 months because i get chronic sinus infections and i get told that a sinus infection is not a good enough reason to call in last time i got sick i made a post on facebook about regretting not taking my allergy medication and a coworker took it upon themselves to show my boss which created lots of issues i now get very stressed about calling off more than i ever did before i havent called off since then and its been months i have tried asking for a half day instead of a full day and i have tried texting instead of calling its usually accompanied by come in until we can figure something out or a harsh response im just very stressed about the whole situation and i think i just need someone to validate what im feeling and provide advice thanks,paalih

1050,"I am about to turn down a ""good"" job offer because I am expected to work there until I retire and I hate the field of work...",hello  my dad worked in a bank before retiring last year he worked there for over 35 years he applying for me to work there i did a couple interviews and tomorrow is probably the final one they want me to work as an architect i graduated from arch school but i never worked in architecture since graduation because i hated it in school i now work as an english teacher and i love it mostly and i am also thinking about learning it on the side so that i may get a job in that field in the future  i hate architecture and i dont want to work in the same place for 35 years but if i told my parents that the bank called me for an interview ill probably be forced to attend the interview choosing what you love over what is stable and makes money is a crazy thought to them  please tell me what to do i actually know what i want to do but i am so nervous that my parents might find out that i turned down the offer i am 28 yo for fcks sake but i still live with them but i pay for my things i am diagnosed with borderline and i know working at a bank and as an architect is gonna be stressful as hell and i was on the brink of suicide a couple times because of stress  help,pa1is8
1051,Was denied promotion to Manager 8 months ago. One of the Managers in my team is leaving. Should I apply to the job formally via my company's website? Nobody in my team even suggested me to the position.,hi there as the title says i was denied promotion some months ago  it was really rough stood up for myself on why i didnt think it was fair but it didnt go anywhere   now a manager who is way less qualified than me is leaving the team and the position became open on my companys website should i just apply    im not sure of what to do nobody in my team even suggested the position for me which hurts also not sure if applying directly will make my manager hate me for basically going behind her back any thoughts,p9wm3p
1052,Way out of the misery,i cannot resist to write this but as i have been following this subreddit and reading all the posts and rants about working soul sucking slaving not having time or passion for other activities it makes me wonder   whats the solution to get rid of these bad feelings   a little of my background i am 26 from europe with bachelors degree  so luckily without a debt  students loan i chose the field i studied and now work in by very much random it pays quite well hours are okay but its stresfull and i do not like it much i come home after 8 hours in the office often more tired and miserable than when i had two mentally easy jobs and worked 70  80 hours per week   i quite liked working as a waiter or customer service in car rental company driving around the city to aiports  meeting people made me happy   however this is age when i and i believe other people start think about family buying their own place future security perhaps health both mental and physical and i know that working easy job would not allow me to consider getting a mortgage or take care of 3 people if i had a girlfriend and a kid which i dont have because i either dont have time or will to be actively meeting many new people  i need time to get along with people so most of my friends i met in school and jobs and we have known each other for a long time moreover my colleagues now are mostly 40  working for the company 10 years and taking it quite seriously  no fun part in working included you get the point nothing much to look for in the morning   i dont want to live with my parents forever or rent cheap flats when having an easy job where i am happy but dont earn much i am not from a family that has that much money to allow me not to work for it so if i want to be independent from family i need to earn more and be dependant on the higher paycheck that will allow me to save more  sometimes i feel that as i get older and more used to the workplace it will get better and easier and more enjoyable even though its not a dreamjob maybe with experience i will be able to get an offer that suits me better and will be happier  i could write so much more about my thoughts on this consumerism and not wanting to work but i will be just going in circles  if you made it here thank you and congrats let me know your thoughts and i would love to chat and look for solutions to happier work life balance ,pa8q5v

1056,Raged quit my job. Feeling really down.,i have worked in customer service related jobs since i was 16 so about 6 years now i ended up in therapy because the last job i had in 2019 caused me so stress and anxiety that i had to be put in a mental hospital throughout 2020 i was in therapy for my work related ptsd and was advised not to go back to customer service jobs but i am 22 in college and i live in a place where non customer service related jobs are few and far in between in may of 2021 i started working at the restaurant my fianc works at and thought it would be okay it wasnt i dealt with tons of abuse from my boss and customers it caused me to spiral after my shift last night and i was freaking out this morning about going back and ended up no call no showing its not like i could even call out to get myself to calm down because we are so short staffed that they would be bully and berate me until i came in so my only option was to not go in and lose my job feeling so down i feel trapped in a loop that i cant escape and therapymedication isnt helping at all i wish life couldve been different for me and everyone else,p9pkhw

1090,Not sure if I can stomach much more of boomers blaming younger generations for the shitty work cultures and broken economy that they’re leaving us.,i was fired from my job in retail last week an assistant store manager had been sexually harassing me so i reported it corporate demoted her to the lower management position of my department and then they fired me for time theft because i took a few extra minutes on my break a few times and someone reported it no verbal or written warning no coaching no suspension just youre fired but she got to keep her job  fast forward to today i go over to my parents house to do some laundry and hang out i love them dearly and theyre good people but i dont think theyll ever understand what its like for younger generations to hold down a job in the workplaces that theyre leaving us  to be clear i know i didnt get fired for time theft i got fired because i told a superior to stop treating me inappropriately i confronted a boss and reported their awful predatory behavior i stuck up for myself and made it clear that i wouldnt tolerate unprofessionalism or hostility from a colleague it sucks and i hate that it happened to me  but the fucked up thing that hurts worse than losing my job is how little empathy my parents and other boomers have for me and others like me they know its a different world than the one they grew up in but they act like were whiny lazy bad with money and just dont want to work anymore meanwhile were being systemically crushed and depleted by a system that was supposed to reward us for hard work and provide us with a sustaining quality of life yet has done the exact opposite  its a system that they were able to buy into at our age they maintained it cultivated its atmosphere and shaped its culture and now theyre cashing in their chips while judging us for their failures why dont you work more hours why cant you save money why arent you buying a house you shouldnt be struggling to make a car payment just cancel your spotify  when i told my parents why i was fired their response was well thats not surprising it literally made sense to them that i was sexually harassed by my boss and lost my job because i reported it but they cant wrap their heads around why i might have trouble saving money or making ends meet in this current economy  this entire incident has effected me financially socially personally and professionally i am deeply depressed and stressed about all of it and after four hours of trying to put it all in terms that my parents might understand im feeling very hopeless that they ever will my dad has been white collar management since i can remember my mom has never had a job i really shouldnt be shocked  but it still hurts and it really makes me not want to hang out with them or any other oblivious boomers anymore,p9qi5j

1094,My advice for some people on this sub (hear me out)...,ill start by saying a few things firstly this is definitely not going to be for everyone and isnt even an option for everyone second this isnt gonna be about policy or philosophy its simply a suggestion to certain people anyway heres my suggestion for something you may wanna try  play poker  hear me out first an obvious side note this is of course not for everyone this is for people a that dont have any history of problems with gambling and have have some amount of self discipline make no mistake this is indeed gambling but so is the stock market or any number of other real jobs gambling where you have the edge is still gambling b for whom a day job is just not an option or they desperately need a way out and dont know how c that dont have ambitions of being rich i think this is most of you people that only want to make enough money so they can get by and have the rest of their time to themselves d enjoy the game if its something you find extremely boring then obviously this isnt for you as it would just be work i think most people generally enjoy the game but havent really given it much consideration this post is for those people  im not going to go into many details or name any specific resources in regards to where to play or where the best place to learn and improve is besides saying that twitch is probably a good start there are an endless number of resources and information available with a simple google search and thats not the point of this post ill also say that online is the bestmain way to play and you likely do have options to play online if you live in most of europe or certain us states there are plenty of regulated options otherwise its still legal and safe for you to play on a number of sites you are not breaking any laws buy doing so and whether or not these unregulated meaning the government isnt watching sites are breaking any laws is contested what is not contested is that as a player you are not breaking any laws whatsoever  here are the main reason im suggesting this 1 you can start from 0 and my advice here is to do so exclusively never put your own money in contrary to popular belief you need absolutely no startup money every single online platform offers multiple freerolls daily meaning a tournament that is free to enter and has cash prizes usually under 5 and only for the top 20 or so players depending on how many enter this will serve a dual purpose as a way to start your bankroll and also getting your beginner practice for free itll take a while but once you make your first little bit you can move on to microstakes where you play for 1 2 cents and 2 is a full buyin for most games its also much easier to beat the early levels no matter what so losing players will tell you theyre just looking for an excuse 2 this might be the most meaningful here your progress are dependent on only yourself and your brain you work for no one no one is exploiting you you are completely outside the system if you stick to the basic principles mainly bankroll management then you will progress if you get better when you fail its on you when you succeed its on you 3 youll find that 99 of the pitfalls especially in your early stages is just fallacies your own brain tries to trick you into if you are confident in yourself and your discipline and approach it from that viewpoint you will already be further ahead than 99 of the field 4 poker is a zerosum game meaning yes when you win it will come from other players however the main difference between poker and the big game of capitalism or life or whatever you wanna call it is that absolutely no one is forced to play it 100 of players does so voluntarily in a way poker is one of the most fair things there is nothing about you matters except your skill there is no way to take advantage of others except by being better at the thing you both agreed to play poker doesnt care about what you think or who you are or what class of society you where born into it only cares about the cards and your skill and no players with more money hold absolutely no advantage over you likely the opposite that is not if you follow the basic principles sure if you break the most fundamental of principles and buy in with your whole bankroll and are too scared to really play with it then yea technically someone less scared can push you around but were never gonna be in that situation because we are not idiots  this whole process will likely take a few months and by then youll know if this is something you really love something thats not for you or something in the middle like maybe a side source of income worst case scenario is you spend a couple of months playing a game you like if you follow the instructions above it should cost you no money but i will say one more time that you have to have the selfdiscipline not to do anything stupid i made this post here because most people here say that

1187,My satisfying revenge on an employer who wanted me to beg him for a job.,  this was a few years back but it is still the most satisfying moment against an employer in my life   i had just left university and was struggling to find a job related to my degree my dad passed just before graduation and i was desperate for money a job came up it was a temp job for about 6 months and very low pay but i needed to take on anything i was offered an interview and honestly looking back i feel such pity for my younger self i was trying so hard to dress and act grown up for my first real job  on the day there was a big storm in my town the bus only took me half the way i got there looking like a hybrid of the girl from the ring and a drowned rat everything felt like it was against me  it was a tiny start up run by this arrogant but obviously insecure 30 year old man he saw me and laughed before even saying hello i was already humiliated but followed him into the room  he sat me down and leaned back in his big chair with his armed crossed over his beer belly and said  so tell me why should i hire you  the rest of the interview had the same tone he really seemed like he wanted me to beg him for it he would swing the money which was extremely low in my face because he knew i needed this he would laugh and smirk when i showed him my work and even after all questions were asked he seemed to really just want to drag it out longer because he was enjoying the power trip  when i got home and changed out of my damp cold clothes i just felt humiliated and dirty i checked my mail to see that he already sent me a rejection email saying something like i feel your work wasnt up to our standards and you lack the experience i shut it off and went to bed trying to forget about it and keep in mind the position was temp and only 6 months  the very morning after i got a very surprise email from a large company i jokingly applied for weeks ago because i thought i had zero chance asking me to head out to another country for an interview with them all paid for long story short it went well and within 3 weeks i was told that i had landed my first real job  2 weeks after that i was already packing up my life relieved and excited to finally get started in my career when i noticed a new email from the startup company that rejected me the email said hi we would like to invite you to another interview as our recent hire didnt live up to our expectations  so they wanted me back  i accepted and went back to them within days of getting the email the same guy greeted me and took me into his office only this time i wasnt nervous or trying to impress i was just being me and you could feel his discomfort why isnt she intimidated by me running though his head  he started saying so luckily for you im going to give you another chanc and i cut him off and delivered the most satisfying line of my life  sorry but let me just stop you there i have actually just been hired by ltinsert big companygt so i will not be needing this temp position i wanted to come down here to let you know in person rather than reject your offer by mail i feel that this position at your company isnt right for my needs or skill level whereas this new company is also your pay is 3x less than what i will earn over there in a junior position but thank you for the interview experience  he was a mix of pissed off and broken as if his inner lack of confidence in the real world had shown its face in his shitty little office that day he said fine ok and then walked me out  to this day i still feel that tingle of joy when i think of it also if anyone is wondering the company went bust not long after,p9e4kd

1293,Labor Shortages in a Capitalists' America moving towards the future.,for the past few months weve seen many business owners especially in the foodservice industries along with particular occupations especially agriculture that have been enduring an extended labor shortage  we often hear some business owners consumers and even rightwing punditstalking head go to the tired cliches of  everyone is getting handouts from the government or are still benefiting from stimulus money  we need more people to pull themselves up by the bootstrap and find work to fill this vacant position      even though many states are back to or have exceeded unemployment numbers pre covid19 pandemic its not any of the employees fault the laidoff or furloughed workers who decided not to come back to these business or even the consumers  if your business model was to bank on always having enough hungry dogs as jon taffer expressed in his fox news interview  isnt your business model setting itself up for failure       first its a narrowminded and presumptuous plan to have with a business in the first place especially if you need a good number of people to be employees in your company  thats pure and simple that if you decide to run any operations you have to consider the human element of your business  if you dont feel you can pay your workers minimum wage or a decent living income then how can you expect to keep people in case theres a catastrophe changing economic cycles or trends or an overall reduction in active workers  alot of business owners or talkingheadspundits mostly on the right seem to only understand one aspect of capitalism or any given economic system how can the business owner especially if they are wealthy survive at any given cost  id often say by keeping wages low while not offering too many benefits they almost speak as if they are gaslighting all workers regardless if they are extremely poor to somewhat wealthy the people are  terrible lazy and only want handout arguments are swimming past lazy and tired to absolutely laughable     many states are maintaining high levels of employment even as many baby boomers with few genx ers are retiring or leaving the general work force theres nothing society can do to help this businesses unfortunately except maybe grants loans tax cuts or bailouts  for many of the business who have gotten these benefits what happened to the extra money  people benefited from the stimulus checks and are starting to move on but what is the problem for this companies     i know certain individuals like to harp on socialist and marxist programs are making people think they have to be taken care of by the government or demanding exorbitant wages just to do a job for highschoolers people with no skills immigrants or people too lazy to pick up new skills   so theres a worker shortage now the people that youve mocked also dont want to work or need to work at these jobs  it seems like you would update your business model or change the direction of your company that would be the logical things to do also as many people have said that system works fine as it is but at this moment the system is now flawed because business owners are getting what they want with minimal effort if you cannot adapt doesnt that mean your business just dies a slow painful death if your profits werent much to begin with how are you expecting to survive in the first place  employees are never obligated to stay just like all of the consumers who are not required to use your services  httpswwwblsgovweblauslauhsthlhtm  httpswwwblsgovweblauslaumstrkhtm  its like any relationship you can have a person or people be with you and you arent offering them very much to begin with they might be or wanting to ask for more out of the relationship yet you are expecting more out of them during a troubled time pandemic lets say some people lay them offfurlough them temporary breakup because you cannot afford by your own account then you come back when everything is a little bit better and ask them to restart the relationship with you on the same term from before even though they may have found something better or moved on,p89rz1

1310,Friday Inspiration: Be your own boss,i really love this sub thank you all for being here i feel like many folks here are just beginning to see the world as the stupid fucked up thing that i saw it as in 2008 where i began my journey away from capitalism and its model of sucessful person i hope to inspire you to somehow walk away from the death trap as well however you can your journey will be your own this is mine  tldr i still work but on my own terms  in 2008 i was 27 and was slaving away in marketing renting a condo in a multilevel building just bought a comfy leather couch new flat screen tv and i dont know what happened but i just realized this was not the way i quit my perfectly fine job out of the blue and went in search of a job that i liked to do luckily there was a river near by and i found whitewater rafting a lot of the guides lived on property in old school buses and for me it just clicked im in  the pay was awful the boss was awful but the job absolutely did not suck no one cared how you dressed and living on site i had practically no expenses so i did that for a while heck i did that for a decade and went to different rivers all over the country just getting paid to play other guides travel the world doing this butliving on site means that your entire existence relies on you keeping that job with that employer or renting a place when you want to move states seasonally is a bit difficult too so i started looking for land i could afford anywhere in the us that was close to a river   in 2011 i found my piece of land at a tax auction and paid cash this was my big break and it is important to do a ton of research but also not impossible to do i bought the land for 2100 about 7500 under value i was absolutely shocked no one else bid on it   made the essential improvements to make it livable in a tipi with an outdoor kitchen and outhouse the tipi was 2k and the other buildings were made of whatever i could get my hands on old wood palm fronds discarded tin free table from the side of the road i even straightened nails moved there and saved all the money that would have been spent on rent electricity internet water etc took showers elsewhere for a while friends or pay showers step one complete housing that is mine that doesnt suck money out of me constantly  i continued to guide rivers and wait tables keep my expenses super low but i still did not have enough income to qualify for aca so thats when i made the leap to not work at all for anybody else cause fuck that im working 2 jobs and still cannot afford basic healthcare benefits plus i need to build a house too 2017 income was 10189 according to my tax return   the business i started was based on a specific need in my community but also benefited me and my existence to do it i picked up recycling from people who would pay me a monthly fee to do so then i would use what i could to build my house sell aluminum cans steel and batteries for scrap and take the rest to the bigger recycling center i did not make bank doing this but i got a ton of stuff to build my house windows wood beams doors rebar shredded paper i make into papercrete bricks steel roofing wine bottles copper pipe 2x4smy house is probably 80 recycled stuff i made my own schedule it was a super easy job just to drive around and sort stuff and listen to music  i have had some bumps in the road of course i pulled all money out of my ira at one point and just started over recently recycling industry basically fell apart when china stopped accepting plastic it still gets wet inside a tipi when it rains and no flushing toilet but i never got into debt with any of this and that has been a key point in my own journey  anyway i had to pivot into something else so i just went with one of my other talents which is native plants and landscape installations i still do that today and work out of my recycled house two people also help me and we all get paid the same i just have more office hours we choose our own work schedule i recently changed my schedule so i only work mondaythursday thanks to this sub for that a lot of my normal expenses are now tax deductible like computer cell phone mileage for my truck hey actually the whole truck internet printer office paper oh yeah and plants soil mulch chainsaw weed whacker jackhammer any fucking tool i ever need   the way i look at it as long as the three of us are all getting the money we need to get and the amount of work we want to do then its a success the business does not need to be profitable because there are no investers or loans to pay or any expenses other than the normal living stuff okay there is some software and insurance that is directly business expense related very minimal that i make sure that is covered in the rates if we need more money for our time hell ill just raise the rates   there will be no getting rich no pto but also no fucked up schedules or meaningless tasks or any of the other bullshit that comes with corporate capitalism its just the 3 of us trying to live   our society needs more people to drop out and be their own boss please consider it the people in this sub are the exact people

Found a new job that seems more promising — sharing my story here to hopefully inspire one person to keep fighting against corporate bs,desperate for a job during the pandemic i settled for a call center job that promised to be better than the others i was naive and totally drank the company koolaid thinking it was great because it was remote and the people are nice it took awhile until i started seeing the red flags and ive been following this sub for awhile which helped me see how i was being exploited they severely underpay every single employee regardless of their title promotions dont come with pay raises and there is no clear pay raise structure to list a few the managers didnt do anything all day and workers were frequently infantilized and often interrogated for not hitting certain performance metrics even though the company said those metrics arent important they constantly kept adding more and more responsibilities and even had the audacity recently to lower the wage for new hires in an expensive city while all the older hires are all quitting because what they originally paid wasnt even enough to pay rent rather than paying the workers more they are trying to force everyone into a new office even though they were hired remotely and have been doing fine the past year working remotely  anyways this was slowly eating away at my mental health i wanted to quit but didnt know what to do next i absolutely dreaded applying for jobs because the process is so dehumanizing i decided to muster the energy and apply to some new jobs anyways and i got many rejections but i also got lucky and found a job description that was actually transparent and listed the pay which is 2x what i was currently paid i applied and found out recently that i got the job this new job actually has sick days whereas the old one didnt this new job also explicitly said they care more about the employees than the customers and its fully remote and it felt like i finally saw some light i quit my old job and start the new one soon and im really glad i didnt settle for less i will likely delete this post soon because i dont want this up forever but im happy to share more details in my inbox to try my best and answer any questions you may have love this sub and i hope together we can make change or at least help some individuals improve their own situation,p8oiha

1431,"Boss says theres a federal that I must receive covid test results within 24 hours, is this so?",tldr my boss insists that theres a federal law mandating that all covid test results must be available within 24 hrs is this actually true or nah      hey all looking for adviceclarification so last week i wasnt feeling well and after several days i decided to take a covid test since numbers are skyrocketing in my area right now im vaxed but so was my other friend who got it last week the test came back negative and im feeling better so all is well but when i told my boss that id be taking a covid test on monday and that id have results by wednesday he insisted that its a federal law that all covid test results are available within 24 hours this didnt sound right to me so i asked him to clarify if he was talking about the rapid test and he said no and that federal law mandates that all covid tests of any kind must give results with in 24 hours so i went to cvs to get my drive thru test done like ive done many times by now and i asked the pharmacist if she had ever heard about this federal law before and she said she hadnt well low and behold it took almost 48 hours to get my results back meaning i did miss a day of work waiting but i work as a vendor so i can easily make up the time before the end of the month this morning i went back to work and when i joined the virtual meeting my boss was again telling the whole team about this supposed federal law and even said there was a 10000 fine for any testing site that didnt get you your results within 24 hours after the call we spoke on the phone and he asked me where i went to get the test and i told him and much to my absolute horror he told me he was going to go to that cvs and talk to their manager and potentially report them i objected saying i didnt want to get anyone in trouble and i was fine but he was really insistent i felt super uncomfortable having my boss go hassle some cvs pharmacist especially because they only administer the test they dont do the lab work anyway it goes in a drop box and gets picked up and then you get the results from the lab directly so it has nothing to do with the pharmacy at all i was so freaked out i called the cvs pharmacy to warn them luckily the pharmacist i talked to was really cool about it he was like yeah cool send him over so i can tell him myself that hes wrong lol i deal with people like this all day  he confirmed that he had never heard of such a federal law and that sometimes test took up to 72 hours or more and that theres only so many hours in a day and thousands of test pouring in it would be impossible to process every single test within 24 hours not to mention if there was a law like that he would be aware of it by now he thanked me for the heads up and assured me that there are laws preventing them from even confirming to my boss i ever took a test there anyway so im starting to calm down a little but ive been stressing about this so i wanted to ask yall has anyone else ever heard of this federal law or anything even remotely similar googled it and found nothing so i thought the reddit hivemind might know and this is the only work related subreddit i trust lolol,p7sbj9

1452,Is it plausible for everyone at one company to work 4 days a week if there's enough people hired?,it just doesnt make sense to me why companies just dont hire more people so that everyone else has less work making them less stressed out happier and more productive every job ive worked ive requested parttime because mentally i know im happier only working 4 days a week 5 seems never ending almost always am i asked to work more shifts because they need help and no this is not a nobody wants to work any more post as im talking about it was this way even way before the pandemic started i dont blame anybody who doesnt want to go back to work right now not at all they need a break i didnt even expect mine to be an entire year either but i was that burnt out depressed from working too much and my schedule literally being work and then spending my entire weekend catching up on things ive missed ie house cleaning  eventually i came around as ive been bored and i want to buy things so lets see how long im okay with working until ive been worked too much i hate it again whats funny is i wouldnt hate it at all if i wasnt asked to do so much more i enjoy spending my day being productive and watching my to do list fall i dont like it when my to do list piles up and becomes never ending because i literally get so stressed out that i cry i know my limits and i know them well anyways im going on this rant as i just got home from a job interview and im always clear and upfront about only wanting to work 4 days a week the interviewer nodded their head as if they understood and then later on in the interview ended up telling me id start off part time but would work full time eventually but then said something about benefits part time right after thay it was a weird loopty scramble from how i heard it so basically what was said between the lines was i was going to work full time whenever they needed and it seems like thats going to be all the time like why even have the option for part time available in your job listing i always steer clear of the ones that say only full time sorry for the rant i just find it bogus,p7skx8

1459,How do I shut up and stop getting upset about work culture?,ive started a new job and im being trained by a young idealistic and very conscientious woman who obviously gains a lot of satisfaction and much of her identity from her work she works long hours and doesnt take breaks which sometimes means i dont get them either because training keeps going if she does  the job is something ive wanted to do for a long time even though being a bit older i dont believe in dream jobs any more just about every job ive ever had has fucked me around one way or another and it wasnt till i discovered this sub and other related subs that i realised this exploitative stuff is just the nature of paid employment and capitalism  ive made a couple of comments about being at a stage of my life and career where ive realised the importance of work  life balance and im strict with boundaries but really its because ive noticed extra work is rarely appreciated much less rewarded  by employers so i will not sacrifice my own time energy and mental health to do it   my question is how do i learn to be comfortable with a workmate that hasnt and might never learn this lesson im with her alone for hours each day and i cant pretend that i share her ideologies though i know logically that i cant be spouting any antiwork sentiments to workmates what are some nice neutral things i can say to her when she is sort of bragging about being too busy to eat her lunch or patting herself on the back for being a good worker and working herself to death i care about this job so i cant share my real opinions but i dont want to enable and support unhealthy work behaviour because its against my values and i want to work in a healthy environment i also hate not being able to be real with someone is it still exploitation if they think they love it i wish i felt that way about working but i really dont life would be so much easier,p82y0u

1510,"I married my husband, but I feel like his job is the other woman we BOTH hate.",hes worked at his previous company for almost half a decade and finally outgrew the company they were constantly over promisingunder delivering for example before the first lockdown they promised everyone pay and job security but when it came down to it let everyone go and told them to file for unemployment instead after the lockdown officially fired 70 of their staff cut pay stretched what little employees they had etc its just an all around shit company  he got a better job offer but he wanted time off which he never really got because the previous company got rid of vacation pay as well he told them he would only start 1 12 months into the future or he wouldnt be able to take the offer surprisingly they gave him the position anyway  today i dropped him off for his first day and were both depressed to say the least i feel so lost without having him in the same room i felt so spoiled in the last couple of months we had off together it sucks because i married my husband i love him i take care of him and i made vowels to him but a fucking company gets all his time and energy it absolutely broke my heart because he couldnt sleep from the dread of having to return back to work  he even began stalking this sub and saying how shitty it was that a few minutes of pleasure for his parents resulted in 60 years of working for companies that suck him dry i cant disagree with that right now im a college student seeking a software engineering degree and the plan is to retire him as soon as i find a job i loathe that he has to work i dont mind working too much but i just cant stand that all i want is to spend every moment with my husband but it isnt the reality we live in  maybe work is necessary in this life to survive but to think its normal to give all your time and energy to companies regardless of pay is not normal how is this natural in any way shape or form i dont want my coworkers or boss or office setting to make up like 70 of my flashbacks when i die i wont care for them one bit on my deathbed i genuinely believe work breaks up families those moments you have with your loved ones are so meaningful and priceless yet were forced to trade them in for completely meaningless moments all to benefit someone elses greedy dream i just feel so empty without my other half i hate work too and im glad theres a community that agrees without thinking its laziness thank you for letting me rant,p7lchr

1513,Why the worker shortage,the shortage is due to boomers finally leaving the work force  for years millennials couldnt get most entrylevel jobs or jobs with flexible schedules cause they were all tired up with boomers being hired they either got more money cause of there experience or they worked for lesser wages cause they had their social security a pension or some other source of income coming in also the companys had no need to worry paying health insurance cause they are entitled to medicare  companys got away with this for years and now the newer work force needs more cause houses groceries and all daily things needed for living are through the roof  more then enough people are applying for jobs but they wanna get paid and well these business have no interest in loosing any bottom line,p83g7f
1514,2+ Years Without a Raise,i apologize if this is the wrong sub for this but seems to be the best one for venting about work  i work for a multinational engineering consulting company and have been with the company for just over two years the pay 2 years ago was average for my position and experience but after 8 months when i asked if they would be giving raises they said theyre coming we just havent determined when one year after that having not received a raise yet i scheduled a salary review with my manager and in summary he said were not giving raises to anyone right now   my frustration is with a couple of things  1 the cost of living  inflation has skyrocketed in the last two years so even if i continued to provide the same level of value to the company without even a cost of living raise they are effectively paying me less  2 i have taken on a different role entirely from when i started that carries so much more responsibility including dealing with an absolute prick of a client and managing up to 30 projects for him  better pay is what motivates people to put up with bullshit and at this point im having a hard time caring at work i understand that you usually have to ask for a raise but getting denied a basic 2 raise after one year to offset the more realistic 810 inflation thats going on destroys my motivation to work hard,p7n5g4

1526,I walked out of my job the other day.,will try to keep this as concise as possible   i work as a ta during term time but dont get pay during holidays so i got a job as bank staff at a private nursery during the holidays so i could afford to live  i had not yet completed a full month of employment due to my second job and i was moved to a different room with different age groups almost every day on one occasion moved to a separate building this meant i had to learn a new routine and new names every day as well as gain the kids trust and build a positive relationship with them i have limited experience in a nurserydaycare and only very recently qualified regardless i managed was i told the routine no i figured it out on my own i did numerous tasks without being asked mostly cleaning sweeping floor and cleaning tables after mealtimes set up activities for children on my own the 34 age group in particular was extremely unruly and i managed to get some of them to calm down with a drawing activity   a child came to me and told me some kids had escaped into an empty room i found five children unsupervised and yet there were two extra staff there that didnt notice   another child bumped his head i took the initiative to help him and report the accident give him an ice pack standard procedure the nursery has an app that you report accidents on nobody had shown me how to use the app again there were two extra members of staff in the room   every new room i started in i also seemed to have a positive working relationship with the other staff or so i thought they expressed gratitude at the end of my shift and disappointment that i was moved to a different room each day   i submitted a new starter form which gave my emergency contact as my partner who had a clearly female name i thought nothing of it at first its illegal to fire someone for their sexual orientation but its not unheard of to find ways around it and throwing someone under the bus so that it appears that you are sacking someone for a good reason  cue getting called into the managers office and being told that staff had complained about a so called lack of initiative that i just sit around and wait to be told what to do which is of course bullshit i was not allowed a chance to explain this was clearly not an opportunity to hear my side of the story the way she spoke to me as if i had committed some heinous crime im not exaggerating she abruptly dismissed any attempts to defend myself and even scoffed at me when i started to show that i was visibly upset  then just said thats all you can go  i cried in the toilet for a bit then took off my uniform grabbed my coat signed out and left she just said thats your choice  sent a very long resignation letter explaining all this i only just received acknowledgement of the letter and told that my feedback has been forwarded this afternoon  i have no proof that my sexuality had something to do with it but the circumstances and timing is very suspicious  if its not about my sexual orientation its still clear that this is not an environment i want to work in   im glad this sub exists i have had the bad luck of having to work with some of the most abusive people i know im not the problem because i have worked with some great people as well although its not as common this sub has been so validating i had no problems with my mental health at all until i started working if you read all of it thanks i really just needed to unload  tldr thrown under a bus suspect that it may have been due to my sexual orientation but have no proof walked out before it could escalate,p8437f

1534,My dad is permanantly physically affected by a horribly stressful job he had 14 years ago,longish story my dad told me this story last night and all i could think of was this sub at the time i was pretty young and was totally unaware of what was going on 14 years ago my father was moved from a position he loved to a higher position that he felt completely unqualified for he had to manage a team and lead a project after the unfortunate death of the previous manager told the project had to go live in march that year he worked his ass off  between 18 and 20 hours per day day and night he worked and stressed and became increasingly distant from his family despite my mom being pregnant with my youngest sister the project was delayed time and time again with the final date being the 16th of july when it finally wrapped up my dad took family time off for my mom just 2 days before my sister was born he tried to sleep 10 minutes passed and hes woken up suddenly by a rush of adrenaline he tries again snaps awake he had been worked so hard that his body became accustomed to not allowing him to relax at all still in the mindset of needing to stress over this project that he knew full well he wasnt qualified for the bursts of anxiety kept him awake until he realized he needed to see a doctor the next day he was perscribed xanax to help with his shot nerves the day my sister was born he was so high on xanax that he nearly missed it im glad to say that he is doing quite well now and fully understands not to ever take on a job like that again however every now and again he will have small short violent anxiety attacks as a grim reminder of that horrible time when his job threw him into a position full of horrible stress its stories like these that make me further embrace the views of this sub and appreciate that more people are starting to see the bullshit that our bosses and managers try to put us through   thanks for making it this far have a lovely day,p7g3q1
1535,We really need to start calling people out who associate someone's job with the entirety of their personality and reason for living,when you converse with other adults for the first time is the very first question they ask you what do you do and we know very well what they mean theyre really saying i want to see how interesting you are based on what job you have and your salary determines your overall worth as a person  man do i love the look on their face when i reply with what hobbies i do in my day to day life instead of a job when they tell me they meant what kind of job i have i say i dont have a job i have hobbies  this really helps me weed out the people who arent worth my time there have been a few cases though where people have downright applauded me for sticking it to capitalism i really like these people and i keep them around   whenever i have written a lot or spent a lot of time editing my book i think gee i was definitely productive today i dont associate the word productivity with how much time i spent making someone else rich that day and you shouldnt either,p777ou

1539,"I'm out sick, but don't let that stop you from bothering me.",please forgive the rant but i need to get this off my chest before i climb a building and screech  i work in an office in which 95 of our employees are vaccinated my direct coworker is not vaccinated and has no interest in getting the covid vaccine its also worth mentioning that i absolutely hate germs and being around sick people so you can imagine my displeasure when she came into work last thursday coughing up a storm our boss made several comments about my coworker coughing but thats as far as it went  on monday our boss began her vacation and is out this entire week monday evening i started to feel odd and left my friends house after according to him looking as white as a ghost followed by throwing up over the course of the night i started to feel progressively worse when i woke up tuesday morning my nose was blocked my throat was on fire i was sweating like a stripper in church and i had severe sinus pressure i sent a text message to our acting supervisor and let her know i would not be in due to the aforementioned  i scheduled a covid test that afternoon and was told it would be between 4872 hours for results with a chance theyd come back sooner than that i screenshotted the appointment confirmation and the pending results section to our acting supervisor to show that i both scheduled and attended said appointment when i was hired i was told i could work from home once and awhile and figuring that this is an important week for us since i work in the billing department that instead of being out sick and not contributing in any way that i work from home to ensure everything gets done in time for friday  the acting supervisor didnt get back to me until this morning and said that the big boss whos on vacation isnt thrilled about the idea of me working from home as the work isnt quantifiable but given the circumstances theyll allow it for today and well revisit the situation tomorrow i was also instructed to keep a log of what work ive performed throughout the day i guess as some measure of justification or efficiency great thanks since you know i didnt ask to get sick and my coworker was the one who came to work coughing like some sort of animal  while im sat at home on my computer getting caught up on my emails and getting everything sorted i get this passiveaggressive email from my coworker saying you have two accounts with billing thats been sitting here since tuesday  ive been fucking out sick since tuesday havent i not to mention i literally just got the approval to work from home so pipe the fuck down and give me some time to catch up on everything if i didnt get the approval and was told to take another sick day those accounts would have sat there for another day  so now all i can think about is the fact that if i dont have a negative covid resultfeel well enough to return to the office tomorrow ill most likely have to take another sick day opposed to working from home since they werent entirely on board with me working remote which begs the question as to why it was even pitched as a perk during the hiring process if it was going to be this much of a problem  not to mention the fact that knowing how my boss is shes going to come back from vacation next week and bitch about how i wasnt at work to get everything done properly as if its my fucking fault that this bitch came to work sick most likely got me sick and im the one bleeding sick time during the busiest week of the month because of my coworkers poor choice to come to work sick and my boss poor choice of not sending the bitch home  and all these employers wonder why no one wants to work who the fuck wants to deal with bullshit stemming from situations well out of their control,p6t05l

1543,"I'm out sick because of my co-worker, but please, by all means, make me feel like I'm inconveniencing the company.",please forgive the rant but i need to get this off my chest before i climb a building and screech  i work in an office in which 95 of our employees are vaccinated my direct coworker is not vaccinated and has no interest in getting the covid vaccine its also worth mentioning that i absolutely hate germs and being around sick people so you can imagine my displeasure when she came into work last thursday coughing up a storm our boss made several comments about my coworker coughing but thats as far as it went  on monday our boss began her vacation and is out this entire week monday evening i started to feel odd and left my friends house after according to him looking as white as a ghost followed by throwing up over the course of the night i started to feel progressively worse when i woke up tuesday morning my nose was blocked my throat was on fire i was sweating like a stripper in church and i had severe sinus pressure i sent a text message to our acting supervisor and let her know i would not be in due to the aforementioned  i scheduled a covid test that afternoon and was told it would be between 4872 hours for results with a chance theyd come back sooner than that i screenshotted the appointment confirmation and the pending results section to our acting supervisor to show that i both scheduled and attended said appointment when i was hired i was told i could work from home once and awhile and figuring that this is an important week for us since i work in the billing department that instead of being out sick and not contributing in any way that i work from home to ensure everything gets done in time for friday  the acting supervisor didnt get back to me until this morning and said that the big boss whos on vacation isnt thrilled about the idea of me working from home as the work isnt quantifiable but given the circumstances theyll allow it for today and well revisit the situation tomorrow i was also instructed to keep a log of what work ive performed throughout the day i guess as some measure of justification or efficiency great thanks since you know i didnt ask to get sick and my coworker was the one who came to work coughing like some sort of animal  while im sat at home on my computer getting caught up on my emails and getting everything sorted i get this passiveaggressive email from my coworker saying you have two accounts with billing thats been sitting here since tuesday  ive been fucking out sick since tuesday havent i not to mention i literally just got the approval to work from home so pipe the fuck down and give me some time to catch up on everything if i didnt get the approval and was told to take another sick day those accounts would have sat there for another day  so now all i can think about is the fact that if i dont have a negative covid resultfeel well enough to return to the office tomorrow ill most likely have to take another sick day opposed to working from home since they werent entirely on board with me working remote which begs the question as to why it was even pitched as a perk during the hiring process if it was going to be this much of a problem  not to mention the fact that knowing how my boss is shes going to come back from vacation next week and bitch about how i wasnt at work to get everything done properly as if its my fucking fault that this bitch came to work sick most likely got me sick and im the one bleeding sick time during the busiest week of the month because of my coworkers poor choice to come to work sick and my boss poor choice of not sending the bitch home  and all these employers wonder why no one wants to work who the fuck wants to deal with bullshit stemming from situations well out of their control,p6t14j

1552,My father told me that his self-esteem depends almost entirely on his work. Our conversation about work and self-esteem made me anti-work before I even found this sub.,a couple months back i was having a conversation with my mother father and sister about finding a job working while in school etc my parents place a large emphasis on work and praise me for working 30 hours a week while taking summer classes but would ridicule my sister for being lazy and working less discussing this with my parents its clear that for them and their generation baby boomers your intrinsic value derives from how much you work or how much you make during this conversation my dad directly told me that he would feel useless and purposeless without going to work it was not solely a matter of enjoying his work and how it fulfilled him but that he would feel less valued or important for even working less my father has worked incredibly hard for his entire life even into his sixties he works 13 days in a row drives an hour there and back and works 50 hours a week i was taken aback when he told me this straight out and it made me take a step back from all the work i do at work and school to question where im getting my selfworth from  whats even crazier to me is that my mom is struggling to maintain a relationship with my dad because of his work she tells me all the time that hes a workaholic and she wants to spend more time with him and all of us as a family but even for her she cant seem to escape her reliance on house work and chores to bolster her selfesteem i just see both my parents trapped in cycles where they work so hard and it benefits nothing in their lives but their selfesteem  having an objective perspective of their situations i hope to build my selfesteem on things outside of my work such as building positive relationships and growing my selfconfidence through my hobbies no matter how hard i work my value comes from me just existing i think younger generations are picking up on this so i hope people stuck like my parents can become unstuck and find reasons to value themselves outside of their work,p71kn9

1562,"The inherent requirement of ""doing more"" in jobs and industry is one of the causes of job misery.",im talking about the two different things   first is the rhetoric that within most desk jobs or corporate jobs you have to always try harder and do more to move up the ladder  if you hit your target you have failed at my company you get a 35 if you meet your requirement and 55 is extremely exceeds expectations   versus  the requirement for companies themselves to always do more  higher revenue higher profit lower costs more more more every quarter and year forever    then there are entire industries of companies that exist to help the other companies do more like ad agencies and consulting  if there wasnt extreme competition within capitalism there would be no need for thousands of supporting companies that only push other corporations to higher extremes of performance        working for a company that only helps other companies increase shareholder value is entirely void of fulfilment  you are pushed to do more work harder with less resources so you can help some other company do more with less resources     i dont know anyone that only works during work hours  within the company other friends even clients and customers  all buring the midnight oil to slog through the week and have 27 days of freedom while dreading the next work day     no one takes all their vacation days most only 12 of the allocation because of the flywheel of working more and more even after a 60 hour work week or 70 hour work week the closing thoughts from a manager is ok so what are you going to do next week to improve     doesnt it all feel like a scam sometimes  like all i wanted to do today was hang around and read a book or take a walk or anything other than what im forced to do  but 200 emails later here we are wednesday afternoon coming up on hour 40 of work already with another two 12 hour minimum days coming up  how does one achieve freedom without lottery winnings or intergenerational wealth in a society where you are fundamentally required to constantly work to get funds to live in an endless cycle of earning and spending,p6zglu

Is it enough to turn away when you know there is someone more desperate than you who will take that spot?, i worked as a lab tech at an ivy right after college the university would let you know on a near constant basis that you were shit and how much money they put towards the professor in charge of the lab and they were very smart about everything nothing in writing my first week the pi sat me down and said that this is not a 95 this job requires overtime but not to put it on my timesheet i was obviously hourly being a fucking stupid immigrant first gen college grad right out of school i did not record or take notes of anything related to this also it was my first job at an ivy and i wanted to apply for grad school next round  the next three years were fucking hell i was regularly working 60 hours a week not including commute and weekends my boss kept telling me i wasnt ready to apply for grad school and he would not give me a recommendation to do so it was always i think you need one more year or a first author paper this was also happening to international students in the lab one tried to get another job halfway across the country after being in his phd program for 7 years the pi sent an email basically telling the other international students to not even think about it or theyre getting sent back to their country other professors in the department knew this was happening i tried going to collaborators for advice they would tell me to cut my losses they didnt want to give me a recommendation because if it came back to my boss that they did it would be awkward after wasting three years and without a recommendation i should leave i got in contact with hr about unpaid overtime and they called me in for a face to face no record and basically said it was my fault that i didnt put hours overtime down on my time sheet even though my boss explicitly told me not toi kept my own record of hours worked i let them know that my boss was basically keeping me hostage with the rec letter and due to the nature of lab work i had few options and fewer people to go to for help a week later they called me in for another face to face my services were no longer needed i was given the option to resign so that i wouldnt have the red mark of being fired on my record being a scared idiot i agreed to resign this was the week before winter holidays began  then 3 months later the pandemic hit and employers stopped hiring and i couldnt get unemployment because i resigned luckily i got in contact with my tutoring gig from college i was making more here part time than i did working at an ivy lol i thought since im fucked why not open up an etsy account and try to sell whatever i had for some cash then i thought better yet why not buy etsy stock by the end of the year i stopped thinking about trying to get another job in academia or industry i threw away the dream of grad school would not even consider throwing money away on a masters i saved up enough to put a down payment on a house if you live in a hcol city making middle income or lower look for a workforce housing program or something similar properties are hard to find and there are hoops to jump through since leaving the nightmare job i finally had the headspace and realized this was a thing that could help me then in january i yolod on some gme i got incredibly fucking lucky that job and the pandemic could have ruined my life im currently choosing to work part time tutoring through zoom i make enough to afford mortgagehealthsome fun i have the time and energy to plan investments and work on building a solid financial foundation for myself i have time to do things that make me happy  i have occasional contact with former lab members these people cant walk away like i did every once in a while i think back to that boss and that job is there really a way to fight huge institutions like that i dont know and im lucky enough to not care but at the same time there is always some one more desperate or someone looking for citizenship or someone who is just a lunatic workaholic i think for me and my sanity thats the key though turning away living simply working forowningsupporting small businesses,p7fpqp

1604,A little rant and request for advice,i work for the state of new york in a field that requires a minimum number of staff on shift for safety reasons so if theres a hole in the schedule for any reason somebody on shift is forced to work another shift up to 16 total hours i understood going in that this would occasionally happen if someone calls in an hour before their shift and you cant find someone willing to work it it is what it is but the agencys personnel department has never been competent at adequately staffing the agency in ten years ive worked for it ive seen locations where everybody gets mandated every day and ive seen vacant positions go unfilled for years the pandemic has made the already bad staffing issues much worse and ive been working multiple nonconsensual double shifts per week for over a year and a half theyre required to give 8 hours off between shifts i have an hour commute so for me this 8 hours is six hours then i have to do personal things like shower and eat when get i get home and give myself an hour before i leave for work to get ready so this six hours turns into a maximum of four hours of sleep inbetween 16 hour nonconsensual shifts this is not sustainable and i see now that the agency will not ever get its shit together and this situation will not get any better so ive been calling in after i get mandated and refusing and doing precursory searches for what other jobs are out there some of the the agencys actions have been and continue to be unethical and abusive there had been a policy that mandation was a last resort only to be done when there was no other possible way to meet the staffing minimums but last year they instituted a new policy that part time employees would be mandated before full time workers could volunteer to pick up a shift to save the state some money on overtime i didnt even think this was legal i checked with the union and they said it was its highly unethical to put money before consent and i think whoever thought of this policy belongs in jail morally if theyre not technically breaking any laws theyve counterproductively instituted hiring freezes and theyre supposed to get someone to relieve you if youre facing a fourth consecutive nonconsensual double shift but my bosss boss had made it clear verbally in writing that they dont have to ive made it clear to my immediate supervisors that i dont give a fuck and ill call in when i need to and im done sacrificing my wellness because of the agencys lack of competence or ethics and i dont care if i get fired  im going to a doctor later today to try to get a note that says i need reasonable accomodations and cant work like that  sorry for the long rant mostly why im posting is for some advice about my future being uncertain the most responsible thing to do would probably be to line up another job then quit my current one but im wondering if getting fired getting unemployment for a while then getting a new job would be a good move do i still need to be fired to collect unemployment when i looked into it 20 years ago a person was not eligible for any benefits if theyd voluntarily left their last job should i worry about the reference i know there is very limited information a former employer can give and they probably do only confirm employment dates but im a little worried theyd say i was terminated and not rehireable and this job is ten years of work experience for me so i dont want to burn the reference please help,p7cuqo

1838,Can we call homelessness what it really is?,the pc way to address this isnt houselessness what a useless term they arent homeless theyre houseless i hear like it does anything how about displaced persons or refugees of an exploitative housing market  homelessness is the threat that bosses and landlords use to force you to work the persistent reminder that you are two paychecks away from being out on the streets and then where will you be homeless people get cleared away by the cops and get robbed by people passing by houseless people dont own property but displaced persons have displacers  not to mention that if we were all promised a dedicated place to live and food to eat we could turn our collective attention to correcting the climate crisis all the big manufacturing corporations would have to do is reduce plastic production like they should have done decades ago and enthusiastic volunteers could handle the rest it is not our fault we are all to busy and too tired to clean up their mess we are too busy scrounging to survive to organize and they cultivated this outcome on purpose   im trying to reach out where i can the anonymity of the internet helps and doesnt help simultaneously i know i have allies i just dont know where they are i want to protect them and myself from trolls and belligerent attacks but how can i reach out and stay shielded at the same time  sorry about the tangent but action must be taken and protests just get shut down so im trying to come at the problem from another angle im not scared of hard work and i cant argue with every idiot but i can certainly stare down the worlds problems and roll up my sleeves crude oil is finite but elbow grease is a renewable resource and i can use my supply to help people that dont exploit me if youve gotten this far thank you,p5lqop

1883,Question: Life Expectations,i have been reading this forum and i come across quite a bit of people with a similiar attitude my question for you guys is what is your expectation of how life should be     i hear people call working slavery because you have to work to survive but by that logic is every animal ever born a slave  each animal has to do tons of hard work to get enough food find a mate raise children if its that kind of animal so my question is what is the expectation for human life i always make analogues to the animal world as that helps me make sense of things so it sounds like people want the life of a pet animal who doesnt really do anything but wouldnt that be boring if all your needs are always provided for personally i think id prefer being a wild wolf with a lower life expectancy  then a dog stuck in an apartment all day with all these amazing amenities that it takes for granted and cant appreciate anymore     but perhaps i am thinking of this incorrectly i would love it if you could explain why i am wrong or your perspectives,p5h6yg

1908,What i think about Hustle Culture?,fair warning im a guy that is in between minimum wage jobs i dont have one right now and currently living with my parents so just if youre reading this and im think im a loser i have to agree with you you dont have to read the rest of this post i just wanted to get this of my chest  what i think about hustle culture its selling hope hope that you will succeed if you just work hard build yourself more and maybe just maybe youll finally get your millions to buy the things you always wanted in life  what they dont tell you i mean the media news outlets youtube reddit instagram twitter basically everything is that you the average joe or jane most likely wont get there why its simple logic in a game theres always winner and losers and more often than not there are more losers than winners the more successful the winner the bigger the pool of losers youll never hear from them well because their losers  if everyone is successful no one is not everyone can be millionaires you need a lot of poor people to have little millionaires  the same thing can be said with the job market today way back then you didnt need a college degree to succeed or have a stable life and family now that the whole market is filled with college degrees college degrees have become a minimum requirement for most high paying jobs eventually there will come a time when masters degrees are the new minimum requirement  what these people who promote hustle culture have one thing in common they sell you hope in a continuous loop the people on youtube who promote hustle culture sell you hope in pieces so that if you fail which most likely you will you will come back to their channel and continue watching the videos that they make   its a continuous cycle of failinggthustle culture videosgtfailinggthustle culture videos that they want you to experience eventually some people like me decide it isnt worth it anymore and drop out in which we become the prime example of being a loser and everyone else should work harder unlike us thereby passively continuing the hustle culture   but why does everybody promote this well because whether youre working for someone or owning a  business you most likely have to pay taxes taxes means higher income for the government which stimulates the economy it also means bigger bailouts for billionaires and whoever is the 1 at the time   and since most of us are not at the top or the middle we will continue to work till our body breaks down this also forces us to seek expensive medical attention later which costs money which also stimulates the economy debt is also good for the economy  now i am not saying you will not succeed if you work hard you just might just succeed to move yourself up to the middle or upper class if you try hard enough  but dont beat yourself up thinking that its sorely your fault if you fail despite trying people get burnout  which can sometime lead to laziness like me not everyone can be winners its just how the world works,p4v4iu

1916,Finally quit... Residential MFT Therapist,im a therapist working at a residential treatment center for teens teens have been impacted by the lockdowns more than anyone and its amazing to try to help them get their lives back on track the problem is the cost cutting management and backbiting employees they offer such low wages that they attract the bottom of the barrel and routinely fail to do the background checks and drug testing that i had to go through the toxic and understaffed environment caused most of the good people to quit and only the insane and those with something to hide have been sticking around for the jobs like medical assistant etc   this leads to a bizarre environment of people completely unqualified to be working with mental ill teens forming cliques and creating toxic environments of gossip and reporting innocent things to management things like buying the kids a board game or getting them a bottle of water on a outing  if these lazy fucking greedy management paid living wages for people with student debtsunk education costs then the place could be amazing but instead its a pit of gossiping vipers where the teens are treated as dogs to be ordered around they get 800 per day per kid but the majority of that goes the ceos private jet real thing and the inflated salaries of the few at the top its impossible to do good in an environment whos main purpose is greed i dont know that i hate capitalism but i hate unregulated croney capitalism and i hate the venomous nature of for profit healthcare   ampx200b  i have so much more i could say if people are interested,p4m0hh

1943,“I actually enjoy firing people y’know…”,the words of my new manager on the first day of a new job   a bit of backstory i posted on here a couple months back celebrating the fact that id finally plucked up the courage to quit my shitty call centre job a job that had basically ruined my mental health to the point where i couldnt sleep or eat properly   after a blissful two months of unemployment i found a job that would on paper allow me shorter hours in a far less demanding role   unfortunately ive ended up in the exact same situation the first red flag was the fact that my training had been completely messed up and my actual start date hadnt been confirmed   it basically meant i started a job without proper training including covidrelated formalities required before i could even step foot in store i wasnt told what my break entitlements were and it turned out theyd ignored my availability and put me down for a 40 hour shift pattern without any consultation   it also turned out that my manager had broken company policy by having me instore before the official company induction they were expecting me to lie to my training instructors and omit the fact that ive been working in store for two days before i was even allowed   finally earlier today it turns out my scheduled days of next week were completely wrong so all of the plans ive made outside of work now have to be cancelled   the title of the post is in reference to a conversation my manager had with me on my first day his words were no offence but you mean nothing to me and i actually love firing people naturally my first impression of this man is anything but positive   sufficed to say i feel like a complete twat and this company has taken absolute liberties with me from day one im already looking for other work but im not sure i can manage yet another sleepless night im considering arriving tomorrow at 830 and just quitting on the spot   i hope i make the right decision tomorrow  i know i should be putting my mental health first but unfortunately corporate conditioning is putting those seeds of doubt in the back of my head and im worried those doubts will prevent me from doing the right thing   ive already put aside a months rent and the rest of this month is also paid so i know things will be fine if a little tight   wise sages of this sub i think i need some words of encouragement  should i quit tomorrow or should i try and stick it out until ive at least secured another job,p4jk2i

1989,My internship experience as part of my education [loooong rant],i just needed to vent about this sorry about the super long post might be a lil disjointed   im studying engineering in polytechnic currently in an internship semester where students have a choice to go source for a company and get 800 a month or stay inhouse working on a project of our choosing for zero dollars working hours for both are 0800 to 1730 on weekdays for 22 weeks   800 might as well be nothing plus the school grades your impactoutcome based on your contributions in your internship period seeing as a random company arent guaranteed to have meaningful projects to work on students usually end up at startups and we know how well those go so i opted for the inhouse option   this probably was the right decision in hindsight my friend went with an outside company and they got him doing menial tasks and fixing xerox printers in 2021 whats he gonna write in his report  anyway the project i was assigned to was hella unorganised the previous batch of student interns were trusted to document their progress and come up with manuals on how to operate the machines areas of improvement etc and the current batch was just given a crash course by the former interns the ones who showed up anyway and left there with no supervision the project supervisors are often doing lectures or whatever it is theyre so busy with and only visit for 10 minutes maybe once a week   ok my schools pretty big on the whole selflearning thing so i guess well just pull ourselves up by the bootstraps and whatnot we dealt with automation my station had conveyors assembly lines and robot arms i learnt what i could programmed the plc robot control though the real engineers would come in if i ran into something i couldnt do   but there wasnt always something to do im pretty confident with plc programming and could eventually finish most tasks quickly then its counting hours for the day at one point the 20 yearold pneumatic compressor supplying air to my station broke and i was left with even less to fill my time i had the longest days of my life during this semester   fastforward multiple weeks and a merciful for us lockdown caused by covid spikes and im in my last week of internship they fixed the compressor i finished my work my station is fully autonomous reports and documentation done i did everything i needed to ahead of schedule   my batch mustve been hardworking because the director decided he wanted to meet all the inhouse interns across all projects he said his thanks and whatever we hope you will continue your learning journey and come back to work on your respective projects projects are never done to show our appreciation well be providing free lunch for today yada yada yada   through the session i was left wondering what a school directors does for their job that they could take the time to do this i could be watching anime in my lab it was my last day anyway but wait theres more   the director and management board decided they wanted to see our groups project inperson out of all the others and they would greatly appreciate if we could come back next week for a demo i doubt theyll be providing free lunch this time   i feel like they dont respect the students time we were forced to skip our holidays and work for you without pay while other students were on holiday we were coming back 0800 to 1730 and now on our last day you want us to come back and personally show you our work couldnt have read our reports watched the videos that showed the operation processes anything besides stealing more of our offtime   this just reeks of shit i had to quit my parttime videoediting job to for this internship i had to solve every problem that arose myself 22 weeks for a 6 lunch set like paying your interns isnt a sign of appreciation   the other interns in my project group didnt seem affected but they defo should be fuck the director and his nothing job the management board can manage deez nuts   my internship is finished give me my grade and ill enjoy my life with 22 weeks ill never get back,p55t1t

But does anyone else sometimes think that work feels like rape of the mind instead of the body?",heres how it feels like rape of the mind in my opinion  you dont want to do it every second youre working it feels like youre being forced to do something against your will your mind cant even think of other things you cant even zone out and imagine youre doing something else you have to focus and work   you cant even escape into fantasies and daydreams you have to be in that place and do those boring and joyless tasks for hours and hours every day  obviously this isnt the case for everybody some people dont take hate every second as much but some like me absolutely dread every second of wageslaving  ps to add insult to injury it all feels extra pointless because of the low wages and the high prices of everything all of that torture for a paycheck that covers bills and stuff and thats it which is the case for a majority of the population of this earth,p3u2o6

2061,I successfully negotiated weekly WFH after threatening to leave for a better paying job,i know this is an antiwork sub but i am actually lucky enough to have a great boss so it was a hard choice when i first decided to move on to company that is bigger pays better and in a little bit better location i was ready to tell them that id be accepting the job offer but my boss wanted to keep me here so much that i took that leverage and requested a 4 day work week same paybenefits i would take a shorter work week without a pay raise any day over a pay raise with samehigher workload of course im grateful that im in a spot to turn down extra money for that perk   in the end we negotiated 1 day wfh per week with an added 4 immediate pay raise and i know my boss well enough to know that day wont be strictly policed so its basically a free day at home i definitely feel like this is a win hopefully this will pave the way for more wfh within the company or possibly even shorter work weeks in the future  for context i work as a quality engineer at a manufacturing facility and regular wfh has been pretty much unheard of my department up until now even throughout the whole pandemic,p3tkcn
2062,I quit a job that almost made me kill myself,hi reddit im glad i found this subreddit so i have a place to vent about this   ive been working at this company for 3 years now casual i was desperate for work back then and took what i could get i became good at what i did  front shop pharmacy  and for 3 years i put work before myself worked harder and harder everyday for r50 an hour converted thats 338 and hour   anyways for 3 years my salary was never once reviewed thereafter they had me working 45 different sections of the pharmacy on a weekend even delivering for the drivers     nd eventually weeks  during these years i tried to work myself up to a permanent position i spoke to my boss more than i can count on my fingers everytime a new position opened up i saw a new face this happened 4 times where they didnt even consider me making me think whats wrong with me am i that bad so i kept working and pushing  some days id be opening capturing and invoicing stock then id have to pack the shelves replace all of the physical labels etc they also had me work the tills and make sure parels are sent out etc keep in mind there are more than enough staff to do this but because i kept on doing what they wanted with no questions or complaints they kept piling it on me more and more never upping my salary and still hiring people they had never met over me all whilst still paying me 338   come 2021 i have been doing such a good job they ask me to come in everyday hell yeah  i think to myself its finally coming im going to get a full time job when i arrived there the next week i was expecting to be spoken to about full time contracts etc 2 weeks pass im thinking ok its covid pandemic we are busy im sure they 2ill remember come 6 weeks nothing  no pay increase no health benefits 338 an hour working 81800 with one hour lunch sometimes no lunch at this point i felt like i was managing the place for the manager everybody was just blaming me for their mistakes it was always me no matter what upon asking my boss again about working full time i got the same thing id been hearing for 3 years i am trying to fit you in find a place then what about the previous positions that opened up i just at there thinking to myself me too scared to ask for a raise because im just a casual anyways weeks pass after id been working every day the depression is kicking in i want to kill myself   i planned it knew what i wanted to do and started to prepare slowly but surely i gave myself a week to say goodbye and spend time with my family after my boss said i wasnt needed that week because its not busy anyways time almost arrived before i could do anything i wanted to talk to my mom one last time my partner my dad etc as we were sitting there my mom just bursts out into tears followed by the news that a very close friend of mine had just killed himself distraught i turned pale and broke down that night i still get hounded by my boss telling me to come into work because im needed whatever i do it i feel more depressed than ever got my salary for working so much same hourly rate yet i couldnt afford things i just needed closer and closer to snapping  then my friends funeral service hit they were talking about him and how his job drove him to taking his own life the unhappiness i broke down in tears still in tears   anyways lastnight was enough i sent my boss a message without notice telling her that i quit we didnt burn any bridges between us though people seem sad that i quit but thats probably because they dont have one person to do all the work they dont want to do anymore i finally freed myself from the place thats been holding me back for nearly 4 years  i quit i feel good but also im just scared for the future i still have the privilege of living in my parents home at the moment this morning people from work were trying to phone me and i felt guilty not answeringwhy should i  at this point i feel so relieved that that chapter is closed now i just dont know what to do from here  but i do want to say this in a work space we are all unfortunatelt easily replaceable  but theres only one of you to those that matter   as of now in definitely scared to start fresh but also excited im finally free   tldr quit a job that made me suicidal  got paid horribly worked multiple job sections i was being used now i have quit and i feel scared and lost   sorry for the long ass post guys and for any spelling errors,p3iog8
2063,I’ve worked for FedEx for 11 months and I’m finally quitting,i m23 started working for fedex ground last september at the height of the pandemic i was a package handler in a hub meaning my job was to load trucks that were going to be distributed out to other hubs all over the country very physically demanding and fast paced work but i enjoyed it when i started  it was fulfilling to get to the end of a sort and feel accomplished in what we finished and the physical benefits were also great i was basically getting paid to work out for six hours every day and over the course of 67 months i lost 5060lbs im stronger and in better shape now than ive ever been in my life and i have nothing but that job to thank for that   i made it through the insanely busy christmas season peak season just fine and was looking forward to getting back to normal come january and for about a month and a half it did kinda go back to normal but in mid february things changed our hub and sort managers both left and the new managers were less than stellar there was a tangible shift in morale almost overnight as soon as they took over and as time went on shit kept getting worse and worse the amount of work we were asked to do everyday was insane and theyd be constantly asking people to come in early and stay late to help finish it i was part time but the full time people would routinely put in 1215 hour days sure they were getting paid really well but at what cost they had just enough time to go home and sleep for 7 hours before they would have to get up and do it all over again  that and they started pulling random unscheduled mandatory shifts out of their asses even on holidays and said we needed to show up for them even if it was on a day we normally have off i never went to a single one fuck that noise   so i finally decided to quit this week my friend who worked there too quit last week and so i was there on my own in blistering and suffocating heat trying to figure out anything that would make staying worth it and i couldnt think of anything this job lives or dies by the managers you have and the people you work with so decided im done  ultimately fedex can be a nice place to work if the conditions and managers are good otherwise it fucking sucks and youd be better off doing literally anything else  if you have any questions about specifics and what led me to decide to leave ask away,p3t9o8

2065,Bitcoin is Anti-Work,in a fiat money system the value of human labor is stolen through an invisible tax called inflation which is effectuated through currency debasement and money printing the system has dug itself so far into a debt hole that we cannot stop or the whole system will collapse   in an inflationary money system the value of your labor goes down every year the position this puts you in as an employee is an endless cycle of trying to figure out how to work more work longer hours  and earn more literally just so you can maintain the exact same standard of living that you had the year prior you have to go to your corporate overlords and beg them to pretty please give you a higher wage because you automatically get a wage cut every year due to money printing stealing your purchasing power   this brings us to bitcoin bitcoin is a fixed supply monetary system that cannot be debased atwill by selfinterested monetary overlords it cannot be debased and because of the natural growth of technological innovation which is a strong deflationary force in the modern world under a bitcoin based money system we would enter into a deflationary economic environment that favors the middle and lower classes  no longer do you have to beg for a raise you automatically get a raise in purchasing power every year because goods and services are allowed to benefit from the deflationary forces of technological innovation groceries become cheaper housing becomes cheaper   everything you need to survive becomes more affordable because no longer is your surplus value and the innovation of technology being siphoned and stolen from you through endless money printing by centralized entities and used for inefficient central planning  under a deflationary bitcoin monetary system you could work less and have more time to pursue your interests and spend time with your loved ones because you would be more financially free  bitcoin is financial freedom from an economic system designed to exploit you for your value bitcoin is freedom from financial slavery  bitcoin is antiwork,p3ytxc

2072,Hate my job after transfer.,in february i got a job at a convenience store after being fired the previous year from a 18 yr desk job i actually really enjoyed it it was a complete 180 as i am now constantly moving and getting to see and talk to people all day long i was thriving no one in 5 months yelled at me made me feel stupid treated me like a child and they were all super nice the store was nonstop most of the time but it was very low stress because of how management and supervisors treated everyone  i transferred back to where i have a support system at the beginning of the month yesterday was my first day at my new store it was horrible first off i was told before that their store is super busy and it may very well be based on numbers but they have so much staff that i had time to literally just stand around several times it certainly was not as fast paced as my last store which you think might be good but the manager was in a constant state of being frazzled it was ridiculous i was reprimanded for cashing a lottery voucher that i had been cashing daily for 5 months at my old store because only managers do that here apparently its because the salespeople are seen as too stupid to do it correctly as i was told there ere too many mistakes when everyone could do it  there is a time from 11a2pm referred to as ahod meaning all hands in deck for the first hour i was on register and they they wanted me to move to kitchen so i take a sup of my drink in the break room before washing my hands something that was literally as much as a nonissue as breathing at my last store and this was the resulting conversation  asst manager am olive what are you doing me om im headed to the kitchen am no what are you doing in here meaning the break room om ummm getting a drink before i was my hands am this is ahod no one leaves their posts you dont get a drink you dont use the bathroom you dont enter the break room for anything om o k i was just getting a drink ill head back now  i then wash hands head to the kitchen and after doing a walkthrough stand around for 10 minutes with nothing to do  at the end of the shift i went to the actual manager to ask a question she snapped do you need something i asked her how she thought the day went and then a question about whether i was allowed to do something or not since i was allowed at my last store but obviously that isnt a guarantee at this one she still a frazzled fucking mess snaps i havent had a moment to even think about today and then waived me off saying yeah whatever to my question  i am 40 fucking years old i know how to do my job i know when not to take a quick break and when i can take one im not about to be told im not allowed to take a drink or go to the bathroom as i am not currently not have i ever been incarcerated  5 months of an amazing job and in 1 day i know im leaving came home last night and put in 8 applications quite honestly im tempted to text her as shes obviously too busy for a face to face conversation or phone call and just saying i quit and never going back or hell maybe just email hr tell them everything ive written here and saying i resign immediately,p4cgtv

2074,I can’t handle work anymore,im so sick and tired of working ive had 8 different jobs since 2017 and the longest i was able to keep one was only a year ive worked both full and part time in fast food and retail but i get so frustrated and burnt out that i either call out to the point of getting fired for it or i end up quitting ive been suicidal on and off because of my jobs   currently i work overnight at a grocery store but the managers are so demanding and there been coworkers shit talking about me i overheard them on my first day and again last time i was on lunch its also really draining me physically last time i think i was truly happy was when i was on unemployment last year   im living with my inlaws and im terrified of being a burden my father in law is a workoholic that would rather be at work than at home and im scared he probably thinks im a lazy bum because i cant handle working my poor boyfriend has stuck to my side this whole time and has helped me a ton during the times i wasnt  working but i feel like im just a pain in the ass unfortunately im also impulsive i ended up racking up 9k of debt well my boyfriend is a part of it he has his name on one of my cards but isnt fully responsible for the debt during a period where i was like fuck it nothing matters because everything is gonna crash and burn in 20 years so i might as well enjoy my life now but now im freaking tf out over the debt i wanted to try filing bankruptcy but my boyfriend begged and cried for me not to and said hes gonna help pay it all off  at this point tho im probably gonna file anyways and hope for the best  i really want to move out of his parents house but with all this debt over our heads plus the fact that i cant keep a job and apartments and homes are stupid expensive where we live makes it impossible but my mental health is draining even more by staying here few examples of what goes on roaches dirty sibling in laws that dont clean up after themselves my stuff keeps going missing but everyone denies it  i got diagnosed with adhd and depression at 15 but i dont have any of my medical info for that my parents have it but im no contact with them i also have my suspicions that im on the autism spectrum and have ptsd from my childhood and borderline personality disorder i saw a doctor a few days ago and she said she would refer me to a psychiatrist and now im also going to a talk group starting today but thats all thats happened so far  im currently on leave from my job because my boyfriend tested positive from covid im supposed to go back in a week and a half  my leave got extended so i could take care of my bf but i really dont wanna go back what the hell can i do cuz at this point im feeling worthless as hell and even thinking about going back to work is making my stomach churn   i want to see if i qualify for disability or something but i doubt id get approved im just now seeing a psychiatrist and i heard for mental illness youre supposed to be on treatment for 2 years before they consider you,p3j6h1

2091,I automated the vast majority of both my job and my wife's job and now we only have about an hour of real work everyday.,i made this throwaway account because some of my coworkers know of my original reddit account and i dont want anyone finding out about this i have been lurking on this subreddit but never posted due to that reason  we both have bas in economics and after we graduated we got decently paying but extremely boring and repetitive desk jobs where are roles are extremely similar  when covid hit we all went remote and then they decided that arent actually needed in person will stay remote permanently this includes my wife and i  ive always liked computers but never learned how to program however around the beginning of the year i decided to try and teach myself i decided on starting with python and started with a great course i found on reddit not sure if i should mention the name i dont want to seem like a shill   i started doing this just to learn programming but as i went through it i realized that i could use so much of what i was learning to automate my own job i did the course for about 3060 minutes per day and finished after about a month and a half after i finished that i had to learn a bit more on my own in order to properly write the scripts after that i helped my wife automate her job as well and now we both work about an hour per day doing stuff that i havent been able to automate  initially i was thinking of going to my boss and telling him for a raise but im sure theyd just cut costs have me automate other peoples jobs and then keep 90 of the profits so i decided against it  i have been so nervous over the past few months that id get caught but so far i have been safe no one has noticed at all ive been thinking of getting a second similar job and then automating that but i am worried that would be pushing it and id be killing the goose that lays the golden eggs instead i might keep learning more programming and doing some parttime freelancing  i am mostly using pandas selenium and a few other tools i dont want to go into too much specifics about what i do exactly just due to a fear of someone finding out who i am  if you think your job can be similarly automated feel free to comment message me for advice i have a lot more free time now and i could use it to help others here get started with python and automating their job also let me know if you think i should post the name of the course i used i wanted to give as much information and help in my post as possible but i also didnt want to seem like a shill so i wasnt sure whether or not to mention it,p3wvdy

2097,"IT, Homeoffice",i hope this belongs here its about work and not working simultaneously  got up at 7 am although i originally intended 6 am but who cares my colleagues dont and my manager wont show up until 9 am anyway alarm clocks are a thing of the past since the onset of covid as i dont commute anymore  logged into a variety of remote teamware stuff so everyone can see that im here got into some pants and went outside to get some energy drinks to fire me up  oh look theres some pizza left yess a man needs to eat breakfast  checked all the news forum posts etc that accumulated while i slept this will keep me busy until 10 am when the great department meeting via zoom starts i have no actual part in that besides one or another canny remark if opportunity arises  this will last one hour or one and a half maybe some colleague wants to know something or some urgent test or other special task needs to be done of course ill hurry to comply but thats it around 1 pm im gonna log out of everything and let the weekend begin   this kind of antiwork comes with the great advantage of paying rather well  it just requires 20 years of actual work experience plus a 2 year degree in some engineering magic to keep a rather positive attitude towards work while not doing very much of it anymore  in our company we have some people like that something like eternal employees everyone knows they dont do much work anymore but they cant be fired because they accumulated too much knowledge  their experience with products and processes is valuable and dangerous at the same time karl marx called them worker aristocracy working class people like everyone else but in privileged positions compared to all those interns and newbs with too little experience and cunningness to navigate the shitty rat race like a fish in the water  some of those poor souls once will rise up to be in such positions eventually but most will drop out of the race before burned out and sucked empty   the system is shit but its far from invincible,p3i58a

2202,Why has the pandemic given workers an excuse for to do a shitty job?,i am very antiwork and i dont really like working but its my opinion if you are employed you should at least do the bare minimum of what is required   in between buying a home getting carpet put down and a few other things ive lost track of how many times people have either given me a window of time of when they will call back or a specific time and never call back   i almost lost out on our mortgage because one employee involved in the process i literally had to call and track them down a day or two after a time frame was given not once not twice but over 8 separate times  go to get carpet installed and i asked the salesperson when i would expect a call back with a quote and was told if not the same day tomorrow not only did this person not call back at all she fucking went on vacation without giving any of my info to another salesperson again if i didnt take time out of my day to have to call back myself this would of never been done  these are just two of many different examples which have all been given excuses similar to well we are in the pandemic so things take longer  alright i totally understand that but if the pandemic is making it take longer to do your job then you need to communicate that with your clients dont tell someone your going to call them back tuesday at 2pm if you are too backlogged to do so tell them it will be thursday   to me its almost like these places are extremely behind but handing out false promises and expectations like candy in order to create a facade of things being normal    im very patient and dont mind waiting but between my own selfemployment job and renovating a house we just bought if you give me a time to expect a call i cant very well be 8 foot up a ladder with a paint roller and masking tape and take your call so i set aside some time since no one called during that time thats my own time im wasting not getting shit done  what really puts the dingleberry on the entire shit cake is no one apologizes for their behavior either so not only is the pandemic given an excuse its normalizing it as well  if you dont want to work then dont if you want to quit then quit i fully support it but if you are in the middle of something when you quit at least have the decency to make sure someone else has that information   there is a clear difference between quitting and quitting like an idiot i honestly dont think some of these people have any empathy to consider what impact their quitting has on other people its fine if you dont care about the other workers but its the people who depend on that company for their service or product being left behind   because i can guarantee you that if the roles were reversed and someone quitting impacted their life in some way they wouldnt be very happy either how would you like if you took your car to get its oil changed and the person changing it walked off the job and they didnt have anyone else available to change it for 3 days,p3bequ

2222,Thoughts on the great resignation,ive been seeing this topic on the news lately after some research ive found information mentioning that in the us 4 million people have quit their jobs in april 2021 i am not sure if other countries are experiencing this trend i think there are many reasons for this like employee disenfranchisement people hating their jobs and returning to office work instead of working from home   i wonder if this data is accurate and if it is then how does this change the working environment ive read that this can change the job market to where employers may adjust their job culture wages and employee experience maybe it will tuen into an employee market but if people have resigned to this extent i worry that there will be some legislation event or pushback from big business or economic issue that will result in people being forced back to work a survey by executive search firm korn ferry found that 94 of retailers are having trouble filling empty roles this trend is most notable in retail and service work but affects all industries across the board   i have little faith in this happening long term or employers making significant changes but i am glad to see people giving corporate america and capitalism the finger at any rate we will see how this affects the economy pretty soon and its results overtime   httpswwwbbccomworklifearticle20210629thegreatresignationhowemployersdroveworkerstoquit,p2sdqf

2229,Labor Revolt of the White River Utes,so im reading this book on 19th century native americanus relations bury my heart at wounded knee by dee brown and came across a bit of antiwork history involving the white river utes of western colorado note the following contains sensitive content discriminatory language and reference to violent events in us history   at the time late1870s the white river utes were being displaced from their land through a series of broken treaties that allowed miners to flood into colorado in search of gold as usual the us government coerced the utes onto a nearby reservation but the tribe still maintained a strong huntergatherer culture  in comes their newly appointed indian agenta position tasked essentially with communicating to tribes on behalf of the us government at best an agent could help petition the government for more food and provisions obtain more consistent annuity payments for previously seized land maybe even secure weapons for offreservation buffalo hunting at worst well meet nathan meeker  gtnathan meeker was possessed of a missionary fervor and sincerely believed that it was his duty as a member of the superior race to elevate and enlighten the utes  in his humorless and overbearing way meeker set out systematically to destroy everything the utes cherished to make them over into his own image as he believed he had been made in gods image his first unpopular action was to move the agency fifteen miles down white river where there was fine pastureland suitable for plowing here meeker planned to build a cooperative agrarian colony for ute indians but he overlooked the fact that the utes had been using the area as a hunting ground and for pasturing their horses the site he chose to build agency buildings on was a traditional racing strip where the utes enjoyed their favorite sport of betting on pony races    gt   gtby the spring of 1879 meeker had a few agency buildings under construction and forty acres of land plowed most of the work was done by his white employees who were paid money for their efforts meeker could not understand why the utes also expected money for building their very own cooperative agrarian community but in order to get his irrigation ditches dug he agreed to pay money to thirty utes they were willing workers until meekers funds were exhausted then they went away to hunt or attend pony races their needs are so few that they do not wish to adopt civilized habits meeker complained to the commissioner of indian affairs what we call conveniences and comforts are not sufficiently valued by them to cause them to undertake to obtain them by their own efforts  the great majority look upon the white mans ways with indifference and contempt he proposed a course of action to correct this barbaric condition first take away the utes hundreds of ponies with a few draft horses for plowing and hauling and then as soon as the utes were thus forced to abandon the hunt and remain near the agency he would issue no more rations to those who would not work i shall cut every indian down to the bare starvation point he wrote colorados senator henry m teller if he will not work  concurrently the governor of denver william b vickers began a propaganda campaign to have the utes removed from the entirety of colorado thereby leaving their valuable reservation land open for the taking he publicly supported meeker in the denver tribune and made some lets just say eerily familiar politicalracist remarks about the utes and their relationship to work   gtthe utes are actual practical communists and the government should be ashamed to foster and encourage them in their idleness and wonton waste of property living off the bounty of a paternal but idiotic indian bureau they actually become too lazy to draw their rations in the regular way but insist on taking what they want wherever they find it removed to indian territory the utes could be fed and clothed for about one half what it now costs the government     gt   gthonorable nc meeker the wellknown superintendent of the white river agency was formerly a fast friend and ardent admirer of the indians he went to the agency in the firm belief that he could manage the indians successfully by kind treatment patient precept and good example but utter failure marked his efforts and at last he reluctantly accepted the truth of the broader truism that the only truly good indians are dead ones  eventually meekers attempt to force agriculture on the utes would lead to a dispute with a ute chief prompting him to wire for military assistance as the us cavalry approached with 150 soldiers there was a ute rebellion that ended in the death of meeker and his men along with several women and children taken as hostages this incident is now known as the meeker massacrehttpsenwikipediaorgwikimeekermassacre in the ensuing battle with the us cavalry between 1937 utes were killed while the us cavalry suffered 13 casualties   shortly afterward the white river utes were forcefully removed from their homeland and relocated to the uintah reservation in northeastern utah in 1883 the town of meeker colorado was established   tldr us government agent attempts to force agriculture an indigenous tribe via labor coercion and starvation,p358j8

2237,Why Do Countries Like America Value Economic Growth Over Quality Of Life?,it seems like the quality of life for like 99 of people could be greatly improved if we as a society valued that over the gdp or absurd levels of economic growth besides the very few who does it really benefit   the standard workweek is still 40 hours with only two weeks mandatory vacation which is outdated and absurd all for the sake of productivity yet society could function completely fine if the average workweek was reduced like 30hrs instead and if vacation was a minimum of one month per year especially because of the added productivity from technological advances and automation those changes would make full time employment way more sustainable and be beneficial to a vast majority of people within our society it would make things harder on small business owners but there are ways around that like giving extra incentives and deductions also large corporations that already make billions in profits can surely handle it  overall i think making changes to greatly improve most peoples quality of life at the expensive of the few would absolutely be worth it do you guys think anything will ever change will there ever be people in power who have the same mindset i dont think the ways things are now is sustainable for peoples mental health and wellbeing,p2p2g6

2460,Vent about HR,and the way employers deal with mental health in general this was from a previous job which was also wfh which makes it even more frustrating that it was this much of a fiasco  so as anyone who has regularly read my postscomments on here i struggle very brutally with mental health issues depression anxiety substance abuse sex addiction the latter two started as coping mechanisms for the former two funny how that works right basically just a smorgasbord of fucked up brain chemicals this makes it extremely difficult to function normally sometimes to the point where even doing basic hygiene routines is like scaling mt everest last year i had an especially bad flare up that actually scared me into trying to find a therapist because i was thinking more realistically about potentially killing myself than i had since my one actual attempt back in 2014 i shopped around but most therapists werent taking my insurance and then i remembered there was an eap program available through my company i reached out to them the rep was very polite and supportive and got back to me quickly with a few different therapists she thought would be a good fit for me i made my pick and we set up the first appointment  it was immediately obvious that i was going to need to be allowed an hour off per week for these sessions all virtual since it was a call center job and there wasnt a lot of wiggle room or down time so i spoke to hr she had the idea that we could schedule my appointments on my lunch break 30 mins and then just give me an additional half hour to fill the one hour appointment schedule i was like okay that sounds like a good idea hr goes yeah so well just need to put in a request for an accommodation  the way it was worded was already a red flag but it was even worse than i thought i was instructed to send my therapist the therapist i had only had a single session with so far a multipage packet detailing extensive longterm therapy she was to read over it sign it and send a copy to me and to hr who would then put in the accommodation request thats right even with all that i wasnt even guaranteed to get it and if it was denied the extension of my lunch would be unapproved and thus eventually lead to me getting fired which means no more insurance which means no therapist  this was for half a fucking hour once a week i could see them wanting to go through a whole spiel like that if i needed a whole week off every month or something thats reasonable but this was just batshit crazy for thirty fucking minutes when i sent my therapist that packet she was floored that they were making such a huge deal out of extending my lunch by half an hour she also didnt feel comfortable signing it because we had only had one session and thats not nearly enough time to gauge whether were a good fit whether i need to be referred to a psychiatrist for possible medication whether i just need a different type of therapist etc it was ridiculous i ended up only doing three sessions before giving up because knowing my time was unexcused and thus getting me closer to termination just stressed me out even more the very act of seeking help made my mental issues worse i guess thats what i get for trying to find help through my fucking job  ampx200b  the point of this whole rant is just to underscore how fucking ridiculously difficult it is to even be considered as needing help with any kind of mental trauma youre facing and even if you can somehow get the stars to align so you can find a therapist who works for you and takes your insurance you still have to schedule sessions around your fucking job of course this wouldnt be an issue if we werent needlessly working nine hours a day five days a fucking week forever  im at the point where ive stopped giving a fuck ill take my time off when my mental health gets especially bad and if you dont like it and you want to fire me then fucking fire me youll be doing me a favor anyway it infuriates me to no end that in this fucking country of freedom something as simple as extending your lunch by thirty fucking minutes so you can hopefully not have a mental breakdown and kill yourself requires you to pole vault sideways through a row of flaming fucking hoops being tossed around by elephants balanced on giant balls during an earthquake  fuck this shit,p1t4q0

2473,I'm just stressed out I guess,i think i need to vent to likeminded people more than anything but maybe some advice would help this is longwinded and not exactly as organized as id like but my brain is a mess  i have a pretty standard office job i do 7304 12 hour unpaid lunch decent pay benefits etc i am the bookkeeper for smallmedium sized event business in canada yes events its been a rough year but i have stayed employed full time throughout the pandemic even when were at a total shutdown   this job was a fluke for me  its not in my field and they were willing to do all my training etc and i worked my way from an entrylevel position to the only bookkeeper in the company im now at the top of my job in my current workplace but not necessarily qualified to move elsewhere as i do not have any official training i have a ba in psychology and have previously worked in human services mostly working with atrisk youth homelessness addictions mental health etc at that time i had to work two jobs to barely scrape by working crazy hours and brining home the emotional stress of working with these populations on top of having my own mental health issues i was not doing okay and really just lest effective in my work when my part time dataentry job offered me a full time position monday to friday with benefits i couldnt say no  i sold out for a cushy office job and sometimes i hate myself for it because i want to be doing meaningful work but then i remember how drained that left me and still unable to care for myself financially and mentally  my whole life i had wanted to help people but when i finally got the chance i was far too burnt out   this is a good time to thank every human service worker out there  you guys are underpaid and underappreciated thank you for your sacrifices   so now i am at this point in my life where i dont want to work anymore not like this  but i have to i can go look for work in my preferred field still underpaying and would have to take on shift work if not multiple jobs i would lose my two day weekend and likely my benefits but my work might have meaning i can go look for work in a new field dominos locally currently pays more than my current occupation so i figure delivering pizzas is a viable option only half s   or i can stick it out here my first plan of action is to talk to my boss and hr about a four day work week or at least five days with the fifth working from home im not sure if they will go for this  my boss has always made it apparent that he needs me in the office even though a lot of stuff i could do from home and only come in maybe 23 days but thats the thing they do need me as i am the only one trained to do some of the work i feel bad for wanting to leave and potentially leaving them high and dry with no one to replace me it would effect peoples payroll if they couldnt find a replacement in time   cons with my jobs    i am the only one in my department  this is both nice im an introvert and shitty because there is no backup if i want to call in sick so i dont if i am really sick i will but sometimes i need a mental health day and i feel like i cannot take them i literally cried at work this morning prompting this writeup i am the only one here that can do payroll  if i want to take a day off i need to fit it into the payroll schedule  covid  were an event company and as long as restrictions are on we are essentially shut down where i am located we just entered another lockdown its been a slow year or so with many days i am required to be here even though there is no work ive done small makework projects and organized the shit out of everything but i honestly feel burntout from the nothingness that my job has become that being said  they still pay me full hours for very minimal work  i do have it pretty easy  nowhere left to go  i am essentially at the top of my game here unless i want to go back to school and study accounting haha i have further up the pay scale to go but the work will not change   not meaningful to me i am literally just here to get a pay cheque  pros with my job   easy i am literally writing this essay at work this last year made me lazy and i am embracing it wholeheartedly here in a way that i likely would  not be able to at another workplace  standard hours benefits pay etc compensation  when its not covid it actually is pretty good  things are busier and there are the occasional perks like free events  small business i work directly with the owner and we have a fairly small staff that i get to know personally my boss is for the most part really great and understanding but he is still a boss  i guess aside from the vent id like a little insight  do you guys think i should stick it out or should i start looking elsewhere i am going to talk about a reduced work week first but if they dont go for it i might be out of here  a little bit more about me im 25f i have a few major mental health issues and see a therapist biweekly this is covered by my benefits as is my medication benefits  important  i am anticapitalist still identifying what exactly that is for me but i hate the society we live in i dont feel i should have to work to earn my existence  i went from high school to uni to work all while working almost full time jobs to get by ive never had more than a week off from anything in my life and i honestly would have gladly taken a layoff last year but they needed me im exhausted if i could quit my job and doing nothing even for a month i would all of this  i think it all comes down to me needing a true break but even that scares me because if im not working im not making rent groceries counselling appts medication id have to use that time looking for a new job doing interviews  the whole break would be stress im stressed out  thanks for reading if you made it this far whew,p15gue

2475,The Reality,i love this page and all of these posts its so satisfying to see so many people awake to realize these companies are just out here to use you but in the thick of it all none of us speaking up is ever truly going to change anything unfortunately when it comes down to it the 1 will always win if we chant that we want more theyll just take more itll always be an infinite loop of us staying at the bottom and the very few at the top the only way to truly solve this is to put a cap on how much a person can make within a year no one person truly needs more than a million dollars a year yachts multiple homes cars jets etc theyll always want more if we dont limit to how much they can spend with a million dollar cap on any single person the revenue of the business can reach more of the employees keeping it running were talking trillions of dollars coming down from the top to the hard working imagine how much of that money can also go back into the business investing into ways to make our hard work not as stressful and painful employees can go to work knowing they are providing for their family and most likely be able to work less and retire earlier this is the real way to change everything let me know what you think about this,p1hs07

2538,As free as I can be,hello all lots of negativity on here i joined because i love not working being able to completely detach from the work force for a little while and enjoy the simple things in life i think is my true passion taking a nap on a tuesday afternoon and not having anything to do for 2 weeks is the best feeling in the world to me i dont think that that is a realistic option for our entire lives though human beings have been working in one way or another since day one we live in a system where money is the middle man for everything we need to survive very few of us have to build our own shelters or hunt for our own food anymore these things have been replaced by buying these things with money now with that being said i think it is possible to find a middle ground and not be totally burned out with existance  i had a job been a carpenter most of my life with a company for 6 years my boss bragged about his brand new ford raptor and his vacation house in florida and told me a raise just wasnt in the budget that year everytime my manager called me i instantly lit up with anger i was made to feel guilty for not wanting to work for 7 days a week and was supposed to be happy with running a crew for 18 an hour it was killing me  opportunity arose i was working on a commercial project building landings to get into pools at a gym and the building owner asked if i wanted to dosome work at his home i said sure i wound up making what i made at my job in 2 weeks in one day cash i ran with it i quit a couple months later and started my own business nothing crazy a guy with some tools and a pickup truck building decks my only regret is not doing it sooner  its not a perfect life but it beats the shit out of dreading phone calls from managers and bosses in know are getting rich off of me breaking my back i found it pretty simple stay away from stupid materialistic purchases dont finance a brand new vehicle buy a used one and learn how to work on it dont max yourself out trying to buy a home get a fixer upper anything you could possibly want to do can be learned on youtube my mortgage is 825 a month in nj nonethenless live small skip the bullshit and be happy no credit cards either  thats how i found my way outbest of luck to you,p1bmzv

2544,Does anyone else's Boss/Owner/VIP of your company come in to the work place screaming and yelling without any context on a consistent basis?,to give context the company i work for is about 100ish people and is involved in construction  the owner is still really involved in different aspects of the company especially sales and this is his baby that he has built from the ground up starting back in 1983  he is a beast of a man and honestly he has been a cool guy to work for though he can be intimidating  the past year however  i see him come in less and less as he is slowly transitioning towards retirement  when he does come in he is just screaming and yelling and there is no context  i work in the office and it does not make any sense to me  it seems like one of two things  the owner is pitching a tantrum or he is trying to give off bde and show he is still the boss and in charge  he was recently gone for a month and everything ran smoothly  he comes back into the office this morning just yelling and swearing like a sailor and i have no idea why  honestly i am at a point where i am unhappy with this company and i feel like there is this constant cloud of pressure of getting work done and done right along with the impending when is the owner going to lose his mind on us next  it honestly makes me want to quit every time he comes in now  i have no idea what stresses he has in his life but i know this  the culture around this place has evolved into one that makes me feel unappreciated for my work and that i should have the attitude that i am lucky to have a job in the first place  i am going to be leaving soon but i wish i could find a way to stay as i have vested so much time and energy into this place already  i cant put up with the way people treat each other here anymore  i am sick of it  i am sick of the owners rants  i am sick of managements lack of respect  i am sick of felling so much pressure and a total lack of job security  this is not a healthy environment to work in mentally anymore  i dread everyday and i just want to walk out and never comeback  id rather work somewhere making half the money knowing i could have no stress  i have worked in this environment my entire life in one way or another  i am completely fed up with it and i am ready to just blow up on someone  not harm anyone mind you but fucking lose my shit on someone and give them a piece of my mind  nothing is ever good enough  if the owner were to come in and start yelling at me right now i would collect some of my things and walk the fuck out right now whilst telling him exactly where he can stick the job  i am not going to sit here and be disrespected like that  tldr  does anyone else have superiors that make the work environment so uncomfortable or toxic from a constant need to assert authority that you just want to quit,p1rn2y

2554,Corporations are Experiencing the Five Stages of Grief over Remote Work,on linkedin i dont really do much but i do follow a few tags namely futureofwork returntooffice and workfromhome over the last almost two years now ive seen articles trickle in commented on a few and voted on various polls im very proremote myself and i support the optional model that being said spending all this time reading articles ive come to a conclusion  i believe we are witnessing corporations go through the five stages of grief over remote work  now they havent gone through all the steps were actually just leaving anger and beginning bargaining there was a poll the other day with over 600 replies that said what would you be willing to give up to stay remote the only answers were part of my paycheck some ptovacation time and nothing id faster go back each with some cute emoji following it i dont really know what any of those options did to warrant a fun emoji seeing as theyre all completely horrible but i digress what was amazing that of the hundreds of comments the vast majority were complaining that there was no option to give up nothing people really really hated that poll and today there was an article about how goldman sachs is giving away food to people who come in once again with unearned goofy taglines like the fastest way to a bankers heart is through their stomach looking at that article besides being offended that they think free food is enough to tempt people back during a literal global pandemic it made me start thinking of the five stages of grief thats when i realized this is bargaining  taking a step back when lockdowns started the big corporations were still in the drivers seat there was no labor shortage this whole thing was an anomaly and wed all be back in the office soon it was unthinkable that wed still be working from home by may hell president trump even loudly declared that he expected the whole thing to blow over in april you know like a miracle but then of course it didnt and worse for the corporates people were happier working from home anxiety was down productivity was up so we started getting a slew of articles about how we should all remember that this was just temporary jamie dimon went off about how he hated zoom david solomon called wfh an aberration etc the resounding message from wall street was this is not the new normal their entire front against remote work was denial in reality they had no control over what was going on moreover with the hurdle of an requiring an office to appear legitimate gone startups found themselves with giant wads of cash and a new perk people loved  remote forever we dont even have an office morphed into a selling point and the extra money they had went to scouting top talent remote work and series a startups became a match made in heaven  so of course after denial comes anger weve seen this all over the place mostly with articles headlined with loaded questions could remotework damage your chances to be promoted could remotework destroy the economy are people who work from home unhappier you know the ones article after article just fearmongering and lashing out against remote work hell id even include the forced mandates to returntooffice as part of this phase  such comtempt for people working at home they demand people come back under threat of them losing their jobs for a while it was unclear what was going to happen with remote work postvaccine that is if all of this wasnt actually the new normal and that we would resume our daily commuting routine as we had always done but then bless the great resignation started people bailed all over the place voting with their feet recruiters started shopping around the banks for talent like they were in walmart work from home wasnt a perk it was a lifestyle and those with a strong taste for it quickly started looking for new jobs then big companies began declaring their intents facebook would be optional forever twitter would be optional forever linkedin would be optional forever even google who had originally wanted to bring back everyone in september reversed course completely and now plans to let essentially any employee work from home indefinitely  the banks never gave up this fight theyre locked in a war they lost over a year ago to stop all this from becoming the new normal and honestly yea i get why theyre angry they puffed out their chests and demanded compliance and their best people just left worse they pushed out their wave of antiwfh propaganda and it just fell flat the banks have spent years doing the absolute minimum effort for their workers putting them in creatively sterile environments and embracing a seating layout somehow worse than cubefarms now people dont want to come back and quit when forced and all the big corporations can do is be upset no one cares how they feel  all that being said i suspect were going to start seeing more negotiation articles will you come back for food will you let us not pay you if you stay home stuff like that im interested to see what other weird angles theyll come at with this i suspect most of what will be offered will be at best useless and at worst offensive but its still a nice change to see corporates attempting to kowtow,p15azv

2568,i need advice - is it ok for my work to treat me this way?,hello this is my first post on here bear with me im 19f a sophomore in college for computer science and i got a job at what i thought would be a kickstart to getting experience in my field while in school i was ecstatic to say the least ive been here since may  this job has maybe 300 employees  all in different areas of production when i got hired on i let them know that 1 i was in college and i may need schedule adjustments while still staying full time for zoom classes as i pay for my own school and its very expensive live on my own etc and 2 may need to work remote since i have a number of health issues as well as school the workplace is also about 40 minutes away from me with traffic and its just not worth the drive for 11 an hour they agreed and understood both of those things upon hiring me i got hired on as a remote employee 90 if not more of the employees worked off site to begin with and i honestly felt spoiled it was great working from home and getting my needs accommodated for the first time at a job   so fast forward a few months  early july they tell me i need to come back on site and im not allowed to wfh anymore for no good reason which isnt a huge issue i liked the job enough at this time but the real kicker is they tell me word for word that i need to get my priorities straight when it comes to work and school  so i was like  what does that mean they hired me on knowing im a college student and they agreed to all of my schedule things and whatnot a few days previously i had sent an email to my supervisor saying that school was starting back up in a couple of weeks and i may need adjustments to my schedule here and there to make room for class time   ever since then everyone in my department has been super passive aggressive at me treating me unfairly and my supervisors are trying to take back everything they told me about working with my schedulemy needs when i got hired on   for example at my job we have to meet a quota every day as far as productionaccuracy ive been pretty damn good at meeting if not exceeding that quota ive been getting emails criticizing every little detail about my work there that i didnt get previously even though my productionaccuracy is almost perfect and its all so condescending   i got an email also saying they couldnt work with my requests anymore from when i got hired because it wouldnt be fair to the other people who have been there longer than me whatever that means   at work we also have a thing kinda like discord we use to talk to each other it has channels for each department and theres one specific to my department to ask questions about things we have to complete workwise  now every time i ask a question i get zero response every time theyll answer other peoples questions in there though just not mine i feel like theyre ignoring me and it just feels so awkward   one of my other friends worked for this company previously and they did some pretty awful stuff to him when he tried to leave and eventually got fired pretty much the same situation with me he asked for an adjustment that was previously agreed on and they ignored him and started ghosting him at the work place as well   it goes deeper than that but tldr i picked up a job really liked it got my work schedule to work with my school schedule everything was great until i remind them that my school is starting back and i may need adjustments to keep up with my classes after i remind them of that they start treating me unfair and ignoring me  my question now is i got a new job offer for higher pay doing something i really like that will be more convenient for me i know people there and it should be way less stressful on me  should i  a put my two weeks in and just tough it out even though im getting no help at all and everyone at my work is being petty towards me and ignoring me etc take the job offer after the 2 weeks is up or b just leave bring their work computers back and everything they lent to me at the end of today tell them im quitting and that i returned everything  explain that working with them was the opposite of a pleasure and take up the new job which i would start this week  i hope this makes sense please let me know if im being too much of a baby over this i just dont like the weird drama at my work place now for the most part i email one person my supervisor that i need an adjustment then all of a sudden everyone at work starts ignoring me and talking about me behind my back and its just not worth my stress,p12n3q

2661,sometimes it takes a little bit of inspiration and a maverick,tldr i actually somehow changed my work culture and learned that its possible to influence others to make positive changes in worklife  i worked a job where it was very common for all my coworkers to stay late well after close and even if they had completely finished their departments tasks  also keep in mind there were many other abuses such as neglecting to give me breaks that i was legally entitled to but thats another story i remember being the sorta new guy although id been there for a few months already and one night i asked one of the coworkers i had a somewhat friendship with do we have to stay like i dont remember them ever mentioning this in the job description or interview even though i asked and i thought they were sticklers for following schedule and the time clock  remember business only care about their time not yours  he said its just normal and youd appreciate it too if your work wasnt entirely done and needed help to go home the thing is i was often employee of the month and i never needed this help because i did my work and finished on time like a good timemanaging person should so one night it was well over an hour past closing time and i was there again helping some other department i asked this same coworker what would happen if i clocked out and left im not trying to be a jerk i just need to be somewhere and didnt expect that i would be at work this late  keep in mind that i like many unfortunate workersdid not own a car and relied on others help for commute dont get me started on how fucking completely stupid america is with its urban sprawl and forced cardependency so i was in a position where no matter what i did it would be rude to someone  he says i wouldnt leave until were done youd probably get in big trouble and i dont want to see that happen to you ok i thought if im still on the clock im still getting paid not overtime though because in order to correct this situation they gave me fewer hours go figure  but when this happened again and it was way too late after close and i really respected the person helping me get to and from work i made the decision to leave  everyone around me had either a look of disbelief or resentment im sure there might have even been jealousy but i wasnt going to divest myself of my own dignity any longer so i went to the break room clocked out got my stuff and left  the next time i went in the head manager had a talk with me and said effectively that he was going to let me keep that job but that im on thin ice and he ended up doubling my workload in addition to having me train three new people and fewer hours i wasnt having it any more i planned to leave and never look back so i informed the scheduling manager that in about a month i would be taking a week off to go out of state that date came and instead of going back to work i simply never returned and never spoke to any of them again  as it turned out about a year after i quit i found myself back accompanying a relative as she was doing business there  there were a lot of workers i didnt recognize luckily thanks to the lovely turnover but one person was working that i did remember and i asked him about their closing situation and what they do when a department has runover tasks that they needed to finish before they could clock out and leave  as it turns out my leaving that one night inspired others to do the same and as a result management had to create a solution instead of having everyone stay well over their scheduled time and do work that wasnt their responsibility or punish employees that worked efficiently and got their tasks done they had the managers complete it and eventually created a new overnight position come in and put everything in order  in the end its never that companys cant do the right thing and respect their employees its that they dont want to and wont unless forced  this taught me a valuable lesson  no one wants to be the nail that sticks up no one feels comfortable being the bad disobedient worker who will then be reprimanded or get their job and sense of security taken away but sometimes all it takes is some inspiration and people who are emboldened by anothers taking the step forward and setting new precedents can collectively make a change for themselves toward the better we can hold better standards value ourselves higher and accept less abuse and exploitation  change is possible if we take the steps and let it  and i brought this lesson to a later job that i had for so long i envied and longed for the worklife balance of a country like france or italy where workers are more at ease and dont have to degrade themselves like people do in america so one day i just pretended like i was in italy with those standards and expectations i didnt let customers walk over me i acted like my employer was lucky to have me work there and it was a privilege that they could even have someone do their job well let alone above and beyond like i did and eventually i noticed change in the work culture among my coworkers after a year i got to train people and instill in them the philosophy i had and how to approach the job and i even told people in higher positions than me how i think they should respond to certain problems they were having with management  i couldnt even hardly recognize this job from when i first started and it was almost scary to see how much better things were by my coworkers imitating me or listening to my advice everyone was happier and that made my life so much less stressful  when covid hit for whatever reason we got even more slammed with clients than ever before all the karens and entitled shitheads came out of the woodwork but i just reminded myself that my health and safety are important and its just a service its not actually important at the end of the day and certainty not worth dying over  i had money saved up and with the stimulus check the insanely hightened stress was just not worth it anymore i was not going to put up with it so i quit but i was thankful knowing that coworkers i left behind would have a slightly less stressed job thanks to the culture i helped to instill  imagine what we could do as a society with higher expectations higher selfworth and no more tolerance for capitalist bull shit the changes that i helped make were nothing and im sorry if ive sounded like im bragging but in all honesty that stuff is irrelevant compared to the vast systematic problems at hand i just want to think that we can have hope in humanity and in each other to make things better and get justice hopefully it takes a little bit of inspiration and a few trailblazers and of course much less tolerance for abuse,ozdoax
2662,Roughly 80 some full days of every year are lost to work,i ran some numbers using this formula 365  holiday and vacation days x hours worked per week  7 and assuming someone works 40 hour work weeks with 2 weeks of vacation and a few holidays off they would spend 83 rounded full twenty four hour days at work that doesnt really sound like a lot but if you figure a worker works like that from the age of 25 to 65 thats over 9 full years january 1st straight through to december 31st with no days off given to someone else who most likely doesnt even know their name    obviously hours worked and extra days off vary wildly for everyone and none of this accounts for time to prepare or commuting but i think its definitely a good conversation starter if nothing else,ozhkj4

2671,"Out of money, out of options, no plays in hand, don't know what to do",its another one of those posts  im a field service technician by morning and a violin teacher in a shop by afternoon at least for two days a week im paid a decent wage but only am assigned about 20 hours of tech work a week because thats the entire volume of where i live in asheville the teaching job also pays a decent wage but also lacks work so i wind up teaching for 8 hours a week i technically have another teaching job in another shop for the other 3 weekdays but its been about 2 months since i got the job and i still dont have a single student  im able to get by just by the skin of my teeth but theres been some drama at my tech job that is causing problems with that let me explain  since i work out of peoples houses my work typically expects the defective parts to be shipped back to the manufacturer after having some problems with the return shipping because i was never trained on it i discovered that the point of sale system would allow me to mark things as being left with the customer giving me the the processing successful screen and allowing me to close the call i called my supervisor and asked if the system would ever erroneously display this screen allowing me to screw myself over by leaving a part onsite that actually isnt supposed to be left and he said no as long as i got to the processing successful screen im good  well that was a fucking lie and despite that i did this for months with no problems suddenly the manufacturers start wanting the parts back my supervisor calls me and asks me where those parts are i tell him i left them onsite and that i confirmed with him that it was okay to do this he said i was never supposed to leave anything onsite and that that button was only supposed to be used in very specific circumstances later while they were investigating the issue they discovered that the system used to not let you do that but had been changed recently and now allows you to erroneously post parts  they have me recover as many parts as i could but i couldnt get all of them and suddenly work starts talking about docking my paycheck for the parts when the manufacturers come to collect they assure me that theyll work something out to do it little by little and that it would be okay it would just suck for a while and that theyre on my side  then on payday i get an invoice with no paycheck a week later i start asking where my paycheck is and the bookkeeper apparently just forgot or had something come up and that she would get right on it literally days later my paystub comes in and not only do they decide to just roll it into my next paycheck they decided to dock me 300 for these parts without ever confirming with me or telling me how much i need to pay off  on sub 30 hours a week even with a decent wage im still struggling to pay my bills i have no savings i run out of money every paycheck so 300 takes me from being just barely covered to missing bills i dont know how the bookkeeper doesnt know this considering that she sees my paycheck and its obvious that i cant sustain on that amount  it just never ends i can never get enough tickets to support myself but i cant get another day job because i have to leave before 2pm to go teach and in it thats a no go  i dont know what to do i cant just get another it job because of the scheduling and im not gaining students at either of my teaching jobs my degree is in music and its what i love more than anything so i cant just quit not even 6 months after i actually stumbled my way into an actual job in the field they even pay a really good wage compared to my previous jobs  i have such a strong urge to just quit all of it to give my violin to some needy but talented kid to never listen to another piece of music ever again and just move on and try to forget it all happened but i dont even have any options for this either im already in debt from music school and on top of that my partner says that we cannot move out of asheville and its nonnegotiable despite being a nurse who could literally work in any town we dont even have any friends in town just her family i moved away from my family just to come here to be with her  i could say fuck it and go back to school to be an aerospace engineer like i wanted to as a kid but there are no schools here and the job would require moving out of asheville   k12 music teacher no graduate programs here would need to move to get a job  collegiate music teacher no programs need to move  same thing to become an aampp debt cant work in asheville  she says to go work at petsmart or something which must be easy for her to say she has 10s of thousands in savings even after dropping 10k towards a down payment on a car i end each paycheck with under 100 in my account  im just trying to be a regular adult im fucking 24 i go to sangha every week i run 5ks to stay healthy and i dont drink anything thats not coffee or water im smart dedicated to my both of my crafts am really good at both of them and show up on time im not asking for much but nobody has any place in society for me it feels like i should just walk out

(20M),currently a fastfood chain worker living in massachusetts also a college student  i have been working this job over the summer for the past 8 weeks overall meh its fast food what do you expect but not the worst thing in the world only reason why i am doing it is because my other internship is unpaid marketing intern  i came into the job expecting to work only part time 20ish hours a week but eventually it ramped up to the point where it got to 35 hours a week it has taken time away that i want to devote to my other job as well my anger for the fast food job culminated in a week where i worked 4 days in a row over a weekend during a major sporting event where i became exhausted afterwards i specifically requested that my manager do not work me on back to back days after which she complied and granted my request and so far things have been better  this upcoming week however i was put on for four straight days  monday through thursday which i planned as my last day i had already put in my two weeks notice i am also working the sunday prior to that week so i have to work five days in a row   i addressed my manager about it immediately she was going away for the first half of the week and needed someone to cover she stated that she really tried to work with my needs but could not even though the are other who could help i tried to ask her to find someone else to cover and she could not find any takers  should i stay or leave the only reason i ask this is that my manger has been quite nice to me and super helpful in navigating the restaurant and i dont want to seem like an asshole fucking her over otherwise i would have quit outright and not made this post i dont need the money and could spend the time doing something else but i would like to get some outside opinions before i make a final decision,p00wrz

2776,"""Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way"" - Alan Watts, on Work.",i think a lot of people either forget or try to ignore the fact that they are going to die one day this becomes more evident when it comes to having a job or when someone brings up the idea of how fucked up it is that generally you have to do something you dislike for most of your life so you can keep living which is mostly doing something you dislike most people have been so conditioned to the idea that you have to work hard to earn the right to live which is ridiculous were all going to die one day so why do we as a society make the time we spend alive unnecessarily unenjoyable we have the resources to take care of all of our basic needs without too much strain and yet people frown at the idea of universal basic income its so sad that most people have been conditioned to love their slavery so much so that when they come across someone who doesnt want to be a slave they call them lazy and a leech but why were all going to die whats the point of spending our time alive chasing money which is really only paper we choose to give value collectively i honestly would rather die than live my life this way because what would be the point    everyday i remind myself that im going to die one day and when i face this fact it becomes hard for me to waste my time doing something i hate for money which has no ability to make me truly happy in a better society from a young age children will be given the space to explore their talents and what theyre passionate about so that when they grow up that will be what they do for a living one person who seemed to really understand this idea was alan wattshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv0n1awqewt0i and he inspired me to spend my time doing what i enjoyhttpssoundcloudcomremedy97vangogh instead of chasing paper,oz5phx

2815,Written 100 years ago. How little has changed,when the worker gets his first job the world about him takes off its mask he sees it as it is hours are long and most work is monotonous any child or young person naturally very much dislikes this first harsh experience of the world of the working class his games and funmaking are given up his physical growth is stunted and his mind dwarfed more or less long ago nearly all of the young men who went to work for wages began by learning a trade this trade was very often extremely interesting to them it educated their minds and developed their bodies if they were apprenticed at eighteen then perhaps at twenty one they were sure of steady work and good wages today very few of the working people learn a trade they work in some factory store or office at tasks which they perform as well in a month as they do in ten years if the young wage earner is vigorous in mind and body he revolts at this labor and makes a desperate struggle to secure an education or otherwise make it possible for himself to rise out of the working class the stronger and healthier his body and the keener his mind the harder does he fight but he finds except in very rare instances that the doors of opportunity are closed to the children of the workers  if the young worker learns one of the trades which still remain in modern industry he finds after he has learned it that it also is being abolished by the invention of new machinery he may go to night school and complete a course of study or take a correspondence course in mechanics or some other form of applied science if he does he will discover that his knowledge gotten at such sacrifice of time savings and effort will not raise his wages there are now so many educated poor people that their pay is on the average much less than that of skilled workers in the trades another hope of the young workers men and women is to save money and start in some small business others have riseni and become wealthy why not they so by giving up all pleasures by overwork and pitiful economies does the young worker make his start in business if he has been fortunate enough not to lose his money through some bank swindle he at last after years of effort tries his luck the best data we have show that more than ninetenths of those who engage in small business fail utterly the small portion who succeed do so by working night and day sundays and holidays even they make but meager livings no better on the average than the wageworkers  the hearts and minds of nearly all young american working people are full of hope they cannot conceive that it would be possible for them to toil on throughout their lifetime for small wages and every day find the work getting harder they do not at first realize what it is to be a wageworker they are unmarried and hence often have a little more money than is absolutely necessary to keep them this the young workers usually spend for good clothes and for an occasional holiday the daily grind of labor has not yet deadened their minds nor crushed their spirits plans for advancement are constantly being formed  then come marriage and responsibility for a family perhaps the care of aged parents adds to the burden in any case by the time the worker is twentyfive years of age he has lost his grip on his hope for something better at thirty with growing burdens he gets to be quite content to work along day by day without looking forward to anything but his saturday pay envelope he is likely to be afflicted by some chronic illness due to the nature of his work or the insanitary condition of his factory or home perhaps illness in his family or the birth of a number of children so increase his burden that his struggle becomes a pitiless daily conflict to liveat thirtyfive years of age these conditions coupled with occasional unemployment drive the worker often to despair but later he gets used to it poor food shoddy clothing a shack to live in unemploymentthese are his lot in life and he makes the best of it the old saying of the poet hope springs eternal in the human breast is not at all true of the working people of today in them hope dies at forty or fifty years of age the average worker plods along rather carelessly if he suffers an injury in the factory he eats without worry the bread of charity which twenty years before he would have despised lie knows that he cannot educate his children lie may see them go early to work and injure their health but he is so happy to receive their weekly wage to help out at home that he forgets that they are young and should be at play or at school  this man is exactly what the owners and rulers of america now wish him to be he is strong enough to do the work they want done he does not demand vacations and amusement a better home and education for his children so he will not strike for more wages the vast majority of the american working people over forty years of age cannot be made to understand their condition life for them has lost all light and beauty and hence all desire for more of its good things quite as hopeless is the state of mind of some of the younger workers a portion of these born of parents broken and weary from work and themselves underfed and sent early to factories are as careless about their conditions of life as are their parents but with a majority of the young and a considerable minority of the older folks this is not true they want more wages and less work they desire rest and leisure a chance to know their family and friends better and an occasional vacation in the country they wish to read hear good musicand go to theaters above all they crave better food and more of it and they know that their limbs are stiff because of the lack of enough rest and exercise  to such and such only are the following pages addressed those who are utterly broken in body and decayed in mind those who are deadened beyond being moved by the facts of life those who think that they somehow deserve all the labor and pain and misery of the world and that a few others should enjoy plenty and peace and opportunity we earnestly request to at once pass this booklet along to someone else for it can be of no interest to themselves  we see today a working class bowed down by labor we see it starved by poverty we see all its efforts to improve its condition met by blows in the face we see babies dying because their parents cannot support them we see tender children enslaved because they toil for low wages we see strong men committing crimes because they cannot find masters we see the aged after lives of long and loving service begging for bread and craving death  socialism is a message of hope it is addressed to the working class it will save the working class or rather show the working class how to save itself the world does not need to be cursed by long labor by low wages by starvation by worry and by disease millions now know that these conditions may be completely changed when enough of the workers understand socialism believe in it and are firmly resolved to have it the time will be ripe for the change that change is coming it is coming soon every

2896,I hate how depressed work makes me,so ive never really had good luck with jobs and long story short after having a severe mental breakdown and being forced to leave a position for both my physical and mental health almost three years later and still feeling the shit that job did to my body i was a university drop out and was heading nowhere fast i didnt even want to live  after this event i managed to find a grant that fit my situation and went back to school where i officially graduated from a web and software development program my uncle even gave me a part time position at his business during this and now this job is the source of a lot of frustration and feelings of being taken advantage of  other than the owners and the owners son i am the most senior member of staff now i have learned every aspect of that business seriously i have written all of their standard operating procedures they throw me from position to position to do whatever they want at a whims notice and above all that they gave me a special project of redesigning and developing their new website  now you would think the website thing would be a good thing and i thought so too but its a job worth 10000 and i ended up getting paid 800 for it the website is working out for him too it has increased customer conversion by 400 since its launch a few months ago and they are now front page google search   this all sounds like pretty good work despite being taken advantage of for a website right well i am the least paid there and half of the things i do the operations manager gets the credit despite him having done nothing for the task for example i was once in charge of getting a delinquent customer to pay their 120000 bill this took a week of work communicating with the customer and developing a strategy plan and implementing a new software into our business i then trained everyone in the business on the software and payments started coming through that friday i remember my uncle going to the operations manager happy and exclaiming good job name you deserve praise for this one  and because i probably have way more access to their business than what they realize i also know that after a month of working with us he was hired in november the operations manager got a christmas bonus of 2000 cash while i was given 100 prepaid visa and i dont want to sound like i am complaining about a bonus but i feel absolutely worthless and tossed to the side   and my uncle is the type of man to yell he has never given raises to workers who ask and quite frankly i am trying to find a job in my field and here is why im starting to get even more depressed  i have applied to an insane amount of jobs i have had countless people read over my resume i even have the live site plus other web projects for an alright portfolio i just get rejection after rejection after rejection i dont know what to do and i have been having a terrible day i needed to get this off of my chest and ive already bugged all of my friends too much with this  i just feel so hopeless and like nothing i do to try and improve my life will ever work because of how greedy and terrible every job is,oxryzn

2986,Something to laugh at…,i had a chuckle this afternoon the company i work for has a tendency to leave things to the last minute like this event that has been happening over the last few weeks we are moving from one warehouse to another and as usual they have left it to the last minute we have to be out of the warehouse in 24 hours and the amount of stock that has to be moved is equivalent to almost 30 semi loads   management has known about it for weeks and has not put it in the daily planning so from this afternoon they were scrambling to organise trucks etc most of us work in 8 or 12 hour shifts warehouse office and forklift operators are 8 hours truck drivers are 12 hours   this afternoon at 1430 the hoist loader finishes loading a truck parks the hoist and walks outhis shift ended at 1430 started at 600 so 8 hours plus 30min break there was 3 trucks waiting in line to get loadedat about 3040min loading time per truck  right as he walks out our operations manager walks in asks him where he is going he says home his shift ended manager loses his shit saying we have 24hours to be out of the warehouse everyone is expected to do their part and extra to get the company though this   loader calmly looks at him and says  lack of planning on your side does not constitute an emergency on mine i have to pick my kid up from school you have not asked or arranged beforehand for me to stay late so i am going   turns around and walks out get in his car and drives off the rest of us chuckle and get in our trucks to continue waiting manager got on the hoist and did the loading for about 4 hours until they could find someone to relieve him   it was a good day,oyd30t
2987,Here's the thing,at this point i have been on 3 jobs but couldnt last a week on any of them and just got paid for the days worked i wasnt fired or had any fights while working on them and in fact i do everything properly but theres always this feeling that tells me i am doing the wrong thing even when i am trying to earn some money  but after thinking deeper about it for most of you guys for example work hours are from 9 to 5 where i live is 8 to 4 but even with those hours i feel that i dont have enough time to do what i like and enjoy the rest of it coming back from work takes around 30 mins because lf traffic shower another 10 or 20 depending of how dirty i return and to relax the body after spending those 8 hours standing barely sitting for a min then that is another 30 mins or probably more 8 hours of sleep and then another 30 mins to get everything ready the next morning but then it seems that theres not enough time to think on the projects i have since i am thinking on what i have to do the next day at work  the only moment when i feel good doing something even if i end exhausted is when i am doing something creative been an artist since i was a kid so i know how to do realistic drawings the sad part of this is that i cant find a way to make money out of it where i live artists are barely recognized so theres not enough room for the things i do since its a developing country everyone is focused on sales yeah the main goal is for the city to turn into a metropolis  i was wondering if theres another kind of work maybe volunteer into something while i learn a new skill and also leaves me with enough time to keep developing my artistic talent without having to work for 8 hours or having the feeling that i am slaving my life away for the goal of some dude i actually want to do something but with the feeling that i am doing something good for somebody else and not just for the pocket of my boss and to keep the rich guys happy  i could go even deeper with this btw but i dont want to make this longer  also fuck henry ford and his 888 consumerism life which everyone copied,oydn57

3048,"""It Is No Measure of Health to be Well-Adjusted to a Profoundly Sick Society"" Essay by Charles Eisenstein",   its no measure of health to be adjusted to a profoundly sick society transcript  so i believe that is a krishnamurti quote it is no measure of  health to be welladjusted to a profoundly sick society if youre  welladjusted like adjusted to what you know youre able to go along  with program youre able to make yourself study hard and get good  grades take the ap classes sign up for extracurriculars to make a  good resume so that you can get into the good college where you study  hard some more and you play by the rules and youre okay with that  youre adjusted to it youre a creature of that system and that way of  being which is fine if we agree that that system is the system that we  should have and that the world youre participating in is the world  that we want and that the direction that you are helping take us is the  direction that we want to go  if you were a you know a white middleclass person in the 1950s  1960s1970s it was pretty easy to believe those things that society  was basically on the right track that science was solving our problems  that modern medicine was conquering one disease after another that we  were progressing life was getting better and better since then its  become harder and harder to maintain the belief that we are living in  the right world  this is something that maybe like really sensitive prescient people  have seen this for forever but i believe that it began to take on a  mass character i mean i hesitate to put a date on it but certainly  when i was a kid it was starting to wear thin a little bit i certainly  sensed a wrongness in the world that pervaded everything i couldnt  make myself adjust i couldnt make myself be welladjusted i could  and welladjusted can mean going through the motions and at least  complying with the explicit requirements of participation and i  couldnt even quite do that and a lot of people in my generation  couldnt do that either  so we became slackers or we became addicted to things or we became  fuckups or wed procrastinate and not study hard and get drunk you  know like if you really believed in the program you wouldnt be  getting drunk every weekend in college because youd have an aim youd  have a goal youd have something you cared about the drunkenness the  addiction the squandering of endless hours in front of video games and  mindless pursuits these are not some problem that must be overcome to  make us better participants in society these are symptoms these would  not exist if we were in a life we really cared about  without that aim without that magnetic pole that directs our actions  and that gives us this filter ok what am i going to do today what  makes sense without that then we are lost then we kind of reach for  this we reach for that and the emptiness that we feel we fill it up  we are driven then to fill it up with whatever can distract us from it  or maybe we take on fake goals substitutes for the lifeaim or the  life purpose that we are really craving higher levels in world of  warcraft or something like that more points in the video game more  money more more more more of something but not the real thing that  we really want  so whether its laziness procrastination addiction selfsabotage  greed materialism all these things that we judge and say is the  problem these are the symptoms its not because there is something  wrong with you that you just cant make yourself get with the program  its that there is something wrong with the program so of course you  dont want to participate of course you get depressed and just want to  withdraw and just cant make yourself do it its not because youre  unhealthy its a mutiny of the soul  or you get anxious something is wrong around here and the  authorities say no no no everything is just fine the problem is  with you here are some meds now i understand that immersed within  this reality there may be no obvious alternative to the medications  that enables a person to keep going this is a very very hot button  topic because many people will say that the meds saved me they  turned my life around they saved me from depression and maybe am not  qualified to pass judgment on whether or not they are universally a bad  thing but i can see what their general function is its to keep people  operational in the world that is given to them  and its a catch22 how do you get out of that world what  alternative do you have to simply coping with it simply adjusting to  it  i cant offer a recipe for how to get out of it but i can say that  the desire to get out of it the question of how do i get out of it  the prayer to be liberated from it will be heard and will bring  results in the end  httpscharleseisensteinorgvideoitisnomeasureofhealthtobewelladjustedtoaprofoundlysicksocietyhttpscharleseisensteinorgvideoitisnomeasureofhealthtobewelladjustedtoaprofoundlysicksociety

3083,"Why are the people who should be fired, well, not?",ok i cant sleep for insert story so i may wake up to typos that i will want to fix later  but my brain decided to think about this topic for some reason   i work part time but ironically the hourly pay is more than a lot of full time jobs so it makes it hard to want to want to leave when its overall easy compared to previous jobs ive had and to most available full time jobs i see  with that said i do work in an office setting and i work under the hr person who is my supervisor but i do not do any hr myself so i tend to see the ppl coming and going   there was a department head whose department had some turnovers i cannot vouch the validity of what i have heard in terms of rumors but i can believe it  when you leave you can submit anything directly to the bossboss without your department head seeing it at least 3 times people were writing fucking essays it seems judging by how long they were writing it in the office was this ever person fired no   when a new department head got hired cuz the one with complaints retired wow no turnovers at all yet but i also dont hear any rumors circulating  now i havent had much experience in an office setting besides this job so idk how typical this is butmy expectations for hr was a little higher than what i got as my supervisor is  not the brightest bulb is bad at spelling and names which she likes to remind everyone for some reason like that isnt something to brag about once asked how to spell recruit while typing req and i had to cut in with c rec and no idk how spell check didnt inform her of this   an employee one time asked me for hr related things but i have no knowledge or authorization for any of that she confessed that she doesnt trust my supervisor as hr  which i cannot fault them on when my supervisor gossips all the damn time and overexaggerates her stories    randomly blurts out confidential things and then says to everyone in the office theres 4 of us total to not repeat that to anyone   terrible at communicating problems with technology shes not old shes a millennial   all of the above them makes mefeel a lot less guilty for slacking off at work i seriously stopped giving a fuck cuz if she doesnt get fired i am impossible to fire then cuz comparatively   i know how to fucking spell shit and sound out names i genuinely feel like she doesnt know how to sound out wordsnames   i absorb gossip but i never do the bad talking which i feel like just makes people talk to me more about secrets but whatever gtgt   i can actually retell an event without grossly over exaggerating something pointless  im no technologically expert but as a millennial i still know my way around i know how to communicate with it and our service contracts regarding our copiersphonesetc cuz i dont make up phrases like phantom ringing when explaining what the issue is and i know how to change inks without someone coming out to do it for us which i guess they had to do before cuz my supervisor didnt know how to replace ink  its gotten to the point that i am really good at finding paper jams and fixing copier problems not all of course just fix issues that saves us having to call for service  sorry that turned into a semirant but the question still stands cuz wtf   please enlighten me with any similar stories i know its not uncommon for unqualified people to keep their jobs for reasons i dont quite understand still   ok gonna try sleeping now night everyone xd thank you if you still read my ramble,ox31ry

3085,A story of my best friend and her evil employer who cut her salary and gave it back.,in 2020 my best friends employer fired almost everyone in her office because the companys sales were affected due to covid they gave majority of the responsibilities to her they also closed down the office and told her to just work from home  then they cut her salary by about 20000 so she went from making 55000 to 25000 they justified it of course by saying low sales  so now shes working almost twice as much and harder for way less pay  then in 2021 after about 11 months she told me they gave her back the 20000 and a 2000 bonus  i used to work there years ago and i know damn well this company could easily survive without firing a single person she still works there sadly,oxn59y

3094,"For Filipinos, why not address recruitment malpractices?", rphcareers is too vanilla for me to post this and want to seemingly attract an employerfocused subreddit rather than an employee one  my biggest letdown in the vicious cycle of bpo industries is the number of exploitative baits they still flail at you even if the pool is intelligent enough to sense it i tried to tap the market just for fun customer service rep and i had one of the worst interviews with a wellrespected bpo company in ph  well they do curate images so what do i expect i got it but declined it without hesitation for alarming reasons if that was the best whats left to it  for starters they advertised misleading work setups required me to have a pc internet even ridiculed one of the candidates in front of us for not having one it was so sad when in fact it was onsite and the recruiter even said and i quote yknow theres no such thing as bpo work from home are you aware of that thats impossible its not meant to be that way we will never offer this option in a condescending tone while he hisses at his dogs crying baby and the screeching cars in front of his house maybe for you i guess no company help for you during the pandemic unlike mine why advertise it then  anyway he even gave his high strung opinion on my previous work you wont excel nor grow from that field i tried it before there are no opportunities and no learning whatsoever you should consider this position today i have your contract ready immediately do i need to hear your own failures when its not relevant to the conversation when in fact i do excel i am still striving and thats why you considered me for the job and guess what im a virtual assistant who earns more than him relaxes more than him 40hour workweek kami and even has a betterinvested set up than him because i care about my job im in awe how he could casually judge a position so similar to what hes doing right now working all odds against him shockingly their salary decreased by 7k 200 on their usual offer on jobstreet in a span of 5 years ive been observing that company for a long time i couldnt negotiate my salary because they will invest more in the safety and work environment of the offices so the base is what we could offer why not give a workfromhome option rather than bothering with that to end the sour encounter i sent my letter of declining the offer and to my surprise he made it look like i didnt pass just to save face the desperation was present in the interview and he made me look like i didnt even qualify what a power trip big boy the pretentiousness reeks what a relief when you try to tap a seemingly good company on the outside but rotten on the inside  brain fart why is there an nsfw option in our subreddit when we dont like work lol anyway just a rant,oxm48r

3178,Health insurance in the US is designed to force you to work.,ive thought for awhile now about trying to drop down to parttime status in the future for my own mental health but something occurred to me back during the pandemic i was laid off due to my company downsizing im an electrician making 28hr because i was laid off i had the option for cobra to continue my health insurance coverage out of my own pocket i have the paper buried somewhere but i literally could not afford to continue paying for health insurance on my own on unemployment i think it was over 1000month which was huge because i have several chronic conditions and a mental disability which require medication so i ended up on medicaid which promptly refused to cover my adderall which as an aside it turns out you cant pay for a medication out of pocket if you are on medicaid  so essentially the only practical way to have health insurance is though your employer who isnt obligated to provide it if you are working less than 40 hrweek and thats not even touching the absurd cost of medical procedures  you can get pretty much any other type of insurance on your own and it will follow you regardless of employment status but in the us medical insurance is tied to your employer its a feature not a bug and im pretty sure its why the affordable care act was shot down so fast and so hard corporate america didnt want to lose any leverage over their workers being as productive as possible,owcmg6
3179,Punishment and annoying job statements,for me as someone who hasnt had a stable long term permanent job since 2018 it really angers me that businesses companies employers etc punish you for not having a job every day of the year every single year like if you explain to people that you job hunted for a job for over a year and didnt find anything they blame it on you or punish  you for not finding a job or not just taking a job to have a job or if you didnt want to work at a job during the period of time when covid19 started out because you didnt have healthcare at that point and the job wasnt offering healthcare and so if you got covid you were soland more so could potentially die from itbut no they punish you and blame you for that and lastly i want to have a job like i had in from 2013 to 2017 and again in 2018 i hunt daily for jobs like that and because i am of the mindset that i dont want to take for example an entry level customer service job just to have a job until i can find a job that is where i was in 2018 that somehow thats on me and i should be punished for that so i work crap retail jobs in the mean time living with a roommate or with friends until i can get back to where i was in 20132017 and in 2018    but it just annoys me to the highest levels that my job being outsourced in 2018 and me being unable to find a job between the end of 2018 and dec 2019 is my fault i hunted i searched i applied i interviewed i got nothing out of it and its my fault the blame is on me i should be punished because i didnt want to work in an environment where i could get covid19 one and two get covid19 without healthcare and now that i have been vaccinated and im trying to get back out there i should be punished for not doing the above things like the retail job i work at could care less about me getting covid could care less about employees and customers wearing mask indoors or social distancing or even the smallest levels of trying to reduce any chance of getting covidthis was when covid19 first hit and even up until now but all of that is my fault    and in truth all of this makes me hate work hate how businesses hire and hate how the people in charge of hiring people handle all of the processes involved in hiring someone i hate all of itand i hate the people in charge of it    i know this is more of a rant but it also felt antiwork im just tired of playing these games you have to play to get hired these days not really looking for any advice just wanted to vent out my frustrations,owo4ky

3189,How I quit the worst job I've ever had,i recently quit i a job 2 months before then quickly got a job at this local sushi place that ive been to many times before and the owner seemed nice this was when covid first started so i was working at this restaurant when i came in i was expected to know everything right off the bat which was weird because sandy didnt even show up until 2 hours into my shift and im very confused to how things work at the end of the day i was told how slow i was and i needed to learn the entire menu tomorrow be fast packer answer phone and take customer order with a smile luckily i know how to fake it until i make it a month in is when i actually learned all the sushi roll and i really didnt see anything bad until someone got firedquit it was a lesbien couple who quit because they were tired of sandys shit i know they quit but sandy said she fired them because her husband doesnt like lesbiens which im pretty sure is a lie because sandy told me when this other girl quit and she brought her parents with her to get check sandy said she was here to shoot her i later found on sandy told her to bring her parents here she fired people for different reasons one girl was too fat for her she fired someone for being black she caused one person to get so mentally depressed he stayed in the park physically unable to move when i was firedquit i was doing my job as usual and sandy came and immediately started hamming on us to clean everything again and smile for customer she tried rushing us by helping with sushi  but not one of the hibachi was ready so we couldnt pack the order when she started helping we had lots of order packed wrong a was given to the wrong person and she was double checking our orders when it was her orders that were wrong i got pissed and started cleaning the lobby but i guess i took too long in the lobby because when i came back into the kitchen she was going off about how could we leave her alone for half an hour and we are disrespectful to her cultureshe said one of us is supposed to stay here and one go clean the lobby but we want to get the job done faster she was here and we told her we were going to clean the lobby earlier that day i went to clean a table and she questioned where i was i said how come we have to do that when shes here and their wasnt many orders anyway sandy didnt like that and was like are you fucking kidding me i am owner and i do want i want and me being angry last you said that you chased away a customer she started going in on me hard i got fed up and said i got to go and she said if i go i quit and to not come back and the girl was working with said if i leave shes leaving too to this day havent  ive gotten paid if there more i will update you,owjpre

Working can change that.,im 23 and live with my mother who receives a pretty generous support from the government due to having a close relationship with my father not married for over 20 years when he passed away and so money isnt really an issue in fact we just received a bonification precatory ammount from a lawsuit we won so now we have another 40k sitting in the savings  i can literally just stay home and watch tv or play games all day or do whatever i please and wouldnt need to work to have nice things or live a middle class life i can go to the supermarket and get pretty much anything i want and just pay on the credit card no need to split in multiple payments either depending on what im getting of course  i dont know if im living the rantiwork nice life but what i do know is i want to get out of this situation as soon as i possibly can i find it embarrassing to be living under my mothers wing at 23 and not being able to decide what bigger purchases i want to do myself because it all has to go through her which she might or might not allow basically im a 23 year old child mom can i get pizza today sure son what about today no son not today this is stupid independence to me is being able to choose whether i want to eat pizza everyday or just sometimes but the important thing is the option is always there thats my goal can i do x yes do i want to do x depends on how i feel like but whenever x has to go through my financial advisor called mom because she is the one that pays is beyond ridiculous to me  and that is where my depression comes from i dont need to work i dont need to pay for my things i dont need to get up early and go to a job to make money but i cant eat pizza everyday if i want to what good is it what if i want to get a new gaming pc it might happen or it might not happen my mother decides screw that i love my mother more than anything but the last thing i need is for her to have a say in what i buy or not  how would i get out of this situation easy i must make my own money how by doing the only thing this sub despises and is probably going to ban me for even bringing it up exactly working i mean i could place 5k in bets and risk losing it to make 5k more will i do that fuck no i could find a way to clone credit cards and use other peoples money to my ends will i do that fuck no you get the idea for me the best risk free way to win my own independence is to work period  heres the part youre all going to laugh at i want to work yes i want to wake up at 7 am get through traffic sit in a cubicle for 8 hours have a questionably unhealthy meal for lunch go back home and do it all again tomorrow why firstly because i want to earn my own damn money second because thats how i see myself in the next 510 years wake up cubicle lunch cubicle sleep repeat the profession i intend to work on is more or less like this  this boring life sounds much more exciting and challenging and rewarding than my current one oh but you dont know what youre in for i disagree since i worked for 3 months in a photo editing gig and it was pretty much like that wasnt the best job in the world by a mile but it gave me something to do with my time and some money to spend any way i wished to at the end of the month now if i could work in a field that i find interesting and that the final product would be something to make me proud to work in youre damn right i would prefer the boring life to my current easy one,ow9ibl

3285,"How does a society of ""antiwork"" people function exactly? If no one is contributing to society, how does it run?",title summarizes my question quite well the only reason society functions as we know it is because people work and contribute towards it in an extremely diverse amount of ways whether youre picking fruit on a farm in construction or an accountant there is work that needs to be done for the world to operate and its not necessarily fun  before people get the wrong idea im not supporting the current system obviously massive wealth discrepancies are a problem  this post has nothing to do with capitalism or the current system however all societies need people to contribute to it in the form of work even in a huntergatherer society people need to forage hunt create tools and structures etc  so in an antiwork society how exactly does anything get done and if only some people work and others dont choose to work why should those who choose not to work be entitled to the benefits of those who are contributing going back to huntergatherer thatd be like your community going out and foraginghunting while you lay down and sleep and then you eat the food they worked to acquire and you do this consistently does that sound like something you want to aspire towards,ovo9tb

3288,Starting new job,i do mostly contract work as a freelancer but i have tried real jobs a few times and it never works out well im a great worker but not a great employee apparently   real job 1 i got fired after 4 months because i question authority     real job 2 was in a call center and i ended up quitting after me and my work bestie who sat in the cubicle behind me talked about getting out of there everyday we really hyped each other up lol  she did it first and then i did it a couple weeks after job wasnt even that bad but sitting in a cubicle everyday really messed me up   real job 3 was great except i had to drive a lot in my own car and they didnt reimbursement mileage or anything i went back and forth with my manager on how its not fair because if an inoffice worker makes the same as me then i actually take home less since i have to pay for all my own gas and car maintenance after i quit i found out that they maxed out my annual salary on hire and i was never gonna get a raise or mileage because i couldnt make more than my manager so basically my manager badly negotiated his own pay and that affected my ability to get paid more i quit because i couldnt get over the no mileage reimbursement thing after driving like 700 miles in a week   real job 4 starts next week ill be working from home so no worries about mileage but i am worried about a regular 85 work week i signed a one year contract this time so i cant just quit i gotta make it through the whole year its possible ill get called in mid year but with the delta variant maybe not   not excited about working in this type of arrangement however as we all know thats the scam if you want health insurance and benefits contract work is its own thing i do prefer working as i please however i dont always have health insurance and no sick days gotta know how to save in order to pay all those taxes at the end of the year yada yada proscons   all in all im fortunate to not have to worry about getting work but man yall know how it is,ovlk8d

3291,I have to go back to work tomorrow after having a week off and I'm dreading it so much that I want to cry and puke at the same time.,my job isnt even that bad its pretty much a standard office job for some awful reason i decided to do a masters degree on top of working fulltime to get qualified for the job i already do as i need it in case i ever need to get my same job somewhere else so that i wont starve if my boss decides to retire although im getting everything done fairly well im really not coping with it just goes to show that no matter how successful or normal you look from the outside this whole slaving for 40 hours a week thing is total bullshit and extremely unhealthy  i used to be a fairly unanxious person but work has absolutely ruined my mental state,ovo6cd
