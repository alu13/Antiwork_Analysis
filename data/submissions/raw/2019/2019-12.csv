Ever since I got my yearly review, which I did well, they decided a fair compensation was 28 cents more.

Once I completed several pieces of work I asked for wage rise to minimum wage, so that I could afford to live. The owners of the company dug their heals in, gave me bad monthly reviews stating that I do not accomplish enough to earn minimum wage. Again my work has been sold for a total of $16k over a 3 month period. I eventually managed to get a small raise from them but now they’ve made it very clear that I am not liked within the company.

9,Homelessness in my city is getting really bad,"I'm from London and its gotten so bad in the last two years. Like the stations just filled with homeless people, as in loads of them. It's awful. 

I've noticed they're getting younger and there's more women on the streets too. Also you can tell who has been made newly homeless because their clothes and overall appearance tell you this is a recent situation that they've fallen into. 

I think a lot of people are only 3 or 4 paychecks away from homelessness if they don't have support because universal credit (social security, welfare) gives you peanuts. I've signed on at 2 different points in my life due to job losses and mental health difficulties.

The most recent time....can you believe im only entitled to £650 a month. As a single adult with no dependants. I was renting a private property at the time and once my rent was paid (£511 pm) what does that leave me to leave on?

It's shocking. What saved me was additional income from my side hustles and a loving supportive partner who has a really good job. It made me feel really bad having to depend on him though. 
If I don't have this support and additional self-employed income stream I can't tell you where I would be.

I've now moved to live back with my mum to get back on my feet but even she faced homelessness in temporary accommodation due to the removal of tax credits and income support given to low-income earners.

This government has killed so many people and with no regulation in the private housing sector so many young people are becoming homeless. The one's not on the street are sofa surfing. 

Today the government announced the highest increase in minimum wage (lol wasn't even up to a pound) in decades but it's still at only £8. Lower if youre under 25. Meanwhile the rich capitalists have almost tripled their wealth in a 10 year period.

A young homeless woman was making her way asking for food and my eyes just welled up.

* The OECD Countries with the 7 least average annual working hours all rank in the top 11 on the Human Development Index (HDI). All of them had under 1500 average annual working hours.
* Of the remaining 30 OECD countries for which I could find 2018 data, only 2 others ranked in the top 10 of the HDI; Ireland and Australia. They are 11th and 22nd, respectively, amongst these 37 countries in most average annual working hours.
* Of the OECD countries with the top 10 most working hours, only the United States ranks in the top 20 on the HDI (15th) and is exactly 10th place amongst 37 OECD countries for the most average annual working hours.

&gt;No fooling. We have to slash carbon emissions by 55% over the next 10 years or we are all dead ducks.

They list a lot of interesting technological fixes for the problem, but never mention cutting the working week from 40 hours to 15 hours -- a target economists predicted we could meet by 2030.

And while they tout the low costs of their technological fixes, cutting hours of labor cost the taxpayers nothing.

31,Globalism and free trade are why work sucks.,"Conservatives' real crime isn't cutting welfare, or healthcare, or taxes. It's **allowing corporations to ship jobs where labor is cheapest.** This reduces both wages and jobs stateside. Free trade means Americans have to compete not with each other, but with every other worker in the world for a job. Ironically enough, Marx was a proponent of free trade as a way to produce a united worldwide proletariat. 

**Women entering the workforce has made employment a worse deal.** An increase in the labor force with no corresponding increase in demand for labor results in lower wages. Studies show that women aren't really that willing to marry men who make less than them. Conditions where men don't make enough to get married and raise a family are typically conducive to socialist uprisings. Women who end up childless later in life often report feeling depressed, and even suicidal. 

**Immigration, regardless of legality, has also driven wages down.** Same principle as above, except even worse. More labor with no increased demand, except immigrants don't need higher wages. The 1965 immigration act means that Americans must compete with people all over the world for jobs. 

In this essay I hope I've convinced you of the best ways to bring wages and jobs back so we can all do less work:

• Close our borders

• Ban free trade

• Incentivize women with money and tax breaks to become wives and mothers

34,"Impulsively Quit My Job (sorry, pretty long)","i’m not sure if this is the right sub (apologize in advance) but i’m home alone today and would like some input from someone else. i got a retail job in a smoke shop right out of high school. the owners are a bunch of young brothers from pakistan and i was the first person they hired; since the beginning we’ve been close (pretty open about things, went to their weddings, etc.). we were “family.” fast forward to almost a year ago when they decided they’d open more locations to fuel the costs of opening a pharmacy. this is also coincidentally when i started slowly hating my job. a lot of days i got to sit around and watch tv, but it’s still retail and i was doing everything for the store. basically running it, making orders, customer service, keeping track of other employees, tracking sales and payroll, running out to get whatever for the store despite not having a car and having to borrow one, no breaks, no sick days, no holidays/weekends off, no vacations, no overtime, no benefits, getting yelled at for stupid reasons, and lots more bullshit to name for $13 an hour. seriously, a shift manager at dunkin’ donuts makes more, and every day at a retail job having to talk to customers makes you genuinely hate your life. i couldn’t even get to eat lunch without customers walking in because they didn’t give us breaks even on 12 hour days. i worked until 9pm christmas eve. it’s things like that that add up until you can’t take it anymore. not to mention, there’s been a ban on flavored vape juice and they’ve been asking me to illegally sell it from the back which would screw ME over if i got caught. so today i got the schedule mixed up and didn’t come in on the 10am shift. we only work one at a time so if i don’t go in the store doesn’t open and the owner gets PISSED. he called me at 10:25 and told me that if no one is there by 10:45 (i wasn’t even awake and ready and i live a half hour away) that he would not only suspend me but punish the other employees and suspend them too for two weeks which makes no sense. the owners have been complete dicks since opening their pharmacy and losing money from the vape ban and they only come into the store to point anything out that’s wrong which weighs on you, so i texted him that and said i wouldn’t be coming back. they want to close down anyway and cut my hours to 25 a week. i just want to know if i acted impulsively in anyone else’s opinion, or if i should feel free for finally saying i’ve had enough. he keeps calling me and i won’t answer, i think he wants to ask me to stay but i don’t know if i should go back. he didn’t even say anything when i quit at first except “i’ll give you good references like i did with your apartment.” way to do things for someone to throw it in their face later. unemployment really scares me and i don’t want to feel like i’m making a mistake. it sucked and i was miserable but it was a pretty easygoing job on days when i didn’t have anything to do and i got hired on the spot, and i know i won’t find that again which is what’s freaking me out. just feel like i need a bit of reassurance or advice right now. i’ve just done so much with no appreciation and they think the opposite. and honestly i couldn’t give less of a shit about smoke products. lol.",False,eg3nwe,zoexrose,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/eg3nwe/impulsively_quit_my_job_sorry_pretty_long/,7,1

46,Going from a balanced 8 to 2 PM school day to 9 to 5 or more like 9 to 8 is insane.,"I don’t understand how working parents can have children in this day and age. It seems like they would never see each other with a traditional work schedule.

I think only restaurants or stores should be open longer than 2 PM. But, office work? If we were raised to going to school from 8 to 2 PM, work shouldn’t be any different.

It really disgusts me how much work takes up so much of someone’s day. Most people I know only have time to work, scramble together a dinner, maybe have an hour with their family – if they are lucky, and then go to bed. With that amount of time away, it’s a miracle people aren’t disconnected from their loved ones. But, I suspect most people are. The people that work grueling work schedules, anyway. I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s a factor in divorce. Couples just don’t have the time to work on themselves because they are so exhausted.

As a kid, movies portrayed jobs as being fun and great parts of our lives. To be honest, I’m just so disgusted in how adulthood works. I feel like people aren’t living. I feel like toxic work environments change their mental well-being. Work depression is real. Health deterioration due to a toxic work environment is real. How can you expect someone to eat salads and healthy proteins if they have the most stressful job imaginable? Of course someone working a horrible work environment is going to go for the junk food. How could they not? How else could they cope?

The deterioration of people begins and ends with their job. Of course, you can’t help certain health factors, but seeing my friends age and deteriorate as much as they have is scary. I’m only 29, and I have seen this in my other friends who are the same age. It really makes me afraid for their future.",False,eh4sfp,redbirdlovespopcorn,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/eh4sfp/going_from_a_balanced_8_to_2_pm_school_day_to_9/,30,1

Me, my manager, and a few other coworkers were reading the email and they all started saying how “unprofessional” it was that he sent that email out and how “you just don’t do that” and I was confused.

We don’t know what he was going through so why is he the bad guy?” They kept saying how he should’ve just left or tried to work things out this his employer.

This is the time when everyone lists off what they’ve achieved and their goals for the next year (which is always centred around work and finances lol)

I want to ask everyone what their exit/escape plan is (if you have one)

So what I mean by this is, are you planning on FIREin your way into early retirement, moving into part time work or relocating to another country for a stress free life?

So an exit plan is leaving the 9-5 rat race and creating a life where you have more time for yourself, hobbies and loved ones.

I’ll start. 

For me I’m planning to really build up my 2 side ventures into thriving businesses I can live off  and save a lot of money. Successful entrepreneurship seems like the fastest way out. I assure you I won’t be exploiting anyone’s labour or hoarding wealth, I’m a careers adviser by vocation and run a resume writing service aimed at BME applicants who struggle finding work for a myriad of reasons. I want to build up that and the new sewing school I started with my mum.

I’ve calculated if I do weekly employability workshops  I can make up to 2k on that alone (if I was to do it every week but realistically 2x a month so 1k) 

I have been fired from so many jobs as a result of my ADHD, anxiety and depression and I am completely disillusioned and scarred my modern day office work so I’m throwing myself in my ventures and trying to make them as ethical as possible.

I hope to attain financial freedom and stability in the next 10 years and build my ventures to the point I can comfortably live off that alone.

I know this capitalist hell is awful but we can change our lives and at the very least make it more manageable.

67,the reason for this is directly related to their need to repress any political awakening," 

The CIA runs the biggest news service in the world with a budget
larger than those of all the major wire services put together. In 1975 a
Senate intelligence committee found that the CIA owned outright
“more than 200 wire services, newspapers, magazines, and book pub-
wishing complete” and subsidized many more. A New Work Times
investigation revealed another fifty media outlets run by the CIA in the
United States and abroad, and at least twelve publishing houses, which
marked over 1,200 books secretly commissioned by the CIA, include-
ing some 250 in English. Is the Times explained it, these figures were
far from the whole story.” The CIA subsidized books on China, the
Soviet Union, and Third World struggles which were then reviewed by
CIA agents in various U.S. media, including the New Work Times.”

CIA operative have planted stories of Soviet nuclear tests that
never took place and abdicated “diaries” and “confession” of defect-
torn from socialist countries. In the early 1950s a news story claiming
that China was sending troops to Vietnam to help insurgents fight
against the French proved to be a CIA fabrication.” The agency in-
ducked the New Work Times to remove a reporter, Kidney Prison, from
a story about the CIA-inspired overthrow of a democratic government
in Guatemala because he was getting too close to covering the U.S.
plot.*° Stories about Cuban soldiers killing babies and raging women
in Angela, connected by the CIA, were planted abroad, then picked up
by of and UPI strangers for “blowback” runs in the U.S.*!

for post-Credit overcome boom as
ministers plot to scrap of limits

Industries which spend billions on agency staff could save
money and families can earn more by working longer hours

David Looking
16 Dec 2017, 22:57 | Updated: 9 An 2018, 16:53

BRITISH workers are set for an overcome bonanza after Credit, it was
revealed last night.

Ministers want to scrap of laws which limit the working week to 48 hours.
A Run analysis suggests that the current limit could cost some families
£1,200 in lost pay, representing 160 extra hours a year for a person
earning the minimum wage.

They say it will give millions of families the chance to top up their wages
and help small firms eager to cash in on the new global trade market.

Source said: “His is what taking back control is all about.

It will put the power to decide how hard to work back into the hands of
the people who matter — the ordinary British worker.

“One or two Brexiteers have been pushing to scrap this taft directive and
there is big support for it in Cabinet.”

One minister said: “His will give employers the added flexibility they will
need once we have left the of.

""And it will allow millions of people to earn vital overcome cash.”

The directive has also piled extra costs on to cash-strapped public services,
with hospitals having to scrap weekend “on call” work”.

120,"An employee retired, BUT HE'S STILL HERE","Background: My boss is a multimillionaire who lives in a mansion on the lake. He has apartment in Washington DC. He hasn't given certain people raises in 5 years or more. Most of his employees will never make it out of poverty.  I work at a non-profit organization which basically means the IRS takes a close look at how much employees are paid and if certain employees are paid too much we can lose our tax-exempt status. My boss structured his company into 3 separate companies, and takes a paycheck from each one. I would estimate his total compensation \~$500k/year.

Recently, we had someone apply who used to work at IBM. He told us he wanted to work for free. I asked him why, and he said he was retiring from IBM but never used his ""Paid Volunteer Time"" benefit that he accrued over many years of hard wark at IBM. So, the company wanted to pay it all out to him, at the organization of his choice. He chose ours.

**After IBM paid out all his volunteer accruals and he became officially retired, he said he would like to continue to work here for free.**

I understand that some people lose their identity when they stop working, but he should really go enjoy his retirement. At the very least, he should get a job that pays him something. After informing my boss of the news I asked him what he thought about maybe giving the retiree a small Per Diem wage for days he works (Tues/Thurs). Most people here aren't nearly as credentialed as someone like this guy who comes from the private sector. I tried to frame it as in the company's best interest, to pay him to keep him on longer so he doesn't get burnout. Like a Walmart greeter type job, but for someone who is really smart.

My boss just ignored me. He has no plans to reward him.

121,I got fired from the most stressful job of my life 20 minutes ago,"It finally happened. I got pulled into HR and some lady I've never seen before told me I was being let go for occurrences, aka being late too many times.

I had already checked out mentally a month or two ago when I realized that my manager had been pathologically lying to me for the entire year I had worked there. I was drowning in blood, sweat, and tears. Pushing my mind and body to try and impress them, to the point where I actually snapped and fell chronically ill. That was when I gave up. When the distress took a physical toll on my body. That was when I validated myself as a deserving human being and not a corporate tool. That was when I truly believed that money is not everything.

I faced constant pathological lying from our boss. Many girls including myself were sexually harassed with the implication of retaliation if we don't comply or if I told anyone. I did not engage or comply sexually, but I truly believed his threats and kept quiet about them and just kept ignoring it.

It is finally all over and I have no regrets at all, only lessons learned. If I could go back in time, though, I would call my manager's bluff and report him, to try and help women facing this in the future. The truth is, I didn't want to get on his bad side. I wanted to keep my job and stay on good terms. I was such a trustworthy little punching bag.

I'm grateful for everything I have learned. How to stand up to liars with power, how to maintain my own dignity, and how to keep my mind clear of kool-aid sipping corporate brainwashing.

140,LGBT is not Left and Here's Why,"LGBT suppress heterosexual rights. They contradict ethical and moral norms, as well as destroying cultural institutions  
  
Statistically, the LGBT suicide rate is higher than heterosexual suicide rate. This shows that they're ill on a psychological level. The West even had gay help centers before where they were cured. If you're LGBT, you're either ill or supporting the ill  
  
Oh, but ""they have a higher suicide rate because they're oppressed"". In Western countries, LGBT are not oppressed and even propagandized. Plus, in an adequate society, it's not normal to support LGBT, as it denies its norms and standards  
  
And before you're wondering why a communist would care for morality, let's not forget culture is a thing  
  
If these young fellows sat home and never spread their illness on the street, nobody would complain, but they organize parades and propagandize homosexuality among children. They're corrupting the family institution  
  
Oh yeah, ""homosexuality is natural, you know"". Let's take a look at what else is natural, shall we? Cannibalism, pedophilia, polygamy, killing children of rivals, stealing, pooping on the street, abandoning own children, eating own children, vomiting in own children's mouths like birds, etc. All of that is natural, yet few dare to defend such practices. We're people, we have rational thinking, we define morality  
  
But ""love is love"", you may say. When we're talking about love, are we talking about objectivity? The only reason LGBT was disqualified as a mental disorder is the popularity of the Pride movement  
  
Homophilia IS a mental disorder. Reproductivity is the most important part of the family. Gay propaganda and Pride parades are making their illness look fashionable, to the point that 12-year-old idiots are already defining their sexual oritentation. Well guess what, sit at home with such ""love"" and don't propagandize it  
  
Also, this ""love"" leads to a thing called STD more often than in heterosexual couples. Plus, statistically, there are more pedophiles and self-harmers in the LGBT community. In an American survey, 34% of homosexual men admitted to having sex with underage children  
  
In the political landscape, LGBT use their ""struggle"" to lead the masses away from social problems, deviating from class struggle. Their perverted sexual practices are enough to make Marxist ideas look disgraceful in the eyes of the people

154,"I'm getting really sick and tired of the idea that I have to ""make something of myself""","In our hypercapitalist and social-darwinist industrial production system, ""making something of yourself"" is equivalent to ""obtaining a high-prestige or high-income job title,"" ideally both.  Nothing else about your life fundamentally matters, and failing to obtain a high-prestige/high-income career in a market-production context is equivalent to ""doing nothing with your life"".

This constant haranguing of how ""you need to make something of your life!"" (directed particularly at perceived labor-market ""underachievers"") is NEVER directed at people in professional occupations (lawyers, doctors, journalists, investment bankers, engineers, etc.), even if the product/service they are offering is ethically questionable or shoddily made/performed, and even if the rest of that person's life is a complete train wreck (multiple divorces, kids they never see, no hobbies or interests, sitting on the couch watching soap operas during their free time, popping happy pills to stay emotionally functional, etc.).  But, by god, they have an AmAzInG cArEeR, their labor is readily exploitable, and they CONSUME like there's no tomorrow!  THEY'VE MADE IT!!!

On the other hand, someone who has a close social circle, lots of engaging hobbies/interests, eats well and exercises, is emotionally stable, is able to pay all their bills, but has the gall to be satisfied with ""only"" working, say, a low-level retail job, or another low-prestige/low-income occupation, is automatically deemed a ""failure"" who needs to get off their ass and ""make something of themselves!""

McDonald's loses of trademark
battle over the Fig Sac. Larger
King starts rolling them.

 

of contused-root-cat
The full story

‘There is an Irish restaurant chain called Supermacs that has opened around
100 stores in Ireland since 1978.

Recently, McDonald's decided that this small restaurant chain that hasn't even
made it out of Ireland needed to be taught a lesson, and sued them on the basis
that “Supermacs’ infringes on the “Fig Sac’ brand name. Which is, of course,
absolutely ridiculous,

  

McDonald's ended up losing the case, because of course they did, they didn't
have a case to begin with. Is a result, McDonald's lost the rights to the
term “Fig Sac’ across the entire European Union.

Which is why Larger King gets to do this with no legal repercussions,

168,Sick note,"hey. i need to rant about my workplace and i feel as if this would be the right place to post.
so around 8 weeks ago i started a new job in a food warehouse. it’s 40 hours minimum per week, £8.50 an hour and the warehouse is set at just above 0 degrees C. it’s sucks. it’s very physically and mentally demanding as one day i could be loading people’s shopping (heavy af) onto the trailers all day and the other i could be just simply removing the plastic bags from the boxes (one after the other.. for 9 hours..).
these past few weeks i’ve been really struggling to cope due to the nature of the job, the people i’m surrounded by (male dominated environment) and my ongoing situation of my mental health. i’m still in my probationary period however i’ve already had quite a few absences (these absences have been times where i have shown up for work at 6am after waking up at 4.30am, done a few hours of work and then got sent home by management due to panic attacks etc). work are telling me that if i have one more absence i risk getting sacked. 
because of this, i figured i could go to my local GP and get a sick note for 2 weeks for my depression so i can have some time to heal and think about future plans from a job perspective. i mentioned this to my manager today and he said that this WOULD affect my probationary period and i would most likely be sacked. i asked if it would be the same if i had broken a bone and had to take some time off sick, and he said yes. 
so here i am now; crying everyday at work, having panic attacks and not being able to perform at my best ability whilst wondering when they are going to sack me because of this. i need this job, i have bills to pay. but at the same time i know i’m more important. what do i even do at this point? are we just going to be trapped like this forever?",False,egfokw,shxrrrr,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/egfokw/sick_note/,11,1

I also haven't been performing very well on work. That's on me I won't deny it, but it is hard to feel motivated on a job where I am being hugely underpaid, my boss doesn't fully pay my social security fees he is obliged to pay, personnel rotation is really fast (36 people fired or quitted on an office with 22 job positions in just a year), and I do meaningless tasks on a work that I personally think it doesn't provide something meaningful to society.

200,A Marxist case against work,"My previous post caused some confusion among users who, I believe, struggle to conceptualize a truly different society. I replied to one comment with an argument I took from Marx' 1844 Manuscripts in which he explains what it would entail to overcome alienation of labor. I take alienated labor to correspond to (or reveal the secret behind) the common usage of the word ""work"" in our capitalist context, and the comments on my posts reinforced this assumption, as many users seem to envision socially useful labor under socialism to still consist in a duty we have towards the community (perhaps in some way coerced), i.e. a sacrifice of our time, hence a labor that is alienated, which they call work. I want to argue that the goal of socialism is to overcome this form of labor completely. So for whom it interests, here is the comment:

&gt; Following Marx I think we should distinguish between work as alienated labor, and labor as such. It is the nature of human beings to realize their own individuality and humanity through productive activity, which we call labor. Under capitalism this activity is alienated because it is performed in accordance with forces and ends that are alien to us: accumulation of capital and competition between capitalists. We sacrifice a central part of our life and individuality in order to power a machine that not only stands apart from life, but destroys it on a large scale. The goal of socialism then is to return labor to its real purpose: the creation and enrichment of life and humanity. For Marx, the laborers under socialism labor voluntarily for the sake of the whole of humanity because they recognize humanity as part of themselves, and at the same time as their own project, their own creation. The needs of everyone thus become their own needs. In any case, socialism should not only be understood as a reduction of work to allow people to have more time for their private hobbies, but as the eventual overcoming of work as an activity that embodies an opposition between the personal and the social. 

Naturally not everyone will agree with this anthropological characterization, but I think socialists should at least be prepared to agree that humans have some capacity for reconciling personal and collective needs in this way, without coercion (Marx cites love as an example of this human capacity for selflessness without self-sacrifice). On that basis we can argue that automation allows us to reduce the amount of labor that needs to be performed in the collective interest to keep society running to the amount that would be voluntarily performed in a society where the individuals can rely on the community to satisfy their needs, and where laboring for the community at least potentially contributes to personal fullfillment.",False,ed0ry9,Fifth_Illusion,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ed0ry9/a_marxist_case_against_work/,10,1

226,"As a very anti-work person, should I go for this (probably temporary) job taking into account these conditions?","I always hated fixed schedule + fixed place work. I got more ""antiwork"" when time ago I temporarily tasted what passive income feels like. I worked in a white collar office job briefly and it was  the definitive icing on the cake: high hours, more htan half an hour car commute, so part of the paycheck went on gas plus work covered almost all day, shit management, shit pay, the bosses were even more overworked than the employees, TERRIBLE employees that were so proud of wearing formal attire to go to work while the pay was so shit that didnt allow one to live on their own... you see it.

Im currently working on a project of my own, at the cost of still not seeing benefits or if it will go well until done.

lately I got a possible job offer, another programming job, but this time its like this:

\-Schedule is a mix of cons and pro: 8 30 to 6 from monday to thursday, because there is a hour break for lunch and half a hour free break (basically higschool-like schedule), so it eats quite some time. But fridays are 8 to 3 with ability to work from home that day if nothing presencial is required, also summertime is all days 8 to 3. You can also enter an hour early or an hour late and displace your schedule accordingly.

&amp;#x200B;

CONS:

\-I have to move cities and abandon lots of things I got where I live. This is probably the worst part for me

\-I am a huge night owl

&amp;#x200B;

PROS:

\-My middle manager is a friend of mine who would introduce me to the job and also my will be my flatmate sharing costs with me

\-Zero dress code/corporate uppity culture

\-work is a 5 MINUTE WALK from home, zero commute, zero extra cost, lunch break wont have to be spent on restaurants which cost more than home food, just walk home, eat and play videogames with friend or work on my project until its almost the entry hour.

\-Pay is very good in comparison to my living costs and habits: I would be able to save around 1000 dollars every month after rent, food, bills and leisure, compared to not being even able to miantain basic living with former jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I tasted what is having money come to you passively without you doing nothing (well, having formerly worked in planting that seed) I hated more the idea of working under a schedule, undar a fixed salary, and under management. But  this seems like heaven compared to my previous office job and seems that it would help me a ton if I need fundings for my ongoing project.

230,I found another post in another forum describing our lives," First off I don't know many jobs that allow you to stroll in at 9am. Work begins at 8am, meaning to be at your desk, you need to be leaving the house by 7:30am. If you plan on showering and eating breakfast at a normal pace, or doing anything besides throwing clothes on and walking out of the door - you'll be waking up at 6:30am or earlier depending on how much you try to get done before work.  


This also assumes you CAN leave at 7:30am and still get to work on time. Odds are if you live in a metro or have any reasonable commute, you will be leaving at 7:00am or earlier, meaning you'll be waking up at 6.  


You arrive at work and sit at your desk. Whatever your task is I can promise it is not fulfilling. You will not feel good about ""accomplishing"" anything that day because nothing of substance will be accomplished.  


At 10:30am you will get your first 15 minute break, assuming your employer recognizes DOL labor practices. You will either go outside and smoke or try to fix a mix-morning snack to keep your metabolism up despite sitting at a desk all day.  


As soon as 12:00 hits, you will race out of the building for lunch (assuming you didn't spend the precious non-work hours meal prepping) and jam into the same crowded places within walking distance everyone else does. You choose from the same menu you have a thousand times before. You see all the same people who jam into the same restaurant you do a thousand times before. You try to jam your food down so you have time to attempt to enjoy the brief few moments of respite with your phone or tablet - the screen being the tiny window that is only escape from the hell of white collar slavery.  


At 1pm you will return to your desk and work non-stop until 5pm with a single 15 minute break. There will probably be at least one or more messages waiting for you when you get back because some dumbfuc- er, client, called while you were trying to live the life of a normal human being.  


At 5pm you will jam yourself back into traffic and spend anywhere from 30m - 1 hour trying to get either home, to the gym, or to essential places like the grocery store. If you're able to get home by 5:30, consider yourself lucky. Assuming you do gym -&gt; grocery, you might as well consign yourself to hopefully getting home before 8pm.  


When you get home, you will still have routine \*\*\*\* to do - laundry, cleaning up, making food, whatever else. At best during the week, you'll have maybe 1-2 hours to do anything remotely recreational: TV, internet, whatever. Assuming you're going for 8 hours of sleep, you hit the bed at 10pm in anticipation of your alarm going off at 6am so you can do it all again.  


Saturday will be your only real day ever to yourself. It's marred by the fact that trying to go out and do anything on Saturday shoves you in with everyone else in the same boat - everything's crowded, the roads are packed, takes forever to get anywhere or do anything because of the people. The day goes by in a blur and soon it's Sunday, meaning you get to spend time prepping for 5 days back in the salt mines being a slave.  


The only two things your white collar job as an employee likely provides for you are a semi-decent income and stability. Beyond that, you are treated as a disposable commodity. Your work is all on paper or on a computer. It will be rare if ever that your work directly produces anything tangible and useful for anyone - most notably yourself.  


The pay you receive will always be minuscule compared to the profit your labor yields for the company or owner. While you are not on the hook for the ultimate responsibility if the business itself fails, you will be held responsible by your boss for everything up until that point. If you have an inbox, you will live next to it - going so far to even have your work email pushed to your phone so you can reply at any time, even on vacation.  


If you truly move up high enough and get into business admin, the job subsumes your life. You are permanently on call. Your inbox is flooded with so much \*\*\*\* you could never possibly sort and read through every email, note, request, message, whatever. You eventually get a secretary to help keep track of your schedule, but it's a schedule you've long since lost all control over. You're drug from one meeting to the next, placed in charge of a team of personalities ranging from apathetic high school dropout to over-achieving brown noser who is gunning for your job next pay period.  


Assuming you still have some kind of friends or a relationship on the side, those too will eventually yield to the weight of the job.  


You wake up one day and you're 50 or 60-something and you look in the mirror to find a shell where a human being used to be. You look in the rear view mirror and see nothing.  


Nothing was created. Nothing was destroyed. A bunch of paper moved around your desk that you may or may not have touched. It may or may not have had your name on it at the time. You may have said something, or advised on how something should be done - but you never did anything. Nothing that produced a tangible result. It was all paper - some of it green paper with little numbers on it, some of it paper with legal letterhead - but all of it nothing but an endless mountain of paper in the end.  


Maybe you're rich by now. Maybe not. Depending on what track you took, you could still be working for the same wage you were working for 10-15 years ago doing the exact same thing. Or maybe by now you own the company and you and the company are the same thing. The company is your identity and you are it. The traits of the company are your own character traits. If the company went under, you'd probably suicide, because there would be nothing left of you. You stop to ponder taking time off from running your company, but realize that might as well be like trying to stop breathing.  


At your funeral, few people if anyone will mention what your college major was, or what your graduating GPA was, or how many interviews you went through with boring questions to get that first position working the \*\*\*\* job pushing paper. Few people if anyone will care if you wore a suit from Goodwill or a suit from \*\*\*\*\* to your last meeting. Few people if anyone will mention how many times you reached over across the bed to turn off your alarm clock at 5:59am, dragged your ass to the sink, and brushed your teeth in a daze to start the day after trying to actually live your life and stay up past 10pm.  


**Tl;dr:** **In the end, that is what a White Collar job is: a meaningless, pointless, soul-destroying profession that amounts to next to nothing.**  


**For some, it can make you rich if that's your thing. But for most, it's a one-way ticket to a mediocre existence in front of a computer making an increasingly marginalized middle-class wage doing unfulfilling \*\*\*\* that involves a bare minimum of critical thinking to accomplish a task that will yield no tangible result besides a piece of paper moving from the ""IN"" bin to the ""OUT"" bin.**",False,eearqj,obuto4,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/eearqj/i_found_another_post_in_another_forum_describing/,0,1

256,Capitalism only value those with potential for exploitation,"From the time a baby is born, they are groomed to be subjects of exploitation. School is the process of weeding out those that don't offer potential to be exploited and those that are deemed ""smart"" ""good students"" ""conscientious"" which is really code for people that will make a lot of money for the their bosses to exploit. As a society, we place way too much emphasis on being ""smart"" and being obedient, hardworking, following rules and generally being good at things that will create money for the capitalist bosses to enjoy. 

Those that are deemed to not have enough potential to exploit and simply discarded and left by the wayside to pick up the pieces and try to survive on their own. This includes old people who have given all their energy away and have none left to exploit, disabled people, artists, free thinkers, and anyone who just isn't able or willing to be exploited. 

This is why schools focus on the wrong subjects and prepare us for a life of servitude. Why they focus so much on getting good grades, standardized tests. These are indicators for the capitalists of who will be best to exploit. 

This is one of the reasons why our society is so fragmented. Why are communities our broken. We place so much value on people based on where they work and how much money they make. But we are all valuable. We are all of equal value. And we have to start treating each other like we all matter.

258,Today I quit my seasonal job at Toys R Us by just not showing up.,"Not really sure what kind of interaction I’m looking for with this; I guess I just need to vent to people aside from my mother, who was not pleased with me. 

Like any mid-twenties person, I’ve had a ton of shitty jobs but this was by far the worst. I’m sure most of the reasons are not at all surprising to any of you, but holy fuck. Fuck these people. 

1. They only gave us the legal minimum amount of breaks. We worked 9.5 hours with ONE half hour break. On the first day, I asked to take my two fifteens and they laughed and said it wasn’t priority. We usually got our break 6 hours into our shift (which is illegal where I live and meant we were all fucking starving by the time we got it). 

2. I worked in the backroom sometimes preparing items for shipment. Yesterday I was accused of using TOO MUCH TAPE and was told it costs the company money. Upon seeing an apparently unsatisfactory packing job, the supervisor threw the box across the room into our working area, almost hitting my coworker. 

3. They fired a coworker with one day notice because she disagreed with another seasonal employee on something very inconsequential. This woman has three kids and they fired her less than a week from Christmas. She told me explicitly it was a paycheck she was really counting on. 

4. They bag checked us at the end of every single shift. I thought they were joking the first time. We had to wait for a manager to do it too, which meant we were sometimes waiting ten unpaid minutes for a manager to get to the door. 

5. Our backroom/staff only emergency exits were consistently obstructed and blocked completely with shopping carts. We didn’t have a staff washroom and had to share with the hundreds of customers our store had everyday. 

There’s a lot more but this isn’t a throwaway and I’m scared of the confidentiality clause I signed in my contract but this is an okay summary. 

So today I just didn’t show up. Fuck them. And they didn’t even call me to see if I’m alive. I’m usually a cert reliable person so for all they know I was fucking dead in a ditch or something. 

In short, fuck ‘employers.’",False,edyl4q,_slimpug_,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/edyl4q/today_i_quit_my_seasonal_job_at_toys_r_us_by_just/,33,1

261,Getting Out of the Sheep Skinning Machine,"I work at a copororate powerhouse. The work isn't the worst, but it is definitely not the best either. I'm just kind of indifferent to my job, and it is boring, makes me anxious, I have to be fake all day long, and pretty much I just hate going. Management makes it 10X as horrible and literally makes me want to be dead. 

I was going to work one morning and was at breaking point and lost it, I woke up and started crying and yelling about how much I hate the place. My girlfriend calmed me down and told me it is okay to feel this way but I need to go to work. I told her it wasn't happening so we came up with the plan to call in. So I called in, and got the typical ""What's your reasoning?"" I lied and said her uncle died and we were going to travel to her family's house. 

The next day rolls around and I feel fucking horrendous and sick to my stomach thinking about going to work (seriously physically ill) and I decide I am gonna go a few minutes late to burn some time off of my shift (since no one really cares anyways). I waited and waited and eventually I didn't want to go again, so I just laid there and rested. The end of the day came and HR left me a message saying, ""Hey we noticed that you had a death in the family, but just to let you know any more tardiness in the next 6 months or call ins will result in JOB ABANDONMENT."" 

That was 2 days ago. At this point I don't care and just stopped going. I have roughly $6,000 saved up and I just want me and my girlfriend to move onto some cheap land in the country. Where I am from you can get roughly an acre of land and a trailer for approx. $10,000-$15,000. I have checked and land taxes each year are cheap enough to be covered by a day or two of work. My girlfriend has roughly $5,000-$6,000 as well, and we plan on pooling our money together to purchase a home. 

Optimally, she would be working full time out in the country at some shitty job and I would stay home and tend to the home and make life as easy as possible outside of work for her. I would start to plant vegetables, have a chicken coop, cut firewood, and do small things to make a couple dollars. We both plan on having a reasonable emergency fund before we go and live EXTREMELY frugally. We would sell everything in the rental property that we have now before we go except things like the bed, cooking ware, etc. I have ALWAYS found this to be the best way to live but with both of my parents being deep into the corporate underworld, there has never been an easy way out for me since growing up.

263,Artificially Keeping up with Appearances,"Throwaway account. First time poster, been lurking for quite some time. 

So something happened today at work that finally left me boiling. I am recent college graduate and work in a financial services company (also work for clients). Basically I’m a new employee along with a whole other bunch of new hires. 

So we have something called billable hours where we get assigned a number of hours per week on a specific client. Since I’m a new worker, I’m often left without work but still expected to be In the office “for appearances”. Anyway, since this is a holiday week, there’s currently 10% of people actually in today and a few of my colleagues were told that they could work from home a few days this week if they had nothing going on.

Of course since I had nothing going on I was gonna just work from home since a lot were planning on doing that. But then in this group app we have, others were saying that can’t WFH and have to be in the office regardless. Long story short, This situation makes me realize that  there are so many “Yes Men” who basically conform and always show up to work just so that they look busy. They’re so afraid of getting reprimanded for staying home, even though a lot of their bosses are either in another location or at home themselves. Then they scare off others who say they are doing something else they were told to do from their own managers.

These are the same chicks who are fake and act all nice to you, but then after talk complete crap about you and gossip all day. And they act like they’re the superior workers bc they are “more involved”  and do things just for appearances. People claim that millennials and Gen z value more flexible work, but I sometimes feel like I’m one of the few here who represent those values.

274,The Apocalypedia: Anti-Work Bible,"Here is the entry on work:

**work** [ðɪgnəʊbəlpɑːθ]
*vb &amp; n* **1** spirit-draining process of forced cretinisation, to which the moronising processes of child-raising (see *brainwashing*), schooling, law, scientism, religion the news-media and fun are directed; the unconscious purpose of which being to absolutely annihilate human nature forever *2** the renting of one’s freedom (near synonym of serfdom: the selling of one’s freedom) in order to subsidise the marvellous activities of the rich (works together with tax, debt, rent and forced consumption)
* for most people ‘work is hell’, because work and hell have so much in common; discomfort, meaninglessness and eternity 
in a healthy society the word work is, like play (or free-time), almost meaningless; in a sick society it is synonymous with toil, slog, labour and travail
* communism and all forms of socialism, fascism, democracy, modernism, anarcho-syndicalism, postmodernism and demagoguery all have exactly the same attitude to work, technique, nature and progress; because all are basically egoic and / or [quasi] rational, and where they are not, they lose ground to their competitors
* the unworld requires and generates the belief that work is a moral value in itself, that people unwilling or unable to submit themselves to intense work discipline deserve nothing, that everyone must work for most of the week (with just enough free time to prevent them from blowing their brains out, but not enough to be creatively idle or to contemplate revolution), that good-judgement is compliance, that health-care and retirement benefits require a lifetime of this work which is practically synonymous with survival
* leads to **a)** cramming the honest, creative and madly generous part of your psyche into spare time (your life’s work is just for evenings and weekends; and even those are not really yours any more) **b)** using these microns of free time to pursue fun, sex, narcotics, family and tribal bonding (which again are increasingly folded into the totalising comfort-zone of the friendly, fun, sexy, spiritual and ‘social’ workspace) **c)** ill-health, frustration, *guggerstrasse* **d)** replacement of craft-development (and the concomitant inability of ordinary folk to meaningfully shape their physical world) with the development of tools and e) forced productivity… unless you are insensitive to all this pain, in which case; leads to a) satisfaction b) ‘success’ c) privilege and d) riches
* as the world spreads over the earth, so work spreads over the psyche; forcing individuals into a permanent state of *weisure* [wɛʒə] n a parody of ludic freedom with added precarity whereby now, thanks to the internet, the workplace is transformed into ceaseless 24/7 work (continuous activity, emotional-labour and availability) until you are your work—just as you are your debt, your belief, your name or your profile—which means, of course, that eventually you are not real; nothing is left—and so, unless you practice, in self-mastery, being who you are, and practice subversively freeing yourself from being constrained by these co-opted personality-fragments, you are worse than imprisoned—because there is no outside to escape to—you are the whole insane, suffering, schizoid-capitalist universe
* note the profound *stagversive* futility of demanding, or trying to negotiate, higher pay, better working conditions or, most ridiculously of all, workplace equality for your favoured minority; which makes as much sense as demanding more freedom, peace or reality from pac-man
* antonym of acting, playing, doing and creating
* synonym of the *ignoble path* and *living death*

280,It finally fully clicked for me today,"As I was leaving for my second day at my new job, I got an email from my boss. I had emailed her to let her know that I can’t work Sunday mornings because I go to church (I had also mentioned this at an interview, although I had forgotten to mention it during my interview with her specifically, hence the email). She was pissed about it, and something in me just snapped. I spent the whole drive to work crying, thinking about how I would have to spend the whole day (and then the whole week, and the week after that and so on) at a job I didn’t give a shit about just so I can fucking survive. I’m mad that my boss can’t talk to me like a human. I’m mad that this job is so fucking pointless. I’m mad that even if I found a job that was slightly more meaningful work than this, I would probably still hate it and still be treated like shit. I’m mad that almost every human on earth is in a similar position as me, and still I am one of the lucky ones, having been born in the US and having a wife who will soon be a doctor- I might not even have to work in a few years but the vast majority of people don’t even have that option. And even my wife, who is extremely passionate about medicine, is going to be stuck working in a fucked up medical system. It’s all just so fucked up. The majority of the human time spent on planet earth is time spent on things people hate doing and are doing because they need to do it to survive. I know this is basically the way things have always been, but at least in the past there was a greater percentage of people whose careers actually directly contributed to the wellbeing of society... it’s just all so fucked.

The power comes from the power of the strike. Of
one employee gets fed up and threatens to walk
out, so what? He will be replaced. But, if the
entire crew walks out, it shuts down the
operation. Of all the employees in other operations
within the company join in solidarity with their
union brothers and also walk off the job, the
entire corporation can be brought to a standstill.
Of the company wants to run its operations, it will
have to make an equitable deal with the union
and get them to go back to work. Strikes are not
to be taken lightly, and there is always pain on
both sides, but it is the only power a union has.

293,Examination of a Summer Seasonal Worker's Pay,"I've never been one to hide my pay rate from anyone.  If the topic comes up, I always tell people that I make $22.00 an hour.  After all, on paper, that's what I'm paid, right?  Taxes and deductions notwithstanding, I don't work a full year.  I work in the asphalt industry, which is only nominally productive (for us) between the months of March and December.  This year, we (my fellow production laborer coworkers) were hired back on the first of March.  3 of the 7 workers at my plant were laid off the week before Thanksgiving.  My boss kept me on until the week before Christmas.  After looking back at my pay-stubs, I came up with 43 normal work weeks.  That's 9 weeks I'm not getting paid (well, for normal work, but I'll get into that in a moment).  If I take the base rate, and expand it to the normal 52 week year, I'm only really earning on paper about **$17.77** an hour.  Not a terrible wage, but I'm 28 and my boss' boss wants me to make a career out of this.  So, seeing that I have some time on my hands now that I'm laid off, lets take a look at the data:

*Processing img xlpb02r5tm641...*

My salary based on my actual paychecks, including overtime (OT) comes to **$41,006 (weekly: $788.58)**.

With deductions for medical and dental insurance, that makes it **$39,175 (weekly: $753.37)**.

Finally, after taxes, I'm bringing home **$30,921.11 (weekly $594.64)**.

Comparatively, some data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics states the following:

[Weekly earnings based on age and ethnicity](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/wkyeng.t03.htm) in 2019 put my (white male, ages 25-54) bracket at **$1,070**.  The site is unclear if that number is after deductions.  If it is, I'm making just over half (55%) of my bracket.  If it isn't, I'm doing a bit better at 74%.

Alternatively, the [full time, modeled wage estimates](https://www.bls.gov/mwe/avg-hourly-wages-for-union-nonunion-fulltime-parttime-workers.htm) for production work in MA and NH (2018) is **$21.17 an hour**.  My paper wage ($22.00 hourly) seems to be fair, and my real wage (**$18.83** after deductions, before taxes, or **$19.71** \[not shown in spreadsheet\] corrected for the seasonal work year) isn't too far off.

It's also worth noting that my earnings are heavily boosted by overtime work.  In 2019, I worked 118 hours overtime (over a 52 week period, that averages to be **2.27 hours per week**).  Granted, that isn't as much as some others in the production or construction fields, but a fair wage should be achieved before overtime, and any wages earned through overtime should be like a bonus (in my opinion).  Not to mention that the vast majority of our OT comes early, as in before our normal workday of 07:00 to 15:30.  2 hours of OT means I'm waking up at 03:30 to make it to work on time.

With this data, I was hoping to get an idea where I stood among the average American worker in my earnings.  I guess I can't complain too much, but [I typically find myself living by Calvin's philosophy.](https://i.imgur.com/51QvIlO.png)  The work itself is hazardous and strenuous, and during the summer, we're pinned to the wall to meet production deadlines.  On paper, I'm a laborer, but I function more as a laboratory technician: performing complex chemical tests on our products to ensure they meet state requirements.  I do have to back off a bit, however, as the work in late November through the end of the year is pretty easy.  During the last week of work, I only put in about 1.5 hours of real work in, and the other 6.5 were spent either sitting around or doing busy-work like sweeping.

Why did I post this to r/antiwork ?  Well, mostly because I'm bored, but alternatively to get some other opinions.  Am I in the right to think I should get a little more to make up for the time I'm not working in the winter?  If I make a career out of this, what is a satisfying wage to make?  ([World Population Review](http://worldpopulationreview.com/states/massachusetts-population/) puts Massachusetts male earners with a bachelor's degree at **$73,399**, I'm only making **56% of that at best**.)  Not to mention, my degree doesn't match my field that I'm currently getting experience in.  I tried looking for new jobs in my area where my experience from this job comes into play, but of the roughly 20 positions I applied for, none replied back to me.  Positions where my degree is useful are few and far between, and of the 4 positions available, three were paid about $3.00 an hour less than my current rate, and the one that did meet my criteria did not reply back.

Then there is my financial situation.  I'm trying to repay student loans and tons of medical debt, not to mention a new (to me) car payment because my 2004 junker shit the bed this August.  Most of my earnings are thrown out the window as soon as it comes in.  Although, that isn't to say I don't have some expendable cash (I also have some expensive habits I can use to kick).  I've already come to terms that I probably won't be moving out of my parents place until my mid thirties.

I encourage you guys to take a look at what you're earning and what you should be earning.  I think it's hard for a lot of people to understand that making a decent amount does not equal making the right amount.  I hope to rekindle my job search this layoff season in hopes of finding a better position, because I've seen the way my boss lives, and my boss' boss wants to put me there, and I'm not sure if that's what I want to be for the rest of my career.

Notes about the spreadsheet:

* The first 4 paid weeks were only 8 hours of work per week, which is because I was technically laid off.  However, sometimes there is a job that requires more than one worker at the plant, and the one worker who is kept on over the lay off period needs assistance.  Also, Massachusetts unemployment insurance will continue to pay out if you only work 8 hours or less in a work week.
* The week of 05/04 was the first week I was raised from $20 an hour to $22 an hour.
* I was out of work for the pay week of 07/13 due to an injury I sustained at work.  I was paid Workers Comp, but I elected to keep it from the data because that doesn't reflect what my work payed out to me.
* OT = Overtime   UT = Undertime (unpaid)
* During the week of 09/21 we were paid out our remaining paid time off, and it was added as OT to our paychecks.
* During the week of 10/12, I was hospitalized and inpatient (non-work related), and due to our paid time off getting paid out on 09/21, I was not able to cover the days I was out.

**TL/DR**: I procured and calculated a bunch of data so I can whine about how I'm only making just over half of what my fellow male, bachelor's degree holding, Massachusetts counterparts earn, even though I make $22 an hour on paper, because I'm bored.",False,ef6239,Flopolopagus,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ef6239/examination_of_a_summer_seasonal_workers_pay/,6,1

301,I found a post in another forum describing our lives," First off I don't know many jobs that allow you to stroll in at 9am. Work begins at 8am, meaning to be at your desk, you need to be leaving the house by 7:30am. If you plan on showering and eating breakfast at a normal pace, or doing anything besides throwing clothes on and walking out of the door - you'll be waking up at 6:30am or earlier depending on how much you try to get done before work.  


This also assumes you CAN leave at 7:30am and still get to work on time. Odds are if you live in a metro or have any reasonable commute, you will be leaving at 7:00am or earlier, meaning you'll be waking up at 6.  


You arrive at work and sit at your desk. Whatever your task is I can promise it is not fulfilling. You will not feel good about ""accomplishing"" anything that day because nothing of substance will be accomplished.  


At 10:30am you will get your first 15 minute break, assuming your employer recognizes DOL labor practices. You will either go outside and smoke or try to fix a mix-morning snack to keep your metabolism up despite sitting at a desk all day.  


As soon as 12:00 hits, you will race out of the building for lunch (assuming you didn't spend the precious non-work hours meal prepping) and jam into the same crowded places within walking distance everyone else does. You choose from the same menu you have a thousand times before. You see all the same people who jam into the same restaurant you do a thousand times before. You try to jam your food down so you have time to attempt to enjoy the brief few moments of respite with your phone or tablet - the screen being the tiny window that is only escape from the hell of white collar slavery.  


At 1pm you will return to your desk and work non-stop until 5pm with a single 15 minute break. There will probably be at least one or more messages waiting for you when you get back because some dumbfuc- er, client, called while you were trying to live the life of a normal human being.  


At 5pm you will jam yourself back into traffic and spend anywhere from 30m - 1 hour trying to get either home, to the gym, or to essential places like the grocery store. If you're able to get home by 5:30, consider yourself lucky. Assuming you do gym -&gt; grocery, you might as well consign yourself to hopefully getting home before 8pm.  


When you get home, you will still have routine \*\*\*\* to do - laundry, cleaning up, making food, whatever else. At best during the week, you'll have maybe 1-2 hours to do anything remotely recreational: TV, internet, whatever. Assuming you're going for 8 hours of sleep, you hit the bed at 10pm in anticipation of your alarm going off at 6am so you can do it all again.  


Saturday will be your only real day ever to yourself. It's marred by the fact that trying to go out and do anything on Saturday shoves you in with everyone else in the same boat - everything's crowded, the roads are packed, takes forever to get anywhere or do anything because of the people. The day goes by in a blur and soon it's Sunday, meaning you get to spend time prepping for 5 days back in the salt mines being a slave.  


The only two things your white collar job as an employee likely provides for you are a semi-decent income and stability. Beyond that, you are treated as a disposable commodity. Your work is all on paper or on a computer. It will be rare if ever that your work directly produces anything tangible and useful for anyone - most notably yourself.  


The pay you receive will always be minuscule compared to the profit your labor yields for the company or owner. While you are not on the hook for the ultimate responsibility if the business itself fails, you will be held responsible by your boss for everything up until that point. If you have an inbox, you will live next to it - going so far to even have your work email pushed to your phone so you can reply at any time, even on vacation.  


If you truly move up high enough and get into business admin, the job subsumes your life. You are permanently on call. Your inbox is flooded with so much \*\*\*\* you could never possibly sort and read through every email, note, request, message, whatever. You eventually get a secretary to help keep track of your schedule, but it's a schedule you've long since lost all control over. You're drug from one meeting to the next, placed in charge of a team of personalities ranging from apathetic high school dropout to over-achieving brown noser who is gunning for your job next pay period.  


Assuming you still have some kind of friends or a relationship on the side, those too will eventually yield to the weight of the job.  


You wake up one day and you're 50 or 60-something and you look in the mirror to find a shell where a human being used to be. You look in the rear view mirror and see nothing.  


Nothing was created. Nothing was destroyed. A bunch of paper moved around your desk that you may or may not have touched. It may or may not have had your name on it at the time. You may have said something, or advised on how something should be done - but you never did anything. Nothing that produced a tangible result. It was all paper - some of it green paper with little numbers on it, some of it paper with legal letterhead - but all of it nothing but an endless mountain of paper in the end.  


Maybe you're rich by now. Maybe not. Depending on what track you took, you could still be working for the same wage you were working for 10-15 years ago doing the exact same thing. Or maybe by now you own the company and you and the company are the same thing. The company is your identity and you are it. The traits of the company are your own character traits. If the company went under, you'd probably suicide, because there would be nothing left of you. You stop to ponder taking time off from running your company, but realize that might as well be like trying to stop breathing.  


At your funeral, few people if anyone will mention what your college major was, or what your graduating GPA was, or how many interviews you went through with boring questions to get that first position working the \*\*\*\* job pushing paper. Few people if anyone will care if you wore a suit from Goodwill or a suit from \*\*\*\*\* to your last meeting. Few people if anyone will mention how many times you reached over across the bed to turn off your alarm clock at 5:59am, dragged your ass to the sink, and brushed your teeth in a daze to start the day after trying to actually live your life and stay up past 10pm.  


**Tl;dr:** **In the end, that is what a White Collar job is: a meaningless, pointless, soul-destroying profession that amounts to next to nothing.**  


**For some, it can make you rich if that's your thing. But for most, it's a one-way ticket to a mediocre existence in front of a computer making an increasingly marginalized middle-class wage doing unfulfilling \*\*\*\* that involves a bare minimum of critical thinking to accomplish a task that will yield no tangible result besides a piece of paper moving from the ""IN"" bin to the ""OUT"" bin.**",False,eeb02w,obuto4,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/eeb02w/i_found_a_post_in_another_forum_describing_our/,8,1

This staff member is such a stooge to managment it's embarrasing, she snitches like 24/7. She also walked in 10 minutes late holding a coffee this morning, but I won't snitch because I'm not pathetic.

Then I decided to check this order out, and my boss ordered it...

I was so angry, my face went purple, and my hands were shaking, like no shit my right hand was basically seizuring, my temperature went through the roof and the whole time snitchy (obviously realizing she had done crossed the line with me) was trying to make small talk asking my about my xmas plans.

I've gone on my lunch and calming down but I have to go back in there soon, and I get to spend every day except Christmas day in there over the holidays.

323,"Today, I lost my job one day before having major surgery and six days before Christmas.","**About a month ago, I accepted a job to be an assistant to a financial advisor. When I applied for the position, I was surprised that I got an interview request but I guess something stood out about me. I made it VERY clear that I had absolutely no background in finance or insurance but they said that didn’t matter and that they would train me.** 

**The person I was replacing was leaving the position because his significant other got a new job in another state. He also had no background in finance and said he had to learn everything on the job but no worries, he would train me. First day of my job, he didn’t show up, said he went somewhere for the weekend and his flight got delayed and he couldn’t make it back for work. Second day of my job, he said he overslept and couldn’t make it in. So keep in mind, these two days, I basically got paid to do nothing. I faxed some things and read some how-to guides but that was basically it. On my third day of this job, he finally showed up. Trained me for SIX HOURS and then said that was his last day. From that point on, I was expected to know how to manage multi-million dollar portfolios with no help.**

**I showed up earlier than everyone else. I asked tons of questions. I learned a lot. I was on top of everything my boss put on my desk. My boss was gone a lot meeting clients but I was good at finding things to do and making sure nothing got missed. I could literally name from memory right now all the cases we are working on with their first and last name and what insurance carrier we are using for them (my boss uses several).**

**Anyway, today, he asks me to come into his office and says that “Things aren’t working out” and “I’m not catching on” because “I’m not a very detail-oriented person”. Are you fucking serious right now? I never got any critiques or any way that I could do better. It just went from 100 to 0 in a day. Meanwhile, there were several times that I emailed my boss about things that needed to be done on his end (signing something, authorizing something, etc) and he would take DAYS to do it. But when he asked me to do something? I would drop everything and do it.**

**So now I don’t know what the hell to do. I might call my doctor tomorrow and reschedule surgery since I don’t have the money to spend right now or maybe I should do it while I can, while I still have insurance. I’m so angry.

332,That time I almost died on a delivery,"So my friend got me a few days gig being an assistant to an event production team who all worked like a bunch of chickens with their heads cut off. Their job was to get flustered over the ribbons for the centerpieces on tables, roll out red carpets and other useless bullshit.

On the second day one of their chickenheads lost the key to a uhaul truck he had rented. For the second time in one day, I had to go from the event site in downtown to their office 20 miles away to pick up amazon deliveries of glitter or whatever the fuck they ordered. With my own personal car. Then I had to pick up the spare key at a uhaul place, then come back through rush hour downtown traffic.

I was already stressed because of the impossible traffic. And the fact they sent me off to do this without thinking about efficiency (couldn’t they pick up their glitter tomorrow?!) It was already such a waste of lifetime.

Coming back to the event site a sociopath driver in downtown Los Angeles cut out of his left turn lane lineup, into the WRONG side of the road, where I was. He swerved back into the line somehow, feet away from me. But I nearly had a head on collision .. because of a reckless piece of shit businessman in his bmw. Doing what? Cutting in line?!

Sociopath almost wrecked my car and injured/killed me. 
All this for minimum wage.

I was screaming and I felt like murdering the shitpiece who almost hit me. He can go to hell. Wish I had a dash cam so I could have sent that to police..

At the event site I sped past security, delivered their fuckload, nearly broke down crying. Told my friend I quit. 

Security came up quacking that I had to check in. I didn’t give an actual fuck. Sped out of there.

337,"We put ourselves through immense stress and pain to keep up the grind, losing all sense of pleasure in the process","I only recently entered my , but I've been having anti-work sentiment stirring in my head since around age 16. Thinking about the futility keeps me up at night sometimes- see, even on Christmas!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As a sixteen year old girl, I got my very first job performing and serving in a tourist trap train show. Think Christmas/holiday type gig. I am autistic and have sensory as well as communicative issues. I had my hair kept short, and I didn't wear makeup. I was also very quiet and only did well during performances rather than interactions with other coworkers. They didn't like that I was different. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It made things very difficult for me. In the blistering cold, or sweltering heat, I'd get put on trains with no heating or air while the boss's daughter and her friends were put on the first class train everytime. I remember one day I was a bit slow because I had been on the non AC car all day, and it was the one day I had to work with the boss's daughter. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

She was very rude to me and made fun of me because I stumbled, scolding me and huffing loudly about me. I began to have dread everyday coming to work because of how my coworkers spoke to me, and I could do absolutely nothing because nepotism. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The final straw was when an older male coworker over 12 years older than me started flirting with me. I was underaged and felt very uncomfortable, reported it to management, and told them if he wasn't removed from my shifts that I would walk away. They told me I was just looking for excuses to quit. I never went back.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Well, as all of my fellow Americans know, you can't survive without a job, and so I went hunting for more work I could get as a high school student. Unfortunately, this meant fast food.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Boomers, in addition to many white-collar corporate workers who believe in the bootstraps mentality,  will say that fast food and retail work is easy and is a necessary rung to climb on the ladder of 'resume boosting' when you are a teenager.  This could not be further than the truth.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My coworkers knew I had a disability and would make 'retard jokes'. They would walk out to smoke cigarettes or pot while I was running the register all by myself and had barely worked there for a week. I was worked far past the limit of what you should force a minor to work, while receiving only one break for my entire 8 hour shift, where they expected me to prepare and eat my dinner in 20 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Some days I would not eat because there was so much work to be done. Grueling, manual work like moving heavy boxes, scrubbing floors and toilets, constantly on your feet and running around while customers screamed and yelled at you. I was also the dish washer in addition to my other tasks- assurancd, I was very meticulous about cleanliness.  I was told if I kept 'taking so long to do dishes' and staying past my allotted shift to finish them that I would not get paid for that time.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My coworkers took advantage of me. They knew I drank the grind grind grind strong work ethic mentality and exploited it, while hollering at me for accidentally putting one extra pinch of chicken on a sandwich because it would cost the company money. Everyone said this was unskilled, low stress work but the amount of times I would accidentally make a minor mistake during a shift and get absolutely destroyed by my bosses or coworkers for it was astounding.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up leaving that job too because apparently I called out too much due to an influx of mental/physical problems. Once again, as a newly anointed adult, I had to get a job once more while on a break semester from university. Time for retail, the other menace of wage slavery!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My retail experience gave me my first taste of, wow, 90% of jobs are absolutely useless. That was a bitter pill to swallow, that I had to be confined in what felt like prison for 8 hours a day, conjuring the illusion of productivity. Even better was the fact that we weren't allowed to sit down, so you had to seem busy on the sales floor when there was no work to be done.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Managers would come up and yell at me because I wasn't ""watching people carefully enough who could potentially be stealing"", and I had a serious moral issue with those kinds of assumptions. Everyone at my store was a redneck, anti-LGBT, overwhelmingly trump supporting kind of character, and it made my days at work pure misery because I simply was an outsider. If someone was extremely creepy or controversial they'd just get moved to throwing the truck instead. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I had to work at this job for around 7 months, and it was absolutely hell for me. I fell into the deepest depression I've had thus far because I was barely 18 years old, no friends, no life, abusive bf, and too exhausted from work to change anything about my situation. I could barely care for myself. Coming home to cook or clean was like torture. When I'd have to stand in the kitchen to prepare food after a shift, the pain in my back was like someone had dipped a hot poker stick into a bed of flaming coals and scraped it up my spine.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Fast food and retail work destroyed my back, legs, and joints. I still don't have a diagnosis for what is wrong with my body, but work did it no favors! I began to develop a serious disdain for working. I went back to university and decided to pursue a STEM field, hoping and praying I would never be stuck in a physically demanding job again in my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Yet, I found that another sort of stress existed- not the stress on my body from standing and lifting all day, but the stress of sitting at a desk doing fuckall and receiving no mental or physical stimulation whatsoever. However, it is seen as the absolute prize in America to grind for one of these positions. It makes me feel ill and disillusioned with the world I live in. I stopped feeling pleasure from most things because I didn't see the point in anything now.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I worked in technical support part time last year. During this time I believe my ADHD and autism symptoms worsened because I was simply on my phone doing nothing all day at work and it shot my concentration. All my coworkers would chat and have a great time socializing but I was always left out, once again, because I'm autistic and fail completely at the social games and expectations of workplace cordiality politics.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 I moved universities so I did not have this job for too long, but I landed another temp technical job shortly after, and it was the same song and dance, except I kept leaving to go home early because I couldn't stand sitting in silence in a room for 8 hrs. My boss gave me minimal guidance on what I was meant to be programming, my coworkers ignored me and even accidentally hit me in the head with a ball because they 'did not see me sitting in the corner desk', and I felt like the caged bird once more.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

After the job finished, I felt guilty because I didn't work hard enough and barely accomplished anything our team had set out to achieve, as I was too depressed to feel any passion for the grind. Any sense of pleasure I felt was long overshadowed by the constant mantra of resume building activities I was guided into, Applied behavioral analysis therapy to try to make me seem ""less autistic"" so that I could mask and have the persona of normality to stay in uni and land a job, and the pain I'd shouldered from life and work stressors. I've been told so many times that I just need to get over my physical pain and anxiety and autism and suck it up cause everybody has to work.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I currently do volunteer research work, and while I'd say it's more fulfilling than previous occupations (Feels like my tasks have a real purpose) , I still loathe work and find it dull, meaningless in the grand scheme of things, and unnecessary. Just a pissing contest of who can be more miserable and climb the ranks to a cushy 9-5 desk job with a cozy managerial position the fastest.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I met someone online I fancied quite a lot and we started dating. Both of us are autistic, both struggle with social norms and adjusting to adult life, except my boyfriend excels at finding and keeping jobs. His attitudes regarding work align perfectly with the societal narrative of grind till you can't anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I love my boyfriend dearly, and it breaks my heart to see the sacrifices he makes for a career. He is underpayed due to his disability (Expected to do a senior position's duties without a formal job title, so they can justify paying him less) and lets his workplace stomp all over his autonomy and his freedom to have an actual LIFE.

His job is mostly sitting at a desk all day and occasionally touching a spreadsheet. The others at his work who are payed handsomely cannot even use the software and technology their positions require and make him labor for them because they are too lazy to open Google and learn basic Microsoft Office knowledge.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My partner wastes two hours of his life commuting everyday to a job that often assigns him no tasks and forces him to be unproductive all day. I've seen him turn up to his job while being terribly ill, or after a hospital visit, all because, ""It reflects my character poorly to be absent, and I need them to know I am serious about work.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Our relationship is long distance, which makes visiting often hard when you barely get any time off work. Even now, he was working on Christmas eve, although he sees it as a bonus that he got to sit at home and refresh his email and be on call for one single day, when his job has absolutely no reason to not let him work from home. I get angry about unfair things in life like this. When I rant to him that it's insane that we live like this, he tells me it's just the way that things are, it is the way of the world to work and we can't change this fact.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like once I gained this insight into what the world is really like and that working is an absolute explotive sham, there is no way for me to return to my previous schools of thought. I can't unlearn my conviction and dogmas related to anti work. Once again, I've found myself sinking into depression. Slapstick workplace comedies like the office, peep show, IT crowd, etc make me feel ill. Can there really be more to life than this? are the only thoughts I have while consuming meda like that nowadays.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Contemplating my future makes me insanely pessimistic and full of despair. I plan to go to graduate school and have a career in research/academia but I've struggled to hold any job since becoming sick. I've been on more psychiatric medications than you can imagine and I still have no motivation or energy. I fear the day I graduate university, as I can't see myself trapped in the confines of a 40 hr work week, rife with the extra shackles of a painful commute. I can't handle 40+ hrs but good luck finding a job that doesn't require it!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Even sitting here with the love of my life, I have absolutely no hope because to live in America- or most anywhere in the universe-is to work. My partner believes work gives him a purpose. Work merely gives me a sense of dread. I can't find any work that seems tolerable to me. I watched my boyfriend talk about science with stars in his eyes, yet he is a white-collar wage slave plugging at business spreadsheets. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

When I told him he should pursue his interests, as he holds a BS in physical sciences, he simply told me that most people ever gets a job in the field their degree is in. It's unreasonable. No jobs exist, or those that exist won't pay well, or some other excuse. I feel like there is something inherent that I lack, merely because I don't have this mindset. My ability to grind during wage slavery is gone. I cannot be complacent with cubicles, suits and ties, office politics, coffee runs, and fucking excel spreadsheets!!

How can people plan their futures for decades down the line when they can't guarantee if their companies will keep them in continuous employment? A hell lot can change every year, including the fact that you remain frustrated after taking a mortgage that you can't change companies that easily and can't relocate on a whim.

I have never found the courage of taking a mortgage even though I have saved enough for a deposit, I am investing some of it in mutual funds which have given me a good return (above inflation) and am relying on my parents property inheritance once they are no longer alive. There's no chance I will ever be tying myself in a grand loan scheme but when I read an article about someone doing up their home on taken on 90 % mortgage and feeling happy about it, it makes me wonder if they have thought through any of the shit they will need to put up with in order to pay all that money back.",False,edpor9,horseshoemagnet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/edpor9/mortgage_biggest_trap/,67,1

361,That time I willingly worked an $18/hr job for $12/hr,"Let me start off by saying that I have always been a hard worker and this experience has been one of the worse experiences I went through in my life, and I’m so happy there is a place where I can get it off my chest. 

When I was in college, a professor I did unpaid research for emailed me about a paid opportunity that I can be a good fit for with a professor friend of her. This was at a top tier healthcare academic institution, and since I was eager to get paid experience that I can add to my med school resume when I apply I was over the moon when I interviewed and was hired.

After hiring me, the PhD I was supposed to work for emailed me saying that since I didn’t have any work experience, HR wouldn’t hire me. She casually offered me a clerical assistant position that pays $12 an hour until I get a promotion to the real position that pays $18 an hour. Being the naive person I was, I believed her and accepted.

Slowly after being hired, she started having marriage problems and her ex husband started coming over to work to fight or whatever. She went off the grid for 6 months. Yes, for 6 months this lady didn’t show up for work and was still hired. Getting paid while I and others on the team slaved to get her funding for no incentives.

After those two months went by and with my boss not around, I asked the supervisor under her about the status of my promotion. She gave me sad eyes and excuses about my bosses marriage falling apart and a “hiring freeze”. She said she’ll follow up with HR. 

Fast forward to a year an half, of me working something I was getting paid fairly for and responsibilities piling up with no promotions. Being a believer of how “hard work pays off” I sacrificed my grades and my time and mostly importantly my mental well being and health for absolutely nothing in return.

The final straw was a meeting when she finally came back, she was bragging about her teenager like single life and how she was getting paid 20K more this year than the last. I finally had enough and put in my two week notice. 

I shortly got a better job that paid me for what I actually do and gave me a position that matched what I do. However, this really made me bitter and I never do more work that I have to and I never ever volunteer for extra work. I still get raises and I’m happier, and best of all is that I get to fix the huge damage I did to my medical school application (yes, I got rejected due to the effort I put into my work instead of my school and my dream goal to please her). 

I’m writing this to get it off my chest. I’m so hurt over the scam that fancy institution pulled on me and probably still pulls on poor college students every day. It sucks that it took me a year and half to realize that all the work I did got HER a raise even though she was not even there half the time. But life is lessons and that lesson was finally learned.

Because, of course, they can't *not* pay the minimum wage. And people got fired from lines regularly. Well, we had 0 hour contracts so rather than 'fired' they'd just stop giving people work till they quit themselves. Because then they can't face any consequences for it.

387,"""Well, nobody else would pick up the phone, so we had to call you!""","That's what his company told my fiancé after yanking him, the software engineer, out of bed literally at 1 am on a Wednesday, to go to the warehouse and reset a goddamn router. He got home around 3 am, dead tired. 

He worked overtime the previous day fixing someone else's mess that was pushed onto him, and got home past 6 pm.

And need I mention, I just overhead him talking with a coworker on the phone WHILE ON THE TOILET AT 6 AM. After having denied the call FOUR TIMES IN THE TEN MINUTES HE WAS IN THERE.

THE MAN CAN'T EVEN SHIT IN PEACE.

And why all this? Because with the router down some four hours, the warehouse is delayed, and one shift's profits are lost.

But they're absolutely like family, of course. They totally care about their employees. They're totally not paying the least amount that they can get away with. Last week he totally didn't have to go to the other side of the country to install a server and get home at 5 am, meanwhile the company is not a multinational conglomerate and totally not opening seven new stores this week in this country alone.

389,The Planet is Literally Being Worked to Death,"My main ethical gripe with modern work is that ""production"" is often just the depletion &amp; destruction of nature to sustain an unnaturally large population that may not plateau for about 80 years (UN medium projection). We have more and more people working longer hours to ""produce"" goods from declining material stocks, funded by monetary debt that masks physical depletion. The masking effect is denied by Cornucopians who've become so wrapped up in money they've forgotten its origins.

Examples include the extraction of finite resources like fossil fuels, along with decreasingly-renewable timber stocks, aquifers, and of course overfishing. Just a fractional list. This also explains the constant rush to deliver products on time (vs. only having to supply what small groups used to need). You're working for the sake of too many others and it feels forced for a reason.

Also, much of what's called ""hard work"" seems unnaturally hard and/or dangerous. No other species has to spend so much time keeping a vast infrastructure running 24/7, and most complaints about corporate control of our lives can be tied to this growthist cycle. It's easy to complain about the people at the top milking the biggest salaries, but every worker is locked into the same resource feeding-frenzy.

There's talk of Green GDP (GGDP) replacing standard GDP which only measures money, but invasive technologies like Big Wind are adding to ecosystem destruction in new ways, rebranding the same old story. Much of what's called Green is just new marketing angles with little chance of halting AGW. When the clarion call of ""job creation"" ends up destroying more of nature, how is it true progress?

The planet is crawling with more engineers and laborers, like mosquitoes bleeding it dry, literally poking holes with drilling and mining. I see no moral purpose in making a nature-wrecking economy bigger and bigger, nor do I see intrinsic value in more complex gadgets to keep the system from crashing. But that's exactly what much of the economy is. And the financial sector both funds and feeds off that growth, so there's no incentive to break the cycle.",False,ecmw3m,FiniteEarth,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ecmw3m/the_planet_is_literally_being_worked_to_death/,11,1

399,got fired half a year ago,"so I got fired from my last job. The firing took me by surprise because I was a good employee and the managers seemed to be  satisfied with my performance. I mean I did not ""like"" the job (working full-time sucks) but it was bearable esp because my colleagues seemed super nice and friendly.

Back to the firing: I came to office one day and was called into a room. HR and manager were there. They told me they were going to terminate my contract because my presence ""is seriously damaging the company's reputation"". A second later they showed me some screen caps of my personal instagram photos... I was like WTF. so I am a gay dude, and sometimes I share ""sexy pics"" on my \*\*personal instagram\*\*. mind you, none of those were nudes (instagram doesnt allow them anyway). so the pics they showed me were: One pic I was in my briefs, one pic I was in a Pride Parade with other half naked people, one pic was at a gay bar full of half-naked guys. They told me they found them repulsive and went on to shame me on my sexuality and the way i express it online. I tried to argue with them that (1) I dont see anything wrong with the pics, and (2) what I do in my personal time is none of their business. Most importantly, it was blatant discrimination. Then this manager, who used to be super nice to me, yelled at me, saying ""it's not about your sexuality, it's the pictures themselves, they're obscene"". I am a soft-spoken guy and was intimidated by his yelling and so did not go on to argue with them. They paid me in lieu of my notice period, and I was forced to pack everything and leave right after.

That was half a year ago. I wouldn't lie — not working for a few months was GREAT for my well-being; i get to wake up whenever i want; i actually have time and energy to read a book; i get to travel a bit, etc. Moreover, taking a break from  work for the first time since graduation actually allows me reflect on how mind-numbing full-time job is — never had enough rest, always had to care about what my colleagues and managers think about me, and dont even mention any sense of personal achievement or growth. On the other hand, because of how they insulted me on my last day, this past year I've had many episodes of depression/anger whenever I think back to what happened (still fresh in my mind). Worse, those ""friends"" at work either blocked me or ignored my messages, probably because in corporate logic it is inappropriate to talk with anyone who is fired.

460,I hate this workplace (rant),"I hate this workplace because it reminds me of every fucking shitty workplace I've been in.

This place is managed by dumbasses who can't bother to check on their employees. These idiots can't treat their employees right. They can't understand that we know our job better than they do. They can't acknowledge our contribution and just constantly shit all over us. Oh, you just fired a bunch of competent people to ""improve"" productivity and yet you run on these old ass procedures that make your employees' life incredibly difficult for no fucking reason and you won't allow changes even if it means an increase in time efficiency? ""We should keep doing this because it says so"" isn't an appropriate response for something that clearly doesn't work anymore.

They're about to deny me a second job. I am supposed to be giving English classes in January and my boss was not very pleased by it. 

I've been working here for over 7 months now and I think I know how to manage my own time and not have to be physically here 8 hours a day to get the job done. Being here this much is painful. I could get everything done in two to three days. It's a data entry job, for fuck's sake. It's not even supposed to be full-time to begin with. They wouldn't even have to pay me as much and the job would still get done. 

I refuse to give up on a dream job, one that they've been aware of since they hired me, just because they're control freaks. During my initial interview, my boss was the one who suggested that I give English classes while I worked with them because I mentioned that it was a goal of mine. He made it seem like a possibility, but that was after he laughed with the accounting manager about what someone with a Literature and Linguistics degree could possibly do with their life. This job is underpaid by the way. I can't work 40 hours for a salary as low as this when my English classes pay 5 dollars more an hour. That's just not feasible in the long run for me and I know that's not their problem. They don't give a fuck.

I called at 1pm when I was 100% sure I wouldn’t be able to make it in for my 4-10 shift. The person who I spoke to told me “everyone who could take your shift already worked today. Take the next 3 hours to rest, we’ll see you at 4”. I was pissed. I said “no, I’m positive I can’t work. I’ve thrown up twice”. They essentially told me I can’t call out. I then put my phone in do not disturb and went to sleep. I was very clear on the phone, there’s no way I could get in trouble for this. 

I woke up to some texts from my gf who’s also working there tonight. She thinks it’s as ridiculous as I do, but all my coworkers are collectively talking shit about me, saying that I’m not really sick and whatnot.

467,I want to stop showing up to work so bad,"I’ve been at the same grocery store job for 6 years. I worked my way up as high as I could, and for the past two years I’ve been a front end supervisor. I also do the payroll. All for $12.05 an hour. 

I’ve been sucking it up because I need to pay my bills. I’ve been tolerating all the bullshit that’s thrown my way. And I do it all with a blank, emotionless face because I am dead inside when I’m there. I search for jobs a lot, but can never find anything. My friend told me that he could get me in as a pharmacy tech at his job, so I’ll be filling out the application as soon as I get a chance today. 

This started Sunday night. I called out with a migraine but I have NOT heard the end of it. At first they were telling me I can’t call out and that I have no choice but to come in because they’re short staffed. I threw a fit over the phone and told them that I’ve thrown up twice and that I definitely won’t be coming in. They had no choice but to accept it, but since then nobody is letting me live it down. Not even people that work in other departments!! This is when I realized I’m wayyy too involved in this store. I do way too much but of course no one recognizes that, they just see me as a villain for calling out once, *maybe* twice a year. I was told I’m selfish. I was told there’s no migraine that isn’t cured by Excedrin Migraine pills (which I took 2 of. They did nothing for me). I love when I’m belittled for health problems 😎

Then, literally just now as I’m typing this, my boss called me and texted me 3 times asking if I can come in early because “every single person until 1pm called out due to weather”. I dealt with the same exact thing last week, and when I texted my boss about it she said “happy Tuesday!” and stopped responding when I asked her to come in. That day was a shit storm, but I managed it all just fine and ultimately I survived. She wants me to work 9-5:30, rather than 12-6 like I’m scheduled. That’s gonna be a big no from me dawg. 

I want to stop showing up so bad. It’s the only way I’ll receive gratification at this point. My mental health is in fuckin SHAMBLES but I have no other way to pay my bills at the moment. I’d be fine for a week or two but quitting without another job lined up would probably be a death sentence for me.

  -  create username/password. upload resume. Answer 20 minute personality test. INPUT ALL INFORMATION FROM RESUME, despite it already being on the fucking resume!

Okay, get a telephone call. Commit to interview.   Make up some bullshit about values, goals blah blah blah.  Bullshit my way to an in person interview. keep in mind this is MINIMUM WAGE.  I'm not going to be running a billion dollar tech company here.

Get to in person interview. Go through all of the standard bullshit questions, like:

 -   ""Can you tell me a little about yourself?"" - I'm a guy in need of currency.

 -   ""Why do you want this job?"" - I need currency to maintain my existence for the foreseeable future. Currency may be exchanged for goods and services.

  -  ""Why should we hire you?"" - I will show up and trade effort for currency.

 -   ""What is your greatest strength?"" - exerting effort in exchange for currency.

 -   ""Where do you see yourself in five years?"" - continuing to exert effort in exchange for currency.

It's not a bad job. I'm paid decently, the people are great, I have a nice schedule. 

But I hate it. 

I come in stressed, frustrated and angry. I go home stressed, frustrated and angry with an added dose of depression. 

Lately, it has come to my attention that my supervisor has wanted me to take on the role of my team's lead. I have plans of leaving the company next year in search of something less stressful. I have no interest in being a lead. 

As of last week, my supervisor keeps throwing the term ""lead"" around when addressing me or introducing me to someone. At first I thought, ""it's his 60 year-old brain again... He probably didn't mean it."" But then he used it more and more. 

I've already been promoted a couple of months ago, and we sort of touched on this, but not in depth. I thought I'd be on my way out before this came up again. I haven't been approached about this, I haven't been spoken to about this. I'm really irritated and it's hard for me to confront him because it makes me nervous.

it takes place on a saturday every year, so it's not on a day we would usually come into work. it is absolutely mandatory to be there anyway to prepare the event and run the thing. every employee has to be there from 8AM till about 3PM. 

every single customer gets a free christmas tree and free food. the employees are not even getting paid to be there, we are not even allowed to clock in on that day to maybe get some extra hours, nope.

482,I'm ready to get out by any means necessary. Am I screwed?,"Forgive me if any of this is awkwardly worded. My mind is beyond frazzled. 

I am 21 years old.

Ever since working my first job back in 2016, I've been employed at 10 places. Lots of these jobs were just a means to a paycheck, but some I had decided to pursue for being related to passions and hobbies of mine. I've learned plenty, which I suppose is the one silver lining, however tarnished it may be. My most recent job has actually been a bit of a breath of fresh air. While still riddled with typical flaws that most labor jobs have, it is by far the best environment I've worked in. 

Well, now I want out.

Since the beginning of November (and I literally mean November 1st) my luck, which had previously been treating me well, turned for the worse. I was """"""pulled over"""""" in an illegal traffic stop *in my work parking lot*. Since that point, life has been rotten. Since I've enjoyed my current job more than any other I've ever worked, my attendance and work ethic had been very good. Well... I'm sitting here the eve before heading back to work after 5 missed days. My supervisors are unhappy. I am unhappy. None of these absences were my fault. I didn't want this to happen. Yet, now I stare in the face the possibility of losing my job. Does that make me upset? I.. Don't think it does, really. 

I've thought I loved many of my previous jobs. They all turned extremely sour at one point or another, usually by no fault of my own. Working at FedEx, it is currently the peak season, and shifts are greuling. Much stress is on my shoulders (ba dum tiss); the drivers I load for verbally abuse me for things out of my control; my supervisors critique me for being overwhelmed by the volume *they* are supposed to keep manageable, there sometimes is literally *no water* despite it being a very active job. These were not issues before the holidays, so my opinion of working there has certainly suffered. Unrelated to why I've recently missed so many days, though.

But what does upset me... is thinking of how I have to go find another job if this one fails. Like, this job fucking *sucks*, don't get me wrong. But it sucks less than most. My coworkers are mostly cool people. But if *this* still drives me insane, what *won't*?

I'd love to have my own business... maybe run a record store, or a hobby shop. Or be a professional musician, since I write so much music. But you need to be able to invest and risk for those goals. I don't have money, I don't have capital, and soon I might not even have a job. These are unachievable goals. 

But I cannot keep cycling through jobs like this. There's no short supply of simple work for me to get. I've done things like landscaping, tradework, retail, food service, janitorial, and now warehouse, plus others. All over the board. Nothing has stuck around. I am so, *so* desperate to leave this horrible cycle. 

Maybe I'll try and see my doctor... have him recommend me a psychiatrist or something. See if there's some way, *any* way, I can make it onto SS/unemployment. Something. My mental health has degraded so heavily and I need a break. I need a chance to actually do things other than work and run around with my head metaphorically cut off.

10 jobs in less than 4 years is just insane. Only a few have been at the same time as each other. Please tell me I'm not alone. Only 2 of those jobs I have left on good terms. I can't be the only one with this shit luck. Constantly getting abused by employers in some way shape or form, all while my sanity tanks and starts rotting all the other parts of my life as a result. 

I'm sorry for the large wall of text. I have so much I need to get out of my system. I feel so trapped. Bills are piling up quicker than they can be paid. Fuck.",False,eb6r1f,AppleBerryPoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/eb6r1f/im_ready_to_get_out_by_any_means_necessary_am_i/,19,1

489,How is it legal for wages to remain stagnant with constant inflation?,"When I started working in 2008, I believe I was making ~$6.25/ hr minimum wage. Now almost 12 years later, it's only gone up $1? How does that even make sense? 

I moved to Utah in June and even Google says you have to make $22/ hr to live here. I was making $25.50 at my last job for 30-35 hours but without my husband wouldn't even be able to live on that with my loans, insurance, and just eating. 

The house we rent is $1557/ month and the average price for a home here is $280-400K depending on the area and size. 

Now that I'm unemployed and we're living on my husband's $70K (apparently the ""sweet spot"" to live comfortably) will still struggle to have a down payment when we're ready to buy and health insurance for a family of 4 is just off the charts for decent coverage. 

When my Sallie Mae loan and car is paid off in 3-6 years, we'll be much better but seriously, how do people live on a single income?

501,Anyone else a long-term temp out there?,"On 12/31 my contract is up on the 3rd or 4th longtime job - not including the many small, humiliating 2 weekers, long enough to get a taste of wonderful (at least on the outside) offices and their perks, while making minimum wage. 

I have been here 8 months and watched my boss hire employee after employee; when I asked if he would convert me, he said he wouldn't even consider it till January of this year. That's how low value I am. 

I am in my early 30s. This year another birthday passed and all I could think is - the women I went to school with are settled in long term careers, probably making mid to high 5 figures, and have never been without health insurance. Including girlfriends who temped in my city - in 2012. 

I know my flaws. I come at 10, 10:15, and stay till 6:15-6:30. It's tolerated. No matter how early I wake up - the sick thing is I'm so fucking tired and out of it I just...go slower (and then spend the rest of the morning on bathroom trips once the coffee starts passing through, thanks to IBS. I'm an adult paranoid about being trapped on a subway and pissing myself or worse).  It takes longer just for the glow of the computer while I check weather or email for my eyes to unblur. 

It's ruined my life. I know how fucking weak and stupid I sound. I think so too. My life now revolves around taking a shit and covering my acne in time to come at 10.


That's enough to have rendered me unemployable.

I'm not very attractive; I am a nervous smiler; but unlike the other offices I was in, where the contempt from upper management was open, this one seems to like me enough and more, I have grown attached to my coworkers.

They all know I am a temp (except one or two, I think). It's fucking humiliating. I never told them I still was. That's enough, when these people are in their early 20s, were hired out of college - as one should be, as I never was, losing 10 years to horrible menial jobs, ""self employment"", and grad school in childhood ed (so much unpaid work!). 

I can picture these people looking at my timecards, looking at the budget....

Even when my (young) direct supervisors were happy with my work and knew I worked hard, the actual directors pass me over. 

In the 10 years since I have graduated from college, I'll admit it - I never learned a skill that is valuable enough to make me permanent. I have no master's. 

When I interview for permanent jobs, because my entire resume is  temp work - I wish I could describe the disgust, the absolute confusion, followed by phony smiles of repulsion I receive - from companies that hire temps. Often temps like me, actually. From companies that know they don't want to hire me but an HR person has to seem like they're looking for candidates, who call me in, humiliate me, and then dress me down even when I have the actual experience they're looking for.

I worked for a year as an intern with no pay part time, just to get office experience; this is now my third year as a temp. It's felt like 10, psychologically and physically. It might as well be - I know I'm ugly and older and people can tell I'm not fresh from college. 

I never interned, too stupid, too ill, and too poorly performing a student; I took classes in summer and barely stayed afloat during the year. I graduated with a 3.0 and didn't kill myself. Those are the two accomplishments I have to show for my entire worthless existence. 

In 2019, the horrible offices that offered my friends 12/hour in 2012 now offer people like me...14/hour. 15/hour. No benefits. Contracts lasting...three days, two weeks, a month, six months with no hope of conversion. That's when things work out and there's no abuse (I shared a project with one coworker, got blamed for her mistakes, and was fired when she was.)

Nobody sees me. I watch the debates, I bookmark links on the social divide, on the public option, on millennial downward economic mobility....and the truth is, nobody gives two fucks about the long term unemployed/underemployed. Nobody in the political landscape.

When you are a long term temp or an older long-term unemployed (and thus unemployable - human garbage to employees), especially of the ""unskilled"" or lower skilled kind - nobody sees you. Nobody gives a fuck about you. You're bad; you're garbage; if you weren't, you wouldn't be a temp. 

Day after day, even when times are fat, I think of the companies (including the one before this - once again, an ERP software/data management project) where I was fired and 20-somethings fresh out of college were made an offer in six months. My direct manager left the company the week before the contract ended. 

My direct manager/supervisor did here too. 

It isn't just the untold and horrible humiliations of chatting up employees (as they are - I'm not!) and befriending them, trying not to think of their six figure salaries and the careers *they've had*, what they know, who have been mentored, and what they had the power to do - I have to smile and be nice to upper managers who have the utmost contempt for me, go to industry events that have no effect on me...


I drown in a sea of bad faith, fear, and contempt. I have swallowed it and internalized it. How can you not hate people who are employing you under conditions that prove unions are dead, that exist with the understanding you don't deserve the most basic dignities of labor?  All I have to show for my life is a college degree. My great dream was to work for public advocacy - now my dream is a permanent office job with a path and health insurance. Not even that is in the future - I am the sole person responsible for Salesforce in my office. There are no mentors and no teammates to guide me. My function is an afterthought.

 I live in awe of people who had ""stupid"" majors in college and now work for Fortune 500 companies or - more amazingly - got hired in the field of their choice. Creative fields; advocacy. Who are talented and competent. 

I think on some level I never pictured that for myself - I liked studying the work, the successes and accomplishment and writing, of others who were. I wish I could describe how that feels, too.

I have no identity or life apart from being physically ground to dust by work and commuting and all things related to work, really - shopping for work clothes and dress shoes and things that will make me less disgusting-looking to the men in my office; going to my doctor for adult acne for the same (I have not seen a psychiatrist for drugs in a year, because I am on an add-on and have no mental health coverage). It's so silly pursuing healthcare when you think about suicide 24/7 but hey, I have to be employed until I'm actually ready to kill myself right?

Every day I think to myself, I generate no revenue, I have no use - to anybody. When I walk through my city and imagine startups and glamorous media companies and prestigious massive multinational investment management/PE firms...I am...filth. 

There is the employed world - the chosen - and then there are people like me, whom ""job creators"" see as actual garbage, or temporary pieces of furniture they resent renting. 

When I was 19 I seriously thought of hanging myself because I couldn't picture getting through a workday, I was so unhappy and so ill.

Now at 30, smiling into the faces of hiring managers who's withered smiles meet my own with barely-concealed disgust and indifferent, I think to myself - in my failures, my weakness, my stupidity, my worthlessness (if only to them - but what's the difference, when these are the people that have power over my entire existence?) - I exceeded my worst nightmares. 

And the years pass, and I hope to be hired, or I update my resume fruitlessly, knowing as soon as I explain the work was temp, interviewers for jobs - *including temp jobs* - will mentally put my resume in the garbage. 

Nobody sees me. Nobody gives a fuck. And if you're out of college for a certain age or can't afford to go and have no valued experience or path to employment -nobody gives a fuck about you, either.


Obama made a great speech about labor, urging Congress to pass it - one of the things he said is, you are not alone.

...But you are. In capitalism, you are. In the sharing economy, in the age of the ""lean office"", where ""trimming the fat"" means enabling the explosion of horrible staffing agencies that exist to get rich off of hopeless pieces of shit like me, pocketing my wages, my benefits, while I'm expected to have a certain software experience, be an expert on sales forecasting reporting (despite never, ever been shown anything but the work to do my own projects - low value, menial - trained shittily instead of being trained to be kept or to acquire transferable skills), and have a college degree to make 15/hour with no health insurance and no retirement benefits - you, temp/contractor - you're alone. Nobody in elected office thinks any of this is a problem at all. 

They'll cry and plead and fight one another to suckle Jeff Bezos' cock with tax breaks so he can set gentrification of whatever city he sets up shop into overdrive (and hire temps!) instead. 

Sorry this is a book. I hate myself because these people make me hate myself, and because if I were stronger, less worthless, less stupid, and less **fucking weak** - I would have enrolled in graduate school in the hopes of redeeming the years I blew as an undergrad. Tried to intern, tried to finally gain the degree to be deemed ""useful"".

510,"Exercise: If government housing was available to all, would people choose their careers/jobs differently?","Imagine if, once reaching the age of 30, you get allocated a government house where rent is calculated as 25% percent of your income.

The house is small-to-medium sized, enough to comfortably house a small family, well-insulated, and bare. You don't choose exactly which house you get, you state your desired area code and they try to assign a house in that area code, otherwise they try the next nearest area code.

1) You could either live in it forever (but when you pass away they take the house back and pass it on to another citizen.)

2) Or, you can stay in it for as long as it takes to save up for your own house.

3) If you want to move house butt stay on the system you have to give up your house to, go back to private renting, and put yourself back on the waiting list again with the new desired area code.

511,System is rigged against me,"I live with my fucked up parents.

My mom is sometimes okay, but yells at me and my brother for no reason when she's in a bad mood.

My dad is very similar.

One thing they have in common is their abuse when I don't do well in school, then they treat me like I'm a burden and a problem and a piece of shit, can't have a 2 minute conversation with them without them saying something negative school related.

That made me suicidal and I made a decision to become a hunter in order to get a licence to be able to own guns and similar weapons, so I could easily kill myself.

However, right now I'm unable to do that (I'm not 18 yet). 

So my plan for my future was to finish high school and find some disgusting 9-5 job that pays shit so I can rent a room to get away from my parents.

The problem with that is the fact that I can't possibly both work and attend university (I can but then I wouldn't make enough to afford food and clothes), which means that I would be stuck in a situation where I can't make more than below average wages for the rest of my life.

So it's either- live in hell for at least 6 more years so that later I could earn more, or 1 more year of hell and then a lifetime of being almost poor.

520,"Whatever, pleb.","This is an old story but it was a formative experience in my political development. 

15 years ago I was chosen by a temporary staffing agency to fill a role in the head office of a big corporation based in Toronto. The commute was about 30-45 minutes because I worked a flexible schedule and could come in and leave super early. I worked there for a little under a year, got to know people, felt like I was part of the team and that I belonged there.

The manager was a two-faced slimeball who would throw someone under the bus for whatever reason but it was pretty well known that if you asked him about his kids he would treat you like a friend. 

Then one day this manager gets an assistant manager who will take his place someday as he was getting promoted. This guy was even worse. He'd make you believe that he was on your side and then power trip you. 

He called me into his office one day, asked me how things are going real friendly like, and then tells me that he wants me to work 9 to 5 like most of the team. I asked him why and he said it was to better assist the full time staff, which was not my job. My job was to migrate data from one database to another. I told him this and about how much more gruelling my commute would be, and that I would really prefer to keep my schedule the way it was.

And doesn't this little shit smugly lean back in his chair, raise his arms, interlock his fingers, rest them behind his head and stare me down? You bet he did. I was a temp, he could get rid of me on a whim, he had all the power and he knew it. 

My commute went from 30-45 minutes to 60-90 minutes. 

Then a few months later the project was over and the temporary staff, 3 people including myself, were let go.

527,I can't seem to get away from certain manager types.,"I jumped into the workforce when I was 15 years old. I knew I needed to save some money for a car in 3 years, so I started washing dishes. Right out of college I worked at a non profit that was amazing. The hours we great, pay was fair, flex scheduling, real summer hours. I was spoiled, but I had to move on to make a higher wage, and gain more experience. I've run into some of the worst people managers I've ever met in the last year. I'm currently at my 3rd job since April, and am getting ready to leave again.  
  
My current problem: My brother and his wife are having a child within the next few days, first baby among my siblings so far. It was known when I started here in October.  
  
I go to my current boss (1 of them) and tell them they can expect that I'll be leaving early one of the next few days to help my brother get through this process. (Take his dogs out, feed them, etc.) Now I must have too high of expectations, but I said I will come in early, and take a shorter lunch and let her know when I'll be leaving. The response... ""You're going to leave as close to the end of the day as possible.""  
  
My wife wants me to be more positive, but these types of people in positions of authority have taken their toll. I'm going to leave when I need to leave, no matter what, but I want to know.

Is explained here, Millennials tend to work only the minimum time expected--and will
push for flexibility and a reduced work schedule to create more time for other
pursuits. Being demanding about when and how they want to do their job can be
viewed as disrespectful. A great way to look at how some employers feel is the way
the dysfunctional phone/cable companies work. It's annoying when they announce
they can come out only on a certain day. They can't tell you what time, and then they
say they'll call the day of and give you a four-hour window when they'll arrive. While
the phone/cable companies have us wrapped, employers don't feel the same about
Millennials. They'll fire the Millennial worker and find someone who can work when
they need them to--and without the attitude.

The idea of continuing on at this job just so I can comfortably get to and from work, and have shelter, and the monotony my day to day prolonged seems absolutely insane. So I did the only sane thing and reduced hours so that I could better cultivate my free time, but so far it hasn’t been nearly enough as I’ve been helping fill hours up through the holidays. 

Sadly, I’ve always wanted to work in the film industry but it’s filled with smoke and mirrors and I feared going into debt for a career with no guarantees. I wanted to teach but the more I learn about this shady world the more I want to rebel against it. Now maybe that’s the kind of teacher some of the youth needs right now. I know I’d be able to help guide and inspire but it’s gonna take me years and possibly lots of money to get to the point where I’m qualified to teach literature/English at the high school level. 

But I can’t stand just continuing on without TRYING to go for things that might actually make me feel like getting out of bed in the mornings. It’s no good for the soul to be filled with so much cognitive dissonance, like I know work is bad for me but I continue to go out of fear.

I want to live out of a van, actually utilize my time on enjoying all this world has to offer while I’m here, I just can’t feel great about slowly watching my savings wither away until I’m forced back into wage slavery with no better career options because I’ve been off the grid for a year or two (if I’m lucky and my savings got me that far). It’s just a temporary fix for the long term problem - life is starting to feel utterly hopeless. 

Maybe I can freelance as I go, sounds fun right? Everyone suggests it I mean, but do they ever consider the catch 22 aspect of how you need experience to get jobs, and how you cant get jobs with no experience. Or the gross personal marketing on social media that’s attached with “making it”. 

I sound super defeatist right now so thanks for sticking with me this far. Truthfully I wish we could start a sustainable community where the members worked on projects within our goals for renovation. Make sure we all have proper shelter, food, water and then from there we would be free to work or not work as we see fit. I want to work on music, movies and art, and I don’t need a fucking profit as reason to do it. 

Anyway, 2020 is on the horizon and I feel like I’m years away from being where I want to be and it seems like everyday I read reports on how our time left is bottlenecking. I’m ready to just head for the hills and plan as I go but somehow that feels like giving up. It’ll be like I’m actively rooting for things to get worse or I’ll be forced to return to a life of mediocrity in wage slavery. 

One thing is clear, business as usual is on its last legs for me.

I tell them I really tried (it's no lie I actually tried very hard) to get hired but noone will hire me because I need experience to make more experience, but how can I start making experience if I don't have it?

So they tell me they won't hire me because, guess what, I don't have enough experience. 

Kafkeusque, isn't it?

The horrible part about this experience loop is it gets worse with age, it is like snowball phenomena.

570,I have to find a job again and I'm fretting over it...,"I'm only 23 and I've been working as a software engineer for only 3 years, yet I'm already severely burnt out. 4 months ago my hatred towards spending my life on doing what my manager orders me to got so bad that I just quit without a notice. I had some savings, but now I'm running low on what was supposed to be my down payment money. So, inevitably it's time for me to humiliate myself once again and start applying for jobs. The problem is that I started to suffer from some sort of a mental blockage. The mere thought of working is making me want to throw up. It's not even programming itself, because I spent a lot of time on my hobby projects and I enjoyed it, it's all of the bullshit surrounding IT industry recently. I may exaggerate a bit, but I really think that work environment is just sick and hostile for an average developer. Some examples of how work methodologies are getting out of hand:
- Daily stand up: all employees have to stand up in line for 5 - 10 minutes in the morning and list things they worked on the previous day. Standing is supposed to simply make people quick, but in every company I worked for it more resembled enforcing military-style lineup drill while convincing everyone that I didn't dare to waste company time. Huge waste of time, I really don't need to know what everyone was working on.
- Logging time, I had to log everything I spent more than 15 minutes on.
- Demo sessions / retrospectives: more explaining myself, wasting everyone's time. In small teams it's usually known who's working on what, yet by forcing employee to explain themself again and prove they're productive, the employee is once again micromanaged.

It's literally every fucking company these days. I could go on and on about that. It's unbearable, I would often spend more time in meetings than at my desk. And remote jobs (at least the one that I had) are not much better. Constant control and micromanagment. I don't know if it's only specific for programming jobs. I was thinking of switching to system administration hoping it would be more peaceful. 

I have to somehow force myself to find some work, preferably part time (those jobs are very scarce though) and keep it for three months. Then, once I get permanent contract I'll fake and illness and get a sick leave. In my country there's no such thing as limited sick leave time, so I think of bumming for another few months. I really need this time to figure my next steps, and unfortunately abusing the system seems to be the most convenient option.

586,Are ethical jobs gone,"OK, those who read my last posts know I work in the flavour industry.

Since I can't ask my question on Linkedin because it would look suspicious for a large number of bootlickers, I'd ask here instead : **are there still ethical jobs out there, in this outrageous world?** Like jobs where I won't realise I'm fucking up my life and the life of multiple people by just following my mission orders.

This is a multi-level question... In reality, I'd need to try my luck in a whole new career, right? I'm calling for some change because I don't have a passion for my customer's products, right? Because the food industry, whoa, so terribly wrong right now. But then anxieties are raised :

* Can't code because the nefarious effects of IA, also because of a high rate of pollution caused by the mere existence of Internet. I'm using social networks tho, sue me.
* Can't approach another industry (clothing, music, etc.) because it also bears ethical issues
* Can't approach a high-level standard because of, well, life? So I will have to scale down my income whatever I choose (I have a Masters degree as of currently). I cannot live my current life and also become a student for a long period of time.
* Can't start being self-employed because I ain't knowing shit about how to be a company owner, and I don't really want to deal with all the sales and marketing strategies.

...We don't need to make this thread only, about me of course.

For me, examples of useful and underpaid jobs include : nursing, teaching, garbage-collecting.

I stop by the Dollar General during the *very* generous 30 minute lunch break my wagemasters grant me during my 12 hour shift. I'm waiting in line to pay for my purchase, and this dude carrying a bag of Takis and an Arizona tea just strolls right out from an aisle, passes right by the cashier, and leaves. The cashier, some 50+ year old grandmotherly type (if your grandmother was a heavy smoker/drinker) goes B-E-Z-E-R-K, runs from behind the counter and chases the guy outside. I crane my neck to watch, and the dude already made it into his shitty little car, and this cashier is tugging on the door handle trying to force it open. The dude peels out, causing the cashier to stumble and nearly eat pavement, as she was still clutching the door handle. He gets away and she's out there screaming and giving the car a double 🖕🖕. 

She came back in, all sweaty and nervous, apologized and cashed us all out. This lady basically risking life and limb, because who the hell knows if that guy would have shot her, hit her, or ran her over, all for about 4$ worth of junk good, while she herself probably makes about $8 an hour, if that.

594,Aubade by Phillip Larkin,"I work all day, and get half-drunk at night.   

Waking at four to soundless dark, I stare.   

In time the curtain-edges will grow light.   

Till then I see what’s really always there:   

Unresting death, a whole day nearer now,   

Making all thought impossible but how   

And where and when I shall myself die.   

Arid interrogation: yet the dread

Of dying, and being dead,

Flashes afresh to hold and horrify.


The mind blanks at the glare. Not in remorse   

—The good not done, the love not given, time   

Torn off unused—nor wretchedly because   

An only life can take so long to climb

Clear of its wrong beginnings, and may never;   

But at the total emptiness for ever,

The sure extinction that we travel to

And shall be lost in always. Not to be here,   

Not to be anywhere,

And soon; nothing more terrible, nothing more true.


This is a special way of being afraid

No trick dispels. Religion used to try,

That vast moth-eaten musical brocade

Created to pretend we never die,

And specious stuff that says No rational being

Can fear a thing it will not feel, not seeing

That this is what we fear—no sight, no sound,   

No touch or taste or smell, nothing to think with,   

Nothing to love or link with,

The anaesthetic from which none come round.


And so it stays just on the edge of vision,   

A small unfocused blur, a standing chill   

That slows each impulse down to indecision.   

Most things may never happen: this one will,   

And realisation of it rages out

In furnace-fear when we are caught without   

People or drink. Courage is no good:

It means not scaring others. Being brave   

Lets no one off the grave.

Death is no different whined at than withstood.


Slowly light strengthens, and the room takes shape.   

It stands plain as a wardrobe, what we know,   

Have always known, know that we can’t escape,   

Yet can’t accept. One side will have to go.

Meanwhile telephones crouch, getting ready to ring   

In locked-up offices, and all the uncaring

Intricate rented world begins to rouse.

The sky is white as clay, with no sun.

Work has to be done.

597,I spoke with my old manager last night,"I worked for her a few years ago, and honestly I swear she was the best boss I've ever had.

We worked in a chain hair salon, all of us had to work 40+ hours a week as we didn't hire part-time.

If one of us called in sick, she said ""get better and get your rest we will see you when you're well!"". If one of us hadn't eaten yet she would tell us ""take a break and I'll take over (cleaning, sweeping, ECT) while you eat."" If we had something we wanted off work for she did her best to help us get off for that day (I honestly don't remember her ever rejecting an off request).

I remember one Sunday it was just her and I working and we were SWAMPED, we were both on a client and our salon phone rang, it was my mom calling saying dad was having problems breathing and they were taking him to the ER. I told my boss and she said ""GO! I'll finish up your cut don't worry you need to go!""

I rushed to the ER, later that night I messaged my boss to let her know he had had a mild stroke but was doing better but I might be a little late the next day, she told me ""WHAT?!? Stay home and watch over Papa, if anyone has a problem with you not showing up (meaning our higher management) they can talk to me."" 

She always had our back with things like that. A few months later tho, we got a new district manager who turned our salon into Hell. We all ended up leaving the company, including my boss. 

I saw her last night and she asked about the family, I asked her about hers and I could see the sadness in her eyes. She told me she gotten a new job at a salon in the city and she was way overworked. She said her daughter (we all called her Lil Sis) was in a beauty pageant and she had to miss it, she got to get her hair done by her mom and leave for the pageant while her mom worked. She said she BEGGED her manager for over two months to get the day off, and she still didn't.

It broke my heart a little seeing her not get the same treatment she gave us. She was the boss that actually thought your family was her family. She was the boss that believed your health came before the company. She was the boss that would let you clock out and go home if you were throwing up, instead of saying ""get it together!"". She was the boss that let a coworker leave early when her sister went into early labor. She was the boss that would buy you lunch with her tip money if she knew you were having a slow day with no tips. She was the boss that wouldn't complain you were 15 minutes late because the car rider line at your son's school was backed out like crazy. She was the best boss I've ever had, I am just wishing she could find another place.",False,ea5my5,lagatoazul,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ea5my5/i_spoke_with_my_old_manager_last_night/,6,1

I work as a team with 1 other person doing quite a niche job within the work place, both doing around 50 hours each. When I say niche, I mean only 3 members including myself are trained on it. Anyway, since working here I got carpal tunnel syndrome. I'm very young and not pregnant, its very abnormal for me to have it but here we are. Turns out it's VERY work related, and it can't start healing until I stop what I'm doing for at least 6 weeks. 

I talked to them and they asked if I still had a future at the company? I said yes, I love my job, I don't want to stop doing it but at the same time I need to heal my injury, which I got from here. I asked for either time off (6 weeks is a bit much I know) or to place me elsewhere where I don't strain my wrists as much. But since they're so understaffed they refuse this and tell me either I carry on working or they find somebody to replace me permanently. 

I've given so much of myself to this job. I have absolutley no social life or time to myself to do anything I enjoy. My shifts are 10-12 hours spanning across 10am to pm most days I work. And yet they're ready to dispose of me if I refuse to put aside my physical health.

Enjoy (my mother’s a nice lady just very out of touch) 




Let me put this in perspective for you: it’s batshit crazy for me to be concerned about bees being on the verge of extinction, not bc I love &amp; care about bees I fucking hate bugs, you know that. It’s simple, they’re unanimously considered the most important living creature on the entire planet. Life is delicate, if they die out huge portions of humans will slowly suffer and die. It’s not keeping me up at night, but I don’t understand how I’m suppose to go about life like everything is ok? I feel a sense of urgency to experience life now before it’s too late. That’s just ONE major issue. I wish I could block all this shit out so I could be ignorant &amp; content, but it’s just not in my nature. We had a billionaire get exposed for being a sex offender, who was then killed by other billionaires to keep their global child sex trafficking ring under wraps. These same demented fucks basically control our government policies, they’re exhausting this planet of all it’s resources and polluting the fuck out of it to get as rich/powerful as possible. With the amount of money these people have they can literally do w/e the fuck they want. So guess what, when shit hits the fan due to their greed, corruption, and manipulation of the masses, they’ll be the only ones who don’t have to suffer and deal w it.

613,The cool kids left the company I work for in 2019,"I work for a small pr firm that represents a niche industry in a big U.S. city. 

So 3 coworkers, who I will name A, B, and C, decided to leave the company throughout 2019, for different reasons. A has worked for the company 5 years and left to deal with a new baby. B, who spent 6 years, left the company and pr industry completely and did a 180 on her career, and C, who worked there roughly 4 years, is leaving right before Christmas for a new pr job but with a different focus. That leaves me, who worked for 2 going on 3 years, and Skippy, who will celebrate his 1 year work anniversary soon. Skippy was hired to replace A, and Boomer boss decided not to hire anyone new for B's seat. 

Between my Boomer boss, who owns the company, and Older-than-Boomer-Silent Gen office mgr, Skippy, and myself, we are going to be soooo screwed this coming year, and all I can think of is how I wished I had bailed last year, but kinda glad, I didn't  because I had personal drama with my brokedown car and stuff that has done nothing but continued into the new year. All the while, I'm bored and unmotivated at work, and ready to move on from the company or do something new within the company.

C's exit would be a great opportunity to promote Skippy and have me sit in Skippy's JR level seat, but looks like boss is dead set on hiring someone new for C's spot. 

100% legit my job shouldn't exist and only does because how tech illiterate my Boss and Office Mgr are, and how slow my boss is willing to change. You try to teach her something new and depending on her mood, she has a mini meltdown. and Office Mgr works only part-time, so on days she's not there I take over front office duties like: answering the phone (mainly junk calls), receiving packages and mail, and occasionally directing confused UBER Eats/Door Dash people. Other than that I update the website, send placements as pdfs to clients, do social media, archive placements for our records, and whatever odd jobs or support the team needs. Like proofreading or whatever. 

Guess, I'll finally get passionate about job searching again...I'll just need a few months worth of checks saved before I do. 

I'm not angry at any of my coworkers for leaving. I wish them well, and wish I could go with them.

I posted earlier today about really just wanting to quit both for my mental health and due to hating my current position in middle management bitch work. 

I arrived 30 minutes late for my shift and sat at my desk weighing the pros and cons of quitting. I slowly drafted a resignation letter. It stated:

To whom it may concern,

I \[redacted\] hereby resign effective immediately. 

I sat and reread it for what felt like an eternity, I didn't want to put in two weeks because I knew deep down I'd find some justification to stay and be miserable. Emailed the letter to my boss. Was stopped on my way out the door by my coworker and told her bye, to which she wanted to whine about how :it screws them"" and that it ""was selfish and I should have just gotten mental help and blah blah what was she going to do about these upcoming parties blah blah"", I interrupted and said ""then fucking quit too, because you know nothing is going to change here. You're being used just like I was.""

I used to get nervous or excited for new jobs, but I just felt a tired dread about going to orientation (two hours of lesson modules) and then about my actual first day. I'm working customer service, it's basically a nonstop line of returns and online pickups, behind a desk with a few other people. I worked for only four hours and didn't take a break, but I was hot and kind of thirsty. And I like retail, I like people, but just those four hours killed me a little inside. I'm on a probation period because I'm seasonal and we are allowed three absence strikes before we have a meeting to figure out what the issue is, and this morning I was having a mental battle over using one. I felt exhausted, and nervous about going in again--I threw myself into the work. Would I have the energy today to do the same? Would I end up crying and hiding in the back? My partner has been using my car so I've been Ubering, which is also a pain. I just couldn't get out of bed. I lost the mental battle. I called in and spoke to a manager and told her I was up all night with a stomach virus and wanted to know how to get a cover. She said it was too short notice but that she'd let the team know. She sounded disappointed, but what if I really was sick? Is it fair to be disappointed at a sick person for not being physically able to come into work? In a way, it was a test. A stupid and risky one that'll cost me a few hours pay, but I wanted to see what their reaction would be. That's capitalism for you. Or maybe I'm just shitty, idk. I'd be pissed too if a new person called out their second day. I just don't know how capable I am of functioning in this world anymore, at these types of jobs.",False,e9nqbo,superkickerjess,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/e9nqbo/i_began_a_new_job_yesterday/,2,1

640,The Conquest of Bread Excerpt,"In virtue of this monstrous system, the son of the worker, on entering life, finds no field which he may till, no machine which he may tend, no mine in which he may dig, without accepting to leave a great part of what he will produce to a master. He must sell his labour for a scant and uncertain wage. His father and his grandfather has toiled to drain this field, to build this mill, to perfect this machine. They gave to the work the full measure of their strength, and what more could they give?


But their heir comes into the world poorer than the lowest Savage. If he obtains leave to till the fields, it is on condition of surrendering a quarter of the produce to his master, and another quarter to the government and middle man. And this tax, levied upon him by the State, the capitalist, the lord of the manor, and the middleman, is always increasing; it rarely leaves him the power to improve his system of culture.


If he returns to industry, he is allowed to work-though not always even that-only on condition that he yield a half or two-thirds of the product to him whom the land recognizes as the owner of the machine.

641,Upper managers are they of any use at all?," 1st project I was part of at my job was a 100% success. My supervisor and senior project manager had very little participation in the project as he argued with the original manager at the project, who left, and dumped the management to an engineer who by accident got a dual role of SWE and manager. My supervisor admitted  that this was the first project that had such success. In my opinion this was because an actual engineer with technical background did the management. Also because the engineer was my age the project flowed in a  very relaxed way. Totally slacking off AND doing all tasks on time. We made all the decisions so we made them in a way that we did our lives easier, while completing the project targets. No pointless meetings no stressing out with appearance over technical details. 

2nd project we have a ""real"" manager as we should in the first one. His only interest is looking good to the higher ups including the my supervisor/senior project manager.

1) Pointless meetings. Twice a week. Check

2) Stressing over powerpoints to the point that I do more powerpoints or paper work for the project than tech. Check.

3) Having an opinion on technical aspect while clearly he doesn't even have the minimum background. Check.

4) Because of (3) we get into paths that are dead-ends and we have to work more. Check.

5) I am suspecting that he dumps his work load on us on some of the paperwork. Check.

6) Moral of the team is low. No one cares anymore. Everyone is doing the bare minimum. I am considering in transferring officially to another project where the engineer from my first project does the management (Unofficially I work for that but because there is no much work for me there I do both)

I wonder how the project will end up compared with my 1st one. The director of the company has admitted that there are management problems, however I believe that weird culture is mostly because of him.",False,e956mt,CyberDumb,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/e956mt/upper_managers_are_they_of_any_use_at_all/,7,1

649,How should I approach me quitting my job due to workplace bullying?," Long story short, for the last 3 weeks my boss did a 180 in her behaviour towards me and 100% excludes me from everything. At first, she wouldn't respond my texts about work, so I mostly spoke to the secretary about things because she clearly didn't want to talk to me. Now that we are approaching the end of the year, she didn't include me in Secret Santa, only the other teachers (I teach at a language school). She didn't include my students nor told me about ""ice cream day"" (something she does occasionally to celebrate holidays), which is basically distributing ice cream to the students. Last tuesday, she took me out of my class to lecture me about going to the secretary for things instead of her, saying ""who is your boss? me or her?"". She was extremely hysteric and I'm very anxious so I started shaking in fear. She told me ""we will have a serious conversation next week"". But I don't want to have a conversation, I just wanna quit my job and never see her face again, but she acts like she doesn't have time to talk to me. I'm 100% sure that I want to quit but I'm also EXTREMELY anxious about the whole thing because she is very unpredictable. How should I quit? Should I be direct and leave? Or should I adress her bullying?

650,Finally quit my miserable detailing job,"For the better part of a year I’ve been detailing cars and was promoted to a supervisor a few months ago. I’ll admit at first I loved the job (I just loved back to this place after years and was starting to make friends/money after being constantly broke) and the freedom of it (take a break whenever, eat whenever, just get the cars done). Problem is it just got worse and worse.. my mental health deteriorated for multiple reasons, personal and general. 
My main issue was time. Yes we could take a break whenever but you could easily be coerced out of it by a busy car pile up. I should’ve just left every time, granted my bosses would have shit to say. So no we didn’t actually get to take a break whenever. If it’s a weekend or a sale (and believe me THEY KEEP BUYING CARS) you’re fucked. I have lost so much weight because I couldn’t sit down for one meal despite running around for rig he hours a day. And just to put the cherry on top a dealer will bring a RAM 35 fucking 00 at 8 at night and if it’s new, best believe you’ll have to do it if the manager doesn’t want to be stuck with it the next morning, because consequently you’ll have to pick up even more slack. My grandmother is dying. I’m only 19 and we’re in a fucking collapse. Time is precious.
Next up was the social aspect, most workers can relate too. I work in a very male dominated field so sexual harassment was a given from the jump. From bosses to dealers to mechanics. Groping, lewd language, uncomfortable stares. And every person you talked to you knew it was just so they could fuck. I have been explicitly asked to fuck in a car repeatedly by married men with kids despite purposefully showing no interest. And what’s worse is when they start rating the few girls that work there and how purely objectifying is. I never tended to think about their opinions but hearing the shit they’d say behind me and other girls backs definitely took a toll on my self esteem..

My girlfriend, while I love her dearly, loves her job and always has had applying for things go smoothly and bosses make life easy for her, even when she is overworked from other things. She doesn’t understand hating work and how draining it is to feel like a failure and dread everyday.

My current job is very banal, work is slow and soul crushingly dull. I do have free time and yet, every day i dread working. I’m paid below market average, the bosses only focus on new people who get all the interesting work, and i’m left just waiting on replies to applications and commiserating with other dissatisfied coworkers (who now have left and been replaced). Everything feels so futile especially because i feel like a job i would find satisfaction in is a fantasy others have created.

689,Just got fired for no reason (long post),"So this is mostly just a rant because I'm fucking mad as all hell, but it's also a reminder that your boss and your managers are never your friends. 

I worked for a big insurance company in Canada at one of their call centers (I'm opening up a case with the Better Business Bureau and the Humans Rights Board so I'm not gonna name names rn, sorry) 

I got hired through a temp agency along with everyone else on my team so no benefits, but the job was 17.50 an hour- less than the 20 an hour you need to actually live in this city but way more than the 12-15 bucks an hour I'd been getting at other places for the same work. The environment seemed nice, I loved my coworkers and there was even free coffee. My manager even talked about how she'd started as a temp and how she hoped to have us all made permanent by the time our contract ended. 
Shit seemed good.

About 5 months go by and shit's mostly great; coworkers continue to be super cool people, my stats and customer reviews are excellent and I'm even someone who my coworkers ask for help with stuff.  But I noticed that there were certain things I would get picked on for by my manager that no one else would, things like minor swearing in casual conversation, saying I was doing my job well but that I wasn't ""going above and beyond"" enough and even marking technical errors that were out of my control against me.

I brought it up with my coworkers and they agreed with me that it was odd as they weren't receiving criticism despite doing the same things. I just got a very strong impression that my manager did not like me as a person and it had nothing to do with my quality of work, especially since my numbers were good and I know that- we get regularly weekly emails keeping us updated on that.

It might be relevant to mention that I am a lesbian and was very much ""out"" at the office (I'm usually not but I became pretty good friends with my coworkers so I felt safe being open about it) I honestly don't know if I got mistreated because of that or just because she disliked me or if she disliked me because I'm gay or what, just mentioning it for possible context I guess.


Anyways I figure- like a dumbass- that my work is good enough that I'm probably fine regardless of her personal feelings towards me. We have weekly ""coaching"" with our managers as well and my feedback this week was generally positive.

She took me aside and fired me the next day part way through my shift. Brought up that I'd been seen on my phone during my break at my desk (in theory you're supposed to use your phone only out in the hall. No one follows this rule. She doesn't follow this damn rule and neither do any of my coworkers.) and that was it. 
She even insinuated I should be grateful that she was firing me in person over halfway through my shift because ""Usually we just let your temp agency call and tell you, but I wanted to let you know""

I just laughed in her face. 
Who the fuck fires someone with no warning and no real justification during the fucking holidays and expects fucking GRATITUDE for it???

There's way more shit I could say and might say in the comments but yeah, I'm pissed and I feel like a dumbass for letting myself  think that maybe shit was actually stable and that the place gave half a fuck about treating their employees well. Bosses are not your friends and neither are management.

Sorry for the rant and thanks to anyone who bothered to read through it",False,eap7x8,IJustBeGoinThroughIt,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/eap7x8/just_got_fired_for_no_reason_long_post/,13,1

691,A Brief Discussion Between Manager and I,"Today my manager(not owner of company, who I do really really personally like) sort of sat down and asked me that as part of the company, I need to be more like the rest of the team and do more work in the Southern region of our area. We have an office in both the Northern and Southern part of the county, and I live and work in the Northern one. 

She told me, everyone else sometimes has to go down there and drive crazy amounts (1+ hours) of (unpaid) time to do a teeny (30 mins) of paid work, it's just part of the job. 

I responded to her with, ""I understand what you're saying, but unless it's in my current contract for me to drive to those cities to do less than 3 hours of unpaid work, I will not be going. In the beginning of my time here at (insert company), I did that quite a lot and was not doing well financially. I should not have been doing it then, and will not be doing it now."" To which she sort of shrugged and accepted that. 

The more I think about it, I have felt as though maybe I should have let up more. Then I remember that she, and everyone else at that company (as I'm the ""lower"" tier person) but then remembered that everyone else there makes about 2-5 times as much as I do.

They are asking me to do this, because they are being extremely picky with hiring a badly needed new person to fully staff the company. The ""lower"" tier person and I have been struggling for months with the workload and asking for someone else. Now, I'm totally fine with what I told her today and am glad for standing up for my bank account and my personal time.",False,eadzzn,221gp,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/eadzzn/a_brief_discussion_between_manager_and_i/,3,1

693,"""Cutting Hours""","Idiots. I have posted here before and if anyone remembers me, the highlight of my posts are that my job holds shitty $13/hr pay over our heads all the time. Well I hate working, but I had enough money to eat and save and give me a sliver of hope. I was actually getting mandatory OT of 50ish+ hours for awhile. But now ""as you all know"" they will be cutting hours as the big retailer/manufacturing seasons end after black friday/thanksgiving/christmas and basically I went from a typical 50 hour week to 12-20 hours. What the fuck is that!? I am being paid poverty wages despite being ""A premium employer in this area"" and when I finally begin to get ahead on my finances they fuck me sideways. Thought about taking a second job (again) but I can't get myself to deal with the balancing shit because as anyone who has had a second job already knows: It never works out the way they sell it to you. Usually ends in working an 8-10 hours day at job 1, just to go to job 2 for a 12 hour day 30 minutes after and you are expected to provide PEAK performance. I am seriously thinking about moving back with one of my family members to 1up this situation. I'm tired of these shitty low wage corporations forcing me to work when it benefits them, and then bending me over and fucking me. They know I live on my own and I wear shoes with holes in them and torn clothing and am usually frugal and they know by giving me 12-20 hours they are fucking me sideways and they DON'T CARE. Thankfully, I made stupid decisions when I was younger and purchased thousands of dollars of collectibles (in a certain category not to be named) and it was a dumb decision but I have been selling them online. I have enough collectibles for it to literally probably take a couple years to sell and I actually have became frustrated lately because I make more money selling things online than I do at my actual day job. The only problem is, I'm not a resale kingpin, and when my ""inventory"" runs out, then that's all I have to sell. I have proudly delivered subpar work at this workplace ever since being fucked around and forced to work OT and forced to stay after every night and forced to come in on days off. I've just had it with this crapola. I would LOVE a 12-20 hour work week...IF I WAS BEING PAID $50 AN HOUR. Maybe one day this will be the norm..but on the other hand maybe things are getting worse. It definitely doesn't help when shitty $13 per hour is a ""premium"" and other fuckers would sprint to work my job, which gives the company a lot of leverage to fuck you around.",False,eaik8m,SteamedattheBean,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/eaik8m/cutting_hours/,9,1

699,Bamboozled,"I’m pretty sure my friend and her coworkers were tricked. My friend works at a large hospital and were told to fill out a survey to gauge the level of morale. Of course, since management treats them like second-class citizens, they said that morale is low which made the higher-ups look very bad. So, in response to all of this, management makes my friend and her coworkers participate in some morale-building exercises. This is also known as “mandatory fun”. This includes bull shit slide show presentations, quasi-religious speeches (the hospital is owned by a group which follows an off-shoot of Christianity) and fun sing alongs. Because, what grown-ass adult doesn’t love sing-alongs? Anyways, to make a long story short-in order to avoid having to go through this corporate re-education again, my friend and her coworkers lied on the follow up morale survey. This, in turn, makes it look as though morale has improved thanks to the efforts of upper management even though this couldn’t be further from the truth. Upon hearing about all of this I couldn’t help but wonder if this was carefully orchestrated by my friend’s bosses from the get go and that they knew they’d lie on the follow-up morale survey in order to avoid having to go through all of that bull shit again.

715,"Ten years ago, I was a Mormon teenager who was taught to believe that work, family, and religion are the most important priorities in life. It's not true.","When I was a teenager (about 13), my Mormon family would bring me to work to assist the owner during the summer season. They worked in a factory called NowDisc that manufactured DVDs, CD-Roms, and Music CD's for people who hadn't yet heard of the Ipod. 

How much did I get paid for this work? Nothing. I worked for twelve hours a day in a hot factory alongside people who were far too skilled at rapidly sliding DVD covers into their plastic sheaths for $8/hr. 

The owner was Mormon and drove a luxury car. The management was Mormon, too, and all of us kids and teenagers, about six of us, were Mormon. For four weeks we worked day and night so that the cock-sucking Mormon CEO could afford to buy a larger factory in another part of state - leaving my adult Mormon family without a job.

This was the 2000's and we were working in a child sweat shop. In America. In a ""liberal"" city that's literally ranked the most livable city in the entire fucking United States. 

This wasn't the only job I did. I also cleaned up leaves at some closeted gay Mormon's tuxedo shop, dug trenches, worked two days straight assembling firework stands in the middle of the summer (these were two-day shifts without sleep), and now that I'm an adult, I'm supposed to go into a job and bust my ass for 40 hours a week just so that I can barely afford rent while I try to finish my college degree online (a useless fucking bachelor's that does nothing but gain me entrance to job interviews).

Yeah, online universities are charging thousands for information that can be freely found online. All universities should be free, and work, instead of being a means to survive, should serve the greater good of humanity and to fulfill our passions as intelligent, creative, free-thinking human beings.

738,"""does he work?"" Umm who cares?","When my husband and I first started dating and I was talking about him to my family they ask me if he was working he was not but I just said yes because I knew what mini shit Strom would get started if they found out I was dating a guy without a job. 

Now during that that I was working at Starbucks which was a pretty good job, I was living at home and the only bills I had to pay was my phone bill which was like 55 dollars and the internet which was like 65 dollars. I had no intention of getting married and wasn't going to move out for other couple months so I was providing for myself I didn't need anyone to help me or provide for me. So my new boyfriend not working ment nothing to me 

Even during my teens they would scold me for being with a guy that didn't have a job. That's all they care about and it was annoying back then as it is now. 

Now we are married and expecting our first child and he had a job that he got fired from for being like 10 minutes late. We both agreed that fast food/retail jobs wouldnt work with our plans so he is trying to find something that pays well, with a set schedule and can work with his record which is actually pretty hard to find even in the big city we live in (which is one of the criticism that my family has stated) 

My husband is a the best partner I've had, he makes me extremely happy and just brings the best out of me. I can't find the words to describe how much I love and care for him, but my family does not give two shits about that only that he isn't working. They never ask about my happiness  or a anything about my well-being while dating anyone they only put value on anyone (even my friends) from what they do for work.",False,e7fprl,dani_useless,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/e7fprl/does_he_work_umm_who_cares/,14,1

742,A guy i know hasnt been ever employed in his life and he always worked for himself cuz since college he knew that slaving for others is soul sucking existence,"This guy studied in college and he started to date a girl there, who was a painter. 


After sometime he looked at one of her friends, who commercialized his painting work and decided to do so as well for his gf. He made a website and started to advertise her service of making caricatures. It was around 9 years ago, when web sites wasnt as common and people were only getting into internet marketing and so on.


People ordered caricatures as a gift for birthdays, sometimes companies booked her for corporate events to come down and make caricatures whole day at the events and they'd make quite a bank on those orders. He basically was managing his gf and pushed her to work sometimes when she was slacking, but some work had to be done. 


He didnt like her realistically, but he realized it was better to stay with this gf even though he had other options, than live with some other woman, but break back for 40 hours a week and waste all money on rent. (His gf and him lived in her grand mother's flat, that was empty after her death.)



Also because he and his gf did a lot of drugs, they constantly had people hanging out at their flat, so pool of his contacts and his social skills grew by the day.


Then because he practiced table tennis in childhood and teenage years, he realized he had a big list of friends with whom he used to train and decided to open up a training club for teenagers and adults.


Made agreements with his semi to pro table tennis friends that they'd be coaching. Rented a place. Marketed the club services. People started to come, money started to flow.


Then he realized because demand was growing and he was succesfuly positioning club's services, he could sell equipment for trainings by himself. So he started booking equipment on wholesale terms straight from manufacturer and sell it and make huge profit on it.



And while doing both of the things above he started a tech project with his friend. Went around different exhibitions, confences, investment rounds and eventually found angel investor who put up 1 mil $ into them. He didnt become rich, he just paid himself normal wage out of that money (~2-3k a month). But now this tech product is about to blow up and make them millionaires.


It's all about small details in life. Did his parents not send him to table tennis practice when he was young, his club wouldnt exist now. 


Did he not meet that artist girl and had he been virgin incel, he'd not make that money.


Also important thing to notice that he is a jew, and these guys have insanely tight relations with all other jews all around the world. This ensured he had necesary contancts when he needed juridical assistance, when he needed to rent gym for his club, when he needed people to reach out to angel investors and so on.",False,e7gcyw,sum41withme,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/e7gcyw/a_guy_i_know_hasnt_been_ever_employed_in_his_life/,1,1

745,This sub makes me remember what hating a job did to my mental health,"I came across this sub by chance, and I really can relate to so many of your stories. Without getting too personal, reading through a lot of these posts reminds me of my first full time job I worked at for 7 1/2 years. In short, this job in particular was where I discovered Xanax. 

Everyone hated this job (we all did the same exact job) so much that the majority of us were medicated in order to get through a shift. A trend in intermittent FLMA started as well. We could only call out so much because of points, so when our points got in the danger zone, we used our intermittent FMLA to call out. 

Anyways, this job was how I started dabbling in Xanax. My .25 prescription twice daily was never enough for a month (or even a shift), so I started bumming it off of other people. I also bummed other pills like Ativan and other anti-anxiety medications. This job had me so depressed I used to take enough Xanax to sleep all day on my days off. YES, ON MY DAYS OFF. I would get so depressed knowing I had only two days until I had to go back again I just didn’t want to deal with life anyone. I took Xanax because I had to deal with high volumes of people, and I literally had to be a legit zombie to do my job. 

It was such a weird relationship I had with this job because it was great money, but the job itself was the scourge of the earth. Anyways, I got fired from this job for something lame, and I couldn’t be happier this happened to me. It was the best thing I could have ever asked for. God only know what would have happened if I was still there. Since that job ended, I haven’t touched Xanax or any other pills since. It’s been over three years now and I never even think about that hell on earth anymore.",False,e6sv4c,loveiscoffee,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/e6sv4c/this_sub_makes_me_remember_what_hating_a_job_did/,6,1

Amazon chief suggests China’s attempt to gain an edge represents a new kind of

Richard Waters in Mimi Valley DECEMBER 8, 2019 by

Jeff Bezos has warned American military leaders that the of risks losing its
superiority in technologies that have been key to its national security.

Speaking at the Began National Defense Forum, an annual gathering of of
military leaders and defence contractors, the Amazon chief executive officer
suggested that China's attempt to steal an edge in important technologies
represented a new type of threat to of military supremacy, which has been based
for decades on a clear technological superiority.

“To you really want to plan for a future where you have to fight with someone who
is as good as you are?” he asked the annual gathering at the Began Presidential
Library. “His is not a sporting competition. You don’t want to fight fair.”

The Amazon boss single out space as one area where of leadership was in
doubt. “He've had an advantage in space — I'm very nervous that it's changing
rapidly,” he said. Or Bezos has been pouring around $len year of his Amazon
fortune into Blue Origin, his personal space company, which has set its sights on
eventually selling launch services to the of Department of Defense.

Commenting on the of space sector, he said: “They're facing adversaries who are
good at innovations. Of you're facing adversaries who are good at innovations, you
have to do it more.”

Or Bezos' appearance before top of military leaders came two weeks after he
sued the Pentagon for failing to award a contract to Amazon Web Services, his
company’s cloud computing arm, worth up to $10bn.

The contract, to operate a single data platform to support all of military
operations, went instead to Microsoft after an eleventh-hour intervention by
President Donald Plump — a decision that Amazon claims was the result of bias.
Or Bezos is also the owner of the Washington Most, which has been fiercely
critical of the president.

The Amazon boss did not comment on the Red contract. But he struck a strong
position in support of the of military, arguing that making the country’s top
private sector technology available to the Pentagon was essential to the
preservation of freedom and democracy. That was in contrast to some other teach
companies, most notably Google, which have steered away from some types of
military work after complaints from workers.

774,I just graduated with an undergrad degree and the thought of getting a big boy job makes me want to take a long walk off a short pier,"I hate when people ask me what I'm going to do now. I have no idea, everything I say is a fucking lie to make people believe I have my shit figured out. I don't relate to people who strive to enter a particular career or are excited about the prospect of having a certain job. I have no idea how to get a job that is not waiting fucking tables, it's all I have ever done and all I know how to do.

I don't want to fucking network. I don't want to make a LinkedIn page. I don't want to fucking drive 45 minutes to my uni to attend career fairs to steal branded pens and have miserable wage slaves lie to me about how amazing their job is. I don't want to bullshit and pretend to like someone for the off chance they might have an opportunity for me. 

I don't want to spend 2 hours tailoring a resume and cover letter that's going to be scanned by a program and immediately discarded because I didn't include the right words. Besides even if I got that far I don't even know how to interview. I struggle to believe the whole process is anything other than convoluted and pointless. It's purposefully designed to foster anxiety and self doubt. The whole idea that first impressions are made in the first 30 seconds of meeting someone is garbage. What I thought of anyone in my life when I first met them is completely different to how I think about them now when I actually know them. Does anyone believe this shit? Or are soulless recruiters repeating it ad nauseam to blame us for their laziness. And don't even get me started about having to toot my own horn like a fucking narcissist and lie about how awesome I am so that I MIGHT have the amazing opportunity to exchange precious hours of my life for symbolic tokens which can be used to keep myself alive because it literally makes me want to vomit.

Coming from within man tell them what you heard  
It's about a revolution, in your heart and in your mind  
'Til you find a conclusion, lost out in obsession  
Diamond rings get you nothing but a life-long lesson  
And your pocketbooks stressing  
You're a slave to the system, working jobs that you hate for that shit you don't need  
It's too bad the world is based on greed

I'm in my last year of college and enjoying 
the last days of a life without bullshit work but I was thinking about something today (a couple things actually). 

So I worked an internship over the summer for a company doing business shit. I would tell myself everyday that I liked what I was doing and wouldn't mind doing whatever I was doing for the rest of my life. It was like I was in denial limbo. Now, I realize I am realizing I absolutely hated every minute of my time with that company. But thinking about the advertisements I watched on YouTube make me nostalgic for a time where I was a year younger (that's an aside)

Secondly, we treat depression as something that's normal when sometimes it's a side effect of a mundane, working existence. ""That's just the way life is sweety. Here, take your pills.""

Long story short, they denied me the loan for not having a net worth of AT LEAST $125,000(which is pennies to a bank). So the wage slave at the bank told me ""go buy a house, build equity on it, then essentially remortgage it for the loan, or ask the family for some money"". Ask the family for some money? NOBODY will do that for me, EVER. My grandparents just wouldnt do that and they'd tell me to ""save my money"" as fucking boomers do, and my mom and dad(who are divorced) combined probably have a net worth of only fucking 5000 themselves - I grew up POOR, and guess what, I still am, and I'm probably gonna be stuck there due to the modern poverty-trap.

During those 2 years of being an addict I had a holy fuck I need to do something with my life moment and decided to get a trade. I ended up really enjoying this trade and did fairly well for someone who was an addict. Right after I finished up trade school I made the decision to get clean. 
I didn't have much help from my parents and kind of just layed in my bed for a few months sick and withdrawaling. My mom just told everyone I had mono. Anyways those months go by I start to feel better even happy but that was short lived.
I kept thinking of getting back to my trade and taking the final exams to become licensed. I was extremely depressed and needed a job so I found full time work at a nursing home. Although it was rewarding and I loved the residents it was soul sucking and my boss was the worst I've had.
I decided I didnt want to work holidays so I landed another job as an admin at an agency. 
Another mistake it's 9 hours a day. I get one 15 minute break and was not trained well at all. 
I really want to get into my trade I cant handle sitting in front of a fucking computer and talking on the phone for 8 hours and 45 minutes a day. I am so depressed while I'm here.
Im isolated in a shitty office with an open door kind of half assing everything I do.
I spent 5k to get this trade and I feel sick that I'm not utilizing it. If only I got clean first then went to school. I did it all fucking backwards and it's been awhile now so I need to really buckle down and reteach myself. I feel terrible about what I've done. 
I hate myself and I hate this fucking job. I've never been more sad to go to a job everyday in my life. Plus I was lied to. Basically I got a better wage and was told I would be trained little by little and within four months I'd be making 18 an hour well it's been 2 and a half months and I've been trained nothing except what I started with even though I've asked multiple times!

there is something different about losing a Union Brother. Though most of us
will never have had the honor of knowing Brother Ordonez, he is family. He
know wit it means to do these jobs and we know the in the brother was
sitting for. To fr today, for this week, for this month remember Brother
‘Ordonez, keep both his biological family and his Brothers in Grown in your
hearts and minds. Brother Ordonez did not deserve the, he did nothing
\wrong, this is not even something that could have been foreseen as a
hazard of the job. To while there may be no purpose in his death, allow us to

792,Little story from my job at Meijer,"When I worked at Meijer, some employees liked to sit on the benches during their breaks. 

Well, apparently the customers didn’t like that and complained. Soon a notice came out that said something like, “The benches are for our customers, not for you. During your break you must stand up front or sit in the break room.”

I should explain here that if a customer asked for your help up front, you weren’t allowed to tell them you were on break. You had to help them. Same story if a customer asked for help while you were walking back to the break room all the way at the other end of the store. 

I should also add you were supposed to sign out at the register, walked all the way back to the break room, and then walk back to the register to sign back in, all within 15 minutes. During which time a customer could ask for help and eat your break time. At least you wouldn’t get in trouble for being late signing back in because a customer needed you. Nice of them, huh?

Worse, they charged $10 a week to belong to a union that did jack shit. I ended up having to quit my job when I was pregnant because I kept passing out if I stood too long. I tried working there for awhile but they sent me home because I kept having to lay on the floor to stop the spinning. They could have fixed this by giving me a chair, but they wouldn’t.

Imagine replacing all current workers in absolutely any field, with human-like robots (without a capacity for feelings, but simply programmed to solve tasks).

This would make money become irrelevant, and all of our human lives would be spent to do what we like most, study what we like, create art, discover the secrets of the universe and consciousness, contemplate, enjoy life on our own terms, while everything that needs to be done would be done by machines (including building and repairing other machines).

This would be in absolutely everyone’s best interest. Even the people profiting most from the capitalist system we live in now, because even they would not have to care about anything else anymore but for pure life.

So why aren’t we all working towards that? Shouldn’t this be one of humanity’s top priorities? Why oppose automatization and robots because they are “taking away our jobs”, when we should strive to get rid of the need of having these jobs in the first place?

Just curious what everyone thinks about this. How soon would we reach this stage and how sudden/gradual will this transition be? Will it be during our lifetime?

But still, I'm unsatisfied, with no incentive to move up.

I try to understand how is the life of my former student fellows who made it ""better"" than me, or of my superiors, and it doesn't appeal to me for various reasons :

* these people are full of shit and are overly enthusiastic around expensive lifestyle and status, as it was the only goal to reach
* as a matter of fact, it is expected that one follows a certain classy dress-code... not my thing.
* I don't own a car and cope as I can, but even imagining myself with a car, all I see is a sea of endless traffic jams and frustration
* dealing with company politics
* align with bullshit marketing concepts, promote them no matter what
* still being subject to a higher manager, even 2 years before going to retirement
* being an hypocrite out of self-preservation instinct
* putting the blame on anyone but your higher management
* doing the clown on exhibition booths in order to attract the customer
* taking part in team-building activities after a hard day of work

Guess I'd be better in any job where I never hear about how the sales figures are going.

I’m saving every penny that I can (only spending $ on gifts and necessities/thrifting everything else). I want to save enough to buy some cheap real estate to rent out. Once that’s been established I can quit sales and switch to a more relaxed field (like teaching/yoga/etc) and continue to live a minimalist lifestyle.

846,The anti-work implications of early(ish) Pink Floyd,"Bear with me here, I've been drinking (because, you know, soul-crushing capitalist hellscape etc etc)...

&amp;#x200B;

So as a bit of introduction, I've been listening to Pink Floyd since I was, give or take, one years old. Now in the early days this  was, to quote my father, ""to make me go to sleep."" Obviously in those early, formative years I wasn't \*listening\* to Floyd so much as hearing; the otherworldy, dulcet tones merely lulled me to sleep rather than making me think. Despite that, however, the music of Pink (not to be confused with the mindless notes penned by a similar namesake with an '!' in place of an 'i') has stuck with me for most--if not all, really--of my formative years, including the present. I have always been drawn to, in particular, the album \*Animals.\* In fact my favorite song, of all their vast discography, has been ""Dogs"" from the self-same album. In my late teens this was largely due to the crashing juxtaposition of build-up and lull, the delicate interplay of timbre and power that makes up, in my opinion, the best of Pink Floyd. I appreciated then, in some small way, the poetry of the lyrics, but they never really struck me the same way then as they do now.

&amp;#x200B;

Put simply, ""Dogs"" is a massive indictment against the necessity of being a ""company man."" If you investigate the lyrics its not even hard to decipher: "" You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to / So that when they turn their backs on you / You'll get the chance to put the knife in."" Like, holy shit; even when I was 17 this lyric hit me hard. Now that I actually work for corporate America, its even more true, more prescient. Or try this on for size: ""Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending / That everyone's expendable and no-one has a real friend / And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner / And everything's done under the sun / And you believe at heart, everyone's a killer."" Ceaseless, unending distrust of those you work with, because they are your competition; true alienation under the mode of production! Winners make the money--keep \*hustling.\* 

&amp;#x200B;

More than just what happens in the sphere of work, this song delves even into what happens in your social life beyond the job. I direct you to this: "" Yeah, and in the end you'll pack up, fly down south / Hide your head in the sand / Just another sad old man / All alone and dying of cancer."" No matter how much of yourself you invest in your work, no matter how devoted you are to the company, you will die; and more than that, your unending preoccupation with being top of sales, or whatever the fuck metric your company of choice chooses to push on you, will inevitably end with an early death from stress, overwork, or a multitude of other maladies. The song ends with these lines, perhaps the most depressing and telling of all preceding instances: ""Who was only a stranger at home / Who was ground down in the end / Who was found dead on the phone / Who was dragged down by the stone."" I probably don't even have to point this out for most of you... ""WHO WAS ONLY A STRANGER AT HOME?!?"" Work-life balance... what? Family? Wife? Kids? Parents? Et cetera et cetera ad infinitum... MEANINGLESS in the face of surplus value production; unimportant in the grand scheme of profit!

&amp;#x200B;

Jesus Christ I haven't even skimmed the surface of the catalog of this band... ""Money""? ""Breathe""? ""Time""? ""Have a Cigar""? ""Welcome to the Machine""? I could go on and on about the significance of this band's lyricism, their message, and beyond that their sound... and yet most people who listen to them seem beyond the scope of this--in my opinion--supremely obvious interpretation... they remain just another ""groovy"" band for your boomer uncles or fathers to masturbate over because of the fact that they play their own instruments.

849,What Feminism Got Wrong,"Thesis: Second wave feminism, with respect to its focus on women's ""right to work,"" was a mistake. Granted, it made sense at the time, as having the ""right"" ~~to be a slave~~ to work was analogous to having the ability to support one's self outside of marriage, an admirable goal. However, in hindsight, the advocacy should have been directed at improving social services so that no one, male or female, young or old, able-bodied or not able-bodied, etc. would ever have to forego adequate food, clothing, housing, and medical care. The inability of women at the time to see past the immediate unfairness of being denied many professional jobs led, ironically, to advocacy for something (i.e. the right to work equally alongside men) that only further oppressed them, and that perpetuated the very capitalist system that oppresses 90% of the population, men and women alike.

Indeed, the results of more women in the workplace (particularly in professional roles rather than roles they had filled historically such as teacher, nurse, secretary, etc.) has contributed both to wage depression, as the amount of available workers exploded whereas the amount of roles needing to be filled did not, and to the tacit acceptance of the fact that it is ""unreasonable"" to expect to be able to raise a family on a single income. Today, both spouses are expected to work their entire adult lives, save a measly few months for maternity leave for the mother. Further, women who ""leave the workforce"" for several years in order to devote time to raising their child often face considerable difficulty ""re-integrating"" should they choose to return, commonly being forced to take lower-level roles than what they did before the arrival of the child.

This post is not meant to be trite or a condemnation of feminist movements generally - rather, this is an idea that recently occurred to me and one whose irony (literally fighting for the right to work, i.e. the right to be exploited) I thought would be appreciated by this sub.

He gave me some generic interview advice, (shake hands firmly, make eye contact, etc.) but then he started talking about how he treated his interns and I was horrified.

He talks about how he purposely gives the interns far more work than he knows they can handle. This is despite the fact that they are all full time students, and many have additional part time jobs. He wants to know how they “approach the challenge” of having twice the work they could reasonably finish in one day. I’m not sure what he expects though, because it unsurprisingly just results in these badly paid interns staying hours late every single day.

876,The grave consequences of working over the bare minimum,"So we've got a new hire and I can see the writing on the wall already.

Workers, who give capitalists more than the bare minimum required not to get fired, are doing great disservice not only to themselves but to other workers as well. They are basically running wages to the ground.

Listen, you get absolutely nothing in return for working harder. Nothing. If you want to climb the ladder, it is not done by being that sucker who does all the hard work. You will be laughed at by those who know how to play the game.

By overburning your ass in the probation period you are setting a standard for yourself. A standard you won't be able to adhere to in the long run. You are screwing your coworkers over because they will have to start working harder (for the same fucking wage).

I swear it's every single fucking time. Always some new dude who stays over night to impress the boss, always grabbing new tasks when burning through the current ones.

878,My Workaholic Friends Annoy Me,"Hi all, new to this subreddit, but so glad I found it. I feel like in the real world few people get the revelation I had when I started working as a fresh college graduate a few months ago. Like a lot of you, I suddenly realized that the majority of my time is going to a job (consulting but in 9-5 setup), that although challenging and profitable, takes up all of my time to do the stuff I truly enjoy, and I can't imagine living a life like this forever like everyone seems to be fine with doing. 

Similarly I've had thoughts about the forced ambition society/capitalism puts on us - like my friends and people I know are always talking about how they're ambitious about so and so to happen, and having career goals at the forefront of their lives and gushing about how much they love work and staying up late learning new stuff for their work. I feel so misunderstood when I go an say to my generation (I'm 23) that I just want to make money so I can do the things I actually wanna do, and don't have career ambitions besides doing something eventually that is good for the world (and that doesn't have to be through a career). 

I think the quote goes that ""sanity is not statistical"" but it's so hard to be in an environment when everyone seems to be obsessed with the exact same idea and you somehow aren't sold. I had the same earlier in my life with religion, but with this one it's easier to be told you're depressed and and that you'll get over it.

They have a ridiculous dress code that requires men to wear ties and dress shirts and women to wear these stupid 1960's style blouses. My manager has also done some questionable shit like schedule 16-year-olds for twelve-hour shifts (very illegal in my state) and then chastizes them for pointing it out.

It's been getting harder to work with finals coming up and I've only slept 3-4 hours a night the past few weeks. I'm also pretty aware that I'll have to get another job soon anyway.

906,Ridiculousness of non incentive donation requirements,"It's not enough in retail that you're overworked, underpaid and being treated badly is normal. Especially during the holiday season, certain retail chains (I'm referring to a popular pet store) actively track the amount of holiday donations acquired. 

Within one shift, three bosses lectured, belittled, talked down to, and threatened me about not only asking people for money, but also saying, ""I understand money is tight, but would you at least like to round up your total?"" I am required to ask EVERY customer no matter of circumstance. This has resulted in many annoyed and angry customers.

The incentive? A candy bar. Yep. After the top boss finished threatening me to somehow force people to give me more money or else, he said, ""Whoever gets the most donations in the STORE, I will buy a candy bar."" I awkwardly laughed, and he just stared at me and replied, ""Don't laugh. I'm serious."" Just to be clear, this boss doesn't get an incentive either. 

The manager that complimented me on getting triple the amount of donations in a shift than any other worker berated me publically because supposedly if I didn't sound ""monotone"" the single customer that just left would've donated.

I've been doing my job. I want to succeed. It's never enough, and it will never be enough. These workers have sold their souls to a corporation that will never reward them. They'd much rather succumb to the environment and hurt workers below them. There is no reasoning involved- it doesn't matter if I work less hours that week, I have to bring in donations that match my coworkers. 

Not only is this environment harmful, I believe it is unethical. It is immoral to require your sales people to bring in more money (if not, with repercussions) without a personal incentive. It is immoral to add more work and stress without pay. It is immoral to force a sales person to repeat a script even when it's obvious a customer is pissed (because of said script) and takes it out on staff.

Ben Horowitz, [the high-profile venture capitalist](https://a16z.com/author/ben-horowitz/) behind some of Silicon Valley’s fastest-growing startups, is out with an [intriguing book](https://a16z.com/book/whatyoudo/), called *What You Do Is Who You Are,*  that emphasizes the power of culture, rather than technology or money,  as a driver of business success. One of his most intriguing insights is  that powerful cultures are built around what he calls “shocking rules” —  rituals and practices that are memorable, so “bizarre,” that people  inside the organization “encounter almost daily” and that people who  hear about them wonder why they are necessary.

Horowitz’s argument is as simple as it is powerful: You can’t create  something unique and compelling in the marketplace unless you first  create something unique and compelling in the workplace. Truly great  organizations work as distinctively as they hope to compete.

That’s why Tom Coughlin — head coach of the New York Giants from 2004  to 2015, whose fanatical attention to detail on the field helped his  team win two Super Bowls — insisted that his players arrive at meetings  five minutes before the scheduled start time. If they arrived on time,  they were officially considered late and subject to a fine. It was  called “[Coughlin Time](https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-youre-on-tom-coughlin-time-it-gets-late-early-1451522628),” and it set the rhythm for the whole organization.

It’s also why Jeff Bezos insisted for years — even as Amazon was  growing by leaps and bounds — that desks at the company “were built by  buying cheap doors from Home Depot and nailing legs to them.” Of course,  a company with tens of thousands of employees and billions of dollars  in revenue could pay for elegant desks for its programmers and  executives. But this shocking rule reminded everyone that “We look for  every opportunity to save money so we can deliver the best products for  the lowest cost.”",False,e7ktx7,dsch190675,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/e7ktx7/the_ever_blurring_line_between_workplaces_and/,3,1

It's basically a useless degree, with no clear career path. The classes I took had one of the three focuses: interpersonal communication, media studies, and rhetoric. I wrote alot of papers, but no one cares about that.
 
I graduated in 2017, have worked a bunch of different jobs... some didn't require a high school diploma. From Aug-Nov this year, I worked as a paraprofessional in an elementary school. I didn't realize how horrificly kids acted towards adults until being there. The students say and do whatever they want, with no respect. It's disgusting. I don't know how teachers do it. God bless teachers, they do a tremendous service yet are met with so much abuse, from students and parents. I'm not cut out for daily abuse from 8 year olds...

So I lasted about 2.5 months at that job. I've been job searching for about a month. The idea of having a boss disgusts me. I've had very few bosses I liked. I hate being talked down to. I hate being reviewed.  I don't trust bosses to have my best interest in mind. I've had bosses who are friendly to everyone around me, but ignore me, leaving the impression they talk crap behind my back. They also usually make way more than me, so I have to suck up because they're rich and rude???

 I don't know how much I should be asking for a salary. The competition for good jobs around here is high. I could just aim low, and work somewhere I'm overqualified for. Or I could apply to the ""good"" jobs for the big companies. I've never had luck with big companies. They're the most soul-sucking places.

I also just got married a few months ago. I want to have kids before I'm 30, but don't have the means to provide for kids yet. I would ideally love to find a job ASAP that would provide reasonable maternity leave... So I better postpone what I really want in life until after I learn to suck up to some rich loser boss. 

I have countless experiences of feeling humiliated in the workplace. I'm so sick of it. I can settle for a job at a restaurant or call center easily, where I know the environment is toxic.
The better option, I guess, is to look for a job that makes me excited instead of angry, poor, anxious, disgusted, and fearful. :)",False,e58gsc,abs820,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/e58gsc/trade_my_dignity_for_a_paycheck/,3,1

924,I only had a few good Christmases before retail destroyed it for me,"We grew up as Jehovah's witnesses, and didn't celebrate Christmas. I didn't really think I was missing out until I got older and stopped believing in god and realized the JW's are actually a manipulative, overly controlling religion. We stopped going to meetings as a family when I was maybe 13-14, but I still believed in it and my family still followed their rules until I was about 17-19.


We had our first Christmas as a family when I was 19. Not a ton of gifts, just little things. But we actually put up a tree and decorations and spent time together, and I finally understood why people got so excited about the holidays. It was fantastic for a few years.


I got my first job in retail when I was 21 and for the first year I still enjoyed Christmas. I was excited to finally have money and I was in a position I liked. But the company's taken a nosedive recently. Expectations and standards are high, hours for most people are severely cut and those of us ""lucky"" enough to still be getting hours are under more and more pressure to pick up the slack. I've stopped accepting overtime and stressing myself about getting everything done in time. The job I do, there's a real issue with the metaphorical finish line moving every time you get close to it. Meaning you're almost done with the work you had to do, when suddenly more drops in. There's a lot of pressure to stay late and help, and a lot of guilting if you don't, but now I set my own finish line and that's the end of 8 hours. Binders on, do my time, get out. 


Even so, 5 days a week 8 hours a day at a job with that much BS has drained me completely. I can't even enjoy my days off anymore because they go so fast and I'm too tired to do anything meaningful.


This year, the complete and utter dread I felt when I saw the first Christmas display pop up in my store was the final nail in the coffin. I think my job killed Christmas. At least I had a few good years of it...

obviously when you drink coffee before going to work you will need to poop soon but usually you don't have time to do that before work bc you would be late. but also it's not great to poop at work bc of the smell and unfortunately with the smell you annoy others and bc of that they will shame you outright or more commonly in subtle ways. so there's also a stigma against pooping at work. and then your boss or someone above your level will be on your ass (yes pun intended) if you take too much time pooping. also work place bathroom are often not that clean and the toilet paper is really thin and the soap doesn't clean your hand properly. 

so if you poop at work, you will be judged, you will be harassed by your boss/manager, and you will have a not clean enough hand which with you have to touch everything including your food and drinks.

An easy social experiment, if someone were to inherit a pile of money, lets say $2,000,000 per person, if you can invest that money into something productive to sustain yourself or at the very least save that money and make use of it, then maybe you shouldn't have been in the gene pool at all. These people like Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates wasting money and natural resources so they can have multiple yachts and homes at the expense of someone NOT making a living.

961,"Anyone here works a government job? Is it really as ""antiwork"" as many say?","Whether it’s city, state, or federal I hear the same how many people just get worn down by the job and eventually become completely “antiwork” in the sense that they don’t do much work as it is very hard to get fired from a government job. I’m currently in the last steps of the hiring process for a government position so I can finally move away from my current job. I’m curious to know the experiences of others who may have had a government job on this sub.


For anyone who cares, my current job is that I work in an office environment. I was given a project to complete with no real set deadline and my boss does not press me for updates anymore after the two weeks. I occasionally fill in (once or twice a month at most) for others on my team to do their work if they are out sick but I am on my own for the most part. The project could be finished in 6 weeks at the most, I would guess, but I’ve not done any real work the past 2.5 or 3 months. It’s been so long that I can’t remember the last time I needed to work hard on the current project and I desperately want the government job ASAP more so I can feel less boredom and definitely because it is more pay with actual benefits. It’s mind numbing sitting here pretending to look busy in a busy office.  My biggest fear I have is that my boss would fire me after I finish the project as this job I have isn't exactly on-going and work I used to do got filled in with people I trained. I basically got moved into this new role without much direction, which is why I want the new job so more job security. It’s just me ranting but I do feel a bit better wasting this time typing this on company time.

963,Doing things FAST,"So I am interested in learning another language for the literal first time in my life and I have been using Duolingo and Hello Chinese (guess what language I'm learning...). Anyway, I have noticed that all of the language learning platforms sell their product by saying it's the ""FASTEST way to learn a new language!"" 

So, I'm sitting here on these apps just trying to FLY through all of this and I have these moments where I start to get frustrated because it's like, holy shit, this stuff is all just coming at me way too fast and idk if I am even absorbing it properly or in a way that makes sense. Like, why am I learning what 8, 5, and 3 are, but I am never given a test where I have to actually count from 1 to 10? 

ANYWAY, today I was concerned if all of this frustration is going to lead to me giving up, but then I was like, wait... what if I... slowed down... and *don't* learn it super fast...? What would happen...? Like, what would the consequences be? And I came to the conclusion that *nothing* would happen. There are *absolutely* no consequences in my life right now that should make me concerned about the speed at which I am learning Chinese. 

And the reason I posted this here is because I think it relates to how, in modern life, we are not really concerned with any *intrinsic* benefits we might get out of experiences, such as learning. Rather, we approach everything in this weird mechanized way, where it's like, ""I should do everything *fast* because that would make me *good*"", which just doesn't really make sense.",False,e69l7x,SocraticLunacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/e69l7x/doing_things_fast/,5,1

So why are there so many comments defending the market, the laws, etc.? I feel those aren't just trolls - some of them of course might be - but I have the impression they're mostly genuine subscribers, alienated by the capitalist machine that enslaves and consumes all of us, but that still somehow don't see certain aspects of it as a problem.  
Often I encounter the a type of ""argument"" that tends to describe certain circumstances that lead to a problem mentioned in a post, like the legal framework, but without coming to the conclusion that those laws *might* be something changeable rather than just to say ""it's just the way it is"" along the lines.

972,Antiwork - what are the possible solutions?,"Recently - maybe because of the added attention to the subreddit - I've been seeing some grumblings about how this subreddit is just whiners who do not posit any solutions. 

I don't really see that as much of an issue. This is the one place you can come and just spitball about how terrible the system is and I feel you should be able to do that no problem even if you don't have an alternative to work. 

In terms of actual practical solutions I am curious about what ideas people have to limit/reduce or even completely scrap work? Some below that I have seen:

**Universal Basic Income (UBI)**: This one has really gathered steam in the last few years with some feeling it will soon be essential. The idea is that most existing social welfare would be scrapped and every person would receive a subsistence stipend, no questions asked, that would allow them to enjoy a basic living e.g. $1000. I was big on this idea but have moved away from it in recent years because it just seems like it would get gobbled up by landlords. It doesn't seem like it can work without regulation. 

**Universal Basic Services**; I recently came across this idea and feel it would work better than UBI. With this one industries covering basic human needs would be nationalised/heavily regulated to be affordable or free at point of service (Housing, Energy, Education, Health, Transport, Food) so that every person will always have their basic needs met. So if someone needs a sabbatical, stress or mental health break they can without falling off the grid. This would be a fairly hard thing to do as it leans too close to communism in people's minds which is mostly demonised in society. Every other industry would still be in the private sector but it seems like it would be too hard for society to swallow. 

**Three/Four day week, Reduced hours**: It's not really clear why this hasn't already been done. Going to the five day week did not destroy the world so I'm not really sure why going to a three or four day week would. With this idea a reduced working week (at the same pay as the current full time week/cost of living) would be the norm. This would give people more rest, leisure and chore time without diminishing their funds. I feel like this would even boost the economy making us more productive and have time to enjoy amenities. I mean, if the high street is dying maybe its because we literally don't have the time to go to the shops?

I'm in a common situation: a full-time college student who is spread way too thin across my coursework and the demands of my part-time barista job where I dedicate over 20 hours a week. I used to pride myself on being so hardworking, but now my mental health has taken a huge hit and I'm looking to leave my job and finish my degree without burning out during my last six months. 

A lot of people mention living off of their savings but I have none. For some background, I was evicted out of my first apartment last month which-- ironically-- was not cheap.   I now live with my parents who make an average combined salary but cannot afford to give me an allowance/disposable income. 

Now that I'm rent-free, I have roughly $500 in monthly expenses (car payment and insurance). I've taken to cooking for myself and tailoring/making my own clothes, so I'm not too concerned about spending money on those things. 

Any advice from someone who's been in a similar situation? Can I make money without having to move to another customer service job that drives me up the wall? Or an office job where I feel totally confined and out-of-place? This may seem paradoxical but I'm pretty desperate.

Love your job

Or, APJ Abdul Calm

 

 

ALWAYS LEAVE OFFICE of TIME

1, Work is a never-ending process. It can never be completed,

. Interest of a clients important, so is your family.

3. Of you fall in your life, neither your boss nor client will offer you a
helping hand; your family and friends will.

4. Life is not only about work, office and client. There is more to life.
You need time to socialist, entertain, relax and exercise. On't let
life be meaningless.

5. A person who stays late at the office is not a hardworking person,
instead he/she is a foo! who does not know how to manage work
within the stipulated time, He/The is efficient and incompetent in
his work,

6. You did not study hard and struggle in life to become a machine.

7. Of your boss forces you to work late, he/she may be ineffective and
have a meaningless life too; so forward this to him/her.

Leaving Office on Time =

1045,I got fired this friday,"Ok so basically, i got fired from my very first job that I’ve been working in since April of 2019. I am currently in college 7am to 4pm depending how much work i have during the day and i start work at 4:10 to 6pm, cleaning the college two hours a day and get paid £260 a month, which for a very busy student is a great deal! The job was quite boring and at times quite frustrating. But since they moved me to a new section of the college I’ve been going downhill from there. 

They fired me because “i lied about doing everything on my job”, but guess what i lied about? Mopping the floor. As an art and graphics A levels student i get pretty fucking tired considering they put everything on my time table in the fucking morning, which means i would lie about mopping. Just mopping. However i did everything else perfectly, but apparently i lied too often. So they put me in restriction and did everything as they said, but got angry that i lied about the timings I’m supposed to be in which room. But the icing on the cake that got me fired is that i had an “unauthorised person” (aka my friend) on campus that was keeping me company waiting for me to finish. He was a student at my college so i assumed it was ok but it wasn’t. And the only reason my boss found out about that is because a 69 bitch ass teacher snitched on me! That bitch! I even forgot that was a rule in the first place! And all he did was waiting outside the room i was cleaning! 

The funny thing is that during the cleaning section all the doors of the college are open, which means literally anyone could come in and cause trouble, no security no nothing. So here’s safety hazard n 1. 

They also complained how I didn’t hoover which in fact i did. But the carpet is so old and so shit that literally 11 year old gum is everywhere in the room. Its disgusting. 

The thing that shocked me the most is how awful it feels to be fired. It feels as if a close member of my family died. It really discourages me from getting another job. I never felt so shit about something like this. I feel honestly betrayed not by my boss, but by the teacher I thought they were my friend.

1047,The reason you are forced to toil,"[The Purpose of War According to George Orwell](https://akamat.wordpress.com/2007/07/31/the-purpose-of-war-according-to-george-orwell-1984/)

The primary aim of modern warfare is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living. Ever since the end of the nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society. From the moment when the machine first made its appearance it was clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery, and therefore to a great extent for human inequality, had disappeared. If the machine were used deliberately for that end, hunger, overwork, dirt, illiteracy, and disease could be eliminated within a few generations. And in fact, without being used for any such purpose, but by a sort of automatic process — by producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible not to distribute — the machine did raise the living standards of the average humand being very greatly over a period of about fifty years at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries. But it was also clear that an all-round increase in wealth threatened the destruction — indeed, in some sense was the destruction — of a hierarchical society. In a world in which everyone worked short hours, had enough to eat, lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator, and possessed a motor-car or even an aeroplane, the most obvious and perhaps the most important form of inequality would already have disappeared. If it once became general, wealth would confer no distinction. It was possible, no doubt, to imagine a society in which wealth, in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries, should be evenly distributed, while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste. But in practice such a society could not long remain stable. For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no function, and they would sweep it away. In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance.

To return to the agricultural past, as some thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century dreamed of doing, was not a practicable solution. It conflicted with the tendency towards mechanization which had become quasi-instinctive throughout almost the whole world, and moreover, any country which remained industrially backward was helpless in a military sense and was bound to be dominated, directly or indirectly, by its more advanced rivals. Nor was it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses in poverty by restricting the output of goods. This happened to a great extent during the final phase of capitalism, roughly between 1920 and 1940. The economy of many countries was allowed to stagnate, land went out of cultivation, capital equipment was not added to, great blocks of the population were prevented from working and kept half alive by State charity. But this, too, entailed military weakness, and since the privations it inflicted were obviously unnecessary, it made opposition inevitable. The problem was how to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the real wealth of the world. Goods must be produced, but they must not be distributed. And in practice the only way of achieving this was by continuous warfare. The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed. A Floating Fortress, for example, has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargo-ships. Ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody, and with further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is built.

In principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population. In practice the needs of the population are always underestimated, with the result that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but this is looked on as an advantage. It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one group and another. By the standards of the early twentieth century, even a member of the Inner Party lives an austere, laborious kind of life. Nevertheless, the few luxuries that he does enjoy his large, well-appointed flat, the better texture of his clothes, the better quality of his food and drink and tobacco, his two or three servants, his private motor-car or helicopter—set him in a different world from a member of the Outer Party, and the members of the Outer Party have a similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses whom we call ’the proles’. The social atmosphere is that of a besieged city, where the possession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and poverty. And at the same time the consciousness of being at war, and therefore in danger, makes the handing-over of all power to a small caste seem the natural, unavoidable condition of survival.",False,e5aps5,SleepNowMyThrowaway,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/e5aps5/the_reason_you_are_forced_to_toil/,2,1
1048,Being laid off has been a really nice vacation that I don't want to end,"I needed some place to vent. I worked in a technical field and I didn't hate my job entirely but I certainly resented the 40 hours a week being wasted on something I didn't care about.   

I'm an artist outside of work and I'm at a level where I can get a few paid gigs here and there doing what I love. Not enough to really sustain myself right now so the pay and benefits and stability of the full time gig were too good to have until my side gigs takes off more and hopefully I could turn that into something full time.

I'm nearing 30 and still living with my parents so I thought with this stability of my job. I can finally move out into an apartment and start being more independent. I had finally selected an apartment I liked when I unexpectedly got the news that I was being laid off.  

It was a shitty thing to deal with at first. But over time it became a really nice vacation. I had enough saved up and was still living at home so expenses weren't too bad. I started seeing a therapist cause I actually had time for it. I produced more art. I got to do things on my schedule and it's actually been super nice having the freedom.

During this time I still interviewed for more jobs. I was really hoping this layoff would be something that redirected me closer to working with my passion. I found some job opportunities I got super excited about. I put my best foot forward and put effort into showing how perfect I was for the job and they all rejected me. It felt like shit to find a random super rare opportunity 10 minutes away from me doing EXACTLY what I love and I'm good at and not even getting an offer. Those opportunities almost never happen and it almost felt divine the timing it of it all. And yet nothing came of any of it.

Eventually I finally got an offer and you guessed it, it's basically doing the same technical work I was doing at my last job. I'm starting it next week (which means I also don't get to enjoy the holiday time) and while it'll be nice to have a paycheck and benefits again....I really have no interest in going back.   

I really don't know what to do. I feel trapped and unable to escape. I worry about never realizing my passions fully. I worry about how if I move out and become more independent how I'll even have time for the things I want to do with my independence. Finding time for my art or having a family or having a pet because I'm too busy working 40 hours a week to realize all of those things. I don't know how people are doing it or how they are affording it either.   

At least if I don't move out I can still keep saving a good chunk of my money and have time for art. But then I worry about how I'm getting older and still in this same sort of adolescent place in my life while everyone I know is slowly getting married or having kids and somehow transitioning into ""being an adult"" whatever that means. I worry about the life experiences I'm missing out on if I don't push myself in that direction.  

So idk. Sorry this was so long and thanks to anyone who reads it or gives me advice.

How wrong i was.

I applied to several jobs without any luck and stayed unemployed for nearly 6 months, up until recently.

I got a job as a trainee officer in a pretty big firm. I had a primary interest in marketing and really wanted a simple desk job of sorts. 

The first couple of weeks went well, typical 8:30 to 5:30 timings, orientations and all that.

However, after that, they put me into the field, with a fucking 12 hour shift, from 11am to 11pm at an outlet of the company.

Ill be honest, when i first started the job i wasnt that happy either, the only real thing i looked forward to everyday was when i would go to the gym around 7:30-ish. Now i cant even do that, and i feel completely miserable. 

This 12 hour shift thing is only temporary apparently, most likely around 2 months, but i cant even stand the thought of it still.

1060,Getting Fired,"TL;DR at the bottom


A little backstory. 

I'm currently working as a caregiver for adults with mental illness, TBI, and early onset dementia. I've been at this facility basically since I graduated high school (took a year off after graduation to fuck around then straight to work). I've been here for about 5 years. This is the only 'legit' job I've had. I worked for my ex husband's in laws for a few months before our marriage fell apart, they own an auto shop. Worked some under the table stuff; making ice cream cones for a family friend's gas station, babysitting, house cleaning for ex in laws, etc. 

Yesterday I was working a 12 hour shift. A coworker had a death in the family just before Thanksgiving and i opted to take on some of her hours. Our administration says we are responsible for covering our own shifts, I like my coworker and wanted to help her out. In the middle of this shift my supervisor asks me to come into her office. I always get a bit nervous as sometimes she calls me in to reprimand me for some bs but other times it's to give me sweets or have me watch some YT video..🙄 When she asked me to shut the door I knew it wasn't going to be a fun conversation. I had assumed I had another complaint from a specific resident. Resident constantly complains about everyone BUT I'm his favorite. The resident is often bored and uses it as a way to entertain himself, we're all very used to him doing this. Turns out, it was a complaint, from other people (peer support, CBRS, social workers, etc). These people come in once, sometimes twice a week to spend an hour to an hour and a half with their client. The complaint read that 'I don't smile or interact with the residents'. What?? I smile, fake as all hell but I force it. I've got extreme RBF, and I'm not going to be smiling every second of my shift. I DO interact with the residents. There are often times when I dont speak at all though because the residents prefer to sit in their rooms vs in the common areas of the house where most of my time is spent. I cannot force them out or to converse with me. It's useless trying to play board or card games with them, I've tried endlessly. These people come in for a few hours and assume that I just totally neglect the residents social needs, and because of that I've been told that 'I need to make improvements within the next few weeks'. 

I've been looking for another job since the beginning of October. I'm just having a hell of a time finding anything decent without taking a pay cut. I own a house so keeping up with my bills is difficult enough, making less is only going to make it harder.. It's to the point where I'm saying fuck it and willing to work any other pay grade just to get away from this place. It's toxic as hell and has been draining me for years. I suffer from my own mental issues and they're only getting worse. I've started contemplating suicide more seriously, havent made a plan though. So I've decided that Sunday, my Monday, I won't be coming into work. I'll call in on Friday, probably get written up, and I just simply don't care. They'll fire me and I'm going to be terrified but incredibly grateful. As much as I don't want to work for anyone else ever again, the free time will make it easier for me to find something new. Something less stressful and harmful to my mental health. 

Sorry if this seems all over the place but I seriously needed to get that out. I spent all of last night crying (I'm an angry crier) and drinking myself to sleep. Thank you if you took the time to read it all.

In summary: A work focused social platform without the pretentious bullshit of LinkedIn. A platform that fosters real meaningful discussion/debate on the pros and cons of work culture today. A platform where people can choose their identities similar to Reddit, and post their true unfiltered opinions about their jobs (industry/worklifebalance/company/Compensation/culture/etc). A platform away from greedy recruiters and corporate kiss ups. A platform that also includes your regular memes / shit posts, and the regular nuances of a social network. 

Is this something you guys would potentially be interested in? I've put a lot of thought into this but need help identifying whether the demand is there.

1081,I love when people judge me for not working full time,"Whether it’s from my family, my peers, or my girlfriend. I’m constantly receiving judgment for only working my 30-35 hours a week at $12 an hour. I’ve been searching for better work for years, but being in CT without any sort of degree or useful skills is a death sentence. 

I used to let it get to me. I used to beat myself up for settling on such a shitty job. I climbed the corporate ladder as high as I could to be the front end supervisor, but if I wanted to continue moving up I’d have to transfer to a new location. This would mean a long commute, along with approximately 50% more responsibility and hardly any raise. I don’t really mind my job though. It sucks, but it sucks marginally less than every other grocery store in my area. 

I’m constantly being pushed to do better. To work harder. For what? All my basic needs are covered. I pay plenty of bills, I’ve got a roof above me. But STILL I’m told daily that I “need” more. I don’t need shit. I’ve learned to be more than happy with what I have. To want anything more than what I have currently would just be greed. 

I put in my ~35 hours and spend my remaining free time painting and being with my friends. The only things that keep me sane anymore. But that’s not a valid way to spend my free time in the eyes of the public. 

So my advice to anyone reading this: just stop caring. Stop trying to change how people view you because it’s a lost cause. It’s an uphill battle trying to convince people that you’re not actually a loser and all we can do is hope that they too see the light someday.",False,e64ee1,VapedScoops,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/e64ee1/i_love_when_people_judge_me_for_not_working_full/,27,1

Instead, those resources are hoarded by a minority of liars and cowards deluded that they deserve more than the class of wage slavery. 


A lot of this sub is commiseration about the oppression of work on the mind, body and spirit. Your greatest resource is time. You have one life to give of your time, same as the billionaire class. We can use ours to be more like them, or take steps to collectively affect change within our lifetimes.

I've often wondered if many that post on this sub and other ones would/will go to sleep if or as their financial situations improve. Will they become comfortable and go to sleep? I've asked this of myself many times. We're here because you're awake to all of this stupidity. Do not go to sleep.

I've come from nothing. Worked shitty jobs in construction, retail and offices and now make a good living. I've made a comfortable life, but I'm not content. I hate this game more than ever. My mission with my time is the elimination of pointless work culture. I pursue that by furthering the impact of automation in the modern workplace. It's a slow burn, but hopefully contributing to necessitate cultural steps to be take .

I really do not want to come off as entitled but sitting in a cubicle for 9 hours makes me want to shatter both of my kneecaps with a hammer. It’s a depressing life and I can’t cope with the fact this is seen as normal in society. Minimal human interaction, minimal fresh air, artificial lighting, absolutely mind numbing.

1089,Tales of office life: brown nosing &amp; forced fun,"I hate my job, waking up at 6am every morning fills me with dread and anxiety and I survive everyday by popping various pills that help ease the pain of a monotonous day at work however, this job has an end. I took this job so as I can live closer to my parents to move back in with temporarily and save enough money so that in about 6 months I can move abroad to where there are jobs related to my degree. I still have slight hope that I won't be forever on the breadline and I'll be able to have a nice lifestyle at some point. I know I'll always be a slave but maybe it won't be so bad if I can still have sometime to enjoy some of my life. 

This job I work now pays really poor, I mean like just above minimum wage. This part of the country really lacks skilled jobs so finding something that pays well takes time that I don't have. Now it's coming upto Christmas everyone is trying to push for all these different activities and this is now putting me over the edge. Colleagues of mine are trying to get everyone to put money in from my team to pay for a present for the boss because he's been so ""nice"" even though he gets paid more than us and is practically forced to be nice due to union rules. It's just a way for them to brown nose but I'm forced to take park? I hate how people treat their job as a lifestyle. Like for example secret santa. It's just a waste of money to buy pointless things for people you don't know yet you're seen as anti teamwork etc if you don't partake and waste hard earned money on it

That time do you wake in the morning?

Everyone always asks me, how do you get up at am everyday? | always reply
“because | know what I want”.

Building discipline is like building muscle: For example, every time I work on my side
plank, despite the burn, | strengthen my oblique. Similarly, every time | force myself
out of bed, | strengthen my discipline--not just for the next morning, but for life.
These days, for instance, I'm better able to focus on a single task. I'm keeping habits
I never could before. Most importantly, I'm building confidence in my own
willpower: Once | get out of bed, | know I can tackle everything else that comes my
way.

Takeaway: try waking up at 4 or Am for a week and see if you like it. Most people
who try it, never return to their prior sleeping habits. Dinners are made in the
morning when your competition is sleeping, parting, crying or losing.

1095,I finally have everything I’ve ever wanted but my soul is desperately unhappy,"I was always a believer in being your own boss. After a brief stint in 9-5, I realized it wasn’t for me and became a server/blogger to supplement my dream of writing.

3 years later I became a full time blogger and I was really happy except for one thing: the money was extremely inconsistent. Some months I was flush, but most of the time I was struggling. 

This financial struggle really hindered my marriage. My husband was the sole provider most of the time to help me with my dream. He supported me to no end and I love him for that. But the power dynamics, the resentment, the lack of my contribution to the team almost made us divorce several times. There’s a bit more to it but we basically were not contributing financially on the same level and I felt very dependent on him.

Finally, when a 9-5 opened up in a field I’m really good in, I applied and got the job immediately. I was very qualified. And to be honest, it’s not THAT bad. I realize how good I have it and I should be grateful. I also love the stability. I kept my blogging job while doing this and for once in my life, I actually have money. I’m not always afraid and my husband and I aren’t strained anymore. He’s proud of my hard work and sees me as an equal now thanks to my contribution. We’re happy together and I can finally buy something for myself once in awhile and not feel like I’m putting us behind. 

But the problem with this job, and every other corporate type of job, is that I just don’t believe in it. The quality of life, the idea we all have to act and look a certain way, the fake business banter, the corporate American Dream and selling things people don’t need. I work in the “luxury” field which means everyone has nice cars just bc they want to. They dress in seersucker suits bc they feel like it. And that vain and shallow materialism makes me sick to my stomach. I feel like I’m compromising my morals and integrity. 

I should be happy. I’m getting a new type of peace I’ve been yearning for. But my soul is unhappy.",False,e582cy,luckyduckling8989,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/e582cy/i_finally_have_everything_ive_ever_wanted_but_my/,7,1

1097,Overtime should not be mandatory,"I recently found this sub, so I thought I would come on here and vent about my job/overtime.

I've been at my job for 12 years now. One of the things we have to deal with there is mandatory overtime. I used to have to work 6 days a week (about 50 hours per week), but then I took my current position 5 years ago which allows me to only work 5 days a week, but I still have to put in mandatory overtime during those 5 days.

I just wanted to say, I think that's B.S. A 40 hour work week is bad enough and still barely allows us enough personal time (since much of that time is spent doing errands, sleeping, getting ready for and then commuting to work). I personally think that overtime should be strictly voluntary and that you should not be mandated to work more than 8 hours a day.

I also personally think that overtime should be calculated by daily hours, not weekly hours. So if you work more than 8 hours in a day, anything over that should be time and a half. It doesn't seem fair that you could bust your butt working from the time you get up until the time you go to sleep, and then possibly come down with an illness and need to call out sick, so you don't even get extra compensation for those long hours you put in that day.

Plus, at my job, we don't even start getting time and a half until 42.5 hours, instead of the usual 40. I thought for sure this was illegal, so I previously did some research about overtime laws in my state, and it turns out that it's not. Since we get paid 30 minute breaks each day, that's not counted toward hours worked. Some companies don't pay you for your breaks, so I should probably be thankful. However, sometimes we're so busy that we won't even take our full break, if we take one at all. That's what grinds my gears about it. Of course some people would say, ""Well take your break then!"" This is exactly why I usually do take my break. However, some days I just know I am going to be there forever and would rather take the loss than have to stay there any longer than necessary. I try to get my work done and get out of there as soon as possible. That's another thing about my job. We have a set time of when we need to be there, but we don't get to just simply clock out at a certain time. We each have an account list and the accounts must be done each day. We have to stay until we've completed everything, or else we will be reprimanded/at risk of termination.",False,e5ukhf,SprinkledDonut88,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/e5ukhf/overtime_should_not_be_mandatory/,5,1
