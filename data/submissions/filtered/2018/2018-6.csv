0,[Serious] Parents do not respect me because I'm not working at the moment,this is a bit of a rant but i want your take as fellow anarchists in this situation also im posting here because i dont know of any psychological help subreddit delete this post if you think its been misplaced  im 21 years old im studying a career and i have a very good average so i can apply for a scholarship to go study abroad in the future i still not have any work experience but i will seek to start working soon 6 months1 year when studies lighten up a little my parents said today that they cannot respect me or treat me as an equal because i was just exploiting them i know im privileged and that i didnt give any fucks about them they are in a bit of an emotional rollercoaster since my sister went to live with my grandma escaping all the stress but i hate the situation i help around the house i study a lot and i only absorb stress and bullshit i dont ask for money either only for transportation and lunch food when i need it it makes me feel like real shit and a burden more so with the economic situation  they work and they just want us to be as exploited and useful as them they want my sister to even wake up at 600am to make them feel like they are not the only ones being harassed by the system its nuts im considering getting psychological help to even survive and be functional i suffer stress a lot or to start working fulltime and moving out but this would kill my academic performance for sure and my hope  im not lazy but how can i even be motivated to seek work when all they show me is stress anger and frustration caused by work how can i go to them with a smile and do everything they want when i know this is not helping at all they want me to show respect im very grateful in fact when they think im a social parasite or something i cant stand it  did you ever went through something like this  yeah i know first world problems thirdworldist btw grow a pair and face the world go work you lazy shit etc etc im sorry if your worldview doesnt fit mine this shit makes me feel angry and ashamed due to the current work ethic i ask for your honest help,8ps4tb
