0,Have to quit my bullshit job,i have posted about my job before i really dislike it im a glorified administrator working on a military base   before the base closed my line manager a military officer and all round dickhead said i am in stage one of the formal disciplinary process as he is concerned im not working my full time hours nor do i have the formal qualification for the job a boring health and safety certification so why hire me then idiots i never pretended to have the qualification but theyve decided i need it   as i dont want to be dismissed after their little kangaroo court i resigned and turned in my 4 weeks notice on the spot which he looked really surprised at   the kicker is he said my work is of very high quality i spend 90 of my time at work reading my kindle playing games on my ipad or browsing the internet sure i take long lunches and i dont have any timesheet or anything to track my hours   fuck it i hated that pointless job anyway the salary was pretty good though,bgg727
1,[Discussion] I quit my job after one day of work.,hey everyone i am really curious to know how many hours a week do you work  i accepted a job that was 1 hour away each way for pretty good money but id be working 5 10 hour days of physical manual labor and half saturdays a part of me feels guilty but it was so hard leaving at 6 am and coming home at 630pm still having to make dinner and prepare for the next day id never see my family as i would be in bed at 9  it was too much i was on my feet all day landscaping  my co workers were so happy to work 50 hr weeksits justso sad do you not have a family or hobbies others would call it lazinessbut i am too young to work my life away while my body and health are in good shape i want to walk in the parks garden do things for me  justwhat the hell happened to a 40 hr work week my spouse is also working just as much no wonder people get divorced,bghdib
2,Do you discuss work with with your significant other?,my wife and i usually talk about our days when we get back home from work we both think that its good to know how your partners day went over the years however we can go through periods of time where work was too much to bear and we tell each other to not even ask about it weve lived it and dont want to spend time talking about it   im conflicted on how to feel about this on the one hand when work has particularly sucked that day the last thing i want to do is talk about it but on the other if i cant talk about it have i given work too much power over me  anyone else go through this,bgfj5x

4,Moving to cheap countries with savings?,im becoming more and more drawn to the idea of moving to countries where one can live for around 250 a month all in ive got some savings which could last me at least a few years at that amount i like the idea of leaving the rat race and just moving around cheap countries for a month here few months thereetc and when my money runs out i could just move back home to save up and do it again  does anyone have any experience with this type of lifestyle,bfo2uc

7,"Getting angrier over the years, because of work",ive had a series of jobs that had a strong confrontational element in them customer service tech support even if advanced level etc ive only recently realised the extent of the emotional it caused me   whenever a company searches someone with good people skills its because your real job is essentially to argue with others or convince them to do things they dont want to do  but you have to be polite and nice during the amount of repression positivity and fakesmiles and such is really really spirit crushing   i think i was a nice person once i aspired to be one at least now im just angry and bitter all the time the myth about bastardised operator from hell thats often used to described techies thats because their job made them this way   i cant show this true face at work so i end up taking it out on people in my personal life sadly they dont deserve this,bjbcm2
8,What have you internalized?,i am a hard worker  i was rummaging through some of my elementary school assignments and found this as a common theme in how i described myself and its very much true i always chuckle whenever i read a post about how much soandso hates the super productive worker the worker who goes above and beyond who voluntarily takes on extra work who sacrifices their selfinterest for the betterment of the group the company because i was that person  i started working once i was legally able to do so  at age 14 i worked a minimum of 31 hours weekly i was so loyal and productive for the company that id even voluntarily work through my break time years later when i landed a factory job i remember feeling very useless and irritated whenever there was nothing for me to do  this has all changed recently after a few life experiences and realizations  the psychological influences that shaped my behaviour are so complex that i cant possibly write it all out here but to put it simply  i feared alienation all the environments i grew up in the culture was your value is what you produce what your status is how useful you are and how closely you obtain what we deem valuable you needed these things to be accepted and humanized otherwise you were an outcast and that disconnect from community your peers hell  even from your parents and family leaves a deep psychological scar so i learnt and internalized to accept authority and to submit to its demands i learnt that everything that i was to be had to be aligned with others values i internalized that my worth and value as a human being was solely derived from my economic output my productive labour and attaining those things which others ascribed social value to  so yeah thats a very very simplified version of my experiences what have you internalized,bj1plq

11,Found this comment under an 80s Japanese funk song and it reminded me of this sub,charlie at 11 months ago  oh yes japan in before the bubble burst in the early 1990s it was the beginning of the end of japans infallible economy everybody including the japanese thought it would never end only a few short years later japans economic bubble would pop and lifetime employment as they knew it would be over suddenly we found that the japanese workers were not so much unlike american workers or british workers or other workers they didnt necessarily enjoy being owned by the company and giving all of their lives to the company either  most japanese men of that generation retired with few hobbies or interests beyond work yet they were forced to retire young they were like living ghosts the japanese workforce of today is not like this they are much more like their western counterpart  working to live instead of living to work  how less  i 168 9 reply ,biqw3l

17,Anyone ever had a problem getting a job after a period of being able to not have to work?,so me and my wife both hate work  just the concept of how its structured is so terribly demoralizing that i wonder how im going to make it through the rest of my life  ive had several kinds of jobs and they are all terrible  the bosses corporate bootlicking employees etc  you guys know the drill    over the past 6 years me and my wife have taken turns at being the sole provider while the other takes some time off usually 5 months to a year to try to enjoy the better aspects of life  we have 6 animals but no kids so we are pretty good at budgeting to accomodate the sort of lifestyle we find worthwhile  i got laid off from my last job and got a pretty nice severance package plus unemployment  at the same time my wife got a decent paying job so ive lived without the burden of work for the past year and a few months the times coming up though i can tell my wife is really starting to hate her job so im on the depressing quest to pick it up from my end    im a little worried about how to get another job with a 14 month period on my resume where i cant account for  playing with and raising newborn kittens while exploring artistic endeavors unfortunately doesnt appeal to hr or hiring managers  do i lie on the resume and if so how  what do you guys do i didnt even get walmart to call me back about a position and a lot of my resume is filled with grocery and grocery vendor experience   anyways thanks for reading i wish all you the best comrades     and if you must go to work tomorrow  well if i were you i wouldnt bother  for there are brighter sides to life  and i should know because ive seen them but not very often  still ill by the smiths,bhnh10

19,"Has anyone here read ""Homo Ludens""? - a book on the profound use of play (opposite to work?)",what really is the root issue i take with work is how it claims to be meritocracy but actually perpetuates toxicity and misanthropy instead its a broken meritocracy that values how well you fit as a cog in the system how obedient you are even at the expense of skill quality or wisdom and how likely you are to willingly bully those under you if you move up in the chain to me being so antiautonomy in work culture is ultimately antiplay and destroys purpose if i discover enough workplaces are this way which appears true in the 7 years ive worked then my goal is to boycott and do something valuable based on true wisdom that actually is supportive to the lives of other people i wont go to work everyday ill go to play       in homo ludens johan huizinga defines play as the central activity in flourishing societies he identifies five characteristics of play it is free it is not ordinary or real life it is distinct from ordinary life both as to locality and duration it creates order it is connected with no material interest and from it no profit can be gained     httpswwwamazoncomhomoludensstudyplayelementculturedp1621389995httpswwwamazoncomhomoludensstudyplayelementculturedp1621389995,bikyht
20,"If there are any, what are some things that would make you like your work or a job?",i see a lot of posts here of people fed up with their work and i assume youre all familiar with david graebers bullshit jobs and it seems most of the work youre describing falls into the category of bullshit jobs so i totally get it   but i was just wondering if there were any circumstances where youd either like or could live with your current job or if theres any kind of work that would make you not feel that way  i know im rather privileged in a sense that ive never had to do work i hate to keep a roof over my head privileged in quotes because the reason for that is that im eligible for a bunch of financial support from the state for disabilities ive never had more than the absolute bare minimum either but that was tradeoff i was willing to make im opposed to the concept of work on an ideological intellectual and emphathetical basis not emotionally from personal experience i delivered mail for 4 years which i honestly loved pretty much total freedom but i do think the fact that it was only 10 hours a week contributed a great deal to me not getting fucking sick of it im back in school now getting my high school diploma because i never finished because of the aforementioned disability and im planning to go into teaching which if the disinterest for a subject i love from teenagers that dont want to be there doesnt make me want to kill myself in 3 months would seem like a pretty fulfilling job  would any of that apply to you would a substantial reduction in hours make it at least bareable would you hate your job and work in general as much if it was only 20 hours a week or 10 and youd still have enough to live do you think that theres any work that if in a magical perfect reality you could pick exactly what you wanted and make a living youd enjoy find meaningful if not these things are there any conditions which would make you like your work,bf3wah

39,The current way of living makes it hard for people to leave the big cities in favour of living closer to nature and off the land,i am a 32 year old dude who wants to leave the slave temple that london is and move somewhere warmer in europe closer to nature my plan is to find a small town that would allow for me to buy my own old traditional house and refurbish it then grow vegetables chicken etc  but the only big problem is that there are mostly no young people living outside the huge cities of europe  society has brainwashed the current generation of young people into moving and working like slaves for the rest of their years in the big cities with promises of high status consumerism promising careers and whatnot this young generation cannot even fathom the idea of ever leaving their important cubicle jobs for a life of peace where they would do something meaningful alongside their family in nature as people used to do  in light of this it makes it hard for the rest of us to do this because we the younger ones dislike the idea of living in town or villages with old people without a great energy and a youthful vibe   my prediction is that the powers that bes plan is to eventually have everyone living in big citadels where everything is controlled and monitored and where going out in nature would only be allowed for a very short time and only based on some reward system based on how obedient and productive you were  living in nature would be off limits for us but not for the elite obviously the landscapes will be used to mass produce gmo crops to feed the slaves within the citadels and thats about it,bfglht

56,"""They want your time... even if they have no use for it.""",so im reading bob blacks abolition of work which im sure a lot of you have read its in the sidebar  and im just completely struck by this passage  ampx200b  gtbecause work is unnecessary except to those whose power it secures workers are shifted from relatively useful to relatively useless occupations as a measure to assure public order anything is better than nothing thats why you cant go home just because you finish early they want your time enough of it to make you theirs even if they have no use for most of it otherwise why hasnt the average work week gone down by more than a few minutes in the past fifty years   ampx200b  its both obvious and insightful  its something everybody knows is true  that workers are forced to pretend to be busy or make up bullshit to do rather than just leave or do their own thing when theres no actual work to do and even much of the actual work is made up as an excuse to occupy them  its also something most people dont think about in that way  most people believe work is about contributing to society and doing useful things that need to be done and this i think is an obvious counter to that,bgnu32

93,Bullshit Jobs (book) by David Graeber,my first post here i just discovered this sub   i recently read this book bullshit jobs has anyone else read it i highly recommend it to everyone in this sub it goes really in depht to pointless jobs and why they exists   personally the book just blew my mind im kind of perfectionist who would probably keep myself busy even without job and i have been so frustrated with every single job i had   im studying programming because i think it as best way to make ends meet and have possibility to change jobs and spend longer periods of time unemployed and work at home and im actually interested in it   i feel like all my previous jobs have just drained my energy and creativity to make something actually meaningful now i have been unemployed for 9 months thanks to social security system in my country and some money i inherited and never before have i been so focused on my personal goals and needs so much in my life   i believe this kind of chance to explore one self with enough time should be possible for everyone i understand it wouldnt work if everyone just stopped working but everyone should have a year in their life when they can focus on themselves and figure out a plan for their future that they dont hate  i would love to hear your thoughts about the book or your relationship with this world where everyone is expected to grind all their life,bhnp7n
94,Mandatory 1 hour unpaid breaks should be illegal.,youre extending the time a worker has to be at their company for a whole hour    yes you can leave the premises but that just involves you taking off your uniform and commute time by the time you get home you have to head straight back to work  1 hour unpaid breaks are degrading and pointless you have no time to do anything and spend more time waiting for the break to end than anything  its a huge waste of time and takes out any meaningful hours you couldve spent at home  great now instead of 3 hours of free time you will have 2 hours,bhkoto
95,"Private to Public Industry- Same Grind, Different BS",im a guy who will be turning 30 at the end of this year since i graduated college at 22 ive worked in the private sector for the past couple years ive been feeling burnt out i began to resent the fact that my timeefforts are sacrificed to afford a select few the luxe life and those same few will always want more often at an expense to me so when my former employer sold the company and the new corporate overlords came in handing out the koolaid while slashing benefits such as 401k matching i peaced out  ampx200b  thinking it would be a great way to remedy the burn out ive been experiencing i sought out employment in the public sector specifically within public education i now work for business services at a local school district my thinking is at least now my time is sacrificed towards supporting educational opportunity for the community the position is also represented by and union and has what i would consider good pay and benefits in theory ill even be able to retire with a pension  ampx200b  however since starting a little less than a month ago i am beginning to see the shortfalls of the position from an operational stand point what i deal with on a daily basis i find it insane that my agency is often legally obligated to obtain goods and services from vendors who do not provide the best deals this is a direct result of the public bidding process a laughable bureaucratic nightmare im willing to ignore since any chance of meaningful change would need to start with state lawmakers improving regulatory policy for now i will wag my finger at teachers purchasing office supplies from amazon instead of buying the same product at a higher price through a state contract approved vendor my motives behind accepting the position remain the same dont sacrifice my time making someone else rich support the community instead while making a decent living   ampx200b  my real issue with the position came to surface just this past friday most the people i work with are 2025 years older than me and emptynesters not to say theres anything wrong with that i just dont have a lot in common with my new coworkers as such ive kept pretty much entirely to myself ive participated in exactly zero seconds of water cooler talk even though theres plenty of it happening most of it is just run of the mill friendly coworker stuff with a side dish of bitter old public employee grievances the biggest negative nancy happens to be the employee whos in the same position but senior to me she has spent enough time complaining about how things used to be and how close she is to retirement that within the first week i adopted a watch out around her mindset on friday she stopped by my desk on her way out and expressed her opinion of i know young people their phone is their life but you spend too much time on your phone and you really shouldnt be doing that complete with scrunched nose facial expression and all it took everything in my power to not ask are you fing serious right now instead i said ok and told her have a nice weekend  ampx200b  to be honest i figured this was going to be an issue on several occasions ive finished my lunch at my desk and taken the rest of my break in my car to escape her leering i got the impression she was probably counting the seconds i spend on my phone without actually knowing when my break starts or ends   ampx200b  so now my plan is on monday to speak to my manager my thoughts are im going to suggest i keep my phone in my car because i dont want this to be an issue for negative nancy but more importantly for me but also the way negative nancy approached me with with the youngins comment makes me think she just has a personal problem with me biased towards young people and theres always going to be a next you shouldnt be situation with her im fine with the dogma of while youre being paid you should be on task but it needs to be applied evenly not just for phone usage i doubt if i approached negative nancy and said something along the lines of i know youre old and dont like change but you shouldnt be gossiping about how things used to be and how much youre looking forward to retirement while youre on the clock shed like that very much or see the merit in it even though the principle is the same i figure at least if i talk to my manger theres some record of it and im expressing my own concern on the matter instead of letting negative nancy dictate the situation thoughts  ampx200b  tldr bitter public employee who spends her days complaining about change tells younger coworkerme he spends too much time on his phone i think her statement has no merit and she just has prejudice towards anything that isnt the status quo how do i proceed in managing my workplace relations with her,bi3216
96,Have you ever broke the rules at work because you didnt want to work with a bad coworker?,i am no longer at this job but i was reflecting on this job that i had where i was an office support technician and my coworker was a complete and utter asshole the job was pretty chill and stress free all you had to do was maintain and service clients printers in 5 huge corporate atampt offices and sometimes service their computers the job got plenty of downtime i was reflecting on the job because i liked how low stress and chill it was but i had to leave because some stupid dipshit that came to work there  i really dont feel like going into detail because every time i tell the whole story i get pissed off all over again so to make a long story short i held down that job site by myself until this doofus came along i trained him and yet he was a complete and total rude jackass to me yelling at me because i didnt say good morning one morning telling my supervisor who was stationed in another state lies about me to try to get me fired etc etc  so we had a project we had to work on and the project was to split up the corporate buildings and go on each floor to count how many hp and canon printers were being disposed of at the end of the day we had to meet up to put our recorded information into excel after we finished the the spreadsheet my coworker was supposed to be the one to email it to the supervisors who were all in georgia   i was still counting printers since the buildings i had contained more printers and he sent me a text to my work phone telling me that he already entered his information and he wanted to meet up so we can work on the spreadsheet together at this point because he had been being a total dumbfuck asshole i no longer wanted to work with him so i came back to our office and used his laptop to attach my spreadsheet to his and then i emailed it to the supervisors  i get chewed out by the supervisors for using his laptop and pretending to be him sending the email they ignore the fact that i had been telling them about his jackass behavior for like 3 months and yet they still wondered why i didnt want to work with this dweeb they all talked down to me and they even let my coworker call me names during the conference without even letting me tell my side of the story i am still trying to repair my self esteem from what happened and i think i have a long way to go  the job is very low pay and has a high turnover rate i wish i would have known that shit about the high turnover rate before i signed up for the job  have you ever done something out of line at a toxic work place,bh3rri

99,Tired of being shafted,i seem to only be able to find jobs that need me there all the time or that suddenly and without warning cut my hours down to shit 10  15 a week im a college grad that got lucky and landed a job from an internship i did my last year of school im an english major  so i was pretty happy to find something applicable working in social media wasnt my highest ideal but it paid well and gave me a lot of time to dick around at work   fast forward to actually getting employed by that company and having a conference out of state the vp of the company who was a total control freak tracked me down and asked me why we hadnt made any of the days posts on facebook i told her i do end of the day updates for facebook and live updates for twitter we never came up with a plan but that was my first mistake in thinking she was a reasonable person   she started screaming at me about how no one uses twitter and its all about facebook that wasnt true at all i had the analytics to show how engaged people were and twitter was better for live events didnt matter though she started railing on me in front of my boss who happened to be doing some other work in that conference room pretty much said she regretted even bringing me on this trip because i was useless and she could have done my job better than i did  that conversation set the tone for the entire 3 years i worked there i was so afraid of seeing her like that again which happened from time to time i did everything i could to stay out of her hair but something was always my fault   towards the end my uncle passed away and we shared very siilar philosophies at one point work less play more be creative buy your own land to have sustainable living practices etc having that happen made me really angry at myself for wasting so much time and money just dealing with my job so i put in my two weeks once i found a writing gig online  got laid off three weeks in because they claimed they hired too many people so i delivered pizza anything to avoid going back im a really hard worker but very few places have really appreciated that got made fun of a lot in the high school mentality environment at the pizza place so i worked at the university in a temp position thought it might get my foot in the door  it didnt ive applied to so many jobs from janitorial to admin at that school the one i graduated from by the way and all of them ended up in an im sorry to inform you rejection letter   each job ive had either works me to the bone or is pretty doable but janks my hours without warning leaving me in a crisis this last crisis  i had a revelation why not spend very minimally and work very minimally i was alone in that idea but it has been very healing   lately however ive been cut to 15 hours a week at my retail job found another job at the tourist trap in town as a supervisor which would also allow me to sing and play the accordion on the boats i had this job back in college  so it feels like wearing an old shoe   just found out im getting 11 hours a week even worse than before my new boss claims that may will be a short hours month but i dont know about this   im just tired of being seen as the creative weirdo who is really only worthy of minimum wage work the nice jobs ive had had limited timelines or psychotic people running it found this sub last night and i feel ive finally found my people i felt so alone in my philosophy about work the only one who thinks like i do is my mom when we talk about it its like belonging to a secret society because everyone around gets mad at the idea of working less and being creative   i just want you to know i plan on participating here and i look forward to the excellent ideas being shared here  tldr long career of being shafted either in respect or hours really hard worker that never seems to catch a break develop a philosophy of anti work and felt like it was a small  secret society with my mom who is the only one i could talk to about it found this sub last night you are all singing songs ive been thinking i was alone in hearing look forward to the amazing time well have by connecting here,bi0bgk
100,Emotionally violent family dinners.,hi all i hope that you have the time to read all this it would mean a lot to me and maybe if it is not too much to ask show some understanding i know this would seem very minor and insignificant compared the problems many other people face but please try not to be too judgmental towards me   ampx200b  last night we had dinner with my aunt uncle and my moms cousins daughters daughter they all say some pretty social darwinistic right wing reactionary type things on occasion even though there is an unspoken nopolitics rule between them and my household for obvious reasons sometimes though the type of stuff i hear is so reactionary and sometimes straight up ableist that i cant keep quiet and i usually would make a very subtle comment that is not explicitly political then we would drop it   it started small at first my uncle said something about whiny millennial snowflakes like he always does which admittedly i pretty much meet that stereotype through no fault of my own as i am actually autistic my motor and speech skills were pretty messed up in my early childhood and my neurology is quite different i responded with something nonconfrontational that i thought wouldnt start a fight i forgot what it was he responded back and this went back and fourth with us making comments at the table each time it got a little more political and hostile for example he once said that there should be a war where millennials would have to fight so the majority of them dont come back alive which was pretty much saying that i should go and die without him actually saying that explicitly it finally got to the point where we were talking about the current state of the world under capitalism my uncles position was that things have been the best theyve ever been because the news says so i worked with him on coming to the conclusion that the mainstream news presents a worldview that serves the economic interests of those who own it i was hinting at the fact that the whole reactionary worldview he has is propaganda to justify the rule of those in power i remember the look in his eyes it almost seemed like you know you make good points for a brief moment i felt a moment surprise and hope had i done the impossible and started to breadpill my reagan worshiping boomer uncle  then my aunt had to chime in instead of engaging with what we were talking about she decided to be nasty and attacked me for currently being unemployed which there are of course good reasons for being autistic gives a whole array of resulting problems im studying so i could do something meaningful im lucky enough to not have to wageslave away where im literally no use to anyone else i figure that if im going to contribute to a capitalist system i might as well do it in an unalienated way where i wont want to kill myself im very lucky that my household is well off enough so its not a problem and they are very supportiveonbored with the plan i have for my life my aunt and uncle dont see it that way though every job is useful nothing useful exists outside of the job market and anyone who doesnt have a job is choosing to do so out of a desire to play video games all day is the over simplistic line of thinking that everyone is encouraged to take up  at first it doesnt sound too bad you see my aunts attitude can be so arrogant and unemphatic her tone of voice so full of hierarchy and dark fascist energy that instead of calmly and rationally unpacking her criticisms so as to give her an actual understanding of myself my body language apparently got aggressive i raised my voice and apparently accused her of wanting me dead which makes a lot of sense from my perspective but not to someone like her who does not know me very well there was a lot of background to explain a lot of myths to debunk etc etc but i had completely lost my ability to act calmly and make sense   i felt the temples in my head become superheated my visual perception changed my hands started to shake and twitch as i went into shock despite all this i tried my best to still talk coherently and i tried talked to talk about the workers who live meaningless completely alienated lives and whose beautiful souls are imprisoned by a system that processes human beings into economic units of commodified labor to their credit they did not just give me the usually facts dont care about your feelings shit and they asked me to explain what i meant more precisely but i was obviously not in the mood to explain alienation theory and the current situation verbal conversations like this are always rigged against me for this reason  my mothers cousins daughters daughter asked the table what other options there are besides working at a job with a hint of hatred in her voice i wanted so much to be able to talk calmly to explain some core ideas of anarchocommunism to get her to understand that we could have a world where everyone works is selfautonomous and unalienated but i was worried about causing a scene at the restaurant so i said to them im not talking to you and i closed my eyes and completely disengaged myself from external reality   i opened my eyes a few minutes later and suddenly began trying to explain while i was still in shock how i was not against labor or work itself that would make not sense but i was against how labor is organized in a system where the means of production are gated off as private property i said something like everyone needs to work but its different when things are walled off i wanted desperately to explain to them that we can live in a world of free labor where everyone is free and in control but i was still in shock and i was not making as much sense as i could have my stepdad who was beside me in a sympathetic and kind voice said something along the lines of its okay you dont have to explain it i told him that my ability to explain things well was compromised as if they couldnt already see that and i shut myself down once again i had to leave early because i couldnt stop my tears as i left i wanted to tell them something to the effect of i dont have a problem with you i have a problem with what made you believe all the false things about life but i knew better than that   ampx200b  im glad i made the decision to move away from here next year where i would get another chance at formal education having a social life maybe even some work aligned with me i will be staying with my dad then while he is not a leftist like myself he is a bernieloving social democrat who always takes the time to understand me at least i have plans to move to away which is good   ampx200b  i feel ridiculous because people go through so much worse and just deal with it there was something about my aunts queenoftheworldlecturing that i hope none of you have to experience in the moment i felt as if i was among enemies who wanted to kill me and my fear of being born into a world of complete darkness where no one in the world was there to hear me out had come to pass i even felt like i was going to die even though thats ridiculous in hindsight i thank you for taking the time to read this writing this has been hard but it made me feel a lot better afterwords  i will be able to continue on studying making progress and doing what i can tomorrow i hope that a better world will come to pass where neurodivergent people are not excluded from society where working is fun free and a healthy part of humanity and people are not taught to hate,bi610h

117,Our life’s are a joke,after watching a movie gravity pretty good i had the sudden realisation that all of our lifes are a joke this planet has so many things to offer the world is so fucking beautiful and yet we are stuck in 40 hour jobs that have no benefit either to us or for anyone else we are not humans anymore we stopped seeing true beauty in life because of stupid ceos and laws that require us to sell our freedom for money as the saying goes money is the root to all evil  its a shame call me a crazy hippie but im tired of wasting my life away in an office im so damn tired of excel charts and shallow emails being my main thing of the day im tired of meetings that have no depth im tired of this entire system were having i would call it voluntary slavery nobodys forcing you to work but you have to in order to survive of course there are great jobs that benefit the planet or us such as firefighters or farmers ill always support them   i remember calling in sick some days ago because i had no motivation i went out that day had a walk in a garden full of flowers and just loved life so much i recommend everyone to do that btw  im sorry for this rant but im just angry imagine we make contact with aliens and they see us working 4050 hour jobs lol we are the joke of the entire solar system,bia2oh

119,"I'm in IT, a support engineer. My entire profession has no merit, and probably shouldn’t exist. Here's why:",i recently came to the conclusion that my entire profession has no merit and probably shouldnt exist i get paid a lot to do this and for years ive been struggling to put the reason for my frustration into words im probably shooting my own feet here but its true  im in it a support engineer in the past 6 years i worked in a few level 13 support roles in the beginning  directly with customers and later on with more advanced trouble tickets that could not be solved by call centre staff etc i no longer talk to customers directly i get a problem description in writing and tackle that instead  i supported the following products in my career insofar  1 cable and dsl modemrouters voip phones entry level position talking to end users directly  2 business webhosting plans more advanced than the above  email and websites helping people upload new pages and images to their websites helping people configure and troubleshoot their outlook 3 linux servers for an ultrafamous cloud provider this required the highest level of technical proficiency  4 a voip and videoconferencing app including hardware my current employer provides to use with it  in my career i dealt with a lot of people callingticketing a certain product that was misbehaving they always called and asked are your servers down before even trying to turn anything off and on again they never believe when you say no and its often confrontational even when theyre polite  here is the main reason why this profession is useless   if something works for everyone else but doesnt work for you  then you are the problem and not the companys software hardware network servers etc   ampx200b  to put it simply if your website is down  its a lot more likely that your code has a bug in it or you misconfigured something than the companys servers being down if your voip calls are disconnecting its not going to be our servers fault in 99 of the cases  its your network thats slow   this means that only 1 of my work brings any benefit to society the rest is of my time is spent on pushing back on nonsense user mistakes complaints about unsupported thirdparty softwaregadgets i cant help with remotely missing features that you might really really want  but we dont etc  the only real merit ive seen to call center tech support was when many customers rang up at the same time to complain about something there might have been an outage that our monitoring had missed somehow it allowed us to detect it but the detection is based on call volumes you dont even need the support guy on the other line for this  there are a few maybereasonable counterarguments to the above debunking of the entire tech support establishment  the education argument  not all calls are complaints about something broken tech support has a supposedly educational value  you teach customers how to do things over the phone i   would argue that phone calls are the least effective way to teach someone technical skills if your grandma is unable to check her email because she doesnt know how to use her iphone most of the callers on my first support roles were unsurprisingly elderly then calling support is a very cumbersome way of equipping her with the necessary skills to live in an increasinglytechnological world   i could think of much better ways to help the elderly in a world where everyone gets universal basic income and people would have time to volunteer techies like me would go to nursing homes for a couple of hours a week maybe this way you can sit with a person and see the gadget you troubleshoot while you do it you get to interact with a person in a natural lessforced setting  the but the one time i called and i was right argument  in most cases if theres a real outage  you dont need to call the company knows  the support reps cant do anything but tell you to wait patiently for it to be fixed when we never ever gave a customer an eta no point in calling really  you probably have a story about the one time you called tech support and only after a lot of arguing with the incompetent support representative you proved you were right  and the company eventually fixed something for you maybe you must be proud of your diagnostic and technical skills even if you didnt get the fix  but this proves my point even more tech support dont have the ability to fix problems that are nontrivial and that you would have solved anyway by looking up the error message on google tech support were not equipped to help you in any way so that the 1 out of 100 legit complaint they got  they couldnt even identify properly once they were convinced youre right and theres a bug in the codeserver issue  they did not fix it themselves all they did was submit another internal trouble ticket to someone else ie a network engineer or a software developer who never spoke to you directly   to summarize my point tech support just blocked you and delayed you from reaching a solution by the way you might not be fully aware but when very big customers have trouble  they dont call tech support they have an account manager that skips the offshore call center and goes straight to the devs who can fix it    suppose you agree with me and acknowledge that dealing with angry customers and being put in a confrontational position where you have to prove people wrong our servers are fine its your configuration thats causing the error message sir is unhealthystressful for employees and brings no benefit to any of the parties involved that would beg the question whats the alternative heres what i suggest  1 automation  my web hosting job entailed a lot of overthephone domain registration imagine people spelling theircompanynamecom to you over a bad line or email hosting plan signups you could do these things online too why is it good customer service to do it for them its just prone to spelling errors customers dont know the radio alphabet companies allow that just because they see these calls as upselling opportunities many companies these days dont even let their call center staff take credit card details over the phone anyway for security reasons the customer gets transferred to a system that allows them to key in the number the customer might as well have done the whole process online the same trend is already happening with password resets 2 monitoring again automation  companies keep very close track on server traffic error messages etc dont waste your time calling and waiting on the line for 25 minutes with thousands of other affected users to ask are your servers down if something is down the alarm bells are heard already 3 just google it  official and unofficial product documentation you learn better by searching how do i connect to an aws ec2 instance by ssh and following the guide then calling and have someone remotely connect to your laptop and click the buttons for you whatever is the issue youre struggling with youre not the first one many others had the same problem and there are free videos and guides all over the web ive seen so many people in it who had no real education in the field  they learned it all online users dont have to have the same level of proficiency but there are ways to get help for your specific problem without calling easily 4 nothing  some productsservices dont need tech support at all ive had a gmailcom address for 14 years and it works fine i never considered calling facebook customer service or netflix whatever i needed to do in my gmailnetflix account i did online without calling i dont know if they even have call centers if they do theyre probably offshored have no server access no ability to help and just recite answers from the website that i could have looked up by myself  5 better technical education  see above grandma example give everyone universal basic income those who like teaching tech would find other venues to do it instead of wasting their time in flakcatching jobs absorbing customer anger till they grow bitter and cynical  ampx200b  im open to other suggestions on how to make me unemployed   any thoughts,bijcpu
120,Whatever happened to people staging labor protests?,i know unions are choked out and collective bargaining just doesnt work anyway under capitalism spellcheck almost made that vampirism good bot  but what i mean is like the sorta tactics unions pull without actually being a union  say for example you work at a theater everyone shouldve called in sick the day avengers end game debuted theater loses a bunch of money and management is pissed sure in theory youll get fired but their misery doesnt end there as now they gotta replace you numb nuts with a whole bunch of new people who dont know what theyre doing and do it quickly  pull the fire alarm youre an employee you say you smelled smoke they have no choice but to believe you hashtag believe employees lol big distraction and cuts into profits  what im basically saying is if people are too antisocial to organize workers unions atleast herd like a bunch of cats to bring contempt and pain to others  i take enjoyment out of other peoples misery not gonna lie thats how i minimize my wagie condition,bjckjq

143,I'm tired of people being fed nonsense about college and the role that it has on their lives,society harasses people into going to college and honestly im sick of it  high school students always hear this nonsense from their guidance counselors and parents about how they need to go to college after they graduate  they just promote it like its the endall to all the troubles in life  these kids are being fed bs  when i was a freshman in high school instead of being mislead for 4 years by the assumption that i needed to go to college right away i much rather would have had someone telling me to take a gap year to figure out what i wanted to do with myself    as someone who has spent the past 5 and a half regretful years in college the best advice that i can give to anyone younger than me is to take a year off after high school and to do some serious introspection  figure out who you really are what you want your life to look like what youre good at and what going to college really means dont let society your friends or even your parents harass or guilt trip you into going to college  what nobody tells you is the following   1 nobody is going to be helping to pay off your student loans  and thanks to predatory practices youll be paying them off until you die     2 nobody tells you about how more than half of your college experience is a repeat of high school courses that you dont need     3 nobody tells you how it physically mentally and emotionally feels to be a holder of debt     4 nobody tells you how even after wasting your mind body and soul on degree that youre not entitled to any job opportunities or a sustainable living     i cannot stress enough if you have a skill that will allow you to operate outside the norms of this system please find it and hone it  this isnt a post telling people not to go to college this is a post telling people not to let society guide that decision for them without considering their options first  theres too many people who think they need degrees when all they really need is their individuality and creativity  you dont need a degree to highlight preexisting talents you just need to find them     ,bar12p

151,"Choice, Consent &amp; Disappointment",first of all thank you for this sub  its been a relief to come here after a long day at work to find validation or blow off some steam watching other people blow off their steam  ive learned a lot and yall are the best    ampx200b  i find myself on rantiworkhttpswwwredditcomrantiwork due to three central themes in my life  choice consent and disappointment i came from an abusive family growing up so control is important to me choice is important to me  growing up my dads rule was once you started high school you get a job there was no explanation given as to why more importantly i wasnt given a choice my dad didnt ask i wanted a job he told me to get one i didnt know why i needed a job  my friends and i didnt need much money to have fun we went to each others houses or walked around the local walmart lol and as for college well i was just going to get scholarships and financial aid no the issues was choice was taken away from me in the process i might still have wanted a job if i had the option to but its not something i got to do its something i have to do thats still true today ive also realized that in public school at least i could get some of my socialemotional needs met from teachers my teachers loved how polite and hardworking i was and how well i paid attention in class i got some of what i didnt get at home at school i dont even get a fraction of that at work  as ive grown and matured into a healthier adult the issue of work has festered in my mind its plagued me ive beaten my head against the wall trying to solve this chinese finger puzzle why do i struggle so much with work why the harder i pull against this idea the more im snared in this trap  in maturing ive learned that choice is incredibly important n relationships ive learned that i dont have to be in any relationship i dont want to not only does that keep me safe it makes the good relationships that much better because they are a choice i get to be friends with nice people and have a nice partner because they make me feel good if someone treats me poorly when im honest and vulnerable with them  like my family  i owe it to myself to protect myself and walk away is it hard does it hurt yes because then i have to rebuild another area of my life and find another way to support myself but like removing a sliver from my finger its best in the long run im an active person and i love to be busy i very well might choose to have a job if it was a choice but i cant therefore until its a choice i believe i can never really know if i would actually want a job its an apparent paradox how can i ever really know if i want something if im not allowed to leave it whenever i want  this leads into my latest introspection as to why i struggle so much with work disappointment i went to college wanting to do well and setting high expectations for myself and i take some responsibility for not doing as well as i wanted i know i was capable of getting straight as but wasnt aware of the tools and support i needed until after college at age 29 i feel like im just gaining the awareness of what i need and skills to ask for those things now but even as ive grown into a healthier more mature person job after job continues to disappoint i trust myself more now  ive done the work  and im beginning to believe its not me  its the job system that continues to disappointment me time after time   i want to honor the belief i once had of what jobs career and life after college held they were the epitome of promise and hope but after five years in college and seven years of jobwork  not to mention time spent in high school even before that envisioning what this life would be likeim at a point in my life where it just cant be me anymore part of it is the unrealistic expectations i set for myself but i was also raised with the belief that if you do well in school go to college and get a degree youll easily get a job in your field  and then youll be happy this cant be it  this cant be what i was looking for and working toward for thousands of hours and years of my life  theres nothing here its justlife there is pot of gold or light at the end of the tunnel  and i absolutely refuse to believe its because of me  because after literally thousands of hours of work and effort ive been doing it wrong this whole time   jobs are disappointing me i loved going to school  friends learning whats better than that jobs have been so disappointing to me in what other relationships or experiences in my life do i get so few socialemotional needs met where else do i have to confront authority headon im not an authority in any other relationship in my life nor do i answer to one seriouslythis is it   ampx200b  these days im faced with the reality that i will need to adjust my expectations for what i job is and maybe what a job can be to survive and live a happy life it feels like my experiences at a job are more or less what they were in high school  a way to make money fun at times boring at others but not the main event of my life that was fine in high school but that still feels like how they are today that wouldnt be a problem but they were built up over the years as being this big colossal thing and compared to what they really are they feel like such a disappointment and letdown  i am very grateful to be among a community of people who get it so we can grieve this loss together  thanks everyone,bbsdic

153,Henry Miller was antiwork,while i was reading tropic of cancer i came across this interesting section and just wanted to share it with you guys  in everything i quickly saw the opposite the contradiction and between the real and unreal the irony the paradox even as a child when  i lacked for nothing i wanted to die i wanted to surrender because i saw no sense in struggling i felt that nothing would be proved substantiated added or substracted by continuing an existence which i had not asked for  everybody around me was a failure or if not a failure ridiculous  what was most annoying was that at first sight people took me to be good to be kind generous loyal faithful perhaps i did possess the virtues but if so it was because i was indifferent i could afford to be good kind generous loyal and so forthsince i was free of envy  from the very beginning i must have trained myself not to want anything too badly from the very beginning i was independent in a false way i had need of nobody because i wanted to be free free to do and to give only as my whims dictated  in my bitterness i often search for reasons to condemn them the better to condemn myself for i am like them too in many ways for a long while i thought i had escaped but as time goes on i see that i am no better that i am even a little worse because i saw more clearly than they ever did and yet remained powerless to alter my life  at a time when others were getting themselves comfortable berths i was taking one misarable job after another and never enough in it to keep body and soul together almost as quickly asi was hired i was fired i had plenty of intelligence but i inspired distrust whereever i went i fomented discord not because i was idealistic but because i was like a searchlight exposing the stupidty and futility of everything besides i wasnt a good ass licker people could tell at once when i asked for a job that i really didnt give a damn wheter i got it or not and of course i generally didnt get it but after a time the mere looking for a job became an activity a pastime so to speak it was a way of killing time no worse as far as i could see than work itself i was my own boss i had my own hours but unlike other bosses i entrained only my own ruin my own bankruptcy i was not a corporation or a trust or a state or a federation or a polity of nationsi was more like god if anything  this went on for a while welluntil one day i was trapped finally the day came when i did desperately want a job i needed it not having another minute to lose i decided that i would take the last job on earth  ,batp6y

194,Just some questions,hi all  ampx200b  i just came across this subreddit and the premise is very intriguing and id like to ask a couple of questions i hope yall can clarify for me i read through a few of the sources on the sidebars but im still not sold on a lot of things i agree that there are a lot of bullshit jobs these days working conditionshours are horrific and that wage slavery is very prevalent so there are manyyyy things we should strive to change however and ive read the 8 myths article im not sold on the fact that work can be abolished  gtwork is necessary   gt   gtthat depends on what you mean by work think about how many people enjoy gardening fishing carpentry cooking and even computer programming just for their own sake what if that kind of activity could provide for all our needs    i understand there are many jobs people would do but how about sewage treatment assembly work etc i would guarantee that those jobs require payment for people to do them  ampx200b  am i missing a point i understand i might be mixing up the concepts of work,beuf49

196,How do I tell my manager at Goodwill that I want to quit?,ive been there for 4 days and already its too much for me   the place is incredibly filthy and extremely depressing there are flies all throughout the building and sorting through the donations is obviously a health hazard since i opened a bag full of dirty linen that had those push pin needles all over them i was digging through the bag quite fast and i noticed just in time that the big was full of linen with needles sticking out of them i was rushing because the manager said that i had to go fast because i needed to get 100 pieces of clothing on a clothing rack every 30 minutes or else i will get in big trouble  the manager is mean she never feels like coming out of her office to resolve to void override issue at my cash register ive been having customers that have me ring up all of their items and then they change their minds and want to put everything back there are only a certain number of items you can put back before the computer says void override contact manager and the manager gets upset with me when i page her to come to the front  she even gets upset if im not moving fast enough when sorting donations or if i forget something that she tells me  the sales floor is chaotic there is never enough people on the floor to monitor the customers who need to use the fitting rooms so im trying to make sure people arent sneaking shit in the fitting rooms to steal im trying to ring up customers im trying to watch people that are walking around and put away products that came off of the production floor  i want to quit but i dont know how to do so especially on such a short notice,bcmwzq

200,Alienation from my social self.,at work i deal directly with customers and make a product for them on demand for sake of simplicity such interactions can go either one of two ways   1 the person can be impersonal and just come up bark out their order pay and say a bare minimum thank you 2 be personal and make some small talk with me as i am ringing them out and making their order  i used to get mad when people did 1 but as i continue to work there and think about it both interactions are harmful to me they both are interactions that wouldnt exist had they not want to purchase something from the company i work for likewise in order to keep my job i must have good customer service meaning i have to interact back with them appropriately   so all these interactions become this thing that is commodified on both sides   despite being relatively antisocial i am a human being and human beings are pack animals socialization is a huge part of our nature there are many psychotherapies based on socialization for this reason   but these kinds of customer service based interactions and their lack of authenticity is taxing,bdk729

202,Shitty night followed by a shitty morning- because of work.,ugh i tried to have fun and relax last night but i couldnt because i had work this morning boyfriend was drinking and i couldnt because if i did i would either get sick or wouldnt wake up in time for work in the morning he was also in the mood but we had no clean towels to shower with and no time to do laundry because i had work in the morning havent done laundry in literal weeks because i only get 4 hours of free time after work and we dont have an inunit washer and dryer and i dont want to spend my whole 4 hours at the laundromat im so tired of having to limit myself and be the boring responsible one luckily my boyfriend is off today so he can do laundry during the day time and we can actually do something other than be bummed about having too little time with too much to get done   like im about to go on a small tangent how shitty has our society become where just taking care of yourself takes up all your free time i would cook and grocery shop and keep the kitchen clean but that takes up all my free time i would love to start dancing and working out but that would take up all my free time i would love to keep my laundry perfectly cycled but doing laundry all the time when you dont have a washer and dryer takes up all your fucking free time im excited to move in a couple months to an apartment that actually has a washer and dryer so i can just put my shit in the wash and relax or do something without worrying about someone coming and taking my shit if i dont get it in 45 minutes   like yall i get four hours until i need to be in bed how am i supposed to fit cooking eating cleaning working out showering walking the dog and also fit the recurring things like laundry and grocery shopping in and still have any free time oh right i cant you know what i notice every time we try cooking we dont eat till about 730 and the kitchen is still dirty by 9 pm and nothing else has been accomplished idk i just feel like we should have more time for self care we wonder why people are so overweight unhealthy dont take care of themselves hmmm could it be because of the fact that we have literally no time for self care,bduih8

204,Modern Day Slavery,   from the wiki my comments are numbered feel free to debate with me  slavery is any system in which principles of  property law are applied to people allowing individuals to own buy and sell other individuals as a de jure form of property  property law is the area of law that governs the various forms of ownership and tenancy  tenancy is where a property is let rented on a periodic basis such as weekly or monthly in land which is the property of some person  property in the abstract is what belongs to or with something  1 employees belong with a company are rented on a periodic basis usually weekly or biweekly  a slave is unable to withdraw unilaterally from such an arrangement and works without remuneration  2 we are unable to withdraw from the arrangements of capitalism based on law those on the streets unable to pay rent are left to beg or be jailed living for free is illegal and all land is taxed all remuneration that goes to land is slave money  many scholars now use the term chattel slavery to refer to this specific sense of legalized de jure slavery in a broader sense however the word slavery may also refer to any situation in which an individual is de facto forced to work against their own will scholars also use the more generic terms such as unfree labour or forced labour to refer to such situations however and especially under slavery in broader senses of the word slaves may have some rights and protections according to laws or customs  3 millions of workers are forced to work in abusive dangerous polluted conditions to pay for their land or more common the land of their landlord or reality company against their will  slavery existed in many cultures since the time before written history a person could become enslaved from the time of their birth capture or purchase  4 all current participants into the curent first world were forced into it at birth  slavery was legal in most societies at some time in the past but is now outlawed in all recognized countries  5 this is simply untrue as slavery is widespread throughout the first world under the guise of a free market  the last country to officially abolish slavery was mauritania in 2007 nevertheless there are an estimated 403 million people worldwide subject to some form of modern slavery the most common form of modern slave trade is commonly referred to as human trafficking in other areas slavery or unfree labour continues through practices such as debt bondage the most widespread form of slavery today serfdom domestic servants kept in captivity certain adoptions in which children are forced to work as slaves child soldiers and forced marriage  human trafficking is the trade of humans for the purpose of forced labour  6 citizens are forced to work for first world companies unable to leave the shackles of working for land instead of being traded we are left to beg companies for our land money in a process called interviewing  7 american children at the least are told they need to take out debt to pursue college and become bounded to their debt to make matters worse the colleges have jacked up the debt because the government allowed them to set the prices all educational debt is slave money  8 all first world citizens are kept in captivity by the first world countries needing money for land and for a visa to even leave their home country or visit another this makes all visa money slave money the conditions for settling in another country are restricted to those with the ability to pay for it more slave money  9 children are forced to work at schools in the us at least and told they need a job to survive the desperate landscape of the current world  10 at least in america marriage is preferable to being single due to the tax breaks we are coerced into marriage this way coercion being a form of force  slavery is still widespread we need a revolution to stop it feel free to debate my points if i am mistaken,bdx3ak

219,No privacy in our personal lives. None. At all. Job interviewers don’t even consider people who don’t offer their entire life to the job.,its honestly ridiculous that you cant even mark your availability to your own needs you have to match your availability to what the company wants or else they will not even look at you   i remember when applying for a fast food job i had marked saturday off of my available days they were closed on sundays im sure you can guess what this place is lol so i was trying to get you know a weekend i already wasnt keen to working another fast food job but i needed to pay my car note at the time during the interview the manager said well i noticed here that you said you arent available on saturdays why like what am i supposed to say if i tell you that i just want that day off youll look at me like im lazy and entitled for wanting a weekend i cant lie and say i have another job or they wouldve probed me for details about that job thinking back it is a christian company so i shouldve come up with a lie that i do some sort of church volunteer work on saturdays and that probably wouldve gotten them off my ass didnt think about it at the time because i wasnt expecting them to be so invasive about why i wanted saturdays off   like and the worst part of it is that day you wanted off ends up being on your schedule every week they scheduled me almost every saturday   the complete disregard for our schedule preferences is disrespectful as hell if you ask me to me it just says we know you are full grown adults who would like to have some control over your own schedule but we dont care because we need everyone here to be our personal lackey who we can call in whenever we want also if you tell them hey please stop scheduling me at 5 am i dont like it they will probably schedule you more at 5 am this also happened to me at this same company i asked to switch to more afternoon shifts because i think its absolutely ridiculous to get up at 4 am to be at a fucking fast food job at 5 am i gave a different excuse and they kept scheduling me at 5 am then got mad when i called in constantly lol like sorry dude i told you already i dont like going in at 5   like find someone who wants to go in at 5 am and if no one wants to go in at 5 am why are we opening so early so people can come get their precious breakfast sandwich at the asscrack of dawn every morning,bcdyyu

240,My thoughts on work while being laid off,simultaneously terrified for my future and more excited than ive been in months  my first job technically second but with the same company is ending very quickly i was told the position is being shut down 2 days ago and my last day is this upcoming saturday i need a new job asap because i dont have the spare funds to keep myself going for long periods of time especially with my current goal of going to college for the sake of learning or using the money if i have to to go to a trade school to make more money im also still living with my parents for the purpose of saving money but i dont want to be a burden on them forever  despite all of the things im stressing over at a time like this theres a part of me that cant wait to be unemployed in the whole year ive worked here i have not had a single full nights rest very few days where ive turned off my alarms a couple sick days gone through about 2 bottles of sleeping pills missed dozens of times to be with the people who keep me going and my aging pets and parents  in my head i know i need to get a new job fast and i will be sending some applications later today but im really at the point where im willing to give up on my future for a few weeks of rest it makes anything seem worth it to turn off my several alarms and get a full nights rest for the first time in months my family moved to a more rural area last summer but ive been so busy and when not busy exhausted that i havent had time to do yardwork or take my dog on daily walks or clean the house for my mom who works so hard already  that classic pie chart where 8 hours goes to sleep 8 to work and 8 to playpersonal is unfair when so much common work could be automated some human input is necessary of course but wasting away at unnecessary jobs because your life has no value without money is bs not only is it unfair but its a lie those 8 hours of work a day arent 8 hours when i live 30 miles from my work its not 8 hours when the thought of work not only keeps me up at night but keeps me from sleeping as heavily as i need to  ended up more ranty than intended but the relief i am feeling by being laid off even if a bit misguided i feel is pretty indicative of the pressure i was being put under by even the simplest of jobs but day after day ,bat3an

243,"A thought exercise: video games are popular because they present an idealized version of work (seriously, hear me out)",so a few days ago someone posted one of those what would you do if you didnt have to work threads many people said art volunteer work part time work etc but the most repetitive answer was video games  a few days ago a colleague of mine has left the company there were talks that hes under performance review which is corporate code for youre probably getting fired soon lets call him jack   jack has been working at hooli a major it company for about 5 years and had the reputation of someone who isnt exactly a hard worker he enjoyed performing simpler tasks  ones that teammates described as press a single button to fix something   jack and i often talked about video games ive been playing the same massivelymultiplayer game for 12 years on and off and so did he the day before he resigned he told me of a new game hes into which involved a lot of manual tasks   you have to craft your arrows and fletch them on your own one by one for example in order to fill your quiver and go hunting this is interesting coming from someone who wasnt considered the most studious staff in the company us engineers are always encouraged to automate everything because manual tasks are considered uninteresting prone to error and inefficient it made me wonder why would people enjoy that level of detail in a game and it got me thinking  i would posit that ltdrumrollgt video games are actually an idealized version of what we want work to be like we play video games because they fill the hole that modern labor created this is of course a makebelief system and im not saying video games are productive  but theyre designed to make you feel like they are whereas 95 office roles do not  the following arguments to support my claim are  1 better reward systems no person character is underpaid in video games if the quest doesnt give you enough gold armor reputation or the mere sense of satisfaction that you progress in the story etc you dump it you might even ditch the game altogether for a more rewarding one  theres no harm in changing games you wont lose the roof over your head reading the wow subreddit after realizing this has been an eyeopener all the rants there about the current reward system can be read from a marxistlike pov  2 no faceless corporations  the quest giver is a person you interact with directly not a huge bureaucratic machine that views you as a cog its strange to think about it but in a good immersive game  even an npc has more heart than the it giant that pays my salary the quest giver or their faction have a story you can relate to   3 no meaningless pointless tasks  if you get told to kill 12 wolves for their pelts then that pelt is later used to craft armor for your character or whatnot if you get told to pick 8 herbs its because theyd be used to craft a potion to heal an orcs sick daughter or something you actually feel like you help someone no huge excel spreadsheets no powerpoint presentations that dont interest anyone heck even most raid guilds dont hold team meetings over videoconferencing   4 your gamework has actual results  if you kill an evil demon boss they die and you saved a village if you gather 20 pieces of silk and nylon threads you craft a cloak that your character can wear the difference is visible who knows what the hell the paperwork i generate is for other than checking a box for the sake of saying we did it this relates to what marx described as alienation from your work too perhaps in games if you work hard towards something you produce a meaningful item of some kind you can often look back at something you achieved in the game with pride  5 you can walk away whenever you want to youre a mercenary in most cases you can pause and continue later if youre tired bored or have something else to do you can play solo or in a group you are your own master and dont need to ask for approval to log off i have to create 2x calendar events fill out a web form to hr and send a massdistribution email to the entire team whenever i take sick leave    6 you get out and see the world this too is ironic because in reality you sit on a chair for hours but the ingame system sends you across different scenic fantasy lands most workplaces are rows of gray openspace desks in busy urban areas with shops and tall buildings some games take place in urban environments too but they launch new maps so you wont get bored my game launches new maps with new regions every few months or overhauls the existing ones dramatically so the world wont get repetitive and boring  to summarize i dont think people are inherently lazy they just want to do tasks that are rewarding interesting and serve some purpose which is very often different than what office jobs are like,bdbui7

249,Marx on Wage Slavery!,since lassalles death there has asserted itself in our party the  scientific understanding that wages are not what they appear to be  namely the value or price of laborbut only a masked form for the value or price of labor power thereby the whole bourgeois conception of wages hitherto as well as all the criticism hitherto directed against this conception was thrown overboard once and for all it was made clear that the wage worker has permission to work for his own subsistence that is to live only insular as he works for a certain time grain for the capitalist and hence also for the latters  co consumers of surplus value that the whole capitalist system of production turns on the increase of this grain labor by extending the working day or by developing the productivitythat is increasing the intensity or labor power etc that consequently the system of wage labor is a system of slavery and indeed of a slavery which becomes more severe in proportion as the social productive forces of labor develop whether the worker receives better or worse payment and after this understanding has gained more and more ground in our party some return to lassalles dogma although they must have known that lassalle did not know what wages were but following in the wake of the bourgeois economists took the appearance for the essence of the matter ,betj0h
