27,Vote Futurist on /r/MHoC!,"Hey! I'm _ from /r/MHoC's Futurist Party. /r/MHoC is a political simulation that simulates the British political system and we're currently holding elections. In it there are parties from all sides across the political spectrum, and as you can tell by us advertising here, I represent one of them. 

The Futurist Party is a party built around principles of letting people do what they want without government inteference, and properly investing in and adapting to the future via technological progress. If that sounds good, you may be a futurist, and what's more, your vote could be crucial to us. On MHoC, even 2-3 votes can change who wins a seat, and as a smaller party, we desperately need your help. We are running candidates in the Wales, Lesser Wessex, and Cornwall &amp; Devon constituencies. 

If you would be so kind as to give us your vote, the subreddit can be found here. Thank you for reading, and sorry if this came off as spammy - we asked the moderators of the subreddit beforehand so I hope that it's all okay. If you want to opt out of this as a sub, please PM /r/MHoC.

She was laid off 4-5 months after being hired because they had to make cutbacks and she was new essentially. My question is: is it fucking true that you can't get unemployment because it's a non profit, and they don't pay the whatever unemployment tax bullshit thing that actual companies do? Shes never been laid off before, and has worked in non profit for years because she actually cares about people (lol).
