0,How to convince people that not working or reducing working time/giving more rights is better?,i was discussing the topic with my mom  she brought up a friend that went to nz and complained about the maori people having a lot of rights and  advantages  over whites normal working people there  because she had met one guy that was from that origin and according to her  didn't do anything  i understand her frustration  like what happens in other places when people of colour  lgbt  etc  get advantages in some fields and this only creates more resentment among the working class  i told her that it would be better if everyone could enjoy those benefits like  having everything provided by the state  and enjoying life  but she responded with the classic  but this maori guy is a slacker   este tipo es un vago  in spanish  so  apparently  when people get everything they end up doing nothing   it's so frustrating  like  she hates the neoliberal government  she hates her working conditions  she hates that everything costs more  but she cannot comprehend that this system of work is doomed and that we can already be free from it  and that we would want to be free from it  when i debate her it's just that  i haven't had the experience yet  and she discredits me because i'm not wasting my life slaving to make somebody else richer than he or she will ever need to be  the working class sentiment is strong  the pride in wasting your life is strong  and then you end up sustaining this system of exploitation and constant grinding in order to get the basic necessities of life  if you do not you seem to be a slacker who  does nothing  i'm sure that maori guy enjoys many things and is a lot more interesting than a lot of wage-slaves  but i can't get my mother or other people for the matter to understand that  doing something  and  working  aren't the same thing and should not be the same thing ,a00p3d
1,"Even when I work for a small business with a nice and polite owner whoâ€™s liberal and I get payed relatively well, I still cannot stand my job.",in essence  there is no job that i ll get in my life that i won t end up hating  what capitalist society doesn t realize is that anyone who s anyone who works a specific task eight hours a day for five days a week for literal years or even sometimes decades and even until the day that they croak is gonna end up hating it  i work as a part time dishwasher at a very successful small breakfast and lunch time restaurant that has a lot of liberal fellow employees but at the same time  there s always some other stupid shit that makes the experience next to unbearable  i m going on 23 years old and there s this 17 year old high school shit pot that barks orders at me like he s my superior and constantly tells me how to do my job and thinks he s smarter and bette than me because he s been there longer than i have  i  know  for a fucking fact that i m smarter than he is  he s a trump supporting republican gun nut and that alone makes him intellectually inferior to me  i know that sounds harsh but if you saw the way he treats me you d feel the same way too  on top of this i have to get up early in the morning every monday  wednesday  friday and saturday to work my ass off for the fucking dreadfully busy holiday season that i oh so much loath with all of my heart and soul  this is by and large the busiest time of year and every day is gonna be backbreaking work-till-you-drop labor until about january 1st  i hate mornings and the fact that i wake up tired and strung out from a night of heavy drinking  which makes my current job even remotely tolerable at this point in my life  makes the work that much harder and harder to bare  the only days i get off are sunday s where i only get about 13 or 14 hours to myself before i m forced to go back to work and tuesday s and thursday s where i have to go to class at my college so i can get a full time job that will be even more stressful and take even more and more energy out of my until i die of a heart attack or cancer at the age of like 55    god fuck this work and money obsessed society  i am antinatalist so even if i am ever lucky to land in a loving relationship  which is in and of itself a laughable concept  i will either never compromise and have a kid or fuck up and she ll dump me because humans are selfish and like to spread the vestigial and terminal illness and tumor to life on this once beautiful planet known as earth like a fucking virus    i never asked for work and i shouldn t have to do it to make a living  i d love to see the first work free society arise in my lifetime but that s an unlikely thing to happen  ,a0ax3h

3,You don't exist,i have a friend i grew up with  we were always sometimes close sometimes not but lately it's farther in between  hadn't talked to him in months  within the first 2 sentences of reconnecting he says  so you got a job yet  which dominates the rest of the conversation  i recently rejoined facebook so i was browsing his page  why idk  facebook makes me paranoid and hate people for these exact reasons  people expose to much of themselves  and it's full of quotes and messages about bettering himself blah blah blah moving on up in the world and leaving being people who aren't doing the same and all that type of rhetoric and some of them are worded oddly specific  now part of the reason we hadn't talked is because i took a break from everybody for a few months because i do that sometimes but this friend in particular is overly concerned about the job shit and literally won't talk to you if you don't have one  like what is that about  before this recent unemployment i had been at the same company for 2 years  granted said friend started surpassing me and doing better than me in his own endeavors but who really cares  good for him  a lot of it was by happenstance  not necessarily because he is a harder worker  cuz i definitely worked my ass of at my job  but in his mind it probably is due to that  even though at the time he explained to me the happenstance but ok  but what does this matter anyway  if i'm not working i'm not a living breathing person  furthermore why do people do this thing where the second you aren't working it's like you never worked before and have no history  you're just dead and never existed  people are so fake ,a1sheu
4,Work is combat,i came across this quote in emily st john mandel's book station eleven  she didn't clarify exactly what she meant by this and the book itself has nothing to do with antiwork sentiments  but i thought it was appropriate somehow   i'd like to hear explanations any of you might have but my thought process was something like this   like combat  you are in a situation where you are compelled to perform tasks where the alternative is literal death  don't fight in combat - gt  get killed by the enemy  don't work to get money - gt  die of starvation in the streets   also no one  wants  to engage in combat  except maybe psychopaths  they just get in there  do the deed and get out  in my opinion work should be the same way  get in there  get your money and get out without attaching yourself to the job itself too much   allied soldiers engaging in combat  coworkers  shouldn't be thought of as friends but as emotionless cogs in a machine working towards a specific goal   although i guess depending on your worldview you could interpret this differently as a pro-work view in that it's your  duty  to fight  work  and sacrifice yourself for your country  company  but i thought it was an interesting thought experiment and it may help others to view work in this way ,9y8dtf

6,This post is to say thanks a lot to you all :),i found you almost a week ago  and i don't fear saying i'm very happy since that moment   i don't know personally any of you  i think  and many of you are excessively apathetic for me   but  this is true  i'm feeling really glad to know i'm not the only one in the world who regrets the current  work  conditions  etc   so  although today it's not a date highlighted by the system  i wanna say thank you    hope you have a really great day ,9up30j
7,"Having to constantly be ""productive"" is bullshit.",example   i work as a web developer  my employers don't know their ass from their elbow and they infuriate the hell outta me  anyway  i produce and deliver a website that  after some tweaking  testing and revising  perfectly meets the needs of our customers  it does everything they need and the customers are happy  everything is ticking over nicely and it doesn't need to be fiddled with   but of course  that can't happen because if i'm not working on it  i'm idle and not producing and my company believe they are wasting money paying me to do nothing  of course  having delivered a service that people actually like and can use  i am actually generating engagement and income for the company  but they're too dumb to see that   so of course  they have to come up with stuff for me to do and they foist busywork on me -  we should change that  tweak this  move that there  style this differently  etc etc  i protest that none of this is needed  but am ignored  gradually the website gets crappier and crappier  customers complain  stop using it and go elsewhere  but the company is happy because i'm producing for them  i'm a busy and  productive  employee  nevermind the fact that your busywork has resulted in alienating and driving away our customers   a lot of the time we don't need to be busy  its just fucking things up for everyone  there are so many instances where being  productive  is not adding any value for customers or employers  if we were being paid to complete a set objective  rather than being in the office for a fixed period of time this would be less of an issue ,9u6aww

13,"General Strike to Save the Planet, January 15 2019",i don't fuckin' know how to do this   i'm one of these distant types that never reacts to anything     i'm scared out of my mind  the planet has what  maybe two years before it's game over   i heard we have 10 years a while ago  but it seems like every week we see a new headline saying it's worse than we thought  and faster than we expected   until six days ago  i didn't vote   i saw a rigged system that was bought and paid for  and thought electoral politics was an insult to one's intelligence   others have different opinions on the importance of voting  but one thing can be very clear   voting  in our system  will never be enough     we  the royal  collective we  need to disrupt the system  and there will never be a convenient time   the number of days we have left is dwindling   working date is january 15   i originally thought the 1st  for symbolic reasons  but a large portion of workers are off anyway that day   we need disruption  civil disobedience   it has to start somewhere  likely it won't be with this   i just want to get a ball  any ball  some god-forsaken-shot-in-the-dark-i-don't-wanna-die-ball  rolling ,9vz5w7
14,On the intrinsic vs instrumental value of work,first here's the philosophical definitions    gt    intrinsic value - the value that something has in itself    gt     gt    instrumental value - the value that something has because it helps us to get or achieve some other thing     i feel like most people mistake work as having intrinsic value when in actuality it's instrumental  we work because it gives us money which allows us to survive   perhaps for some people it gives them a sense of satisfaction which would add to this instrumental value  a politician boasts about increasing employment because of it makes them look good  again instrumental value  mistaking work's instrumental value for intrinsic leads to bullshit jobs which are seen as valuable despite the fact that they are ultimately pointless  this also prevents us seeking alternatives to work because we don't want to lose this perceived value ,9zh285

19,I Took Today Off From Work,i've been feeling sick for the last few days  thursday was the worst of it  i almost passed out at work  i was in pain all night and only got four hours of sleep  then i had a persistent headache  rectal bleeding  and a fever when i went into work  i couldn't decide if this was commendable on my part or not  feels like other people would say that it was   today  my symptoms persisted  so i decided to just stay in bed and rest  now i'm actually starting to feel better  all of my symptoms are gone- even the pain that kept me awake at night  i've probably just been driving myself too hard every day just to make a paycheck   i'm a little bit leery of what my employers are gonna say about it  seems like they'd rather have me in there sick as a dog then trying to recuperate   not pass on any illness to my fellow co-workers   i was mainly just tired of sacrificing my own personal health for a job where i'm not valued or appreciated ,9tnity
20,Sooo tired and want to quit...,hello fellow antiworkers  i just wanted to share my story with you and see what is your opinion about it    for nearly ten years i work in financial department of multinational corporation  work was always stressful  tight deadlines  calls from manager in the evening  working from home in the evening  no vacation  you name it  during financial crisis there have been major layoffs and i got additional work from two redundant employees  work became too much for me and i think i have burnt out in the last year  i can't take it anymore  on top of all that i have got daily nearly six hour commute  sometimes even more  i live for the job only  i want to quit so badly  but i have got kids to take care of  my wife works and we could live on her salary since we are minimalists and do not need much  i am a little bit scared of what will in-laws say since they are more traditional and expect for the man to be a breadwinner and that they could suggest her to leave me because i do not support family    i do not even have energy to prepare for job interviews and i am happy if i manage to go out of the bad  i sleep in most of the weekends  holidays and afternoons  it could happen i come home from work  fall asleep and then next morning wake up and go back to work    i really can't take this anymore and i think life should not be like this  i am sorry to type such a long post  i want to ask you if any of you have some similar experience and what would you do if you were me  thank you for reading and your answers   ,a18lsu
21,"I'm so tired of people thinking that having no identity outside of a job and ""being an adult"" are one in the same.",seriously  who came up with this idea  that you're only an  adult  when you're mindlessly wage-slaving under people who don't give a  's ass about you  and the more of your time you hand over to these people  the more of an  adult  you are    i understand that moving society forward via jobs is important  but for goodness sake  can people realize that that's not  what defines adults and gives them their real value  the process sucks  it's draining  corrupt  and disingenuous  nobody would do these sorts of jobs  as they are right now  without receiving compensation  which makes it clear that people don't take real  pride  in these jobs  and that at the end of the day it's mainly about the paycheck  so i will never understand why society tries so desperately to base someone's whole identity around it    in my opinion  being an adult is all about your age   your mental capabilities intelligence  those are the only two things should define somebody as a proper  adult  like  when i see people who think they're so high  amp  mighty for literally selling their lives away  talk down to others for not doing the same and prioritizing enjoyment fun happiness  as if they're children who don't have life figured out  ,9tq2y5

25,Thoreau knew it in 1854... it's so much worse today, the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation  what is called resignation is confirmed desperation  from the desperate city you go into the desperate country  and have to console yourself with the bravery of minks and muskrats  a stereotyped but unconscious despair is concealed even under what are called the games and amusements of mankind  there is no play in them  for this comes after work  but it is a characteristic of wisdom not to do desperate things     - henry david thoreau,9wb5c2

40,I quit my job today.,i worked for ups for over six months  almost seven  the last few months have been difficult  i would regularly go in feeling exhausted no matter how much sleep i got  i would take the bus ride in the morning and start to feel depressed about the fact that i had to go back to this same place over and over again  yet  i kept going because i had to pay my bills   eventually  i started feeling suicidal  i would daydream about killing myself  maybe that's just how my brain processes stressful situations  i don't know   i didn't feel like the management there listened to me  or valued my work  i felt like i was eminently replaceable  i saw lots of people come and go in a parade of unfortunate souls who would come for the paycheck and then leave once they found out how it really was   i should preface this by saying that i bought a 15 dollar pair of shoes from wal-mart knowing that they'd be torn up and beaten apart by all the walking around on concrete  and walking as part of my commute  that i would be doing  i had worn this same pair of shoes for about five months  yesterday  because they had a new staffing coordinator trying to learn the job and such  she pulls me aside and tells me that i can't wear these shoes to work anymore because it's  a safety issue  which is really odd because you'd think someone would have told me long before that if it was a serious concern      so at this point  i know they're just messing with me  trying to get my goat  during the conversation with the staffing coordinator  i'm trying not to pass out  i'm trying not to think about the box cutter knife sitting on the table behind me within arm's reach  soon after that  i clock out and leave thinking that  since rent is due within five days  i'm going to have to go back to wearing my older  more ratty pair of shoes to work for a few weeks  but whatever  i said to myself  i guess i'll do it      so the morning comes and the first thing i feel when i wake up early so i can start preparing for my work day is  oh geez  i'm going to be stuck here forever  the only way out is to take my own life  and i think about doing it  right there in my own house  that's when i decided to quit  i had to put my continued existence over keeping this job  i had to sit down and weigh the pros and cons of this job   here's how it went   pros     -getting a regular paycheck  cons     -having to commute three hours every day by using the bus  or fifteen hours a week     -feeling suicidal constantly at work    -it doesn't matter whether i work well or poorly     -management doesn't care about me     -my shoes are not the problem  or if they are  i should have been told long before this     -i'm tired of always being tired     -i'm not really paid well enough     -i don't get health insurance  holiday pay  sick days  or paid time off  i don't get anything     -and so on   so put all of those things together  and i just had to quit  nevermind that i might have to take another horrible job just to support myself  i suspect they're all horrible  but at least i won't have to go back to that same damn place again ,a0x6pf

45,Today I did something good. :),i have a part-time job at a warehouse mostly because taking on a full-time position would mean being out of the house 12 or 13 hours a day  on most federal holidays  they expect me to be in there  but the bus doesn't run  so i end up having to pay 35 dollars in lyft fees fora shift where i gross 48 to 60 dollars without holiday pay  this employer recently asked me to  work out  my inability to get to the job site  which is about a three-hour walk away from my house      so today i emailed them  to have a written record  asking for travel reimbursement  if they can't   won't do that  i won't go in on holidays anymore  ah  felt so good to stand up to them at last ,9veihy

51,Dealing with unemployment depression,i just wanted to start this by saying how overwhelmed i am to have found this subreddit       i work in a tech related industry where you are expected to go above and beyond for this career  i did a whole month of unpaid overtime at my previous position and they still treated me like dirt when i decided to move on       i've been unemployed for a few months now while i wait for my next job to start  they offered me a position much later in the year as they didnt have any available initially  i got in through a reccommendation from someone else working there    i've dealt with depression for a great deal of my life but these past few weeks it has really been dragging me down  i havent been able to successfully complete one single personal project during my time and i didnt realise how much of my worth i had tied to my career  i don't even think i know if i enjoy this career anymore or if i want to do it  but i know for certain that i don't want to expel anymore energy doing this sort of work outside of necessary work hours but it almost feels like i'm committing a crime admitting that      most of my old work friends went on and on for days about all the projects i could do with my personal time when i had these few months off and that overwhelming guilt is seriously damaging my mental health  have many of you dealt with this before  is it okay to treat a 'fun' career like a regular job or am i being incredibly ungrateful      thanks for reading  ,9wsopf
