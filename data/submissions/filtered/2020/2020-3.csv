2,"Verne Troyer's (mini-me) net worth was only $150,000 at the time of his suicide. Extremely low for an actor",i feel like his suicide was in large part a result of being broke  he had prominent roles in some hollywood blockbusters and featured in over 50 movies and tv shows   other actors with his background were easily worth millions  but verne  because of his natural-born short stature  had all the odds stacked against him  and even though he was loved by millions  couldn't get out of financial hardships   source   https theblast com c verne-troyer-estate-worth https theblast com c verne-troyer-estate-worth ,fpuc8d

23,I work at a grocery store and these past few weeks have been torture,i ve been seeing lots of posts on reddit about how we re now realizing that these mundane jobs are the backbone of america  and how the essential employees are very brave    i don t think i m  brave  my bills and rent payments are not stopping  i fucking wish i could quarantine but i have no choice  i have 40 hours of pto that i could use  but a week isn t gonna do shit  the situation is getting progressively worse  part time employees are calling left and right to tell us they won t be back to work until further notice  everyone is scared and our manpower is dwindling fast  no one that i work with has gotten the virus yet  but if one of us were to test positive it would be game over    customers are constantly thanking me for continuing to work  which is nice  but also i never had a choice  we were all just thrown into this  it was literally 0-100 overnight  one day  the store made 30k which is an average weekday for us  the next day  we made 150k  we do not have the staff to accommodate such an enormous spike  and especially not now since they re all starting to call out    i wish i had an alternative to pay my bills  i want to stay home so badly and abandon this burning ship  it s the panic buyers and the elderly who are constantly coming in and stocking up on more shit  i don t get it  y all weren t spending hundreds of dollars on groceries before  so why now  i haven t been buying any more than i normally would and i m doing a-okay  if you have kids i can understand why you d buy extra stuff  but if not  you have no excuse  all you re doing is putting a strain on everything    seriously  go out once a week  spend  100 tops on groceries  if you re single  and go home  i see soooo many regulars who still shop every day because they don t want to disrupt their daily routine  you deserve a kick in the nuts if that sounds like you    p s  you wanna know what really kills me  i now need to wake up early on my days off to buy my groceries  if i want to get stuff after finishing my shift  everything is already picked through and we get the scraps  the people you re calling brave need to eat and wipe their asses too  i ve resorted to stealing company toilet paper because there s absolutely none for sale in my small city  fucking jackasses ,fqkm11
24,How to keep staying in mental ressistance state?,resistance is the mental state  those words resonated with me when i found this link in antiwork section -  the matrix https web archive org web 20061120123840 https jdoe freeshell org howtos exitthematrix ar01s02 html    amp x200b   i noticed they way my mind dulls after forced subordination at   place i'm doing my trade time for money  it's like at first you come   and see all through the bullshit - the real view  through your own eyes   after a while it somehow gets into you and your mind submits  you start  to have a fear - emotional dependency based on how your superior views you    start to loose your sharpness  googles of bullshit your rebellious attitude  yourself       amp x200b   all the tricks bosses use to keep the spirit servile - saying that you ain't   gonna find better job  the power displacement feeling in job interviews - where  might-be future boss displays his power via subtle things  the taboo topic - that   somehow its forbidden asking about wage  the feeling that you somehow owe your   boss unpaid after hours  when you refuse - its like a matrix glitch  the tension in the  air and pressure to conform    amp x200b   i was being able to stay mentally free for a while  even being in a workplace    that's not paranoia - but somehow they sense it and pounce on it even if you work good   for example talking to a common programmer colleague about starting my own business  being  met with line - 'don't be stupid  ain't gonna work you don't know shit'  came from the boss    its like - the game of sucking your self esteem so you have nowhere to go except him       amp x200b   another example  service in the military  saw the colleagues transformation process  from human to a drone tried to keep mental freedom there - a lot of books  that reflect the view which i saw  kafka was my friend i tried to keep the freedom vibe via communicating with my colleagues  talking about themes related to outside world and post military plan  its like my boss sensed this 'insubordination'  even it was not forbidden to talk while working no officially forbidden themes also  - he said to me  those words    i will order you to carry bag and you will carry it  between the lines  don't forget that you are still slave   my mother told about her boss berating all workers in the meeting telling - you are too old to work not for me   my point is that resistance starts from the mind  when you start resists you see all invisible jails more easily  this war is invisible - they infect your mind with memes  slogans buzzword  till there is none left of real you  its like its required for you not to even work  but to be dominated spiritually also   basically i'm asking how to keep sharp self esteem in the workplace reality deeply i'm asking how to not to forget you are in the matrix and keep your awareness above this mental soul sucking swamp ,fpui7w

29,"Ctrl+V'ing a rant I just went on elsewhere, about companies taking advantage of WFH during COVID-19.",this pandemic is a chance to prove how valuable working from home truly can be  however  i've noticed many companies taking advantage of it  in my experience  since employees are all at their new  place of work  24 7  we can be contacted at any time  we have no commute  so there's more time to work  we can't go anywhere or do anything  so we have no excuse not to work  in my company's eyes   my workload has been steadily increasing for the past 6-7 months  even while working from home  my current workload justifies about 80-90 hours a week right now  and they don't offer ot pay   i had a hard enough time separating my work life and personal life before all this  and it's obviously only gotten worse the past two weeks  my boss contacts me all hours of the day  expecting me to be working  if i get everything done that's expected of me in 40-50 hours a week  i'm happy and my bosses are happy  but even working inappropriate amounts of ot the past few weeks  i've fallen behind   i feel guilty every time i take a break and ignore calls emails  but i'm not going to let my company take advantage of me  i've decided to cut my time off at 60 hours a week  which even then is 20 hours too many  if that's not good enough  then there are plenty of people looking for jobs right now that they should hire to help me out   if nothing else  covid-19 is a great chance to prove how viable wfh can be   i also acknowledge that 40 hrs of ot is better than no job or income at all  but i'm noticing companies are doing what they can to take advantage of this pandemic as well as their employees  and we need to be careful to not let it spiral out of control and not let them use this to squeeze out everything they can from us   that's the end of my rant  but i'm posting here because i'm curious if others are seeing similar attitudes from their employers  i also want to note that i'm very grateful i still have a job and i don't take it lightly  i live with others who weren't as fortunate  this will be an interesting financial situation to navigate  and obviously i'm doing everything i can to keep us all afloat ,friu6d

40,"I don't understand the obsession over ""careers""",it might be that i'm not a career driven person but i just have no interest in getting any kind of degree and having a career  the only benefit i can see from it is increasing your earning potential but in the end you're still trading your time for money  almost everyone acts like your job career defines you as a person and that it's part of your identity in a way  there's so much more to life than work and i cannot wrap my mind around why people not only put up with the whole system but also act live they love it  sure if you're saving lives or improving people's lives than i could see the satisfaction in that but a lot of jobs are meaningless bullshit hidden under a thin veil    there are lots of things i enjoy and have an interest in but none can be turned into viable ways to make a living  ask anyone if it's possible to make a living from music  art  writing or any of the other creative pursuits  it can be extremely difficult if not impossible and it turns out that those are the things i love in life  i might be able to force myself to get a degree i don't really want so i can get a job i don't want either but i'll never be excited about it like most people seem to be     just wanted to write out my thoughts on this subject ,fry4nc

44,The Current Situation,greetings all   things have changed for all of us quite a bit over the last couple months  and i just wanted to post a couple thoughts that can be taken with a grain of salt    this whole situation is going to get worse than it is now before it gets any better  everyone is getting antsy about jump-starting the economy  and when people panic  they make mistakes    considering that testing is not available everywhere  and  anecdote time  i know of two people personally that have symptoms but were just told to quarantine and were not given tests  this means that the count for the number of cases is likely lower than it should be  and nobody is following up with their points of contact  i cannot imagine that s making this situation better   misinformation campaigns are allegedly underway from russia  surprise  and probably others in an effort to create fear and panic  and it works very well because of our innate biological and psychological traits  it plays right into our weaknesses as people  we will believe something if it aligns more with our own personal viewpoints  we will dismiss or be outraged when they don t  we won t admit if we were wrong and double down on our viewpoint  and we will casually spread this information because we want to connect   to sum that up  panic about the economy  a lack of accurate data and widespread misinformation campaigns will keep this crisis a crisis longer than it needs to be   i hope everyone is healthy and stays safe  i know i m luckier than most right now  wfh  but i will do what i can in this crisis to help those in need  i plan on donating some of the stimulus check  assuming we get one  to my local food bank  and i m setting aside the rest to give to friends and family in need ,fpc45b

128,The problem with anti-work.,well  there's not too many problems with this sub  i mean  it's got great memes  and i'm sure all of you are very nice  but  unfortunately  a majority of the people in here are heavily indebted to the system in exchange for their lifestyles  this places them in a position where  although they would like to quit their job  they cant  how can you quit your job when you have a family to feed  or you're going to lose your house  that's not practical  right    so  most people on this group are against work  but this conflicts with the fact that their way of life requires work for them to maintain what we will refer to as 'values ' your values are things that are important to you  and can be objects  people  ideas  ect  money maintains most of our personal values  and money has also been implemented as the surrogate provider for most our our basic security values such as food  shelter  warmth  and water    money  that we get from working  provides us with the means to sustain values that we have acquired  a family eating is a value  an insurance payment on your new 2015 tundra is a value  new strings for a guitar or a dime sack of weed are values  ect  to sustain these values requires that you must work for them  because money is the method you have been given to maintain these things you care about  without money  we lose the ability to maintain values  and this is all very woven into our system    if there was a problem with this sub  it would be that most of us who have joined it are caught up in trying to maintain our values  in doing so  it has turned us into work-slaves  our prescribed suggested way of life is hardly free  everything has been reduced to you exchanging your hours for the ability to maintain or obtain that which is valued by you  we likely would have opted for independence from this system had we been offered a real understanding of social conditioning and the implications of social learning theory  but  we were not  and so now we work      main take away is  if you haven't already chosen expensive values and want to live freely  then choose what you will need to sustain extremely carefully  our society insists that having children  or we should go to school regardless of the debt  or a buy a new 2020 lease  but if you wish to live freely  these will almost definitely work against that goal  most of the people on this sub are so far into trying to sustain such a large list of values  that it is impossible for them to just 'walk away' from their perceived obligations  the money is no longer an option for those people  they must make it  or they lose what is important to them    it's true that most of us are enslaved not by work  but 'by the need to maintain values which require money to maintain ' humans have a tendency--and this is not always the case-- to tell others to do as they have done  almost like they're trying to see validation of their actions in other people  do not fall for this  use critical thinking to make your own decisions  and realize that if you're not careful  your list of values that require money and time to maintain will grow out of control  going with the grain is expensive  and comes with a steep price  be very careful with what you choose to value  because every single thing you must maintain owns a little piece of you  and if you rack up too much too quick  that's it  game over ,fna6sx

163,Why Bosses Suck: the Use of Knowledge in the Workplace,   during his life  economist philosopher f a  hayek was concerned about socialism  born in 1899  he grew up seeing the economic chaos that resulted from world war i- and the central planning which was adopted as a solution  the weimar republic  which ruled germany from 1918 to 1933  had become infamous for its hyper-inflationary policies which caused people to bring wheelbarrows full of money to buy a single loaf of bread- or to burn the money in fireplaces just to stay warm for a night  hayek  who grew up in austria  could not have failed to notice this  studying at the university of vienna in the early 1920s and working with fellow economist ludvig von mises helped shape hayek s thought process to be distrustful of government planning while seeing free enterprise in a favorable light   thus it was that  in 1945  when hayek wrote  the use of knowledge in society  for  the american economic review  journal  he was by then focused on proving that that socialism didn t work while suggesting that leaving business up to businessmen- rather than politicians who knew nothing about the enterprises they sought to regulate- would be more beneficial to society as a whole  couched in well-written  expressive  erudite language  hayek basically gave government socialists a slap on the wrist   however  he was so enamored of private business as being a savior and edifier of humanity that he failed to take his unique ideas as far as he could  in the article  hayek suggests that those who know any situation best ought to be the ones who make decisions about how to handle it  he uses the example of tin production  certainly  it may safely be asserted that most politicians don t know how to run a tin factory or a mine designed to extract tin from the ground  what hayek failed to mention  much less understand  is that not only do company owners have unique knowledge which allows them to more profitably run their business  but that employees- even entry-level employees- have unique knowledge that allows them to complete their tasks in an efficient  productive manner   this  of course  only applies to company employees who have been with the company long enough to learn how to become a better worker  this is another way of saying   practice makes perfect http journals sagepub com doi abs 10 1177 2372732215624708  the important point to note here is that employees will teach themselves the best way to complete a task without having been told what they are supposed to do- provided that they have the mental capacity to do so  they are also more familiar than their bosses with how other departments they work with may screw up and how to get around such situations    eventually  over the course of time  the employee becomes more knowledgeable about the job he s working  he is better able to formulate solutions  to offer advice on how to increase efficiency  the boss  manager  supervisor  or whatever authority  is often likely to reject such advice due to a combination of hubris and overwork   when bosses are overworked  they treat employees less fairly https hbr org 2018 06 research-when-managers-are-overworked-they-treat-employees-less-fairly - simply because they don t have the time to acquaint themselves with the particular circumstances that each employee faces  when this happens  production declines  the workplace becomes a bad place to be   bosses who are perceived as being incompetent are ultimately the ones who are least acquainted with the particular knowledge that each employee gains during the course of their employment  while there are some bosses out there who are absolutely toxic individuals  there are others who are not  those who are not toxic  who strive to be nice  may nevertheless lose the respect of their employees if they fail to notice or completely ignore what people around them have to say  bosses who want to want to act in a fair manner may instead act in an unfair manner by enabling that one bad department or person to continually screw up without any consequences  no matter how much of a nice person they are  no matter how well they actually behave  such bosses can nevertheless garner the ire of their employees by simply not knowing how to rectify a situation- something that seems blatantly obvious to those who experience it on a daily basis   what s worse  upper management types don t even seem to understand that the dynamic between boss and employee ends up breaking on a daily basis  rather  they d rather blame the boss s  personal failings https dougthorpe com 5-reasons-why-bad-bosses-suck-so-bad  as to why he s not doing well with his employees  there doesn t appear to be any self-critical analysis that i ve seen suggesting that some authority ought to be delegated  or that asking one human being responsible for an entire department to do everything limits that person s ability to make calm  rational decisions that help the company as a whole   rather  overworked bosses  and even those who are not  tend to focus on task completion  that s what they ve been put in charge to ensure  after all  they haven t been given a mission statement demanding increased efficiency  rather  all upper management- a group of people who is even further disconnected from the daily experience of the average employee- focuses on numbers  on production figures  on profits  many such people are unable to see that  rather than hiring organizational development consultants   such as these people http www od-consultants com  to tell them how to operate their business better  they need only go on the floor and ask their employees what needs to change in order for greater efficiency to be obtained   an organizational development consultant is basically a scammer who uses silly buzzwords and fancy pie charts and graphs to justify their salaries  they dress up in nice suits to convey the notion that they know what they are talking about it  in fact  the acquisition of knowledge does not depend on how well-dressed someone is  they seem to have all the answers  but this is only because their purpose is to gather information that bosses at all levels of authority have neglected to gain on their own  they then help develop a specifically tailored game plan for how the company can improve  the fact that companies so often fail to do this on their own- especially when they stand to make more money after having done it- suggests that bosses just downright suck  seen in this light  they are closer to production facilitators rather than catalysts for growth and positive change   all they would have to do to make their company better would be to listen to what each employee has to say  not every employee will be right  not every one will have a good idea  there will be some employees mixed in who are just punching time cards each day without any interest on helping out anyone but themselves  yet there will be honest  motivated individuals mixed in  if such individuals are ignored  they will go elsewhere- sooner or later  under these circumstances  stagnation not only becomes possible  but probable   rather than the savior and edifier of human society that hayek envisioned in the previous century  it becomes clear that  while offering a better alternative to government-sponsored socialism or communism  private enterprise nevertheless tends to centralize power and authority in the hands of a few who ignore the local knowledge that could best help their companies progress  had hayek worked in a european factory for half of his life rather than for various think tanks and universities  he may have discovered this on own  ironically enough  he did not possess the local knowledge needed to know how the local knowledge problem was being ignored on a daily basis in capitalist enterprises everywhere ,fmi6jj

259,Working from home this week has made me realise just how much busy work we do in our jobz and how much we pretend to work,title says it all and i am sure others have had the same experience   yesterday i did virtually nothing  i spend 30 minutes actually working  an hour and a half on calls  just listening  and the other 6 hours of my workday i spent watching youtube videos and dicking around on reddit   i work in corporate it and i know for a fact that one of my 3 immediate colleagues also did nothing yesterday  the other two have a little more on their plate  but i know that they still spent at least half the day idle  both of them signed off early  which they never do in the office   without our boss breathing down our necks my team is taking it easy  but here's the weird thing  there's no consequences at all    you would expect that a sudden lack in busyness would mean that all kinds of shit would pile up and all of our projects would fall apart   but that's not happening at all  the necessary work is still being done and our projects are still moving forward as normal    it doesn't make sense  at the office everyone buzzes around like anxious bees  but now we are working like 2 or 3 hours a day and we're getting the same result    my only conclusion is that we only ever work 2 or 3 hours a day  even in the office  the remainder is simply busy work and pretending    seems very pointless to me for people to spend all day at work and then do nothing  but i see now that that is the reality  when my colleagues and i are buzzing around the office it's all just a display for our boss ,fl7m1d

313,Its Happening,what a difference a couple months make   prior to that we were living our life accordingly  we had no choice  we were conditioned   our societal behaviour ingrained in us from birth  a working society where the majority of the workers were living from pay cheque to pay cheque in order to keep the bills paid  a roof over thier heads  and food on the table accumulation of stuff equated to wealth    that's the way its supposed to be  it keeps the capitalistic society running like a fine tuned engine  we are simply the grease to the machine   money is the fuel  eventually social anxiety and hopelessness is the end result  another by - product looks like it could be image unconsciousness  just check out the vanity posts   markets tank  socialism creeps in to muddy the grease  or to enhance its performance depending on how you see it  this is usually when peak democratic capitalist society comes to a grinding halt   remember that last sentence   this was the trajectory society was on  like it or not  just not knowing how to enact that change  it had to get better   right  socialism scares the  hell out of democratic capitalism   then the pandemic arrived  things changed   in a few short months  weeks even  the pandemic  modified our social behavior patterns like nothing we have ever experienced before  200 years of societal behaviour evolution  altered beyond recognition in days  on a global scale  a behaviour that goes against all of our standard norms  social interaction  large gathering places  world travel  and physical contact that up until now humanity belived it had to have to survive   we may have been wrong in making that assumption  i really hope so   the pandemic erased all of that  we are now forced into isolation  no physical contact  no large gatherings  no walking the dog  or talking to the neighbor over the fence  this goes against everything we are  seemingly an overnight 180 degree turn in the expectation of our societies behaviour  literally days   it got worse   world wide death  uncertainty  panic  closure of  borders  schools and non essential businesses  travel bans  and overwhelmed medicare systems  and financial markets tank  currency devalues as its the perfect delivery system for a pandemic  touch it and it could kill you  online businesses soar  our infrastructure was not designed for this    as a result we now see large progressive cities becoming ghost towns  martial law is right around the corner  this makes it harder to spend our hard earned cash  remember that is the only way capitalism survives   no fuel for the machine the pandemic is not just effecting our social behaviour  it is threatening the capitalism model as we know it  this is usually when the the peak democratic capitalist society comes to a grinding halt  sound familiar   governments cant stop a pandemic  history shows us this   governments first response is to soothe anxiety and avoid panic of the people   inevitably changing tactics only when they realize that the pandemic is spreading regardless of their efforts  too little too late  again  history has many illustrations of this    good news    there was a slow shift to get away from the normal rat race anyway  our existing model wasn't sustainable   younger generations had that figured out long ago  social media was already becoming the communication system of choice  alowing us to communicate in real time and without  borders  online shopping  home delivery services  and the ability to work from home and avoid the 5 day a week standard procedure  the overwhelming desire for healthcare which the pandemic has proven is woefully inadequate  this was going to be a slow process  it's hard to change overnight  and involves  painful job re-creation  and older societal generations must literally die off before the majority of the population can embrace it  harsh for a free society great for a pandemic   this pandemic is painful  as a society  as a human race  i know i'm living it    so  save your money or dont  invest your money or dont  sell your stuff or dont  it won't matter  this pandemic may have not only triggered the end of the peak capitalistic society model  it may have shown use what we can accomplish on the other side to make our society more livable the society goes on  the sun  is coming up tomorrow like it did yesterday  and the day before   for levity  look no further than hollywood  at two quotes that are more appropriate now than they have ever been   wyld stallyns    be excellent to each other   mr  spock     live long and prosper ,fkfoid

362,Manager Dangling Carrots - And Wanting Free Work - What To Do?,so  i walked into a nearby gym  spoke to the assistant manager and offered to write blog posts  after seeing a posting online they had on indeed looking for a full-time blogger  mind you  i called in advance and was instructed to come in and ask to see a manager  etc  i did this for the side income i needed to invest in my blog     day 1 friday   the asst manager there says  cool  the manager is busy  can you wait a bit   me   waits for 1 hour   asst manager    well  she's to busy to see you and i don't wanna waste your time  can you come back on wednesday    here are some red flags he said    also  the owner is old school  he still believes in flyers  but i can convince him   -  come in on monday  we'll be working alongside together anyways  -  can you do social media stuff to  - even though social media wasn't in the job post   i suggest i bring samples  i also say i need 20 hr  and this includes web design  social media  and blog posting  this is the financial equivalent of an  unskilled  worker getting paid in trident layers etc     day 2 monday   i come with some pretty decent social media samples that i photoshopped and a blog post  equivalent to three hours work  work that was super impressive for a boomer  however  it didn't take that long for me because that's my skill  think of it like how it takes the average runner 5 hours to run a marathon  but an olympian can do it in only 2   so  i show him some 5-star samples and even do some consulting  etc  he says that i will be meeting up with the manager on wednesday   later in the day  he talked about needing to update his gyms hours and he needed a simple flyer  which i did as a show of good faith  it was simple to copy-paste word editing and formatting  but i still did most of the work   every day he says that he's putting in a good word for me to the manager    day 3   tuesday   on day 3 he texts me to call him  i call him  he talks about the managers love what i've been doing etc  then he tells me that they won't be coming in because they're old and paranoid of the coronavirus  but he also needs me to update another flyer - so far  i still haven't made a dime yet   then  he tells me that he is understaffed and would like me to work the  front desk  and answer calls  do sales  etc  this is temporary because some of his staff are high-risk for coronavirus e g respiratory issues  old age  but still hasn't even paid me a dime yet  i stupidly agreed to start tomorrow at 9 am to increase my chances of sealing the deal   he keeps complimenting me and sweet-talking me but i don't give a rats ass  i also forgot to ask him what my compensation will be when i work at the front desk  because i previously told him that i want 20  per hour   he only told me that i would get commission and that's all  but guess what  these guys are struggling to get customers and that's why they need a guy like me in the first place     amp x200b    summary    -gave free work   -keeps dangling carrot  and postponing a meeting with the manager for my actual job i applied for   -wants me to work a different job then i applied   -afraid he won't give me the same compensation for the different job   day 4  wednesday today  tbd   i'll make an update if you want     --------   my question   even though i previously agreed to come in yesterday  would i be an asshole if i changed my mind  if i called in advance and asked if he was going to bring my paperwork to get paid upon the first day  then if he doesn't  i refuse to come into work   because if i decide to quit the day after  i still want to get paid for the first day i actually work  which will be later today   i honestly was desperate  because i lost some clients due to the corona  but i feel like i'm being taken advantage of  i already gave them technically over 5 hours of free work   p s  hate to toot my own horn  i'm talented and hardworking for my age  but also young and look that way  late teens to early twenties  which might be the reason why he thinks he can  screw  me    any advice ,fkleig

I can’t escape.,so i  soon to graduate university student  only went because winning a trophy for my mother seemed better than implied homelessness  basically expressed to my mother and sister  college aged  that the idea of having a 9-5 6 nowadays  is bothersome to me  and when it became apparent that i hate school and working  nothing but papers and deadlines  they went with  but what would you do all day  and i couldn t give an answer since i knew that  hobbies  would have earned derision for my apparent laziness  then my sister started with the  if you work hard  you can have freedom  and  just work harder  and before even questioning how we turned out so different  she started going on about how her friend started a hair reviewing channel reviewing sponsored wigs from china on youtube 2 years ago as a high school senior and had 100k now and made enough money to buy her own mercedes  she praised her friend for having the  work ethic   which  given the evidence of min wage laborers that work all day  makes it clear that  work ethic  is doublespeak for money-making ability  and said that she might be able try something like that in youtube too and buy her own mercedes  i tried to tell her about all the factors that she would need to even stand a chance  consistent uploading and editing  parents who wouldn t try pressuring her to get a job since successful youtubing nowadays is a full time job  but it was completely disregarded  she then went on about other side hustles i could try  completely ignoring my counter arguments about needing marketable business ideas  investment capital  free time  or a combination of the three   when my sister was done lecturing me  my mother then asked me to come home from school since i had the opportunity  virus closing schools  but i refused because my home environment  while not directly abusive anymore  makes me uncomfortable since i don t like being around the people who live there   am i crazy for not having this  work ethic  do i really have no options if i want to avoid homelessness  i m not even asking to improve my standard of living  is having the opportunity to maintain it  a small dorm-like room with internet access  really that much to ask for  especially when many other students in my school  especially international  are born with much more than that that they will have access too even out of graduation   at the very least  i can t handle being around people so caught up in propaganda  you would think that the coronavirus madness would let people start questioning their lives ,fikm9h

414,Office jobs red flags,i see a lot of posts about people moving from catering or customer service to their first office job and thinking it'll be all dandy  obviously they can google red flags but i've learned a few myself that aren't as commonly discussed   1  if the bosses are all older men  doesn't even matter which color  this is an old boys club and they will stick to their backward  bootstrap  ways no matter what   2  if your supervisor or manager has direct stake in the company  this is usually true for smaller partnerships  your performance will directly affect their profits so they will breathe down your neck  whereas if you have a salaried manager it's more likely they don't care bc their salary is the same no matter what you do   3  if they literally tell you red flags in the interview  yes interviews are a farce with rehearsed answers and questions  however if someone repeatedly asks how you deal with conflict or stress  there will be conflict or stress  nope outta there   4  if they guilt trip you about discussing salary  it's borderline if not entirely illegal and proves they  know  they're underpaying you  and are worried they won't get away with it   5  if there is a high turnover in the role  speaks for itself  question why all those other guys left   also random tips   you are being exploited no matter what  however these jobs don't allow unions and you must be your own union  always negotiate  always push back   gossiping isn't as bad as people say  it's not necessarily true they're gossiping about you too  sometimes humans need something to bond over  as long as it's not cruel or damaging  fine to engage to make the day go by faster and find someone who will have your back   anyway hope you enjoyed my weird generalizations  have i missed anything ,fgvbv5

452,"Why do people assume just because you love a hobby (esp if you excel at it in amateur levels), that you will love doing it for a living? Has anyone found out how hard the pro leagues can be the hard way?",we always hear stuff like  follow your dreams  and the best recipe for successful wealth is  pick something you love so much an make a career out of it   and indeed you see to many people and not just kids and teens  but even adults  think that being a professional mma fighter would be a fun job or assume just because you love eating cheeseburgers you can make a career at food eating contests  etc   recently i attempted to go pro at magic the gathering  i used to always beat my friends as well as other random people at bars and restaurants in betting matches and win big bucks  i won a small local tournament earlier this year so i decided i would go pro  but when i started this month i was getting my but whooped against even bottom tier ranking pro players and even amateur tournies that are above the ones i used to win at the local level  i practically lost all my gambling money and a large chunk of reserve cash i put specifically for this career on a rainy day   in addition i never thought how stressful and hard stuff i used to do such as organizing my magic deck could be when your paycheck is dependent on it  and i'm so surprised how even the worst of the worst players at upper level amateur contests and professional gambling and dueling can be  every trick i used that easily won me cash against friends and other people in my local neighborhood was easily countered and i could not develop any new strategy  in addition even just buying the equipment to keep up with the recent trends is extremely expensive   so i am curious if anyone here ever tried to go pro at their favorite hobbies and backed out instead for an easy secure job or college like i did with magic  why do so many people especially commentators giving advice think that not only will you excel at something you love if you work at it for a living  but you will still easily stay in said career despite failures and setbacks simply because you love the job   its repeated so often in the media and by commentators that you'd think its a guaranteed formula  but i learned first hand the hard way even the bottom levels of professionalism of your favorite hobby is so difficult you might end up hating the hobby  which i actually did with magic after i decided to abandon pro gaming for almost a month until my sister convinced me to start playing with her again   has anyone here tried to go for the nba or become a professional martial artist or played at esports as a pro gamer or other stuff you had a passion for as an amateur and backed out because of the shock of how hard a career is  even going as far as temporarily abandoning the hobby because you grown to hate it for a while after attempting to go pro with it and seeing how much of a pain in the but doing your hobby is when you work at it for a living and not just for fun and games   please put your examples when you tried to go pro when you were younger ,fhd4uh

484,Putting in my two week notice today,i m nervous about it and how my life is going to go  i just knew i needed a break from working 40 hour work weeks  i had to get up even earlier to catch the bus so my commute was usually 30-40 minutes  getting a ride meant i had to get up even earlier    i started out doing something i didn t mind and i could listen to music but that ended one day and i was switched to working on the computer  not only was i making a few mistakes but i also was tired out of my mind and nodding off everyday  i wish i only had to give one week notice so i could let next week be my last but of course i need them as a reference  i did feel bad for leaving because everyone here is really nice but i hate that i feel bad  this is my life and i want to do something different   i wish i had started to save because then i could take even more time off  i m going to continue working on the book i ve been writing and hopefully publish it as soon as possible  that probably won t make me any money but it s a passion project so i m fine with doing it even if it doesn t make money    i can t wait to enjoy my time off ,fhgcuu

499,I'm trying to take a medical leave from my job and HR outed me,over the last several months  my mental health has taken a nose dive  i'm not going to kill myself  but i am definitely not well  and it is very clear that a lot of that has to do with my job  i won't get into the details  but my therapist suggested the idea of a medical leave  so i decided to contact hr to request information  in that email  i specifically said i hadn't spoken to my supervisor about this issue  and would appreciate the matter being kept quiet until i was able to review the information and decide if i wanted to take a leave    this morning i arrived in the office to an email containing the information i'd requested  with the director of my department cced  immediately i had to do damage control  now it looks like i was hiding this from them  and that i was trying to take a leave at an objectively busy time in our office without providing any notice  i don't even know for sure if i will be taking the leave yet  and had planned on notifying them in my own way once i had everything in order  i hadn't notified management because i didn't want to make something out of potentially nothing    i contacted hr to let them know i was upset about this  to which they said  it's policy  that's fine  and i respect that  but it blows my mind that they chose to not acknowledge my request for privacy at all  i would be significantly less upset if they had told me they couldn't maintain my privacy  i gave them that feedback  and then they stopped replying    what the fuck is the point of hr  what is the point of trying to care for yourself in a work environment when it obviously doesn't fucking matter  i probably won't take the leave now  and will probably be under  admittedly unintentional  scrutiny at work as a result of them outing me ,fe4ktw

513,An aspect of capitalism I don't see discussed enough: Capitalistic doctrine is genetic supremacy.,the mythos of capitalism  regardless of how much it actually operates this way  is that the more capable a person is of providing a service which is useful to the economy  the more they will be rewarded for doing so  while there is absolutely a large aspect of luck and class advantage that this explanation doesn't address  this is the stated goal  and there are a few small ways in which capitalism achieves it  at least in that a person who wants to do economically valued labor is more likely to be rewarded than a person who doesn't   however  i want to point out something about the usage of  capable  and  economically valued   the elephant is the room when talking about people's capability to provide labor is that not everyone actually has the same capabilities  people are born with genetic-related disabilities  and disabilities are not the only disparity in ability that exists between people which can be seeded before birth  while it's far harder to measure the exact differences in capabilities between individuals without something so obvious as a disability to point them out due to the endless well of other factors at play  i also would rather this not be measured  as it's info that could only realistically be used for evil  we do at least know that nature plays a significant role in how a person's behaviors and abilities develop  the reality is that we just don't know how big this factor is  but we know it exists to some degree  even if you take the stance that everyone who doesn't have a clear disability is on even footing genetically  the issue still remains of that subsection of people who aren't   the problem herein is that the extension of this logic is that some people  by circumstance of birth  are more capable of being useful to a capitalistic economy than others are  regardless of what context you put them in  this means that by arguing that a person  should  be rewarded for being able to contribute to the economy  a person is also arguing  by logical extension  that some people are simply inherently deserving of a better life than others   while support programs for people with disabilities raise the floor for the most adversely affected by this reality somewhat  they don't put them on even footing with others  and they don't address the core of the issue  a capitalistic society believes that they deserve less than others do  simply for existing  that's the reality  one cannot argue for capitalism without accepting that they are arguing this ,feqdlk

594,desperate for change,i'm barely hanging by a thread at this point  i've been unemployed for quite a few months now and it's ruining me  i took a break from work but i've realized there is no way out and my generalized anxiety hinders me in ways unimaginable  so far i've only been called for one interview and they haven't contacted me since  and this was a job i applied for experience in my chosen field but only pays  20-30 a day  i only found out about the pay on the day of the interview and knew there was no way i could accept an offer like that anyway  is this what a college education gets you in america    it hurts to know that this is just the beginning since i'm still new to the workforce and have so much life ahead of me  i don't look forward to life the same way i used to before the academic and financial pressures i've endured throughout high school  i don't last longer at a job for more than 4 months at a time and it's starting to show on my resume  i want to die during moments like these  what is the point of all this suffering and toiling for a degree only to walk out of university unemployed and a husk of my former self   i don't know which steps to take next  i've been working fast food and retail for so many years now and i'm dead tired of it all  i don't want to go back to that kinda life again i was hoping things would improve after graduating from uni but it seems a degree only made things worse by setting the bar even higher for myself    i've always pushed for excellence in myself whether at school  uni  or the workplace but now i'm past the point of no return  i hate society with every fiber of my being sometimes  but i know everyone is just as much a victim as i am  and i think this is largely due to social alienation my whole life  i've never been tied to any community and grew apart from extended family  my childhood was traumatic and i still can't get over it  as a result  i've been struggling with severe depression and social anxiety since i was 15  it only adds to the weight upon my shoulders  and this is one of the main reasons why i can't stay in these jobs for too long    people fill me with dread and i cannot fathom an existence where i have to work a till and make small talk with people 8  hours a day five days a week any longer than i already have endured  i know that's highly anti-social behavior and i've been confronted so many times for not wearing a plastered smile on my face at all times but it hurts to smile  it hurts to talk and to reach out for help when you're certain you don't deserve anything good in this life   i wish i was more sociable and inviting and charismatic but i'm none of those things and never will be  what a wretched existence i've found myself in  but no use pitying myself  it's never going to get me anywhere  i just wish there was an alternative but no  for as long as we're alive in this world  capitalism will prevail as the dominant economic system around the world and it's truly disheartening   i don't believe i should be voicing my opinions at all on here but i wanted to do something to end all this suffering  and no i don't mean suicide but direct action against all the big employers and corporations  starting with american ones  we need to start acting now if we're ever going to see change in our lifetimes  we can't keep living like this or can we    anyways  thanks for reading my post ,feohvt

604,"Relatively new to the sub, my thoughts &amp; observations, etc.",after having been put through the mill by three previous employers and had to leave either by choice or by force because they either carried out immoral illegal practices or allowed a toxic work environments to manifest  i have for the last 10 months relegated myself to caring for my immediate next-of-kin who both struggle with different disabilities while claiming the relevant welfare with respect to my caring commitments to cover my living expenses  and i kinda like it better this way - it's not without its drawbacks  but at least i'm not dealing with corporate bullshit on a daily basis    i eventually found myself gravitating to towards this sub because its ideals and what it stood for appeal strongly to me after being on the receiving end of various forms of corporate malice during my time in the workplace - including  but not limited to  being a victim of corporate surveillance prior to eu privacy laws  i'm in the uk for context  personal attacks  psychological abuse  being overworked  being underpaid  being undervalued  being undermined  and being underappreciated    on monday morning  i had to go out of the house as i had some personal matters to attend to  as this was during 'rush hour'  i could not help but sneer at all the worker ants cockroaches rats ensnared in this trap are in hurry to get to their to 9-5s  which most of them probably hate  all of these people who are so inured to the system need to have the wool pulled from over their eyes  but this is not going to be easy with the multiple levels of indoctrination that are in place to keep them in line  in check  and in compliance unquestioningly - including  but not limited to exposure to mass media and propaganda   with regards to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak  i'm hoping that it will be enough to cause substantial damage to the capitalist system  we've already seen stocks take a nosedive  and help shatter the illusion and idealism that society under a capitalism system is perfect and not without faults  along with all of the other lies we've been told  a rising tide lifts all boats   trick le-down economics  etc  coronavirus also has the potential to be a double-edged sword for humanity itself - the downside is that people are going to die  the pro-capitalist boomers being the largest at-risk demographic  and no one with a sane mind is denying this inevitability  the upside is that humanity has the potential to come out the other side far stronger and better than before  lastly  humanity is long overdue an outbreak to thin the herd   from my perspective at least  the line between 80s soviet communism and capitalism is slowly beginning to blur  they exhibit disturbingly similar characteristics  with greedy elites at the top dictating the well-being and the lives of those less fortunate  hbo's chernobyl goes in to detail regarding this  so one could argue that they are both as bad as each other - and either the way the game is rigged  two sides of the same coin  with humanity's freedom or servitude hinging on either side of the coin  if you will   i don't understand why modern day society is so frightened of the word  socialism  both the words society and socialism share the same etymology or root word  for andrew vincent   t he word 'socialism' finds its root in the latin sociare  which means to combine or to share  the related  more technical term in roman and then medieval law was societas  this latter word could mean companionship and fellowship as well as the more legalistic idea of a consensual contract between freemen    wikipedia  how has this honestly not occurred to people sooner  my guess would be that it's owing to decades of indoctrination in the education system  and then being further dumbed down by mass media specifically catered to appeal to the lowest common denominator  looking directly at you with a death glare  murdoch ,fgf8wz

623,[Meta] Why has this sub become a place to despise rich people for no reason?,i thought this sub was for pursuing a career away from a 9-5 workplace and trying to find a life where you can work for yourself    i don t mind the posts about complaining about the 9-5 life because that s also related  but now  almost every post that gets to the top is about having this hate and bitterness towards rich people  how is that related  on top of that  more people whine about how little money they make than talking about how to get away from work life    this sub isn t even about being poor  people who make 150k  also have the same feelings about work that a minimum wage worker does   and worst of all  the people who complain about being poor will hold anyone accountable except for themselves  it s ridiculous  no doubt there are a lot of inequalities in wealth and opportunity  but thinking that it s impossible to move up in life is absurd  i see comments blaming the government for not teaching financial or family planning and that s why people become poor  seriously  the example they used is that someone leasing a car doesn t know that 9 times out of 10 it s a bad idea  but they weren t taught interest rates  seriously  we re going to blame the government for something like that  anyone can fucking learn about it online  anyone old enough to buy or lease a car should know that  the information is not secret  but fuck holding ourselves accountable  it s everyone s fault but ours    the example they gave was that when the government reaches financial planning  people benefit  well  yeah  the government could also install sprinklers on every single lawn in the country and grass would benefit  but does that mean if my grass dies then i should blame the government for not watering it for me  no  i could ve just watered it myself    it s a terrible mentality to have if you re trying to pursue more in life  and pursuing more in life is what this sub is about  or what it was about    rant over,ffy2ol

632,"Employers should be required to post pay range, and benefits for all positions posted.",there is so much time wasted by companies not being transparent about their job postings  it's all about what they expect from you  with only a very generic list of benefits for you  such as  401k  health care  dental care  ect  it makes it incredibly hard to compare jobs when you often don't even know how much they pay until the interview  and most of the time don't know the full benefits until they make a offer or after you're hired  i feel like there needs to be a government mandate that certain information must be provided on any job posted  full disclosure of pay  and a full disclosure of benefits  this would save a ton of money  and effort by so many job hunters  and prevent companies from playing hide the ball from prospective employees ,fdsefe

642,Doing the simple time math on having a full time job and what it means for free time (unacceptable),i work from 9-5    i wake up at 7 am to get ready and go for the commute to work   i arrive home at 6 pm from my commute back from work   i have finished preparing  eating and cleaning up after dinner at 7 pm   now i go to the gym from 8 pm till 9 pm and arrive back home at 9 30 pm   in order to get enough sleep i need to be in bed by 11 pm if i want my 8 hours of sleep cause i'm getting up at 7 am   so someone who works a full time job with a reasonably short commute and a single gym routine for health and well being outside the gym - essentially ends up with a maximum of an hour and a half of free time during the day on a typical work week   now i know that some people genuinely enjoy their work and some find fulfillment and subjective meaning in it and they like it and feel pride in it etc  but at the end of the day whether that is 50 percent of the adult human population or 5 percent of the population is ultimately very hard to ever prove - because there are people who indeed claim to 'love their job' but to some extent that is a coping mechanism in many cases i would think    better to tell yourself and others that you love like your job than to admit that you are forced to doing something that you honestly find rather unpleasant for the majority of your waking hours  in life and the only alternative is starvation on the street - therefore many likely convince others and themselves that they love or at least somewhat like their jobs  despite it perhaps not being completely true   i get that things aren't black and white  life is full of gray area and many nuances  back before the existence of money and agriculture and civilization and division of labor etc  humans like other animals had to roam around the wild to find food - and the failure to do so  or not being succesful in doing so meant starvation and death  so it's not only due to money and society and  the evil rich men who control everything  or whatever cliche  it's also just  biological life that quite fundamentally is a ruthless asshole    but to me - ever since i was 10 years old and gradually started getting a sense of how the world worked for adults i was baffled about the whole forced labor for income paradigm where your right to life  shelter and food came down to earning money through submission to work  it always depressed me and horrified me    later in my teens i got into the venus project and the zeitgeist movement and philosophers like alan watts and many others talking about automating the vast majority of human labor and entirely doing away with this arbitrary man made invention called 'money'  they would talk about how through technology and rational scientific application of sane solutions to poverty and food production and distribution - overcoming many of these fundamental problems of scarcity  competition and human misery and drudgery would be entirely possible from a strictly technical point of view  even decades ago   here i am turning 30 soon and still utterly and completely horrified and sad and angry and depressed with how human society works in terms of money and jobs and all the insincerity  pretense  manipulation  exploitation and fundamental idiocy surrounding this elaborate fiction of money and the made up economy based on nonsensicality    most of us are going places we don't want to go to  to do things we don't want to do  for many hours a day  for reasons we don't believe in  with people we don't want to be around  all to be allowed to be alive    that is to say - we do shit we hate in order for us to go on  doing things we hate  such is life   i think it to be rational and sane and valid and reasonable to want to commit suicide considering this laughably insane and atrocious state of affairs that many view as normality    and i have thought like this for 2 decades now  i fundamentally despise that we have to work to be allowed to be alive and i do not think that  it has to be that way - you need to sell phone subscriptions or sell television sets in exchange for being allowed to eat  most actual modern labor is not rational or sane or pragmatically necessary or overall a positive contribution to life    is it possible from a technical point of view to use the best of science and technology to automate the vast majority of   gt gt necessary lt lt   labor and set humanity free to live our finite lives as we please without being forced to work our short lives away in exchange for a pay check    and is it possible to clothe  house  feed  educate and provide medical care etc  for literally every single human being on planet earth through mostly technical automated means in 2020 if that was indeed the explicit clear aim of modern civilization    if not  then just get back to work or starve i guess  and all you people who claim to love your jobs  let me see you do it full time for a few years consistently in the complete absence of junk food  cigarettes  alcohol  coffee etc  to numb your authentic feelings of misery and despair ,fbyu85

675,I don't know what the F to do,sorry  this is just a rant  i'm nearly 30 years old but have no  formal  job experience since i come from a complicated family situation and i've been struggling with depression and adhd all my life  i tried to go through uni until recently  when i finally had to quit because i couldn't make it work in my circumstances and it was only worsening my mental health  then i met my current partner  and came from a small rural town to the biggest city in my country that's  supposedly  brimming with jobs  to live with him and away from my toxic family hoping to find whatever job i could do and live in peace  of course that's turning out to not be possible for me either  it's already been a year since i'm here  living off what little savings i had till now because i couldn't find a single fucking part-time job where they'd hire a career-less 30 year old  only fast food and that only lasted me a month since  i wasn't fast enough in the kitchen  i'm functional  capable of physical work and pretty sociable despite my illness  i don't even talk about my mental health when applying because i know that's an instant reject  but an empty resume at my age is an instant reject anyway  what i'm supposed to do  then  today i told my partner that this month's rent is all i have left after a year  a whole fucking year trying  he broke down crying  said he doesn't want me to leave  i don't want to leave either since i don't really know where i would have it better  it broke my heart  and it isn't even my fault  is it  i feel so powerless  i'm a somewhat skilled artist and do commissioned work here and there but that doesn't give me enough to live either  i dream of a life in which it does  i look for part-time jobs because i know full-time will absolutely obliterate my mental health like uni did  but people react to it like i'm being picky and not willing to  make real effort  i'd rather have my face blasted off my head before admitting that people who are looking to preserve their health and just fucking enjoy their lives are being lazy  we're just trying to live out here ,fdo7y9

678,A concern about this sub,hey guys  i love being here with everyone and i have to say that i agree with everything here-well no-mostly everything    i don t think this is how far society can advance  tons of people having to suffer to make someone rich who doesn t care for his employees unless they re up in the ladder right with them  where employees are thrown to side and seen as being disposable if you don t want to work through hell for little to no pay    that said  i have noticed an alarming amount of people who are slipping into this ideal of extreme socialism or even communism and as great as that would be  it would only bring about a disaster  these ideas are absolutely amazing  great theories that can save so many peoples lives and better humanity as a whole  however  they are just that  ideas and theories that sound great  but time and time again when they ve been put to the test  it only creates even more suffering than what we currently have now with capitalism  such ideas will only work in an ideal society and sadly  we are very far from that world    reality is cruel and there will always be someone seeking power for themselves and not for anyone else  although we all share a common interest goal  we need to be a little more realistic and not leap over boundaries which we cannot reach to hope  please try to remember that the step to a better society starts slowly  gradually growing  an instant jump from capitalism to communism or a similar ideal could lead to disaster and ruin economy s  i guess what i want to say is that some people here are seeming to become very extreme in their beliefs and the sub as a whole looks as if it is continuing to grow in that direction    we can do better than what we are at now  i agree the amount of work we do is absurd  they are people literally dying of exhaustion and being overworked  but we mustn t abolish what we worked for and learn to keep our minds levelheaded and clear    tldr  love you guys  great subreddit  but please stay calm before we turn into an extremist sub and lose our trail ,fc5k6l

686,"As a Marxist (Neo-Trotskyite), journeyman Silicon Valley technologist and intentional empath that was raised in a fundamentalist Christian cult, the following content constitutes my ideas as to what compels work and the suffering of work in our lives . (Part 1 - Religion)",1  religion   a   prosperity theology https en wikipedia org wiki prosperity theology       i  prosperity theology is a tract of evangelical christianity spread by people like pat robinson and joel osteen that says that life  god  will reward those  in a  deterministic https en wikipedia org wiki determinism  way  that work sufficiently hard or are sufficiently  good  in such a way that they will not suffer economic disenfranchisement       ii  i find that this paradigm  the actual effective reality of individuals toiling under the dynamic  is most aptly summed up in the implications raised by the words  arbeit macht frei https en wikipedia org wiki arbeit macht frei  pastors operating under this doctrine actually have the gall to go to communities where  in my specific case  the average income was  17k yr and tell individuals living in an environment of innate socioeconomic disenfranchisement and irrelevance that the reason they are poor is because they drink and fornicate and do not love god enough  regardless of your individual beliefs  which i do not seek to take from you and actually just hope enable you to be a kinder and happier person  this is a cruelty that we ignore out of what i think is kindness  criticizing and attacking religion is in many ways an attack on the spirit of the poor and i am sensitive to that  however  the fact that this is the case is something intentioned by the parties that benefit from the dynamic existing at all  this being the republican party  the vague shapeless face of the anti-intellectualism movement  alternative medicine  antivax  flat earth  the cult of memes that attacks the very definition of what a fact is that can most be most simply qualified as existing in abundance around donald trump  the republican party's rejection of science at any point of convenience  and corporations that actively prey on the innate vulnerability of the working class for labor       iii  god existing at all forces a dynamic where we apply intent and dignity to the phenomenology of poverty  this is used to ensure the preservation of a underclass that can be the fuel for the comfort of the ruling class  i don't mean to make all of these posts just be an endless allusion to scifi and history  but this dynamic is most fully explored in  'brave new world' https en wikipedia org wiki brave new world  with its  epsilon's https study com academy lesson epsilon-in-brave-new-world html  this slave class creates the basement of experience that acts as reinforcement of the value of the pleasure experienced by the other classes  if you were to poll the poorest people in this country  the bulk of them would tell you that they believe in god  it's funny how piety  the hope of salvation  is only so often seen in the poor  i'll talk about this more in a future segment of this series  but i am very confident in stating that the bulk of us are oppressed because we feel bad at some level for just wanting to do what we want with our only shot at existing  or at least that is why i am learning programming so as to have as not miserable a job as possible and reject the capitalist institution at every opportunity      b  death apologia      i  death apologia can most easily be summed up as any formal defense of death as a necessary component of life  as someone that worked at a  y combinator https en wikipedia org wiki y combinator  biotech startup  albeit only as a fundraiser  for four years and who also identifies as a  transhumanist https en wikipedia org wiki transhumanism  i quite happily reject the necessity of death  it might necessitate us changing the way frequency that people reproduce  and doing so might require a greater degree of democracy and agency afforded to the individual we have now  the way that we use resources  and a renegotiation of economic systems  but reality is such that we're well on our way to solving the mechanisms of death and halting the syndrome of it in most humans       ii  we might  re  probably  not see it in our lifetime  but the  technological singularity https en wikipedia org wiki technological singularity  is coming  whether it be  artificial intelligence https www mckinsey com featured-insights future-of-work ai-automation-and-the-future-of-work-ten-things-to-solve-for part2  or  synthetic biology https en wikipedia org wiki synthetic biology  we are nearing the end of material and energy scarcity  which i am going to cover in a future installment of this series  and must begin to prepare for it now  capitalism is such that we  will  see arguments calling for the intrinsic necessity of scarcity  without scarcity  what will the wealthy judge their fortunes by       iii  to invoke a personal story as evidence of this dynamic  i would like to point out that my pastor grandmother has been waiting to die since she was about fifty years old  she fundamentally believes that life in the now  what we and most rationalist thinkers would call her one shot at existing at all  is all window dressing for an eternity spent in worship at the feet of some highly fetishized god  she has not savored one moment of her life without feeling sorry for not appreciating the hereafter enough  it's one of the most tragic things i've ever encountered  as i write this  i cannot think to call it anything other than eldritch or an aberration  for no reason other than her class and the region that she was born into  she has effectively wasted her one shot at existing wishing for the hereafter  please empathize with the fact that this is a delusion and something that she would have been much better for to be cured of years ago  as it stands  the symbiote has become the host and vice versa  she is mostly religion at this point  her sanity sinking into a stew of delusions that she will never emerge from  even as i stress constantly the necessity of freedom of religion as a consequence of the pursuit of liberty i recoil from the heinous effect of it in the individual  we talk with horror as to the effects of meth  but ignore the effect of nonsensical faith in the unknown  if i am wrong  i'll see you all in hell  however  if i am right as i think i am  i don't even get that  we stop existing the second we're dead and warm and i think it enriches the experience of life in general to speak of it so freely    to cap this off  it is important that we start to examine the institutions that oppress our most vulnerable as these are the institutions that are going to rebel against the destruction of work for everyone in the wake of the decline of scarcity  this being something that i am going to cover in the next few days  i'm going to leave you off with a couple of posits    do you gain peace by embracing this life as your one shot  if not  does that scare you   what are policy ideas that you think should be implemented in the near future   what do you think we are going to fuck up integrating into our day-to-day life ,fc7hwl

Now my first job is frustrated that my availability has changed.",when they hired me i left a full time position because the new job kept throwing around the phrase  part time for now  during the interviewing and onboarding process  well three years later and i'm just as part time as i ever was  with no health benefits  and not making enough to build up a savings  so i went out and i found a second job to supplement my income  well  now my managers at the first job aren't happy that i am requesting certain days off for my new job since they were used to changing up my schedule constantly to fill their needs    i really don't know why mid-level management so often takes on the perspective of their superiors as opposed to their employees whom they see and interact with every day    i think the worst part is that i actually feel guilty about this more than anything else  i feel like i'm letting down my fellow coworkers who might have to pick up the slack when i'm not available  when in reality  i know that management is letting them down by not having a plan other than taking advantage of part time workers' time    but i still can't shake the feeling that i'm doing something wrong here    i brought this up to my boss last week  and i said i was feeling spread pretty thin because on certain days i was having to start at one job  leave and go to the other job  and then come back and finish the day out at my current job  my boss kind of chucked and condescendingly replied  well  that is just kind of how it is when you work two jobs  as if i were simply doing it for enjoyment ,fd29kk

746,"""Just get a better job"" is a lie-- not even NASA was good enough",its not you  its the system  there is no skill or worth  no rhyme or reason  only luck and who you know  or dare i say  who you blow  through out my 20s i've learned that only people who lie and cheat and are generally horrible  make it   i was told so many times by older friends that i had to pull myself up to better myself  i fell for it in a lot of ways  at the time i was in borderline poverty  my family helped with a lot of our bills  food stamps  stripping to make ends meet cause nowhere would hire me  working housekeeping and even running a kiddie train at a dead mall  was a blow to my self worth since i just graduated college   so i did it  despite dealing with a life changing disease  i went back to school for aerospace to become a technician  i even got an internship working at the space center  i thought that  i did it  whatever that meant  went from the confused and depressed and not-wanting-to-do-this stripper to legit putting my hand on a god dang rocket booster  it was an inert test piece  but still   its not me  its not my fault the company i'm with totally low balled me with  18 an hour which still isnt enough to afford life alone  the kicker is i even work often 6 days a week  they really want us to do 7 but i've managed to dance around that  i didnt sign up for health insurance wither because i need every penny and didnt start putting anything into 401k until 6 months in     you could be a literal damn rocket scientist but still not make enough money and be told  go better yourself  its a freaking scam   it doesnt really get better  it can and it does  what i am doing now is still a far cry and more comfortable than stripping  granted strippers are making way more freakin money than me  or say like a retail or fast food job from hell  but it never truly gets better   i will never be secure or safe in a job due to my illness  i'm nearing 30 and my family still has to help me with bills  no matter how fancy the job  its still dangled like a carrot everyday and threatened  you are still replaceable    rent and home prices are unobtainable  hundreds of people are applying to every single job that's posted  both aerospace and nonaerospace  even desk jobs that pay nothing  10-15 an hour  have hundreds of applicants    you need at least 3 different resumes that all lie to pray one of them aligns with the job you're applying for  because if i use my aerospace resume for somewhere else which i have been doing  you are  way too smart  employers wonder wtf are you doing and why are are you applying here  hard pass  next    you could work on one of the world's most seemingly important projects and still deemed as not worthwhile    i've seen people lie about their products  use people  lie about having degrees make up degrees  get raises after stealing   if the most important internet system is going up into space and i'm handling equipment worth millions of dollars  arent i worth more than  18 an hour  we all look down on teachers  housekeepers cleaners  food store employees  fast food workers and tell them to  go better themselves  meanwhile we offer to pay them next to nothing  so now they go to school for possibly hundreds or thousands in debt to scrape up a few measily more bucks at a higher skilled job that still won't be able to help you pay for basic bills necessities   its a scam    what is the point    its difficult for me to save  my bank account is always hovering at the same amount  i'm literally fucking stuck  now i've been thinking about going back to school again for a ba because i've heard know that some technical writers make  30-50 an hour but  its reminding me of every single time i went back to school thinking i would come out better on the other side and not be in poverty and be able to pay all of my bills  right   right   whats the point ,fdgufy
747,Disenfranchisement of youth,hate your boss  i sure do  i work at a company where 2 3 of the employees are millennials or fresh from college  yesterday was the first day in a long time that there was mandatory ot and the voting polls closed before the day was done  i feel like there was intentionally mandatory ot yesterday just because it was voting tuesday to prevent this staff of  100 from voting  lots of pro-bernie talk at the office and at the smoking post and the bosses are very aware of it  if columbus day can be a freaking national holiday and mf never stepped on american soil why the hell is the only days votes can be cast not be a day off work ,fdc77z

749,Why Can't It Ever Last?,i am really disappointed in the job i currently have  i have worked there for about 9 months and in the past month i have slowly but surely come to dislike it  i still love certain parts of my job  working with the cats for example  but  the other little bits of bs are starting to sour the whole thing    i was hoping that if i worked for a nonprofit that did stuff that i was passionate about that it would be better  i was hoping that the usual ennui from workplace environments would at least take longer to set in  i guess i was expecting too much ,fdse5w

752,Officers vs. Enlisted,i just saw a picture of my cousin who enlisted in the usaf   he has been advancing pretty decently and  i guess  his wife has seemed to be pretty proud  but when i saw the shot of him working on a plane  all i could think was something along the lines of   that poor bastard  -- working on someone else's plane that someone else gets to fly while he's stuck on the ground in grease and probably cuts   maybe i'm just a piece of shit  but i mean how do people reconcile that kind of shit  the officers get the nice living quarters and all the fun  while the guys who were cursed with a shittier birth have to do all the dirty bullshit   i mean fuck that shit  dear jesus  am i wrong  it's like dude  fuck you  god  i am not doing that shit just so this asshole can go have a blast   thank ya for ur service ,fdm2tx

754,[Meta] How to never be promoted., gt  be the absolute best at your current position   it's counter intuitive but hear me out  if the boss promotes the best employee  it will only hamper their production and cost the company money   that's why when your employer finally promotes from within  it's always that jackass that doesn't know his asshole from his elbow  it won't hurt production to take that guy off the production line    let me introduce your new boss   jack wagon ,fdm55z

756,Quitting the job I just started,so a couple of weeks ago i was hired to be a cashier at a large retailer and these have truly been the most miserable weeks of my life thus far   i had intended for this to just be a small gig to make a little spending money while i finish school  but the demands of this job have left me with very little time and energy for my studies  i applied for it thinking it was going to be a part-time role since it was listed as such  but the turnover rate is so high for new hires here and the store's been so criminally understaffed that i have been scheduled for full-time hours these past weeks and for the upcoming weeks  i honestly wish i had quit during the first week along with the half the others in my training batch  but as this was my first job i was scared of this shit coming back to bite me if ever i needed another job in the future  so i decided to tough it out for just a month and submit my two weeks' then     i really don't think i can stand working here for that much longer though  customer service is the shittiest and most exhausting acting gig out there  i hate the expectation that i have to smile and remain friendly with people that are being rude as fuck to me often for things that are outside of my control  granted  i'm a lot slower to ring people up because this is my first time doing this sort of thing  but people getting pissed at me over store policy  the prices of their items  their year-old coupons not working  their card getting declined  etc  holy fuck i did not think it were possible for me to hate entitled middle-aged old people any more than i did prior to starting this job  i really don't get paid enough to put up with this shit  there are so many other things i have to rant about but i really don't want this post to get too long    my grades have already slipped significantly because the hours are so long and the work is so mind-numbing that i'm just too fucking exhausted both physically and mentally to do anything once i come home after a shift  the only times i really have the will to do anything are during my two  split  days off  wherein i spend the entire day just catching up to school  running errands  and fulfilling miscellaneous other responsibilities outside of work  so i really can't even consider those  days off  per se  i just hate that i've been pretty much forced to prioritize this job over my education  and i don't even  need  it because i still live with my parents and they've been kind enough to cover the costs of my needs  again  i just wanted the job so that i could have some spending money for going out with friends and other frivolous shit i don't want my parents to have to pay for  i no longer have the time to go out and the money feels so pyrrhic that i don't even want to spend it anymore so what even is the point now   i feel so drained and also am getting very anxious about my grades getting worse  i already have my two weeks' notice written up and i had originally intended to submit it a couple days ago  honestly i kind of want to just say fuck the two weeks and quit immediately without notice  but i don't want my coworkers to have to suffer for it  especially with the store being as consistently understaffed as it is    the thing is though is that there was a problem with my direct deposit and i still haven't gotten paid for this last pay period  i'm trying to work with one of my managers to resolve it and i feel like it would be awkward to submit my notice before that happens  hopefully it gets resolved today because i really don't want to put it off any longer  the mere thought of giving any more of my time to this company is genuinely making me want to kill myself  if this gets drawn out any longer would it be fine to just submit a one week notice ,fde6wa
757,"Partner suicidal so I took a work from home day, boss sent me email telling me how difficult this is on the company",basically what i said in the title  my partner is currently in a phase of severe depression  i got ready to leave for work but found him crying and shaking on the sofa so emailed my boss to say i d be working from home that day  she replied to let me know how much of a strain this puts on the team  bullshit  and how i need to give more notice for wfh days  had a meeting with her the following day and explained the situation in full including how previously he has attempted suicide and self harm whilst home alone when he is like this  i was in tears telling her  she just replies that we need to find some sort of balance as the workplace has needs and when i was off someone was needed to set up a teleconference call and it was  difficult to find someone  i m at my wits end  i need a job but my partners life is more important than their teleconference calls ,fdd0l0
