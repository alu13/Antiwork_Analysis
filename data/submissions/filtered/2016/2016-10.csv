0,Anti-work and ecological collapse,i'm new to this sub  and i just wanted to share a few unqualified thoughts and provoke a discussion  hopefully i don't step on any toes   there is a mountain of evidence that we are facing an environmental catastrophe  and it is directly linked to our productivity  it is the things that we do that are filling the air with co2 and the seas with plastic  yet our productivity is worshipped at the same time  seen as essential  apparently more essential than living sustainably    people who are unemployed are castigated and punished  through the threat of hunger  and the social shame of using food stamps  yet  it is the unemployed who are doing the least harm to the planet  on average  since they have the least income  they produce no toxic crap through their labor  and they consume less of it   they are the enemy of the growth economy but the friend of the planet  those people that don't buy a new tv every two years  or a new car every five  they are living more sustainably than the middle class family that recycles and only eats organic  since for every token gesture they make  they undo it a hundred times over with their annual vacation to hawaii  their new kitchen  their endless consumption of toxic plastic that will leech into the earth for thousands of years to come   there has to be a space given to the conscientious objector who cares for the planet  in fact  we have to start encouraging it  if we want our grandchildren to even be able to survive    to me  anti-work doesn't mean a rejection of effort or care  it means rejecting a system that cares only for it's own needs  that sees people as tools for short-term economic growth  environmentalism cannot function within this structure  since it comes in direct conflict with the main aims of capitalism    it's all well and good funding renewable energy  and trying to make our lives a bit greener  but as soon as concern for the environment steps on the toes of capitalism  it's ignored  and if the issue was forced by protest  it would be beaten down    work  for the majority of people  is the production and sale of stuff  and no one gives a shit if that stuff is worthwhile or meaningful  or if it's poisoning the planet  refusing to work is refusing to consume  and it is the morally correct position  in the light of the horrific news that we read daily about the extremely precarious that we find our planet in    so  just a little rant  anyone got any thoughts or reflections  ,59uy3g
1,An Argument For Work.,you work that you may keep pace with the earth and the soul of the earth  for to be idle is to become a stranger unto the seasons   and to step out of life's procession  that marches in majesty and proud submission towards the infinite   when you work you are a flute through whose heart the whispering of the hours turns to music  which of you would be a reed  dumb and silent  when all else sings together in unison   always you have been told that work is a curse and labour a misfortune  but i say to you that when you work you fulfil a part of earth's furthest dream  assigned to you when that dream was born  and in keeping yourself with labour you are in truth loving life  and to love life through labour is to be intimate with life's inmost secret   but if you in your pain call birth an affliction and the support of the flesh a curse written upon your brow  then i answer that naught but the sweat of your brow shall wash away that which is written   you have been told also that life is darkness  and in your weariness you echo what was said by the weary  and i say that life is indeed darkness save when there is urge  and all urge is blind save when there is knowledge  and all knowledge is vain save when there is work  and all work is empty save when there is love  and when you work with love you bind yourself to yourself  and to one another  and to god   and what is it to work with love  it is to weave the cloth with threads drawn from your heart   even as if your beloved were to wear that cloth  it is to build a house with affection   even as if your beloved were to dwell in that house  it is to sow seeds with tenderness and reap the harvest with joy   even as if your beloved were to eat the fruit  it is to charge all things you fashion with a breath of your own spirit  and to know that all the blessed dead  are standing about you and watching   often have i heard you say  as if speaking in sleep   he who works in marble  and finds the shape of his own soul in the stone  is nobler than he who ploughs the soil  and he who seizes the rainbow to lay it on a cloth in the likeness of man  is more than he who makes the sandals for our feet  but i say  not in sleep but in the overwakefulness of noontide  that the wind speaks not more sweetly to the giant oaks than to the least of all the blades of grass  and he alone is great who turns the voice of the wind into a song made sweeter by his own loving   work is love made visible  and if you cannot work with love but only with distaste  it is better that you should leave your work and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with joy  for if you bake bread with indifference  you bake a bitter bread that feeds but half man's hunger  and if you grudge the crushing of the grapes  your grudge distils a poison in the wine  and if you sing though as angels  and love not the singing  you muffle man's ears to the voices of the day and the voices of the night ,59dm31
