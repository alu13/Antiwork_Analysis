4,“It’s for your personal career development”,"My work is sending me on some once a week training course for three months, where I get to learn about pointless shit that I don’t care about such as new ways to write reports, learning from “industry experts” and “expanding my personal contact network”. I protested that I wasn’t interested in going but was informed it’s mandatory as “part of my personal career development plan.”

Please, please, please will you stop making me do this inane bullshit. I do not care about any of this, or my “personal career development”. I just want to do my 8/9 hours with as little stress as possible and then go home. Hell, if it was up to me I wouldn’t even do that. Working for you is not some radical new lifestyle choice I’m embracing to revolutionise my life - it’s a necessary evil for me to pay rent.

When and how did this become the acceptable norm? Who is coming up with these pointless jobs for people who’s sole responsibility is just to conjure up pointless new training schemes to fuck up other employees lives and waste their time.",False,8dqlm2,Dan_85,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/8dqlm2/its_for_your_personal_career_development/,12,27

16,"We reject work and build an anti-work society, then what?","Please, don't misunderstand my question. I'm as anti-work as it gets, but I am concerned about the possibilities of social reproduction of the basic necessities of people. I know that, with current technology, we could reduce the workforce a lot, but we still would need some organization in the transitional phase to full automation (which could last centuries). 

How would people handle this? Would they really do it (work) for themselves (provided we make conditions as fair as possible of course)? Would we still need some coercion? Should we use incentives? All of this is tricky because it reproduces the social logic of capital, productive ideologies, appraisal of the working man, etc., etc. but it's just that I think we have to use a gradual approach even today.

Say, if I were to hitch-hike to California or Texas, would I be able to get food and housing somehow without doing work I'd hate to be doing?
