4,What job made you hate your life the least while doing it?,hi rantiwork  i am currently out of work right now which is great but starting to hurt me financially i find that as i am looking for a new job i am getting a deep sense of dread and my stomach is turning coupled with the general sense of guilt that society enforces for not working  what job made you hate your life the least while doing it compared to other work you have had i am hoping to avoid some of the worst aspects of previous jobs i have had in an entry levelish position   in order from the aspects that i hope to avoid the most   1 toxicabusive workplace culture fostered by supervisors and managers  2 having to deal with clients and customer service in general  3 inadequate training  4 expectationsresponsibilities far exceed the pay grade  5 no down time  6 grueling physical work  7 never being able to say i used my liberal arts bachelor because the position requires no college or even high school degree   i know people generally despise bullshit jobs but i honestly wouldnt mind trying my hand at some office job i can just come and sit at and do the minimal grind not deal with many people then go home   any advise i feel like an ideal position for me would be some type of low intensity forest surveyor for a parks service but unfortunately i dont have a bs that would qualify me for that ,aty3d5

6,Is my Boss Disrespectful or am I overly Sensitive?,every day myself and another coworker are pulled into his office for a meeting  these can last between 30 minutes and an hour and a half  most of the meeting consists of the boss answering unrelated phone calls or making them composing emails slowly and generally not giving a crap about our time  today he even pulled us in to tell us were about to be busy and then proceeded to waste an hour just holding us hostage  ampx200b  he has an extreme ego and is very condescending in his speech and attitude  i know that he wouldnt accept this behavior if the tables were turned  ampx200b  we brought this to the attention of hr  they dont care because he has customer contacts that make the company a lot of money,avk8qq
7,Most jobs are meaningless or even harmful to society and environment,i do not mind working as long as i feel that i am doing something meaningful but most work is not just meaningless its harmful all around me i see people who are considered to be successful working jobs that do not in any way further wellbeing of society instead they create excess and mental noise designers who create packaging and aesthetically pleasing labels for absolutely unnecessary products  advertisement industry in general developers who create apps that at best marginally increase convenience for the rich fucking instagram museums and the plastic crap they exhibit all these things have negative value   i work as a parttime assistant at a large product photography studio the photographerowner without a doubt a very skilled person shoots content i fucking hate this word for ig packaging commercials of large brands the aftermath of a recent cosmetics shoot included dozens of wasted coconuts pounds of ruined fruit tubs of medical gel i absolutely hate myself for even participating in this charade   ampx200b,ar710p

9,How many of you do warehouse work?,i keep hearing about these office jobs that require almost no work and allow you to go on social media and read during working hours id love to do that but instead i work in a warehouse and literally everything i do is recorded with a scanner with weekly meetings about rates and bar charts showing who is faster everything is about efficiency and speed of performance so that the company gets every last cent and even seconds count in certain situations ive heard about people who work at amazon having it even worse id love to have one of these casual jobs but instead im in constant movement always doing mindless boring work but having to do it as fast as possible,atd4jl
10,Not working and the view that it's selfish?,my no 1 goal in life is to get to a stage where i dont have to work as soon as possible  what do you guys think about this i have this notion that friends and family would be against it that if i had enough to do it responsibly a good few million over my lifetime theyd resent me for it at least for a time how do you think youd overcome feeling selfish would you just shutdown all money talk and jibs about being a non worker what about people thinking you should just work a spend money buying them trinkets or supporting them parents id feel a bit guilty but hey its my life instead of yourself,aszcua

12,I had my yearly evaluation at work and of course they asked where I see myself in the upcoming years,my boss seemed flabbergasted when i told her i have no desire to become a manager i told her they work too much and i never want to be on salary and i want nothing more than to come to work and earn a paycheck and go home to my real life its crazy because i know she expected me to have all these aspirations to grow in the company and me saying i want a real life outside of work seemed strange to her i honestly feel bad for people like this i work to live not the other way around im so over toxic american work ethic that becomes your everything ,arajze
13,Work is Meaningless - An Old Poem,so i hated life because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me all of it is meaningless a chasing after the wind   i hated all the things i had toiled for under the sun because i must leave them to the one who comes after me  and who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish yet they will have control over all the fruit of my toil into which i have poured my effort and skill under the sun this too is meaningless  so my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun   for a person may labor with wisdom knowledge and skill and then they must leave all they own to another who has not toiled for it this too is meaningless and a great misfortune  what do people get for all the toil and anxious striving with which they labor under the sun   all their days their work is grief and pain even at night their minds do not rest this too is meaningless  a person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil this too i see is from the hand of god for without him who can eat or find enjoyment   to the person who pleases him god gives wisdom knowledge and happiness but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases god this too is meaningless a chasing after the wind   king solomon philosopher ,arb6ya

17,It's shocking how many employers don't bother stating the salary when advertising their vacancies,this seems to be incredibly common theyre happy to list off all the requirements of the role in other words what they expect from you but god forbid they tell you what you should expect from them  work is a twoway agreement employees provide a service to you in exchange for money why the hell would you think its ok to not inform people how much money theyll receive if they apply and are successful do you think people are applying because the job sounds fun  employers either the pay is good and you therefore have no reason to hide it or youre wilfully hiding it because its terrible and you think it will deter people from applying and if its the latter people are going to find out anyway so all youre doing is wasting the time of people who apply  or perhaps youre withholding it because you think people should want to apply based on the job role alone and that money shouldnt matter in that case why not drop the salary to zero see how well that works out for you,asqjld

22,I'm wondering how many people here are on the spectrum?,its my assumption that people with autism are less likely to adhere to the pressure to work thats so prevalent in our society due to our dissident cognition the way i see things is that ive been born at a disadvantage in a society that favors the outgoing charming and charismatic smoothtalkers now i have no desire to participate in the rat race but if im going to be pressured by my peers into jumping into the fire then i should at least have the capability of succeeding otherwise what youre telling me essentially is that im only useful as a wage slave if youre going to tell me that my life is only worth 10 an hour an apartment a used car 10ks of debt and an unfulfilling waste of youth job then im gonna tell you to go ahead and fuck yourself i dont give a shit about having a ton of money or a fancy car or any of that its the hypocrisy of those who do care about material items telling me that i cant have the same things but that i should still play the game i am fully aware that there are ways to escape the rigged system and become independent to successfully do that usually requires some kind of artistic talent psychopathic behavior high level of skill at something and a bit of luck i have none of that so basically im screwed but i still wont play your game i still have the right to enjoy my life in whatever way i can so quit calling me a loser just because the circumstances of my life have led me down a dead end and im not a dumbass who will fold under the pressure and go along with a wayward society ,arbn9i

34,Turnover is not made of apples,for various reasons ive quit on a bunch of horrible employers over the past year but usually only when i had money saved up andor something else lined up that i could do afterward     heres what i found after being on their contact lists for so long     wis international sent an invitation for me to come back twice ive quit on them in consecutive years and they still sent me something wanting me back because they cant find enough staff for their business this is the company that has practices which are wellhighly illegal such as forcing hotel stays where employees only get four hours of sleep forcing people to work 16 to 24 hours in a row things like that theyve had three or four managerial shakesup since ive been on their email list and nothing ever really seems to change     prattwhitney is a horrible warehouse chain that uses ups for their warehouse operations in a town called londonderry i worked there for six months last year and surprisingly its one of the better jobs i had this was the job that made me suicidal and feel hopeless about life they hired a new operations director while i was there and put in a new staffing coordinator probably because the ladies who had been doing it up until that point had not been having a good time this was another job with extremely high turnover to the point where they had a new orientation group in every week which was highly demoralizing recently i got an email saying that they are hiring again and could i please apply     callogix was a terrible company that i worked for and they let me go for various reasons at 8 in the morning knowing full well that i would have to sit and wait over three hours for the next bus to come by so i could go home every now and then when i pop on indeed to see whats available i see that they are hiring this happens about every two months or so they just cant keep people working for them their turnover is incredible and not good like the ones made from apples more like bad as in its appallingly obvious theres an upper class and a lower class at work these two classes were separated by a locked door with keycard entry     i wonder at what point will managers realize they are costing themselves money by being terrible i wonder at what point will business owners finally wise up and stop the fast revolving door of entrylevel employees and the slowly revolving door of midlevel management i kind of think it might never actually happen not as long as employees have to prostrate themselves before a boss just to earn a living something adam smith was opposed to believe it or else     and all of these reflections are coming to me while im contemplating how to initiate a classaction lawsuit against my current employer which selfidentifies as an escrow company while they pocket 20 of every transaction while refusing to offer payment protection for people who prove they completed the work they were asked to do      ive heard that theres no ethical consumption under capitalismand while i dont necessarily agree with that statement it occurs to me that a different sort of axiom might also be true theres no such thing as an ethical boss or workplace under capitalism either,at7ah3

38,There's nothing wrong with being unemployed.,were conditioned to think theres something wrong with not having a job and even not wanting to work ironically people who dislike their jobs tend to judge unemployed people i have a job that i dont care for so i rarely go and i understand what its like not wanting to work the whole thing is fucked work 5 days a week until retirement when youre 60 but of course by then youre too old to truly enjoy your money and you dont even know how to relax because your whole life has been focus on work thats why so many older people who retire get depressed or go back to working fortunately i came to realize that money cant make me happy early in my life so this saved a lot of time people waste chasing money  the way i see it is you didnt choose to be born so you should at least be allowed to live your life however you want to people tend to judge you if youre unemployed because theyre unhappy and judging makes them feel a little better about themselves but somehow working a job you dislike for the most part of your life is considered normal weve been conditioned to think and say things like work isnt supposed to be fun but why not they say everyone else does it but does that make it less crazy  i say do whatever it is you enjoy unless you enjoy killing people or something i myself enjoy meditating reading watching tv and making musichttpssoundcloudcomremedy97understand so i spend most of my time doing that although my passion is music im not sure ill get far with it although a year ago i made this albumhttpsbreazebandcampcomalbumtheartofbeingnobody and although it was free i made some money off it which was cool and really surprising so i definitely recommend also finding a creative hobby if you have a lot of free time  on top of all this though i highly recommend taking some time out of your day to just be no phone no tv no distractions just spending some time observing your own thoughts were always doing so its good to take some time off and just do nothing literally were called human beings after all not human doings,aq53gj
39,Work should not be more important than your life,but it is or your boss certainly thinks so  this has been a rough week for me scratch that this has been a rough month for me well more rough than usual i suppose on january 14th my grandmother died we were very close and she has been an important part of my life for as long as i can remember this isnt really the proper forum for a eulogy and its not my angle here to fish for sympathythis is for our purposes here background information her memorial is this friday and i requested the day off thankfully it was granted but im having a difficult time grappling with having to work this entire week with my entire family in town people i see maybe once every few years or so i should have taken the whole week off knowing full well i would be a wreck this is valentines week however and i work in the produce department which covers floral this is arguably the biggest week of the year for us even if i had requested that time i would not have gotten it   i have been thinking a lot about this particular subject since her death as coming into work has been extremely taxing as i work for a company that prides itself on customer service im not really allowed to express any other emotion than obsequious happiness but i am not happy in fact im downright miserable this feeling the subject of this post really hit me hard this tuesday my cousin had just gotten into town for the service and we went to lunch before i had to go to work it is the peak of season here in florida and i was rushing to finish lunch so i could get to work on timei didntand when i clocked in i wasnt in a particularly jovial mood having just powered through a lunch with a family member i enjoy the company of but almost never get to see just so i could had the pleasure of working for 8 hours anyway i had a thought upon clocking in and walking into our cooler which essentially came down to this the company i work at doesnt care about any of this the particulars of my life the petty travails of its employees are nothing compared to that of the singular drive for profit i suddenly realizednot for the first time but for the first time in a visceral waythat work and life are utterly incompatible the world of work is not the real world but ironically it is the one we inhabit the most everything about work is fake plastic a charade of pretend emotions and pretenses just so people will be slightly more comfortable buying groceries here instead of walmart a grand illusion constructed for the everexpanding acquisition of more monetary wealth and the paltry lives of the gears that make up the machine mean nothing the death of a slaves grandmother doesnt generate any profit especially if said slave isnt at work to be squeezed so he has to come in the company requires it we have a duty to uphold the value of our company for our stockholders after all its right there in the mission statement there are some other bulletpoints in there too but they arent as important as that one and its the only one that matters anywhere not just at this company its like we live behind a mirror and what ought to be meaningful and real is reflected back at us as threadbare unimportant the dark reflection of a grim specter refracted through the dizzying haze of surplus value production   i work on saturday the day after my grandmothers memorial service i work at 7 in the fucking morning no time for silent thought no meditation no time for family and friends no time even for tears you have work to do theres money to be made dont you know and you better fucking smile while you do it,aqgrkx

80,New comer with some questions (serious),hey everyone ive just discovered this sub and have a few questions they are all serious as i am curious to learn and the best way to learn is to ask for clarification when you have questions    1 people on here seem to be talking about not working but what would you do instead no i dont mean how would you fill your time i mean literally what would you do without money is the plan to live off the grid or something   2 i understand the desire to leave a job you arent fulfilled in i am an avid reader of fire subs and blogs but what about speaking out another more fulfilling career  i understand it would be great to never have to work but isnt minimizing the pain best especially when working is a requirement if you want to have the money to buy stuff   3 are the majority of people on here american i am a canadian and grew up there but as an adult i have lived in europe and australia which are both more socialist than capitalist this whole idea seems like the capability system failing the little guy and im wondering if there are people on here from non capitalist countries   4 are there any people on here who actually enjoy their job but are seeking things like early retirement i ask because i 100 love my job but i have a lot of freedom and challenge and a great return on my time investment   thanks and again all questions are serious im just trying to learn ,avprvm

82,what a waste of a life,i was talking to my best friend last night and she told me about this boy she knows whose parents are rich so he lives at home and doesnt work or go to school i said personally thats not the life i want for myself but if hes happy and not harming anyone then good for him  my friend kept hounding me about how hes lazy and stupid for not owning a car or having any credit to which i told her credit was an arbitrary concept created by the government and does not determine ones intelligence if he doesnt have a car and has some other way of getting around then good for him  shes brainwashed so she heard absolutely nothing i said and she finally said what a waste of a life which really upset me how can you tell someone who else that their life was wasted we determine whether our lives were wasted or unfulfilling because we are the ones who live them every day  do some people really think that the only way to live a fulfilling life is to work a 95 for 40 years buy a house and a car until youre 60 and too old and tired to enjoy your longawaited retirement i feel bad for people who are so brainwashed by society to think that this is the ultimate goal theyre selling you a false idea of happiness in order to use you in their machine to pump more product and money out into the world all to benefit them not you neither of which measures your utility or value i dont want to live a life strictly confined by the selfserving goals forced upon me generation after generation that doesnt make my life a waste ,aveamj

86,Why would I work for a society that's willing to let me be homeless?,i just dont understand im 25 and ive never had a job its been miserable ive never had a girlfriend a car a apartment friends gotten to pick my own food gotten to go out i have lost all contact with my family not because i dont like them or they dont like me but because im in a constant state of misery i dont want to bring other people down  i just dont understand how im supposed to give any effort to society after a lifetime of being treated like complete scum   i understand i havent ever flipped a burger or stocked a shelf at walmart but should that really mean that i have to wake up everyday in complete agony at the idea of another day in a life that i have no control over   i didnt pick the way my brain works ive tried working before and it makes me completely miserable if that makes me worthless then why not offer homeless people a pain free method of euthanasia i dont see the difference between letting me die painlessly and letting me die to overexposure   im not trying to be thick i just dont understand it at all and i dont understand how im supposed to be normal after 25 years of not having my own life theres no snapping out of it and after being treated so badly for my whole life i dont think there is anyway i could happily work for this society everyday   the world has made it clear that it doesnt think people like me deserve food water or shelter so how could i possibly ever give it even a second of my time   honestly if universal basic income was a thing i could see myself actually having a job if i was started out with the basics like a tiny apartment food and water it would give me the abiltty to do things like have people over have girls over go out and meet people i would be much less of a mess of a person but because ive been treated like a child my entire life because of my refusal to work i literally dont understand how im supposed to do anything  i cant have people over when im forced to still live at home i cant go out with no money i cant learn to socialize i cant do anything except wake up everyday and wish i was dead  until ubi is a thing i will continue to refuse to work its funny that people thing people who dont work have it easy they only have it easy if they are born into a rich family if you are born into a poor family its literal daily hell the fact that i havent killed myself yet is a fucking wonder of nature ,ar6n36

91,21 years of life in a mountain wilderness - I wanted to share this here...,video httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvglp2lnhxviehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvglp2lnhxvie  from the description    storyline  their home most certainly has a view ramiz palos and his wife zemina fled the hardships of urban life in bosnia as soon as the country had emerged from a 4yearwar two decades ago   they choose to live on mount vlasic in central bosnia at 1300 meters above sea level separated by kilometres of dirt road from the nearest inhabited place   palos says he is not a recluse and was not looking for an escape from traumatic memories instead he says he wanted to take control of his life  after 21 years of primal existence in the wilderness palos feels in control and happy insisting he would never return to civilisation  i had several reasons to move here i came here to secure means for existence but also to live an exciting life to not have a boring life he says   life in the wilderness has many challenges but palos insists embracing it was easier and more productive than if he had waited for the government to create a job for him  people here in bosnia are too willing to surrender responsibility for their own life to somebody else they are not thinking people need to think to come up with ways to find work for themselves i dont have to worry about the work of the government or anyone else he says  while he sometimes has to fight off bears and wolves and to endure pouring rains winter storms and strong winds palos has an abundance of food fresh air and a warm home  you need to know how to behave in nature because we get heavy rains winter storms and strong winds you need to know how to behave in such circumstances he says  sometimes it gets so cold that i cannot leave home for two months but i have enough food and everything else i need so it does not matter winter comes and goes  with an unemployment rate of close to 30 percent finding a job in bosnia can be hard and close to a fifth of the countrys population lives in poverty  the country is failing to fully capitalise on the good climatic conditions and an abundance of fertile land that make it one of the most favourable spots for farming in southern europe  but aleksandra nikolic from the sarajevo faculty of agriculture and food science believes that a growing number of bosnians are recognising the advantages of rural life  agriculture is a way of life it is no longer identified with the image of an exhausted man farming a rough patch of land in the middle of nowhere with the help of emaciated farming animals she says agriculture is a sector of economy that helps people in local communities to weather the periods of financial economic political or any other crisis by securing a source of income that helps them get through hard times palos might be the best example of that when he first moved into the mountains in 1996 he lived in an old van and then in a makeshift tent but after just a few months he had built a simple house for himself and was joined by his wife  they still live in the house with no running water and off the electricity grid but they grow their own vegetables and corn raise goats and farm fish in the wild mountain river palos used local wood and stone to build his barn hatching tanks and the watermill where he grinds his corn  from time to time palos ventures into the nearest town to sell extra produce to urban dwellers and purchase essential supplies that he and his wife cannot produce for themselves     ,asegbb

114,I'd like to share some thoughts about meaningful work,i am now in a job that i do not hate because it would exist relatively unchanged in some kind of utopia and id like to tell you all about it because i want to talk about bestcase scenarios as well i wont go into much detail for privacy reasons sorry  i am a personal assistant to a disabled person now i dont know if this is common outside the nordic countries so ill explain if someone with a longterm disability requires regular assistance from another person for daily tasks  not medical care and not looking after  its possible to hire someone to come help you out with whatever you need my employer has a physical disability affecting mobility and their own life that they live so i am just there when needed for logistical support so to speak it allows my employer to focus on their own life rather than meshing the role of assistant with friends or family i dont have any opinion on something like whether anyone prefers an employee to a relative taking this role my point is more that this option is available to people here and im not trying to toot my own horn here anyone with mobility in their hands could do this work so im not special but i think that this particular position is pretty cool  so im very motivated when i go to work it helps that my employer and i get along well but the fact of the matter is that this is work that needs to happen in an ideal world in my opinion disabled people would be not bred out nor segregated nor considered a burden so this is work that absolutely needs to be done and an option that absolutely needs to exist in order for everyone to have selfdetermination compare to some childcare jobs i have had where the parents and kids expressed the desire to actually stay home but for serious financial reasons couldnt that was so frustrating to me and left me with a lot of dissatisfaction in my work  the other thing i like about my job now is that this comes at no cost to my employer they are the one who put out the job listing interviewed me hired me and who sends my hour log to the city but it is the city who pays my salary to speak of the salary it is enough for just me to live without much stress but its likely that other people with more responsibilities would need help but for me this particular situation is very stressfree  if things were different when i woke up tomorrow and i didnt need to go to work anymore for the first time in my life i would still go to work anyway as long as my employer required my assistance i sure couldnt say that working in restaurants or cleaning houses or at some of my childcare jobs i prefer my free time but i dont dread work at all and i dont feel dead from it   i hope that whatever kind of things youre interested in and good at that some kind of employment like this comes up where it would exist in relatively the same form even in an ideal world i wish you all meaningful days and fruitful effort ,anta6b
115,Whats your vision for a realistic anti-work society?,obviously plenty of shitty jobs will still have to be done for the world to continue functioning but i truly feel that if we acknowledged that they are as shitty as they are and paid a more fair wage while scaling back hours everything would be so much better studies show that scaling back hours leads almost always produces the same amount of completed work example janitor no one says i want to be a janitor when i grow up but unfortunately that kind of job has to be done if they were paid a higher rate and had less hours they would be much happier right so lets say a hospital wing has one janitor making 10 an hour working 9 hours a day 5 days a week if they were paid 20 an hour and only worked 5 hours a day 5 days a week they would be much happier even more so if a second janitor was hired to make up for when janitor  1 isnt there where does this extra money come from idk the same imaginary place all money comes from how will this be implemented without fucking with inflation idk i dont have an economics degree but if this could somehow work and we could hire two people for every single position while still paying them at the same rate they are currently making everything would be so much better ,anfdh9

(Told that happiness over money is immature),so this happened a couple hours ago but keeps grating at my nerves sorry if this gets long need to rant   i was talking about how to find a job since i have left uni and have 8k in loans understandable i have to get those parasites off of me as soon as possible but the issue seems to be when actually deciding what to do to get rid of the debt my mom was poking around for ideas since i write and hope to have passive income selfpublishing eventually asking what i could find online for maybe a site or something local something that i could not get too stressed over and had some experience doing   the issue came when my dad started getting angry because i wasnt receptive to the idea of walmart or a factory like him he knows it would be stressful early hours and i am not a morning person and half the places listed dont even do the basics of allowing unions which all i mentioned to him he proceeded to tell me that i had to have something i had to agree and anything is better than nothing so the chance of some money at the risk of burning out and suicidal thoughts like the reason i left college because i work for whatever company can exploit me the easiest is fine as long as i make at least 10hour literally his bar of making a decision on jobs   i reminded him about why i left severe depression and anxiety in combination with incompetent faculty and he says thats life suck it up not every day is going to be fun yeah but i dont want everyday to be a shit show like where you work and constantly pissed at coworkers that you complain about to everyone i say i dont want the boomergenx mentality and would rather be disability and poor if that is the life he wanted me to have all he cared about was how it would be a stain for future employers and wouldnt get me anything good later not i dont know wondered if there could be a reason i felt so broken not saying people on it are anything negative or worthless but i dont know what i am good for and it is all my minimal selfworth i use it for myself i feel like shit and life right now is breaking me  he then goes on to talk about how i am going to end up working until i die and have no retirement to which i mention because i am a millennial and the way things are going with the jobs he thinks i should take i will anyways which leads to the main reason i was mad enough to make this post he says its because my generation has smartphones and video games and waste money on that to be happy instead of putting it away for retirement i asked if he was joking that spending a little money on something that brings joy is why we cannot escape from this pit at 65 this leads to him going on a rant about two single moms working two jobs and happy because they dont have those and i realized it was pointless to keep arguing he really has no idea and wouldnt change his mind i was tired and i didnt want to hear how i was being lazy and a hippie with my ideals rather sleep on the couch and be too depressed to actually cry ,aonkz0

123,My mom got fired today,my 60yearold mom works as a fitness instructor at various gyms she teaches different fitness classes to different groups and ability levels  i got a call from her this evening and she was crying she said her boss left a sealed envelope for her in her office in it was a notice of her termination my mom didnt read the letter to me but she claimed no explanation was given she speculated the class attendees were complaining about her teaching style not accommodating all fitness levels she wondered why they didnt simply reassign her to a different class rather than outright fire her  she worked at this gym for 9 years and really enjoyed that workplace she made lifelong friends there  she also went aboveandbeyond developing her class there she invested her own money to purchase music portable audio equipment to play the music and small inexpensive physical equipment to augment some exercises she purchased all this new music and equipment for an upcoming class but obviously wont be using it now  on the phone she kept saying that she felt like a failure i didnt know how to respond to that how do i even respond to that  she also claimed the gym still has all her music and equipment and since she was fired via a letter she was unable to get her property back today,aoodln
124,[Whiney vent] I'm not made for this society,i sound so whiney and i cant tell this to anyone i hope this sub will understand me  everyday i get closer to having to slave away at a job school isnt going well because ive been struggling with depression and possible add for forever and never got help not only that its simply because ive always hated studying random shit those two illnesses wouldnt even be a problem if it werent for the school system in the first place it caused my depression and add really doesnt fuck my life in any other aspect i was miserable in highschool in my country we have this culture of getting overloaded with information from 845215 and then we all pay for private tutors normally for an hour and a half but so many times we stayed 46 hours or more because of exams now its still bad with uni every exam is equivalent to studying a 400 page textbook im done with this but i look to the future and only see slave jobs its no better im officially trapped whats the point in life if youre not rich and famous thats the only option you have to get out of this mess otherwise youre just a modern proletariat looking up to the people on top its too early for ai to reform everything and just get universal income and inactivity is horrible as well i cant do anything worth something for society because i havent proven im qualified ill never have fulfillment i just cant take it anymore yesterday i bawled my eyes out because i found out a famous girl from my country whos a year older is where she is today because she tweeted i want to give you a hug to a famous youtuber and he decided to date her is that it got so much to say i cant say anything the worst part is when your parent no longer has any wisdom to give you they just tell you that they worked hard to the point of back injury and lived for the little things i cant do that i cant im so confused,anr5o6

126,I really hope someone rises up one day and starts an effective movement,im so glad i found this sub im in college and for a so called liberal safe space there is a shit ton of capitalist propaganda lets be honest the anti work sentiment and anti capitalism sentiment go hand in hand i would honestly be ok if i was working and making a meaningful impact but im selling myself to make some mega corporation even more rich every godamn class ive had has talked about how you should find a job you love and youll never work a day in your life so much fucking bullshit it irks me that it would be more than possible to end this system overnight if the powers at be allowed it coming up with an invention or innovation that influences people should not be a grounds for fucking up the way the world works man just imagine if we had a maximum wage like we have a minimum wage,aomo8t
127,Not working long term: How would people handle that?,tldr what would people do with themselves if they didnt have to work would they find ways to remain integrated and social within society would we withdraw into tv and media would we find most people lack a passion and drive to make the most of their time when all they have is time  ampx200b  im on the last day of my weekend here and why theres no way in hell im looking forward to work im also wondering how i would fill my time if i didnt have to work i mean im relatively lazy and doing the same solitary things day in day out would no necessarily satisfy me i also know that my relatively lazy self would not thrown myself into all those things i say i want to do and accomplish just because i had the time it would take work for me and building a good lifestyle i think for not working to work i imagine id having to have standing coffeedinnerlunch dates maybe join a sports or community group rubbish cleanup charity for the needy having social appointments would help me appreciate my time by myself itd be nice to even have just time to go hiking or to lunch at the park  ampx200b  so how do we think most of the populace would handle not having to work we say wed do these thousands of things cook sew draw garden but these require a lot of self direction i guess and putting work in to get good at these things takes actual effort would most people be willing to put in this effort would someone who has the time and patience to learn how to cook well for their family and community decide to be a chef andor open a restaurant well thats great then if having the space and time has let this person find their passion but about billions of other people seeking a place and role and purpose in their lives or greater communities would having all the time make most people better and force them to really seek out their ideal selves or would most people crumble  ampx200b  like im sitting here i stopped reading the courage to be disliked because its a bit of a dry book and right now im not sure how its tittle relates to its content but i was getting bored im a super amount of options of what to do i could go for a walk in various places maybe a swim i could nap i could visit at least one person i could watch tv i could meditate or just do nothing theres no force in me telling myself i have to worry about making the most of my time today im doing chores tomorrow i decided so now im kinda not lost as to what to do but im ultimately in complete control similar to the books talking points so who do i want to be what would society be in such a situation,ap1bu6

129,Remote work offers hope to escape this mess.,in some cases depending on many many factors of course its possible to turn remote work into a job where you spend only a couple hours a day delivering results and the rest of the day doing whatever you want the only issue is you have to be kind of secretive about it and you have to really know what your boss wants and expects from you but if you find the right type of remote work its possible to liberate yourself a little bit if only temporarily,ap85re

141,Should I take this step?,so i need your opinion im from germany and im close to 30 and so far either been a student or just been travelling the world but i never had a 95 job only little side jobs here and there with like 50 hours a month so thats really chill studying in germany is basically cheapfree so you can study as long as you can afford it after a while you have to pay longterm fees so it is getting more and more expensive anyway in a year or so i will end university and then well thats the thing i mean despite the common views on work like we share in this sub i also have ms i am fucking tired most of the time and completely unable to focus on anything for more than 20 minutes partly the reason why studies took me so long it also causes massive memory loss and paralyzes legsarmsetc even when just temporary i dont think id ever be able to even hold a job because i cant function for that many hours let alone 5 days in a row so ive been told i could get a severely disabled id card which has quite some advances here like paying way less taxes getting money from something called basic security and of course i can still work but i dont need to work so many hours but right now i really dont know if i want that it has its pro and cons what if ill find a job i genuinely like but they reject me because of it yes they can do that i also feel like with this id i will be stigmatised as malfunctioning forever there is still this stubborn naive voice in me that is like well maybe if it is your dream career you can do it with a lot of caffee and drugs but maybe you can  am i just an idiot holding a golden ticket for a stressfree life or am i about to ruin my young future to build a career should i try to survive in the working world first and get that id later in case my health fails this could also be a ticket to complete isolation maybe i could never move to a different country can i have your thoughts on this  ,ao4i3b

163,Why is it so wrong to only work for the money?,i dont work for fun im not motivated i only work because i need to eat and pay bills that doesnt mean i am a bad worker i was a solid ab student in school and i always try my hardest at work but its because its a lot easier to do well than having to find a new job after getting fired but many applications especially online have questionnaires where based on wording they seem to be looking for someone who will work through breaks and lunches stay late as much as needed without being asked able to essentially mind read any customers and then upsell based on what they want   its a minor annoyance but when ive been struggling to find a job that doesnt physically and mentally wear me down and a questionnaire answer option is literally i am hardwired to serve i have to draw a line im not sure if theyre serious or not the next answer down is i have always enjoyed serving people which seems more believable but i still cant relate i dont and i cant work because i enjoy it i work because i could die if i dont,amvn0r
164,Is there anybody who would like to talk ?,as most of you may probably already know its pretty damn hard to find people irl who are pro antiwork  and who understand how deeply we the working class people are all exploited by the capitalist  elite  and what kind of social repercussions does that leave on our every day lives basically  i was wondering if anybody would like to talk either via skype  discord  or whatever telecomm software you re currently using,an2tat
165,First day @ new job,so i finally got out of my toxic and overbearring job today is my first day at a new job with a great company good benefits time off casual environment but i cant help but feel discouraged already i know i dont want to work under capitalism but i have student loans and bills  i have no desire to do this job i took it because it pays more and got me out of my previous shitty job i want to do something i care about that feels like im helping people and this is just more of sitting behind a computer all day managing data  my friends and family dont understand it its only the first day and they want me to give it more time i get it but the feeling of waking up this morning so damn early and dreading coming in and now my dread being confirmed  it feels like theres no escape from this depression of meaningless work,an4pyr
166,I see myself once a week,my job probably like many of yours is soul taking  i go to community college from 7 to 10 and i work from 11 to 830 six days a week  i literally see myself once a week  time goes so fast that i dont ever realize whats happening   i have no time to look back   its like im sitting in the car that is driving itself 100mph and stops once a week to fill up gas for ten minutes  im posting this here because i know you can relate  wish everyone best and to do whatever makes them happy to do for life,an8xkg

168,Billions and billions of years..., and this is it how how do so many people seem to not go crazy like i do  the chances of beeing alive are so small one cant even comprehend it from the big bang over single cell organisms dinosaurs generations of human beeings i somehow came into existence and how do i have to spend my time in this world getting up at 615 am 5 days a week sitting behind a desk for 8 hours  unfuckingbelievable go to kindergarden go to school go to college then work for 40 years and die i hate beeing alive i wish my parentsd been wise enough not to bring another beiing into this meaningless mess of a world,amskks
169,Book recommendations,i thought it might be interesting to hear about more books on antiwork than are in the sidebar whatre everyones favourites and why the two i think most about are  the refusal of work by david frayne   this one goes through the ideology of the work ethic the ways work takes over our lives so even free time isnt really free and has a lot of interesting and well researched sources but the thing i really like is it interviews a group of people whove tried to push work out of their lives as much as possible and talks about how they reached a breaking point one really cathartic part was when they talked about these small slices of utopia they experienced that made them realise something better was possible and they were wasting their life though it also goes through the socialfinancial pressures that come up when you try to push work out of your life it opens with a quote from a film called the working class goes to heaven where antiwork students with megaphones harangue the workers going into a factory in the morning saying its 8 o clock in the morning when you come out it will be dark the sun will not shine for you today  bullshit jobs by david graeber  this ones already in the sidebar and is pretty well known but it talks about one of the most infuriating and frustrating parts of work a significant portion if not most of the work we do is totally pointless increasing productivity hasnt led to us working less or freeing us from work entirely its led to the proliferation of whatre essentially makework jobs it goes into how alienating and despairing it can be working those jobs and why it proposes a ubi as the solution though david graeber is an anarchist  put your favorite bits of writing below   ,amoxi7
170,If school sucks and parents/teachers say these will be the best days of your lives. What does that say about the rest of your life?,seems like its easy to say school is fun and the best days of your lives in retrospective once you enter the workforce ,amh0ll
171,"I work in a restaurant, and my boss won’t allow sick days.

175,My boss is micromanaging my time by passive aggresiveness.,i work as a vendor for a company where i go around to stores all over my region merchandising and placing orders my job description states 30 hours per week as maximum i get paid hourly so of course ive been getting those 30 hours a week no matter what i have over 90 stores to finish in a month the schedule is totally flexible as long as i get those stores complete and not go over 30 hours a week   so i have gotten used to the work and sort of chill at each location after im done i get the job done in a quality manner and stay below those maximum hours well now 4 months into the job my boss has started to email me about my time he has been asking why im spending more amounts of time in stores when i could be getting it done faster i think he knows the work doesnt actually take that long which yeah it really doesnt however i dont want to purposely cut my hours because its giving me a stable income to get by with living for the time  he said this recently while your store efficiecies are good we are concerned about your ability to accomplish the role in a timely manner ,apfvcv
176,A debate for the ages!,who is the pop culture god of antiwork to me it comes down to either peter from office space or randal from clerks these are probably my two favorite antiwork movies and im not sure who i side with  anyway this question has probably been asked here before but share your suggestions,aphvvt
