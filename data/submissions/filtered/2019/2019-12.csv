6,We’re one big happy family...,this is what the owner of my company said to me in my latest review    over the last 6 months i have had part of my finger amputated due to a workplace accident  i wasn t given much support whilst away having surgery and upon my return i took on the role of producing work from start to finish  which was sold for thousands of  s i am an apprentice and i earn much less than minimum wage  once i completed several pieces of work i asked for wage rise to minimum wage  so that i could afford to live  the owners of the company dug their heals in  gave me bad monthly reviews stating that i do not accomplish enough to earn minimum wage  again my work has been sold for a total of  16k over a 3 month period  i eventually managed to get a small raise from them but now they ve made it very clear that i am not liked within the company    yeah family ,ei9kh0
7,Homelessness in my city is getting really bad,i'm from london and its gotten so bad in the last two years  like the stations just filled with homeless people  as in loads of them  it's awful    i've noticed they're getting younger and there's more women on the streets too  also you can tell who has been made newly homeless because their clothes and overall appearance tell you this is a recent situation that they've fallen into    i think a lot of people are only 3 or 4 paychecks away from homelessness if they don't have support because universal credit  social security  welfare  gives you peanuts  i've signed on at 2 different points in my life due to job losses and mental health difficulties   the most recent time can you believe im only entitled to  650 a month  as a single adult with no dependants  i was renting a private property at the time and once my rent was paid  511 pm  what does that leave me to leave on   it's shocking  what saved me was additional income from my side hustles and a loving supportive partner who has a really good job  it made me feel really bad having to depend on him though   if i don't have this support and additional self-employed income stream i can't tell you where i would be   i've now moved to live back with my mum to get back on my feet but even she faced homelessness in temporary accommodation due to the removal of tax credits and income support given to low-income earners   this government has killed so many people and with no regulation in the private housing sector so many young people are becoming homeless  the one's not on the street are sofa surfing    today the government announced the highest increase in minimum wage  lol wasn't even up to a pound  in decades but it's still at only  8  lower if youre under 25  meanwhile the rich capitalists have almost tripled their wealth in a 10 year period   a young homeless woman was making her way asking for food and my eyes just welled up    i feel so disillusioned with life ,ei7sjw

15,Globalism and free trade are why work sucks.,conservatives' real crime isn't cutting welfare  or healthcare  or taxes  it's  allowing corporations to ship jobs where labor is cheapest  this reduces both wages and jobs stateside  free trade means americans have to compete not with each other  but with every other worker in the world for a job  ironically enough  marx was a proponent of free trade as a way to produce a united worldwide proletariat     women entering the workforce has made employment a worse deal  an increase in the labor force with no corresponding increase in demand for labor results in lower wages  studies show that women aren't really that willing to marry men who make less than them  conditions where men don't make enough to get married and raise a family are typically conducive to socialist uprisings  women who end up childless later in life often report feeling depressed  and even suicidal     immigration  regardless of legality  has also driven wages down  same principle as above  except even worse  more labor with no increased demand  except immigrants don't need higher wages  the 1965 immigration act means that americans must compete with people all over the world for jobs    in this essay i hope i've convinced you of the best ways to bring wages and jobs back so we can all do less work     close our borders    ban free trade    incentivize women with money and tax breaks to become wives and mothers    offer money to immigrants if they'll voluntarily repatriate,efwlbg
16,I can’t take it anymore. Work has all but killed me.,i m having mental breakdowns on the daily  i can t function properly  i want to harm myself  tonight i drove around recklessly  closing my eyes sometimes and just being an idiot  all because i can t deal with work anymore   it has sucked every tiny last little bit of joy  happiness  and soul left  i truly can t picture going on for another day- the fact i have to go in tomorrow for a 10  hour shift is making me cry and giving me a headache- the concept of doing this forever is unbearable    my car needs fixing  so does my phone  as well as other bits and pieces i have around the house that are broken  i can t afford to move out  the rent s steep enough at  home  and i m never going to be able to afford to save because i don t earn enough despite working almost 200 hours a month    i m stuck  i don t recognise me anymore  i want to die,eg3l26
17,"Impulsively Quit My Job (sorry, pretty long)",i m not sure if this is the right sub  apologize in advance  but i m home alone today and would like some input from someone else  i got a retail job in a smoke shop right out of high school  the owners are a bunch of young brothers from pakistan and i was the first person they hired  since the beginning we ve been close  pretty open about things  went to their weddings  etc  we were  family  fast forward to almost a year ago when they decided they d open more locations to fuel the costs of opening a pharmacy  this is also coincidentally when i started slowly hating my job  a lot of days i got to sit around and watch tv  but it s still retail and i was doing everything for the store  basically running it  making orders  customer service  keeping track of other employees  tracking sales and payroll  running out to get whatever for the store despite not having a car and having to borrow one  no breaks  no sick days  no holidays weekends off  no vacations  no overtime  no benefits  getting yelled at for stupid reasons  and lots more bullshit to name for  13 an hour  seriously  a shift manager at dunkin  donuts makes more  and every day at a retail job having to talk to customers makes you genuinely hate your life  i couldn t even get to eat lunch without customers walking in because they didn t give us breaks even on 12 hour days  i worked until 9pm christmas eve  it s things like that that add up until you can t take it anymore  not to mention  there s been a ban on flavored vape juice and they ve been asking me to illegally sell it from the back which would screw me over if i got caught  so today i got the schedule mixed up and didn t come in on the 10am shift  we only work one at a time so if i don t go in the store doesn t open and the owner gets pissed  he called me at 10 25 and told me that if no one is there by 10 45  i wasn t even awake and ready and i live a half hour away  that he would not only suspend me but punish the other employees and suspend them too for two weeks which makes no sense  the owners have been complete dicks since opening their pharmacy and losing money from the vape ban and they only come into the store to point anything out that s wrong which weighs on you  so i texted him that and said i wouldn t be coming back  they want to close down anyway and cut my hours to 25 a week  i just want to know if i acted impulsively in anyone else s opinion  or if i should feel free for finally saying i ve had enough  he keeps calling me and i won t answer  i think he wants to ask me to stay but i don t know if i should go back  he didn t even say anything when i quit at first except  i ll give you good references like i did with your apartment  way to do things for someone to throw it in their face later  unemployment really scares me and i don t want to feel like i m making a mistake  it sucked and i was miserable but it was a pretty easygoing job on days when i didn t have anything to do and i got hired on the spot  and i know i won t find that again which is what s freaking me out  just feel like i need a bit of reassurance or advice right now  i ve just done so much with no appreciation and they think the opposite  and honestly i couldn t give less of a shit about smoke products  lol ,eg3nwe
18,Understaffing to make us feel guilty,just before christmas i got extremely sick like not able to eat sick  but i didn't take any sick days  not because i needed the money or because i really like my job but because i know the people this would fuck over would be my colleagues and friends   we are constantly understaffed and i never realised this could be to make us feel guilty for taking time off  in the three years i have been with my company i have taken 1 sick day and that was in a amp e all night due to being assaulted   i didn't t take time off when i was hit by a car and needed stitches in my face because it would fuck over my friends  i didn't take time off the second time i was assaulted because my friends needed me in work   fuck this shit  and fuck any company who purposely leaves their workers understaffed  i get 3 weeks paid sick leave a year and you can bet i will be getting it this year ,eg3ry8

20,Having days off gave me a work nightmare,i had a nightmare last night where i was working on an oddworld-style  a game series i think you guys might enjoy  factory as a slave  i caught a glimpse of the outside world and it drove me to escape  i ran through a forest until i couldn't anymore  they hunted me down with dogs and found me under a bunch of twigs and grass trying to hide  then they dragged me back to work by my hair    i think the holiday off messed with me  i had the day of christmas off and  by the great generosity of my employer  half the day on christmas eve  i think having those days off was enough of a taste of freedom that my sleeping mind freaked out knowing it had to go back to work where i'll spend most of my waking life for the rest of my life  ugh ,efx0w2

25,Going from a balanced 8 to 2 PM school day to 9 to 5 or more like 9 to 8 is insane.,i don t understand how working parents can have children in this day and age  it seems like they would never see each other with a traditional work schedule   i think only restaurants or stores should be open longer than 2 pm  but  office work  if we were raised to going to school from 8 to 2 pm  work shouldn t be any different   it really disgusts me how much work takes up so much of someone s day  most people i know only have time to work  scramble together a dinner  maybe have an hour with their family   if they are lucky  and then go to bed  with that amount of time away  it s a miracle people aren t disconnected from their loved ones  but  i suspect most people are  the people that work grueling work schedules  anyway  i wouldn t be surprised if that s a factor in divorce  couples just don t have the time to work on themselves because they are so exhausted   as a kid  movies portrayed jobs as being fun and great parts of our lives  to be honest  i m just so disgusted in how adulthood works  i feel like people aren t living  i feel like toxic work environments change their mental well-being  work depression is real  health deterioration due to a toxic work environment is real  how can you expect someone to eat salads and healthy proteins if they have the most stressful job imaginable  of course someone working a horrible work environment is going to go for the junk food  how could they not  how else could they cope   the deterioration of people begins and ends with their job  of course  you can t help certain health factors  but seeing my friends age and deteriorate as much as they have is scary  i m only 29  and i have seen this in my other friends who are the same age  it really makes me afraid for their future ,eh4sfp

104,"I'm getting really sick and tired of the idea that I have to ""make something of myself""",in our hypercapitalist and social-darwinist industrial production system   making something of yourself  is equivalent to  obtaining a high-prestige or high-income job title  ideally both   nothing else about your life fundamentally matters  and failing to obtain a high-prestige high-income career in a market-production context is equivalent to  doing nothing with your life   this constant haranguing of how  you need to make something of your life   directed particularly at perceived labor-market  underachievers  is never directed at people in professional occupations  lawyers  doctors  journalists  investment bankers  engineers  etc  even if the product service they are offering is ethically questionable or shoddily made performed  and even if the rest of that person's life is a complete train wreck  multiple divorces  kids they never see  no hobbies or interests  sitting on the couch watching soap operas during their free time  popping happy pills to stay emotionally functional  etc   but  by god  they have an amazing career  their labor is readily exploitable  and they consume like there's no tomorrow   they've made it   on the other hand  someone who has a close social circle  lots of engaging hobbies interests  eats well and exercises  is emotionally stable  is able to pay all their bills  but has the gall to be satisfied with  only  working  say  a low-level retail job  or another low-prestige low-income occupation  is automatically deemed a  failure  who needs to get off their ass and  make something of themselves   the real tyranny for us capitalist-society-dwelling folks is the tyranny of the career-track  the tyranny of the platonic ideal perfect resume that constantly dangles like a sword of damocles over our heads and life arcs  and the tyranny of all the attendant social expectations and consequences     the spontaneity and  play  of life ends where a  proper career  begins ,ehdksf

110,Sick note,hey  i need to rant about my workplace and i feel as if this would be the right place to post  so around 8 weeks ago i started a new job in a food warehouse  it s 40 hours minimum per week   8 50 an hour and the warehouse is set at just above 0 degrees c  it s sucks  it s very physically and mentally demanding as one day i could be loading people s shopping  heavy af  onto the trailers all day and the other i could be just simply removing the plastic bags from the boxes  one after the other  for 9 hours  these past few weeks i ve been really struggling to cope due to the nature of the job  the people i m surrounded by  male dominated environment  and my ongoing situation of my mental health  i m still in my probationary period however i ve already had quite a few absences  these absences have been times where i have shown up for work at 6am after waking up at 4 30am  done a few hours of work and then got sent home by management due to panic attacks etc  work are telling me that if i have one more absence i risk getting sacked   because of this  i figured i could go to my local gp and get a sick note for 2 weeks for my depression so i can have some time to heal and think about future plans from a job perspective  i mentioned this to my manager today and he said that this would affect my probationary period and i would most likely be sacked  i asked if it would be the same if i had broken a bone and had to take some time off sick  and he said yes   so here i am now  crying everyday at work  having panic attacks and not being able to perform at my best ability whilst wondering when they are going to sack me because of this  i need this job  i have bills to pay  but at the same time i know i m more important  what do i even do at this point  are we just going to be trapped like this forever ,egfokw

129,A Marxist case against work,my previous post caused some confusion among users who  i believe  struggle to conceptualize a truly different society  i replied to one comment with an argument i took from marx' 1844 manuscripts in which he explains what it would entail to overcome alienation of labor  i take alienated labor to correspond to  or reveal the secret behind  the common usage of the word  work  in our capitalist context  and the comments on my posts reinforced this assumption  as many users seem to envision socially useful labor under socialism to still consist in a duty we have towards the community  perhaps in some way coerced  i e  a sacrifice of our time  hence a labor that is alienated  which they call work  i want to argue that the goal of socialism is to overcome this form of labor completely  so for whom it interests  here is the comment    gt  following marx i think we should distinguish between work as alienated labor  and labor as such  it is the nature of human beings to realize their own individuality and humanity through productive activity  which we call labor  under capitalism this activity is alienated because it is performed in accordance with forces and ends that are alien to us  accumulation of capital and competition between capitalists  we sacrifice a central part of our life and individuality in order to power a machine that not only stands apart from life  but destroys it on a large scale  the goal of socialism then is to return labor to its real purpose  the creation and enrichment of life and humanity  for marx  the laborers under socialism labor voluntarily for the sake of the whole of humanity because they recognize humanity as part of themselves  and at the same time as their own project  their own creation  the needs of everyone thus become their own needs  in any case  socialism should not only be understood as a reduction of work to allow people to have more time for their private hobbies  but as the eventual overcoming of work as an activity that embodies an opposition between the personal and the social    naturally not everyone will agree with this anthropological characterization  but i think socialists should at least be prepared to agree that humans have some capacity for reconciling personal and collective needs in this way  without coercion  marx cites love as an example of this human capacity for selflessness without self-sacrifice  on that basis we can argue that automation allows us to reduce the amount of labor that needs to be performed in the collective interest to keep society running to the amount that would be voluntarily performed in a society where the individuals can rely on the community to satisfy their needs  and where laboring for the community at least potentially contributes to personal fullfillment ,ed0ry9

147,I found another post in another forum describing our lives, first off i don't know many jobs that allow you to stroll in at 9am  work begins at 8am  meaning to be at your desk  you need to be leaving the house by 7 30am  if you plan on showering and eating breakfast at a normal pace  or doing anything besides throwing clothes on and walking out of the door - you'll be waking up at 6 30am or earlier depending on how much you try to get done before work      this also assumes you can leave at 7 30am and still get to work on time  odds are if you live in a metro or have any reasonable commute  you will be leaving at 7 00am or earlier  meaning you'll be waking up at 6      you arrive at work and sit at your desk  whatever your task is i can promise it is not fulfilling  you will not feel good about  accomplishing  anything that day because nothing of substance will be accomplished      at 10 30am you will get your first 15 minute break  assuming your employer recognizes dol labor practices  you will either go outside and smoke or try to fix a mix-morning snack to keep your metabolism up despite sitting at a desk all day      as soon as 12 00 hits  you will race out of the building for lunch  assuming you didn't spend the precious non-work hours meal prepping  and jam into the same crowded places within walking distance everyone else does  you choose from the same menu you have a thousand times before  you see all the same people who jam into the same restaurant you do a thousand times before  you try to jam your food down so you have time to attempt to enjoy the brief few moments of respite with your phone or tablet - the screen being the tiny window that is only escape from the hell of white collar slavery      at 1pm you will return to your desk and work non-stop until 5pm with a single 15 minute break  there will probably be at least one or more messages waiting for you when you get back because some dumbfuc- er  client  called while you were trying to live the life of a normal human being      at 5pm you will jam yourself back into traffic and spend anywhere from 30m - 1 hour trying to get either home  to the gym  or to essential places like the grocery store  if you're able to get home by 5 30  consider yourself lucky  assuming you do gym - gt  grocery  you might as well consign yourself to hopefully getting home before 8pm      when you get home  you will still have routine   to do - laundry  cleaning up  making food  whatever else  at best during the week  you'll have maybe 1-2 hours to do anything remotely recreational  tv  internet  whatever  assuming you're going for 8 hours of sleep  you hit the bed at 10pm in anticipation of your alarm going off at 6am so you can do it all again      saturday will be your only real day ever to yourself  it's marred by the fact that trying to go out and do anything on saturday shoves you in with everyone else in the same boat - everything's crowded  the roads are packed  takes forever to get anywhere or do anything because of the people  the day goes by in a blur and soon it's sunday  meaning you get to spend time prepping for 5 days back in the salt mines being a slave      the only two things your white collar job as an employee likely provides for you are a semi-decent income and stability  beyond that  you are treated as a disposable commodity  your work is all on paper or on a computer  it will be rare if ever that your work directly produces anything tangible and useful for anyone - most notably yourself      the pay you receive will always be minuscule compared to the profit your labor yields for the company or owner  while you are not on the hook for the ultimate responsibility if the business itself fails  you will be held responsible by your boss for everything up until that point  if you have an inbox  you will live next to it - going so far to even have your work email pushed to your phone so you can reply at any time  even on vacation      if you truly move up high enough and get into business admin  the job subsumes your life  you are permanently on call  your inbox is flooded with so much   you could never possibly sort and read through every email  note  request  message  whatever  you eventually get a secretary to help keep track of your schedule  but it's a schedule you've long since lost all control over  you're drug from one meeting to the next  placed in charge of a team of personalities ranging from apathetic high school dropout to over-achieving brown noser who is gunning for your job next pay period      assuming you still have some kind of friends or a relationship on the side  those too will eventually yield to the weight of the job      you wake up one day and you're 50 or 60-something and you look in the mirror to find a shell where a human being used to be  you look in the rear view mirror and see nothing      nothing was created  nothing was destroyed  a bunch of paper moved around your desk that you may or may not have touched  it may or may not have had your name on it at the time  you may have said something  or advised on how something should be done - but you never did anything  nothing that produced a tangible result  it was all paper - some of it green paper with little numbers on it  some of it paper with legal letterhead - but all of it nothing but an endless mountain of paper in the end      maybe you're rich by now  maybe not  depending on what track you took  you could still be working for the same wage you were working for 10-15 years ago doing the exact same thing  or maybe by now you own the company and you and the company are the same thing  the company is your identity and you are it  the traits of the company are your own character traits  if the company went under  you'd probably suicide  because there would be nothing left of you  you stop to ponder taking time off from running your company  but realize that might as well be like trying to stop breathing      at your funeral  few people if anyone will mention what your college major was  or what your graduating gpa was  or how many interviews you went through with boring questions to get that first position working the   job pushing paper  few people if anyone will care if you wore a suit from goodwill or a suit from   to your last meeting  few people if anyone will mention how many times you reached over across the bed to turn off your alarm clock at 5 59am  dragged your ass to the sink  and brushed your teeth in a daze to start the day after trying to actually live your life and stay up past 10pm       tl dr   in the end  that is what a white collar job is  a meaningless  pointless  soul-destroying profession that amounts to next to nothing       for some  it can make you rich if that's your thing  but for most  it's a one-way ticket to a mediocre existence in front of a computer making an increasingly marginalized middle-class wage doing unfulfilling   that involves a bare minimum of critical thinking to accomplish a task that will yield no tangible result besides a piece of paper moving from the  in  bin to the  out  bin ,eearqj

160,work-culture drains the soul and any life.,i'm not bashing having a job  dont assume that right off the bat   but i worked with someone who is single  lives in an apartment and works 40-50 hours a week    he has no real hobbies outside of video games   and barely makes enough to pay for rent and groceries      i was talking with him  so what do you do for fun   i play video games or watch netflix  i asked him if he goes on even personal trips  nah  i just stay home and watch netflix or ride by bike around the block    and that got me thinking this is what they want from us they want us to become drones with no real personal life except consuming whatever tv show or game comes out    then work and make the rich even richer   again i'm not bashing having a job  because it is vital and there  are  jobs pay a little less but they are better than doing retail or office work   everyone i talk to who works full-time just seems like a shell of their former selves ,edw2bp

163,Capitalism only value those with potential for exploitation,from the time a baby is born  they are groomed to be subjects of exploitation  school is the process of weeding out those that don't offer potential to be exploited and those that are deemed  smart   good students   conscientious  which is really code for people that will make a lot of money for the their bosses to exploit  as a society  we place way too much emphasis on being  smart  and being obedient  hardworking  following rules and generally being good at things that will create money for the capitalist bosses to enjoy    those that are deemed to not have enough potential to exploit and simply discarded and left by the wayside to pick up the pieces and try to survive on their own  this includes old people who have given all their energy away and have none left to exploit  disabled people  artists  free thinkers  and anyone who just isn't able or willing to be exploited    this is why schools focus on the wrong subjects and prepare us for a life of servitude  why they focus so much on getting good grades  standardized tests  these are indicators for the capitalists of who will be best to exploit    this is one of the reasons why our society is so fragmented  why are communities our broken  we place so much value on people based on where they work and how much money they make  but we are all valuable  we are all of equal value  and we have to start treating each other like we all matter    thanks for listening to my rant ,ee4249

186,Examination of a Summer Seasonal Worker's Pay, puts massachusetts male earners with a bachelor's degree at  73 399  i'm only making  56  of that at best   not to mention  my degree doesn't match my field that i'm currently getting experience in   i tried looking for new jobs in my area where my experience from this job comes into play  but of the roughly 20 positions i applied for  none replied back to me   positions where my degree is useful are few and far between  and of the 4 positions available  three were paid about  3 00 an hour less than my current rate  and the one that did meet my criteria did not reply back   then there is my financial situation   i'm trying to repay student loans and tons of medical debt  not to mention a new  to me  car payment because my 2004 junker shit the bed this august   most of my earnings are thrown out the window as soon as it comes in   although  that isn't to say i don't have some expendable cash  i also have some expensive habits i can use to kick   i've already come to terms that i probably won't be moving out of my parents place until my mid thirties   i encourage you guys to take a look at what you're earning and what you should be earning   i think it's hard for a lot of people to understand that making a decent amount does not equal making the right amount   i hope to rekindle my job search this layoff season in hopes of finding a better position  because i've seen the way my boss lives  and my boss' boss wants to put me there  and i'm not sure if that's what i want to be for the rest of my career   notes about the spreadsheet     the first 4 paid weeks were only 8 hours of work per week  which is because i was technically laid off   however  sometimes there is a job that requires more than one worker at the plant  and the one worker who is kept on over the lay off period needs assistance   also  massachusetts unemployment insurance will continue to pay out if you only work 8 hours or less in a work week    the week of 05 04 was the first week i was raised from  20 an hour to  22 an hour    i was out of work for the pay week of 07 13 due to an injury i sustained at work   i was paid workers comp  but i elected to keep it from the data because that doesn't reflect what my work payed out to me    ot   overtime   ut   undertime  unpaid    during the week of 09 21 we were paid out our remaining paid time off  and it was added as ot to our paychecks    during the week of 10 12  i was hospitalized and inpatient  non-work related  and due to our paid time off getting paid out on 09 21  i was not able to cover the days i was out    tl dr  i procured and calculated a bunch of data so i can whine about how i'm only making just over half of what my fellow male  bachelor's degree holding  massachusetts counterparts earn  even though i make  22 an hour on paper  because i'm bored ,ef6239
187,I Showed My Colors,an email was going around soliciting ideas and contributions for a gift to our manager  giftcards for  a spa  restaurant  amazon  target  or something else  usually i just politely decline  this year i had enough  i said i disagree with workplace gifts  especially for management  and we should stop  of course they won't  but a few asked about it in direct conversation and i gave my reasons    long story short  manager makes close to  125k a year  more than double what i get  and i haven't seen a raise in five years  plus all the bullshit perks because the 'manager' title   if anyone needs a spa day  it's me  us  yet  i can't afford that  she can  i can't afford the restaurant they mentioned  she can    i hate this time of year  the pressures of consumerism and draining the account  for what  especially when that pressure comes from the job i hate yet can't seem to leave for reasons not worth explaining now   i hope everyone reading is able to make it through this month okay  it's getting worse every year for me ,ed99tz

193,I found a post in another forum describing our lives, first off i don't know many jobs that allow you to stroll in at 9am  work begins at 8am  meaning to be at your desk  you need to be leaving the house by 7 30am  if you plan on showering and eating breakfast at a normal pace  or doing anything besides throwing clothes on and walking out of the door - you'll be waking up at 6 30am or earlier depending on how much you try to get done before work      this also assumes you can leave at 7 30am and still get to work on time  odds are if you live in a metro or have any reasonable commute  you will be leaving at 7 00am or earlier  meaning you'll be waking up at 6      you arrive at work and sit at your desk  whatever your task is i can promise it is not fulfilling  you will not feel good about  accomplishing  anything that day because nothing of substance will be accomplished      at 10 30am you will get your first 15 minute break  assuming your employer recognizes dol labor practices  you will either go outside and smoke or try to fix a mix-morning snack to keep your metabolism up despite sitting at a desk all day      as soon as 12 00 hits  you will race out of the building for lunch  assuming you didn't spend the precious non-work hours meal prepping  and jam into the same crowded places within walking distance everyone else does  you choose from the same menu you have a thousand times before  you see all the same people who jam into the same restaurant you do a thousand times before  you try to jam your food down so you have time to attempt to enjoy the brief few moments of respite with your phone or tablet - the screen being the tiny window that is only escape from the hell of white collar slavery      at 1pm you will return to your desk and work non-stop until 5pm with a single 15 minute break  there will probably be at least one or more messages waiting for you when you get back because some dumbfuc- er  client  called while you were trying to live the life of a normal human being      at 5pm you will jam yourself back into traffic and spend anywhere from 30m - 1 hour trying to get either home  to the gym  or to essential places like the grocery store  if you're able to get home by 5 30  consider yourself lucky  assuming you do gym - gt  grocery  you might as well consign yourself to hopefully getting home before 8pm      when you get home  you will still have routine   to do - laundry  cleaning up  making food  whatever else  at best during the week  you'll have maybe 1-2 hours to do anything remotely recreational  tv  internet  whatever  assuming you're going for 8 hours of sleep  you hit the bed at 10pm in anticipation of your alarm going off at 6am so you can do it all again      saturday will be your only real day ever to yourself  it's marred by the fact that trying to go out and do anything on saturday shoves you in with everyone else in the same boat - everything's crowded  the roads are packed  takes forever to get anywhere or do anything because of the people  the day goes by in a blur and soon it's sunday  meaning you get to spend time prepping for 5 days back in the salt mines being a slave      the only two things your white collar job as an employee likely provides for you are a semi-decent income and stability  beyond that  you are treated as a disposable commodity  your work is all on paper or on a computer  it will be rare if ever that your work directly produces anything tangible and useful for anyone - most notably yourself      the pay you receive will always be minuscule compared to the profit your labor yields for the company or owner  while you are not on the hook for the ultimate responsibility if the business itself fails  you will be held responsible by your boss for everything up until that point  if you have an inbox  you will live next to it - going so far to even have your work email pushed to your phone so you can reply at any time  even on vacation      if you truly move up high enough and get into business admin  the job subsumes your life  you are permanently on call  your inbox is flooded with so much   you could never possibly sort and read through every email  note  request  message  whatever  you eventually get a secretary to help keep track of your schedule  but it's a schedule you've long since lost all control over  you're drug from one meeting to the next  placed in charge of a team of personalities ranging from apathetic high school dropout to over-achieving brown noser who is gunning for your job next pay period      assuming you still have some kind of friends or a relationship on the side  those too will eventually yield to the weight of the job      you wake up one day and you're 50 or 60-something and you look in the mirror to find a shell where a human being used to be  you look in the rear view mirror and see nothing      nothing was created  nothing was destroyed  a bunch of paper moved around your desk that you may or may not have touched  it may or may not have had your name on it at the time  you may have said something  or advised on how something should be done - but you never did anything  nothing that produced a tangible result  it was all paper - some of it green paper with little numbers on it  some of it paper with legal letterhead - but all of it nothing but an endless mountain of paper in the end      maybe you're rich by now  maybe not  depending on what track you took  you could still be working for the same wage you were working for 10-15 years ago doing the exact same thing  or maybe by now you own the company and you and the company are the same thing  the company is your identity and you are it  the traits of the company are your own character traits  if the company went under  you'd probably suicide  because there would be nothing left of you  you stop to ponder taking time off from running your company  but realize that might as well be like trying to stop breathing      at your funeral  few people if anyone will mention what your college major was  or what your graduating gpa was  or how many interviews you went through with boring questions to get that first position working the   job pushing paper  few people if anyone will care if you wore a suit from goodwill or a suit from   to your last meeting  few people if anyone will mention how many times you reached over across the bed to turn off your alarm clock at 5 59am  dragged your ass to the sink  and brushed your teeth in a daze to start the day after trying to actually live your life and stay up past 10pm       tl dr   in the end  that is what a white collar job is  a meaningless  pointless  soul-destroying profession that amounts to next to nothing       for some  it can make you rich if that's your thing  but for most  it's a one-way ticket to a mediocre existence in front of a computer making an increasingly marginalized middle-class wage doing unfulfilling   that involves a bare minimum of critical thinking to accomplish a task that will yield no tangible result besides a piece of paper moving from the  in  bin to the  out  bin ,eeb02w

215,"We put ourselves through immense stress and pain to keep up the grind, losing all sense of pleasure in the process",i only recently entered my   but i've been having anti-work sentiment stirring in my head since around age 16  thinking about the futility keeps me up at night sometimes- see  even on christmas    amp x200b    amp x200b   as a sixteen year old girl  i got my very first job performing and serving in a tourist trap train show  think christmas holiday type gig  i am autistic and have sensory as well as communicative issues  i had my hair kept short  and i didn't wear makeup  i was also very quiet and only did well during performances rather than interactions with other coworkers  they didn't like that i was different     amp x200b    amp x200b    amp x200b   it made things very difficult for me  in the blistering cold  or sweltering heat  i'd get put on trains with no heating or air while the boss's daughter and her friends were put on the first class train everytime  i remember one day i was a bit slow because i had been on the non ac car all day  and it was the one day i had to work with the boss's daughter     amp x200b    amp x200b   she was very rude to me and made fun of me because i stumbled  scolding me and huffing loudly about me  i began to have dread everyday coming to work because of how my coworkers spoke to me  and i could do absolutely nothing because nepotism     amp x200b    amp x200b    amp x200b   the final straw was when an older male coworker over 12 years older than me started flirting with me  i was underaged and

x200b    amp x200b   some days i would not eat because there was so much work to be done  grueling  manual work like moving heavy boxes  scrubbing floors and toilets  constantly on your feet and running around while customers screamed and yelled at you  i was also the dish washer in addition to my other tasks- assurancd  i was very meticulous about cleanliness   i was told if i kept 'taking so long to do dishes' and staying past my allotted shift to finish them that i would not get paid for that time    amp x200b    amp x200b    amp x200b   my coworkers took advantage of me  they knew i drank the grind grind grind strong work ethic mentality and exploited it  while hollering at me for accidentally putting one extra pinch of chicken on a sandwich because it would cost the company money  everyone said this was unskilled  low stress work but the amount of times i would accidentally make a minor mistake during a shift and get absolutely destroyed by my bosses or coworkers for it was astounding    amp x200b    amp x200b    amp x200b   i ended up leaving that job too because apparently i called out too much due to an influx of mental physical problems  once again  as a newly anointed adult  i had to get a job once more while on a break semester from university  time for retail  the other menace of wage slavery    amp x200b    amp x200b   my retail experience gave me my first taste of  wow  90  of jobs are absolutely useless  that was a bitter pill to swallow  that i had to be confined in what felt like prison for 8 hours a day  conjuring the illusion of productivity  even better was the fact that we weren't allowed to sit down  so you had to seem busy on the sales floor when there was no work to be done    amp x200b    amp x200b   managers would come up and yell at me because i wasn't  watching people carefully enough who could potentially be stealing  and i had a serious moral issue with those kinds of assumptions  everyone at my store was a redneck  anti-lgbt  overwhelmingly trump supporting kind of character  and it made my days at work pure misery because i simply was an outsider  if someone was extremely creepy or controversial they'd just get moved to throwing the truck instead     amp x200b    amp x200b   i had to work at this job for around 7 months  and it was absolutely hell for me  i fell into the deepest depression i've had thus far because i was barely 18 years old  no friends  no life  abusive bf  and too exhausted from work to change anything about my situation  i could barely care for myself  coming home to cook or clean was like torture  when i'd have to stand in the kitchen to prepare food after a shift  the pain in my back was like someone had dipped a hot poker stick into a bed of flaming coals and scraped it up my spine    amp x200b    amp x200b   fast food and retail work destroyed my back  legs  and joints  i still don't have a diagnosis for what is wrong with my body  but work did it no favors  i began to develop a serious disdain for working  i went back to university and decided to pursue a stem field  hoping and praying i would never be stuck in a physically demanding job again in my life     amp x200b    amp x200b    amp x200b   yet  i found that another sort of stress existed- not the stress on my body from standing and lifting all day  but the stress of sitting at a desk doing fuckall and receiving no mental or physical stimulation whatsoever  however  it is seen as the absolute prize in america to grind for one of these positions  it makes me feel ill and disillusioned with the world i live in  i stopped feeling pleasure from most things because i didn't see the point in anything now    amp x200b    amp x200b    amp x200b   i worked in technical support part time last year  during this time i believe my adhd and autism symptoms worsened because i was simply on my phone doing nothing all day at work and it shot my concentration  all my coworkers would chat and have a great time socializing but i was always left out  once again  because i'm autistic and fail completely at the social games and expectations of workplace cordiality politics    amp x200b    amp x200b    i moved universities so i did not have this job for too long  but i landed another temp technical job shortly after  and it was the same song and dance  except i kept leaving to go home early because i couldn't stand sitting in silence in a room for 8 hrs  my boss gave me minimal guidance on what i was meant to be programming  my coworkers ignored me and even accidentally hit me in the head with a ball because they 'did not see me sitting in the corner desk'  and i felt like the caged bird once more    amp x200b    amp x200b   after the job finished  i felt guilty because i didn't work hard enough and barely accomplished anything our team had set out to achieve  as i was too depressed to feel any passion for the grind  any sense of pleasure i felt was long overshadowed by the constant mantra of resume building activities i was guided into  applied behavioral analysis therapy to try to make me seem  less autistic  so that i could mask and have the persona of normality to stay in uni and land a job  and the pain i'd shouldered from life and work stressors  i've been told so many times that i just need to get over my physical pain and anxiety and autism and suck it up cause everybody has to work    amp x200b    amp x200b    amp x200b   i currently do volunteer research work  and while i'd say it's more fulfilling than previous occupations  feels like my tasks have a real purpose    i still loathe work and find it dull  meaningless in the grand scheme of things  and unnecessary  just a pissing contest of who can be more miserable and climb the ranks to a cushy 9-5 desk job with a cozy managerial position the fastest    amp x200b    amp x200b    amp x200b   recently i met someone online i fancied quite a lot and we started dating  both of us are autistic  both struggle with social norms and adjusting to adult life  except my boyfriend excels at finding and keeping jobs  his attitudes regarding work align perfectly with the societal narrative of grind till you can't anymore    amp x200b    amp x200b   i love my boyfriend dearly  and it breaks my heart to see the sacrifices he makes for a career  he is underpayed due to his disability  expected to do a senior position's duties without a formal job title  so they can justify paying him less  and lets his workplace stomp all over his autonomy and his freedom to have an actual life    amp x200b    amp x200b    amp x200b   his job is mostly sitting at a desk all day and occasionally touching a spreadsheet  the others at his work who are payed handsomely cannot even use the software and technology their positions require and make him labor for them because they are too lazy to open google and learn basic microsoft office knowledge    amp x200b    amp x200b   my partner wastes two hours of his life commuting everyday to a job that often assigns him no tasks and forces him to be unproductive all day  i've seen him turn up to his job while being terribly ill  or after a hospital visit  all because   it reflects my character poorly to be absent  and i need them to know i am serious about work    amp x200b    amp x200b   our relationship is long distance  which makes visiting often hard when you barely get any time off work  even now  he was working on christmas eve  although he sees it as a bonus that he got to sit at home and refresh his email and be on call for one single day  when his job has absolutely no reason to not let him work from home  i get angry about unfair things in life like this  when i rant to him that it's insane that we live like this  he tells me it's just the way that things are  it is the way of the world to work and we can't change this fact    amp x200b    amp x200b    amp x200b   i feel like once i gained this insight into what the world is really like and that working is an absolute explotive sham  there is no way for me to return to my previous schools of thought  i can't unlearn my conviction and dogmas related to anti work  once again  i've found myself sinking into depression  slapstick workplace comedies like the office  peep show  it crowd  etc make me feel ill  can there really be more to life than this  are the only thoughts i have while consuming meda like that nowadays    amp x200b    amp x200b    amp x200b   contemplating my future makes me insanely pessimistic and full of despair  i plan to go to graduate school and have a career in research academia but i've struggled to hold any job since becoming sick  i've been on more psychiatric medications than you can imagine and i still have no motivation or energy  i fear the day i graduate university  as i can't see myself trapped in the confines of a 40 hr work week  rife with the extra shackles of a painful commute  i can't handle 40  hrs but good luck finding a job that doesn't require it    amp x200b    amp x200b    amp x200b   even sitting here with the love of my life  i have absolutely no hope because to live in america- or most anywhere in the universe-is to work  my partner believes work gives him a purpose  work merely gives me a sense of dread  i can't find any work that seems tolerable to me  i watched my boyfriend talk about science with stars in his eyes  yet he is a white-collar wage slave plugging at business spreadsheets     amp x200b    amp x200b    amp x200b   when i told him he should pursue his interests  as he holds a bs in physical sciences  he simply told me that most people ever gets a job in the field their degree is in  it's unreasonable  no jobs exist  or those that exist won't pay well  or some other excuse  i feel like there is something inherent that i lack  merely because i don't have this mindset  my ability to grind during wage slavery is gone  i cannot be complacent with cubicles  suits and ties  office politics  coffee runs  and fucking excel spreadsheets    amp x200b    amp x200b   wish i didn't feel so lost in life all the time  wish i'd stayed in the dark with blissful ignorance and never contemplated my disdain for modern societal expectations manistested in the reality of the 9-5 hustle  it's hard to feel this way  i'm only 20 and already feel as if the joy has been sucked from me  it only goes downhill from here ,efba1t

251,The Planet is Literally Being Worked to Death,my main ethical gripe with modern work is that  production  is often just the depletion  amp  destruction of nature to sustain an unnaturally large population that may not plateau for about 80 years  un medium projection  we have more and more people working longer hours to  produce  goods from declining material stocks  funded by monetary debt that masks physical depletion  the masking effect is denied by cornucopians who've become so wrapped up in money they've forgotten its origins   examples include the extraction of finite resources like fossil fuels  along with decreasingly-renewable timber stocks  aquifers  and of course overfishing  just a fractional list  this also explains the constant rush to deliver products on time  vs  only having to supply what small groups used to need  you're working for the sake of too many others and it feels forced for a reason   also  much of what's called  hard work  seems unnaturally hard and or dangerous  no other species has to spend so much time keeping a vast infrastructure running 24 7  and most complaints about corporate control of our lives can be tied to this growthist cycle  it's easy to complain about the people at the top milking the biggest salaries  but every worker is locked into the same resource feeding-frenzy   there's talk of green gdp  ggdp  replacing standard gdp which only measures money  but invasive technologies like big wind are adding to ecosystem destruction in new ways  rebranding the same old story  much of what's called green is just new marketing angles with little chance of halting agw  when the clarion call of  job creation  ends up destroying more of nature  how is it true progress   the planet is crawling with more engineers and laborers  like mosquitoes bleeding it dry  literally poking holes with drilling and mining  i see no moral purpose in making a nature-wrecking economy bigger and bigger  nor do i see intrinsic value in more complex gadgets to keep the system from crashing  but that's exactly what much of the economy is  and the financial sector both funds and feeds off that growth  so there's no incentive to break the cycle ,ecmw3m

259,got fired half a year ago,so i got fired from my last job  the firing took me by surprise because i was a good employee and the managers seemed to be  satisfied with my performance  i mean i did not  like  the job  working full-time sucks  but it was bearable esp because my colleagues seemed super nice and friendly   back to the firing  i came to office one day and was called into a room  hr and manager were there  they told me they were going to terminate my contract because my presence  is seriously damaging the company's reputation  a second later they showed me some screen caps of my personal instagram photos  i was like wtf  so i am a gay dude  and sometimes i share  sexy pics  on my  personal instagram  mind you  none of those were nudes  instagram doesnt allow them anyway  so the pics they showed me were  one pic i was in my briefs  one pic i was in a pride parade with other half naked people  one pic was at a gay bar full of half-naked guys  they told me they found them repulsive and went on to shame me on my sexuality and the way i express it online  i tried to argue with them that  1  i dont see anything wrong with the pics  and  2  what i do in my personal time is none of their business  most importantly  it was blatant discrimination  then this manager  who used to be super nice to me  yelled at me  saying  it's not about your sexuality  it's the pictures themselves  they're obscene  i am a soft-spoken guy and was intimidated by his yelling and so did not go on to argue with them  they paid me in lieu of my notice period  and i was forced to pack everything and leave right after   that was half a year ago  i wouldn't lie   not working for a few months was great for my well-being  i get to wake up whenever i want  i actually have time and energy to read a book  i get to travel a bit  etc  moreover  taking a break from  work for the first time since graduation actually allows me reflect on how mind-numbing full-time job is   never had enough rest  always had to care about what my colleagues and managers think about me  and dont even mention any sense of personal achievement or growth  on the other hand  because of how they insulted me on my last day  this past year i've had many episodes of depression anger whenever i think back to what happened  still fresh in my mind  worse  those  friends  at work either blocked me or ignored my messages  probably because in corporate logic it is inappropriate to talk with anyone who is fired   just sharing my experience  thanks for reading ,ebx33z

316,I'm ready to get out by any means necessary. Am I screwed?,forgive me if any of this is awkwardly worded  my mind is beyond frazzled    i am 21 years old   ever since working my first job back in 2016  i've been employed at 10 places  lots of these jobs were just a means to a paycheck  but some i had decided to pursue for being related to passions and hobbies of mine  i've learned plenty  which i suppose is the one silver lining  however tarnished it may be  my most recent job has actually been a bit of a breath of fresh air  while still riddled with typical flaws that most labor jobs have  it is by far the best environment i've worked in    well  now i want out   since the beginning of november  and i literally mean november 1st  my luck  which had previously been treating me well  turned for the worse  i was  pulled over  in an illegal traffic stop  in my work parking lot  since that point  life has been rotten  since i've enjoyed my current job more than any other i've ever worked  my attendance and work ethic had been very good  well  i'm sitting here the eve before heading back to work after 5 missed days  my supervisors are unhappy  i am unhappy  none of these absences were my fault  i didn't want this to happen  yet  now i stare in the face the possibility of losing my job  does that make me upset  i  don't think it does  really    i've thought i loved many of my previous jobs  they all turned extremely sour at one point or another  usually by no fault of my own  working at fedex  it is currently the peak season  and shifts are greuling  much stress is on my shoulders  ba dum tiss  the drivers i load for verbally abuse me for things out of my control  my supervisors critique me for being overwhelmed by the volume  they  are supposed to keep manageable  there sometimes is literally  no water  despite it being a very active job  these were not issues before the holidays  so my opinion of working there has certainly suffered  unrelated to why i've recently missed so many days  though   but what does upset me  is thinking of how i have to go find another job if this one fails  like  this job fucking  sucks  don't get me wrong  but it sucks less than most  my coworkers are mostly cool people  but if  this  still drives me insane  what  won't   i'd love to have my own business  maybe run a record store  or a hobby shop  or be a professional musician  since i write so much music  but you need to be able to invest and risk for those goals  i don't have money  i don't have capital  and soon i might not even have a job  these are unachievable goals    but i cannot keep cycling through jobs like this  there's no short supply of simple work for me to get  i've done things like landscaping  tradework  retail  food service  janitorial  and now warehouse  plus others  all over the board  nothing has stuck around  i am so   so  desperate to leave this horrible cycle    maybe i'll try and see my doctor  have him recommend me a psychiatrist or something  see if there's some way   any  way  i can make it onto ss unemployment  something  my mental health has degraded so heavily and i need a break  i need a chance to actually do things other than work and run around with my head metaphorically cut off   10 jobs in less than 4 years is just insane  only a few have been at the same time as each other  please tell me i'm not alone  only 2 of those jobs i have left on good terms  i can't be the only one with this shit luck  constantly getting abused by employers in some way shape or form  all while my sanity tanks and starts rotting all the other parts of my life as a result    i'm sorry for the large wall of text  i have so much i need to get out of my system  i feel so trapped  bills are piling up quicker than they can be paid  fuck ,eb6r1f

331,Anyone else a long-term temp out there?,on 12 31 my contract is up on the 3rd or 4th longtime job - not including the many small  humiliating 2 weekers  long enough to get a taste of wonderful  at least on the outside  offices and their perks  while making minimum wage    i have been here 8 months and watched my boss hire employee after employee  when i asked if he would convert me  he said he wouldn't even consider it till january of this year  that's how low value i am    i am in my early 30s  this year another birthday passed and all i could think is - the women i went to school with are settled in long term careers  probably making mid to high 5 figures  and have never been without health insurance  including girlfriends who temped in my city - in 2012    i know my flaws  i come at 10  10 15  and stay till 6 15-6 30  it's tolerated  no matter how early i wake up - the sick thing is i'm so fucking tired and out of it i just go slower  and then spend the rest of the morning on bathroom trips once the coffee starts passing through  thanks to ibs  i'm an adult paranoid about being trapped on a subway and pissing myself or worse   it takes longer just for the glow of the computer while i check weather or email for my eyes to unblur    it's ruined my life  i know how fucking weak and stupid i sound  i think so too  my life now revolves around taking a shit and covering my acne in time to come at 10    that's enough to have rendered me unemployable   i'm not very attractive  i am a nervous smiler  but unlike the other offices i was in  where the contempt from upper management was open  this one seems to like me enough and more  i have grown attached to my coworkers   they all know i am a temp  except one or two  i think  it's fucking humiliating  i never told them i still was  that's enough  when these people are in their early 20s  were hired out of college - as one should be  as i never was  losing 10 years to horrible menial jobs   self employment  and grad school in childhood ed  so much unpaid work    i can picture these people looking at my timecards  looking at the budget   even when my  young  direct supervisors were happy with my work and knew i worked hard  the actual directors pass me over    in the 10 years since i have graduated from college  i'll admit it - i never learned a skill that is valuable enough to make me permanent  i have no master's    when i interview for permanent jobs  because my entire resume is  temp work - i wish i could describe the disgust  the absolute confusion  followed by phony smiles of repulsion i receive - from companies that hire temps  often temps like me  actually  from companies that know they don't want to hire me but an hr person has to seem like they're looking for candidates  who call me in  humiliate me  and then dress me down even when i have the actual experience they're looking for   i worked for a year as an intern with no pay part time  just to get office experience  this is now my third year as a temp  it's felt like 10  psychologically and physically  it might as well be - i know i'm ugly and older and people can tell i'm not fresh from college    i never interned  too stupid  too ill  and too poorly performing a student  i took classes in summer and barely stayed afloat during the year  i graduated with a 3 0 and didn't kill myself  those are the two accomplishments i have to show for my entire worthless existence    in 2019  the horrible offices that offered my friends 12 hour in 2012 now offer people like me 14 hour  15 hour  no benefits  contracts lasting three days  two weeks  a month  six months with no hope of conversion  that's when things work out and there's no abuse  i shared a project with one coworker  got blamed for her mistakes  and was fired when she was   nobody sees me  i watch the debates  i bookmark links on the social divide  on the public option  on millennial downward economic mobility and the truth is  nobody gives two fucks about the long term unemployed underemployed  nobody in the political landscape   when you are a long term temp or an older long-term unemployed  and thus unemployable - human garbage to employees  especially of the  unskilled  or lower skilled kind - nobody sees you  nobody gives a fuck about you  you're bad  you're garbage  if you weren't  you wouldn't be a temp    day after day  even when times are fat  i think of the companies  including the one before this - once again  an erp software data management project  where i was fired and 20-somethings fresh out of college were made an offer in six months  my direct manager left the company the week before the contract ended    my direct manager supervisor did here too    it isn't just the untold and horrible humiliations of chatting up employees  as they are - i'm not  and befriending them  trying not to think of their six figure salaries and the careers  they've had  what they know  who have been mentored  and what they had the power to do - i have to smile and be nice to upper managers who have the utmost contempt for me  go to industry events that have no effect on me    i drown in a sea of bad faith  fear  and contempt  i have swallowed it and internalized it  how can you not hate people who are employing you under conditions that prove unions are dead  that exist with the understanding you don't deserve the most basic dignities of labor   all i have to show for my life is a college degree  my great dream was to work for public advocacy - now my dream is a permanent office job with a path and health insurance  not even that is in the future - i am the sole person responsible for salesforce in my office  there are no mentors and no teammates to guide me  my function is an afterthought    i live in awe of people who had  stupid  majors in college and now work for fortune 500 companies or - more amazingly - got hired in the field of their choice  creative fields  advocacy  who are talented and competent    i think on some level i never pictured that for myself - i liked studying the work  the successes and accomplishment and writing  of others who were  i wish i could describe how that feels  too   i have no identity or life apart from being physically ground to dust by work and commuting and all things related to work  really - shopping for work clothes and dress shoes and things that will make me less disgusting-looking to the men in my office  going to my doctor for adult acne for the same  i have not seen a psychiatrist for drugs in a year  because i am on an add-on and have no mental health coverage  it's so silly pursuing healthcare when you think about suicide 24 7 but hey  i have to be employed until i'm actually ready to kill myself right   every day i think to myself  i generate no revenue  i have no use - to anybody  when i walk through my city and imagine startups and glamorous media companies and prestigious massive multinational investment management pe firms i am filth    there is the employed world - the chosen - and then there are people like me  whom  job creators  see as actual garbage  or temporary pieces of furniture they resent renting    when i was 19 i seriously thought of hanging myself because i couldn't picture getting through a workday  i was so unhappy and so ill   now at 30  smiling into the faces of hiring managers who's withered smiles meet my own with barely-concealed disgust and indifferent  i think to myself - in my failures  my weakness  my stupidity  my worthlessness  if only to them - but what's the difference  when these are the people that have power over my entire existence  - i exceeded my worst nightmares    and the years pass  and i hope to be hired  or i update my resume fruitlessly  knowing as soon as i explain the work was temp  interviewers for jobs -  including temp jobs  - will mentally put my resume in the garbage    nobody sees me  nobody gives a fuck  and if you're out of college for a certain age or can't afford to go and have no valued experience or path to employment -nobody gives a fuck about you  either    obama made a great speech about labor  urging congress to pass it - one of the things he said is  you are not alone    but you are  in capitalism  you are  in the sharing economy  in the age of the  lean office  where  trimming the fat  means enabling the explosion of horrible staffing agencies that exist to get rich off of hopeless pieces of shit like me  pocketing my wages  my benefits  while i'm expected to have a certain software experience  be an expert on sales forecasting reporting  despite never  ever been shown anything but the work to do my own projects - low value  menial - trained shittily instead of being trained to be kept or to acquire transferable skills  and have a college degree to make 15 hour with no health insurance and no retirement benefits - you  temp contractor - you're alone  nobody in elected office thinks any of this is a problem at all    they'll cry and plead and fight one another to suckle jeff bezos' cock with tax breaks so he can set gentrification of whatever city he sets up shop into overdrive  and hire temps  instead    sorry this is a book  i hate myself because these people make me hate myself  and because if i were stronger  less worthless  less stupid  and less  fucking weak  - i would have enrolled in graduate school in the hopes of redeeming the years i blew as an undergrad  tried to intern  tried to finally gain the degree to be deemed  useful    those of you who have english or anthro or history and are even steadily employed as admin in something like a finance office or different from your background -

391,Are ethical jobs gone,ok  those who read my last posts know i work in the flavour industry   since i can't ask my question on linkedin because it would look suspicious for a large number of bootlickers  i'd ask here instead    are there still ethical jobs out there  in this outrageous world  like jobs where i won't realise i'm fucking up my life and the life of multiple people by just following my mission orders   this is a multi-level question  in reality  i'd need to try my luck in a whole new career  right  i'm calling for some change because i don't have a passion for my customer's products  right  because the food industry  whoa  so terribly wrong right now  but then anxieties are raised      can't code because the nefarious effects of ia  also because of a high rate of pollution caused by the mere existence of internet  i'm using social networks tho  sue me    can't approach another industry  clothing  music  etc  because it also bears ethical issues   can't approach a high-level standard because of  well  life  so i will have to scale down my income whatever i choose  i have a masters degree as of currently  i cannot live my current life and also become a student for a long period of time    can't start being self-employed because i ain't knowing shit about how to be a company owner  and i don't really want to deal with all the sales and marketing strategies    we don't need to make this thread only  about me of course   for me  examples of useful and underpaid jobs include   nursing  teaching  garbage-collecting   what is your job  do you consider it useful or ethical or necessary for mankind  does it provide you with some relative comfort  what alternatives did you consider  why can't they work out in the end  have you considered raising a startup or embracing neetdom voluntarily   pleasure discussing with you ,e8wng8

429,The Conquest of Bread Excerpt,in virtue of this monstrous system  the son of the worker  on entering life  finds no field which he may till  no machine which he may tend  no mine in which he may dig  without accepting to leave a great part of what he will produce to a master  he must sell his labour for a scant and uncertain wage  his father and his grandfather has toiled to drain this field  to build this mill  to perfect this machine  they gave to the work the full measure of their strength  and what more could they give    but their heir comes into the world poorer than the lowest savage  if he obtains leave to till the fields  it is on condition of surrendering a quarter of the produce to his master  and another quarter to the government and middle man  and this tax  levied upon him by the state  the capitalist  the lord of the manor  and the middleman  is always increasing  it rarely leaves him the power to improve his system of culture    if he returns to industry  he is allowed to work-though not always even that-only on condition that he yield a half or two-thirds of the product to him whom the land recognizes as the owner of the machine    the conquest of bread -peter kropotkin,e9rsct
430,Upper managers are they of any use at all?, 1st project i was part of at my job was a 100  success  my supervisor and senior project manager had very little participation in the project as he argued with the original manager at the project  who left  and dumped the management to an engineer who by accident got a dual role of swe and manager  my supervisor admitted  that this was the first project that had such success  in my opinion this was because an actual engineer with technical background did the management  also because the engineer was my age the project flowed in a  very relaxed way  totally slacking off and doing all tasks on time  we made all the decisions so we made them in a way that we did our lives easier  while completing the project targets  no pointless meetings no stressing out with appearance over technical details    2nd project we have a  real  manager as we should in the first one  his only interest is looking good to the higher ups including the my supervisor senior project manager   1  pointless meetings  twice a week  check  2  stressing over powerpoints to the point that i do more powerpoints or paper work for the project than tech  check   3  having an opinion on technical aspect while clearly he doesn't even have the minimum background  check   4  because of  3  we get into paths that are dead-ends and we have to work more  check   5  i am suspecting that he dumps his work load on us on some of the paperwork  check   6  moral of the team is low  no one cares anymore  everyone is doing the bare minimum  i am considering in transferring officially to another project where the engineer from my first project does the management  unofficially i work for that but because there is no much work for me there i do both   i wonder how the project will end up compared with my 1st one  the director of the company has admitted that there are management problems  however i believe that weird culture is mostly because of him ,e956mt

435,How should I approach me quitting my job due to workplace bullying?, long story short  for the last 3 weeks my boss did a 180 in her behaviour towards me and 100  excludes me from everything  at first  she wouldn't respond my texts about work  so i mostly spoke to the secretary about things because she clearly didn't want to talk to me  now that we are approaching the end of the year  she didn't include me in secret santa  only the other teachers  i teach at a language school  she didn't include my students nor told me about  ice cream day   something she does occasionally to celebrate holidays  which is basically distributing ice cream to the students  last tuesday  she took me out of my class to lecture me about going to the secretary for things instead of her  saying  who is your boss  me or her  she was extremely hysteric and i'm very anxious so i started shaking in fear  she told me  we will have a serious conversation next week  but i don't want to have a conversation  i just wanna quit my job and never see her face again  but she acts like she doesn't have time to talk to me  i'm 100  sure that i want to quit but i'm also extremely anxious about the whole thing because she is very unpredictable  how should i quit  should i be direct and leave  or should i adress her bullying  should i schedule a time next week to make sure i finally quit or surprise her ,ea8m8y
436,Finally quit my miserable detailing job,for the better part of a year i ve been detailing cars and was promoted to a supervisor a few months ago  i ll admit at first i loved the job  i just loved back to this place after years and was starting to make friends money after being constantly broke  and the freedom of it  take a break whenever  eat whenever  just get the cars done  problem is it just got worse and worse  my mental health deteriorated for multiple reasons  personal and general   my main issue was time  yes we could take a break whenever but you could easily be coerced out of it by a busy car pile up  i should ve just left every time  granted my bosses would have shit to say  so no we didn t actually get to take a break whenever  if it s a weekend or a sale  and believe me they keep buying cars  you re fucked  i have lost so much weight because i couldn t sit down for one meal despite running around for rig he hours a day  and just to put the cherry on top a dealer will bring a ram 35 fucking 00 at 8 at night and if it s new  best believe you ll have to do it if the manager doesn t want to be stuck with it the next morning  because consequently you ll have to pick up even more slack  my grandmother is dying  i m only 19 and we re in a fucking collapse  time is precious  next up was the social aspect  most workers can relate too  i work in a very male dominated field so sexual harassment was a given from the jump  from bosses to dealers to mechanics  groping  lewd language  uncomfortable stares  and every person you talked to you knew it was just so they could fuck  i have been explicitly asked to fuck in a car repeatedly by married men with kids despite purposefully showing no interest  and what s worse is when they start rating the few girls that work there and how purely objectifying is  i never tended to think about their opinions but hearing the shit they d say behind me and other girls backs definitely took a toll on my self esteem  my grandparents are pissed and i m probably going to be kicked out but fuck this at least the guilt of tainting desert water for the sake of a small profit won t haunt me anymore,ea10r6

439,New-Speak,every time i see advertisements now i can t help but to be reminded of the new speak in 1984  commercials love using the term  freedom  to the point that it no longer holds its original meaning  for instance when cell phone companies say  here at get fucked wireless we give you the freedom to choose a plan that best suits you and your family  even though when you sign a cell phone contract you re essentially becoming an indentured servant  i m so tired of these advertisements depicting smiling  perfect families being so happy that they just bought some superfluous bull shit that they ll be paying for for the next decade  i also think it s hilarious when they tried to add interracial and gay couples into the commercials to promote  diversity  even though they could honestly not care less about who s buying their shit so long as they got cash and they re gullible enough to give it up  sorry  needed to vent ,e9hd7a

450,Just a small rant to see if I'm validated in my opinion or not,i work in a retail pharmacy  i have been there for 3 5 years  i like most of my coworkers and management is okay  we had a visit from a district manager the other day  she's new to our district this year  i already don't like her because of small petty things  like she made me to take down seasonal decorations our patients loved that i made because it was corporate standard  and she also has never directly spoken to me  my store manager told me to take them down after the dm sent an email  whatever  but when she visits she just talks to management about us  in the same room as us  as we are working around her  its fucking bizarre  what set me off at this last visit is that she was saying to one of my pharmacists that she would be back next week for some kind of compliance visit and it would be sooner rather than later because she  definitely doesn't want be here for the holidays in a room  full of employees who will be working those holidays  what kind of tone deaf fucking moron says that  anyway  my hatred for her is deeply cemented now  i brought this up to my manager and he was truly confused about why this was an issue for me    tl dr district manager says she doesn't want to work holidays in a room full of employees required to work holidays ,ea3gb4

461,Just got fired for no reason (long post),so this is mostly just a rant because i'm fucking mad as all hell  but it's also a reminder that your boss and your managers are never your friends    i worked for a big insurance company in canada at one of their call centers  i'm opening up a case with the better business bureau and the humans rights board so i'm not gonna name names rn  sorry    i got hired through a temp agency along with everyone else on my team so no benefits  but the job was 17 50 an hour- less than the 20 an hour you need to actually live in this city but way more than the 12-15 bucks an hour i'd been getting at other places for the same work  the environment seemed nice  i loved my coworkers and there was even free coffee  my manager even talked about how she'd started as a temp and how she hoped to have us all made permanent by the time our contract ended   shit seemed good   about 5 months go by and shit's mostly great  coworkers continue to be super cool people  my stats and customer reviews are excellent and i'm even someone who my coworkers ask for help with stuff   but i noticed that there were certain things i would get picked on for by my manager that no one else would  things like minor swearing in casual conversation  saying i was doing my job well but that i wasn't  going above and beyond  enough and even marking technical errors that were out of my control against me   i brought it up with my coworkers and they agreed with me that it was odd as they weren't receiving criticism despite doing the same things  i just got a very strong impression that my manager did not like me as a person and it had nothing to do with my quality of work  especially since my numbers were good and i know that- we get regularly weekly emails keeping us updated on that   it might be relevant to mention that i am a lesbian and was very much  out  at the office  i'm usually not but i became pretty good friends with my coworkers so i felt safe being open about it  i honestly don't know if i got mistreated because of that or just because she disliked me or if she disliked me because i'm gay or what  just mentioning it for possible context i guess    anyways i figure- like a dumbass- that my work is good enough that i'm probably fine regardless of her personal feelings towards me  we have weekly  coaching  with our managers as well and my feedback this week was generally positive   she took me aside and fired me the next day part way through my shift  brought up that i'd been seen on my phone during my break at my desk  in theory you're supposed to use your phone only out in the hall  no one follows this rule  she doesn't follow this damn rule and neither do any of my coworkers  and that was it   she even insinuated i should be grateful that she was firing me in person over halfway through my shift because  usually we just let your temp agency call and tell you  but i wanted to let you know   i just laughed in her face   who the fuck fires someone with no warning and no real justification during the fucking holidays and expects fucking gratitude for it   there's way more shit i could say and might say in the comments but yeah  i'm pissed and i feel like a dumbass for letting myself  think that maybe shit was actually stable and that the place gave half a fuck about treating their employees well  bosses are not your friends and neither are management   sorry for the rant and thanks to anyone who bothered to read through it,eap7x8

464,"""Cutting Hours""",idiots  i have posted here before and if anyone remembers me  the highlight of my posts are that my job holds shitty  13 hr pay over our heads all the time  well i hate working  but i had enough money to eat and save and give me a sliver of hope  i was actually getting mandatory ot of 50ish  hours for awhile  but now  as you all know  they will be cutting hours as the big retailer manufacturing seasons end after black friday thanksgiving christmas and basically i went from a typical 50 hour week to 12-20 hours  what the fuck is that  i am being paid poverty wages despite being  a premium employer in this area  and when i finally begin to get ahead on my finances they fuck me sideways  thought about taking a second job  again  but i can't get myself to deal with the balancing shit because as anyone who has had a second job already knows  it never works out the way they sell it to you  usually ends in working an 8-10 hours day at job 1  just to go to job 2 for a 12 hour day 30 minutes after and you are expected to provide peak performance  i am seriously thinking about moving back with one of my family members to 1up this situation  i'm tired of these shitty low wage corporations forcing me to work when it benefits them  and then bending me over and fucking me  they know i live on my own and i wear shoes with holes in them and torn clothing and am usually frugal and they know by giving me 12-20 hours they are fucking me sideways and they don't care  thankfully  i made stupid decisions when i was younger and purchased thousands of dollars of collectibles  in a certain category not to be named  and it was a dumb decision but i have been selling them online  i have enough collectibles for it to literally probably take a couple years to sell and i actually have became frustrated lately because i make more money selling things online than i do at my actual day job  the only problem is  i'm not a resale kingpin  and when my  inventory  runs out  then that's all i have to sell  i have proudly delivered subpar work at this workplace ever since being fucked around and forced to work ot and forced to stay after every night and forced to come in on days off  i've just had it with this crapola  i would love a 12-20 hour work week if i was being paid  50 an hour  maybe one day this will be the norm but on the other hand maybe things are getting worse  it definitely doesn't help when shitty  13 per hour is a  premium  and other fuckers would sprint to work my job  which gives the company a lot of leverage to fuck you around ,eaik8m

469,Bamboozled,i m pretty sure my friend and her coworkers were tricked  my friend works at a large hospital and were told to fill out a survey to gauge the level of morale  of course  since management treats them like second-class citizens  they said that morale is low which made the higher-ups look very bad  so  in response to all of this  management makes my friend and her coworkers participate in some morale-building exercises  this is also known as  mandatory fun  this includes bull shit slide show presentations  quasi-religious speeches  the hospital is owned by a group which follows an off-shoot of christianity  and fun sing alongs  because  what grown-ass adult doesn t love sing-alongs  anyways  to make a long story short-in order to avoid having to go through this corporate re-education again  my friend and her coworkers lied on the follow up morale survey  this  in turn  makes it look as though morale has improved thanks to the efforts of upper management even though this couldn t be further from the truth  upon hearing about all of this i couldn t help but wonder if this was carefully orchestrated by my friend s bosses from the get go and that they knew they d lie on the follow-up morale survey in order to avoid having to go through all of that bull shit again  just my theory  let me know what you think ,eafulv

474,My last job the boss asked us to give her our sick days.,so at my last job you could transfer sick leave to someone else  here is the kicker only management or high ranking members actually got sick leave  our director had some medical issues in her family and sent out several emails asking us to donate sick days to her  us the people who get 0  the working people who if we are sick accept no pay  should give our sick leave to someone who does 4x less work and gets paid 100x more  i would rather throw my fictional sick leave into the trash ,ea7bdw

523,Have you ever tried to vigorously convince yourself that you like your job? (And more work-related discussion), i'm in my last year of college and enjoying  the last days of a life without bullshit work but i was thinking about something today  a couple things actually    so i worked an internship over the summer for a company doing business shit  i would tell myself everyday that i liked what i was doing and wouldn't mind doing whatever i was doing for the rest of my life  it was like i was in denial limbo  now  i realize i am realizing i absolutely hated every minute of my time with that company  but thinking about the advertisements i watched on youtube make me nostalgic for a time where i was a year younger  that's an aside   secondly  we treat depression as something that's normal when sometimes it's a side effect of a mundane  working existence   that's just the way life is sweety  here  take your pills    i really don't know how people wake up and do the same thing they hate everyday  hell  i don't know how i'll do it in 5ish months without becoming suicidal  i'm seriously trying to understand how  in the past 60 years of pointless work that's made people mentally unwell  the powers that be decide that this is ok ,e8mlyr

526,This week I was denied a small business loan and I was 'written up' at work. Having a really tough time...,so last weekend i discovered an ad for an active and profitable ups store listed for  125 000 cad  now ofcourse i dont have that kind of money because i'm currently a wage slave barely getting by  so i applied for a small business loan  long story short  they denied me the loan for not having a net worth of at least  125 000 which is pennies to a bank  so the wage slave at the bank told me  go buy a house  build equity on it  then essentially remortgage it for the loan  or ask the family for some money  ask the family for some money  nobody will do that for me  ever  my grandparents just wouldnt do that and they'd tell me to  save my money  as fucking boomers do  and my mom and dad who are divorced  combined probably have a net worth of only fucking 5000 themselves - i grew up poor  and guess what  i still am  and i'm probably gonna be stuck there due to the modern poverty-trap   then later in the week i got written up for essentially being on the lower-end of sales in the office compared to the 1  that are killing it each month    anyways  if you read this i appreciate you hearing me out ,e7f31k

571,The anti-work implications of early(ish) Pink Floyd,bear with me here  i've been drinking  because  you know  soul-crushing capitalist hellscape etc etc    amp x200b   so as a bit of introduction  i've been listening to pink floyd since i was  give or take  one years old  now in the early days this  was  to quote my father   to make me go to sleep  obviously in those early  formative years i wasn't  listening  to floyd so much as hearing  the otherworldy  dulcet tones merely lulled me to sleep rather than making me think  despite that  however  the music of pink  not to be confused with the mindless notes penned by a similar namesake with an ' ' in place of an 'i'  has stuck with me for most--if not all  really--of my formative years  including the present  i have always been drawn to  in particular  the album  animals  in fact my favorite song  of all their vast discography  has been  dogs  from the self-same album  in my late teens this was largely due to the crashing juxtaposition of build-up and lull  the delicate interplay of timbre and power that makes up  in my opinion  the best of pink floyd  i appreciated then  in some small way  the poetry of the lyrics  but they never really struck me the same way then as they do now    amp x200b   put simply   dogs  is a massive indictment against the necessity of being a  company man  if you investigate the lyrics its not even hard to decipher    you have to be trusted by the people that you lie to   so that when they turn their backs on you   you'll get the chance to put the knife in  like  holy shit  even when i was 17 this lyric hit me hard  now that i actually work for corporate america  its even more true  more prescient  or try this on for size   deaf  dumb  and blind  you just keep on pretending   that everyone's expendable and no-one has a real friend   and it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner   and everything's done under the sun   and you believe at heart  everyone's a killer  ceaseless  unending distrust of those you work with  because they are your competition  true alienation under the mode of production  winners make the money--keep  hustling     amp x200b   more than just what happens in the sphere of work  this song delves even into what happens in your social life beyond the job  i direct you to this    yeah  and in the end you'll pack up  fly down south   hide your head in the sand   just another sad old man   all alone and dying of cancer  no matter how much of yourself you invest in your work  no matter how devoted you are to the company  you will die  and more than that  your unending preoccupation with being top of sales  or whatever the fuck metric your company of choice chooses to push on you  will inevitably end with an early death from stress  overwork  or a multitude of other maladies  the song ends with these lines  perhaps the most depressing and telling of all preceding instances   who was only a stranger at home   who was ground down in the end   who was found dead on the phone   who was dragged down by the stone  i probably don't even have to point this out for most of you   who was only a stranger at home  work-life balance  what  family  wife  kids  parents  et cetera et cetera ad infinitum  meaningless in the face of surplus value production  unimportant in the grand scheme of profit    amp x200b   jesus christ i haven't even skimmed the surface of the catalog of this band   money   breathe   time   have a cigar   welcome to the machine  i could go on and on about the significance of this band's lyricism  their message  and beyond that their sound  and yet most people who listen to them seem beyond the scope of this--in my opinion--supremely obvious interpretation  they remain just another  groovy  band for your boomer uncles or fathers to masturbate over because of the fact that they play their own instruments  no  pink floyd is much more than that to me  they are the beginnings  however obtuse  of an argument against the wage-slavery regime of modern life that so many of us are held under the dominion of ,e8n2b1

574,What Feminism Got Wrong,thesis  second wave feminism  with respect to its focus on women's  right to work  was a mistake  granted  it made sense at the time  as having the  right   to be a slave  to work was analogous to having the ability to support one's self outside of marriage  an admirable goal  however  in hindsight  the advocacy should have been directed at improving social services so that no one  male or female  young or old  able-bodied or not able-bodied  etc  would ever have to forego adequate food  clothing  housing  and medical care  the inability of women at the time to see past the immediate unfairness of being denied many professional jobs led  ironically  to advocacy for something  i e  the right to work equally alongside men  that only further oppressed them  and that perpetuated the very capitalist system that oppresses 90  of the population  men and women alike   indeed  the results of more women in the workplace  particularly in professional roles rather than roles they had filled historically such as teacher  nurse  secretary  etc  has contributed both to wage depression  as the amount of available workers exploded whereas the amount of roles needing to be filled did not  and to the tacit acceptance of the fact that it is  unreasonable  to expect to be able to raise a family on a single income  today  both spouses are expected to work their entire adult lives  save a measly few months for maternity leave for the mother  further  women who  leave the workforce  for several years in order to devote time to raising their child often face considerable difficulty  re-integrating  should they choose to return  commonly being forced to take lower-level roles than what they did before the arrival of the child   this post is not meant to be trite or a condemnation of feminist movements generally - rather  this is an idea that recently occurred to me and one whose irony  literally fighting for the right to work  i e  the right to be exploited  i thought would be appreciated by this sub    interested in what others have to say ,e8duus

658,Antiwork - what are the possible solutions?,recently - maybe because of the added attention to the subreddit - i've been seeing some grumblings about how this subreddit is just whiners who do not posit any solutions    i don't really see that as much of an issue  this is the one place you can come and just spitball about how terrible the system is and i feel you should be able to do that no problem even if you don't have an alternative to work    in terms of actual practical solutions i am curious about what ideas people have to limit reduce or even completely scrap work  some below that i have seen    universal basic income  ubi  this one has really gathered steam in the last few years with some feeling it will soon be essential  the idea is that most existing social welfare would be scrapped and every person would receive a subsistence stipend  no questions asked  that would allow them to enjoy a basic living e g   1000  i was big on this idea but have moved away from it in recent years because it just seems like it would get gobbled up by landlords  it doesn't seem like it can work without regulation     universal basic services  i recently came across this idea and feel it would work better than ubi  with this one industries covering basic human needs would be nationalised heavily regulated to be affordable or free at point of service  housing  energy  education  health  transport  food  so that every person will always have their basic needs met  so if someone needs a sabbatical  stress or mental health break they can without falling off the grid  this would be a fairly hard thing to do as it leans too close to communism in people's minds which is mostly demonised in society  every other industry would still be in the private sector but it seems like it would be too hard for society to swallow     three four day week  reduced hours  it's not really clear why this hasn't already been done  going to the five day week did not destroy the world so i'm not really sure why going to a three or four day week would  with this idea a reduced working week  at the same pay as the current full time week cost of living  would be the norm  this would give people more rest  leisure and chore time without diminishing their funds  i feel like this would even boost the economy making us more productive and have time to enjoy amenities  i mean  if the high street is dying maybe its because we literally don't have the time to go to the shops  high street shops were closed before i left for work and closed after i finished work ,e61qb2

712,i don't understand fat cats,do you know what i would give to be at the top of something i created  i would be so pleased with even 20  of all profits  seeing as once i make something i only need to sit on my arse to accumulate my profits  i don't understand these fat cats squeezing civilisation for all it's got  i feel truly awakened to the absurdity of our time  i would love to own a business to be 2  3  4  hell 10 times better off than i am now  but i don't get needing to be 10 000 times better off at the cost of everyone else's well being  if your company pays its employees  8 an hour yet makes  100-200 in that time  why do the fat cats feel entitled to everything but  8  it's not right  you know it's not right  i know it's not right  we all know it's not right,e4g37f

714,I got fired this friday,ok so basically  i got fired from my very first job that i ve been working in since april of 2019  i am currently in college 7am to 4pm depending how much work i have during the day and i start work at 4 10 to 6pm  cleaning the college two hours a day and get paid  260 a month  which for a very busy student is a great deal  the job was quite boring and at times quite frustrating  but since they moved me to a new section of the college i ve been going downhill from there    they fired me because  i lied about doing everything on my job  but guess what i lied about  mopping the floor  as an art and graphics a levels student i get pretty fucking tired considering they put everything on my time table in the fucking morning  which means i would lie about mopping  just mopping  however i did everything else perfectly  but apparently i lied too often  so they put me in restriction and did everything as they said  but got angry that i lied about the timings i m supposed to be in which room  but the icing on the cake that got me fired is that i had an  unauthorised person   aka my friend  on campus that was keeping me company waiting for me to finish  he was a student at my college so i assumed it was ok but it wasn t  and the only reason my boss found out about that is because a 69 bitch ass teacher snitched on me  that bitch  i even forgot that was a rule in the first place  and all he did was waiting outside the room i was cleaning    the funny thing is that during the cleaning section all the doors of the college are open  which means literally anyone could come in and cause trouble  no security no nothing  so here s safety hazard n 1    they also complained how i didn t hoover which in fact i did  but the carpet is so old and so shit that literally 11 year old gum is everywhere in the room  its disgusting    the thing that shocked me the most is how awful it feels to be fired  it feels as if a close member of my family died  it really discourages me from getting another job  i never felt so shit about something like this  i feel honestly betrayed not by my boss  but by the teacher i thought they were my friend    fuck this college man ,e4xnc9

716,The reason you are forced to toil,  the primary aim of modern warfare is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living  ever since the end of the nineteenth century  the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society  from the moment when the machine first made its appearance it was clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery  and therefore to a great extent for human inequality  had disappeared  if the machine were used deliberately for that end  hunger  overwork  dirt  illiteracy  and disease could be eliminated within a few generations  and in fact  without being used for any such purpose  but by a sort of automatic process   by producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible not to distribute   the machine did raise the living standards of the average humand being very greatly over a period of about fifty years at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries  but it was also clear that an all-round increase in wealth threatened the destruction   indeed  in some sense was the destruction   of a hierarchical society  in a world in which everyone worked short hours  had enough to eat  lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator  and possessed a motor-car or even an aeroplane  the most obvious and perhaps the most important form of inequality would already have disappeared  if it once became general  wealth would confer no distinction  it was possible  no doubt  to imagine a society in which wealth  in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries  should be evenly distributed  while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste  but in practice such a society could not long remain stable  for if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike  the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves  and when once they had done this  they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no function  and they would sweep it away  in the long run  a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance   to return to the agricultural past  as some thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century dreamed of doing  was not a practicable solution  it conflicted with the tendency towards mechanization which had become quasi-instinctive throughout almost the whole world  and moreover  any country which remained industrially backward was helpless in a military sense and was bound to be dominated  directly or indirectly  by its more advanced rivals  nor was it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses in poverty by restricting the output of goods  this happened to a great extent during the final phase of capitalism  roughly between 1920 and 1940  the economy of many countries was allowed to stagnate  land went out of cultivation  capital equipment was not added to  great blocks of the population were prevented from working and kept half alive by state charity  but this  too  entailed military weakness  and since the privations it inflicted were obviously unnecessary  it made opposition inevitable  the problem was how to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the real wealth of the world  goods must be produced  but they must not be distributed  and in practice the only way of achieving this was by continuous warfare  the essential act of war is destruction  not necessarily of human lives  but of the products of human labour  war is a way of shattering to pieces  or pouring into the stratosphere  or sinking in the depths of the sea  materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable  and hence  in the long run  too intelligent  even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed  their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed  a floating fortress  for example  has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargo-ships  ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete  never having brought any material benefit to anybody  and with further enormous labours another floating fortress is built   in principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population  in practice the needs of the population are always underestimated  with the result that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life  but this is looked on as an advantage  it is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near the brink of hardship  because a general state of scarcity increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one group and another  by the standards of the early twentieth century  even a member of the inner party lives an austere  laborious kind of life  nevertheless  the few luxuries that he does enjoy his large  well-appointed flat  the better texture of his clothes  the better quality of his food and drink and tobacco  his two or three servants  his private motor-car or helicopter set him in a different world from a member of the outer party  and the members of the outer party have a similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses whom we call  the proles  the social atmosphere is that of a besieged city  where the possession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and poverty  and at the same time the consciousness of being at war  and therefore in danger  makes the handing-over of all power to a small caste seem the natural  unavoidable condition of survival ,e5aps5
717,Being laid off has been a really nice vacation that I don't want to end,i needed some place to vent  i worked in a technical field and i didn't hate my job entirely but i certainly resented the 40 hours a week being wasted on something i didn't care about      i'm an artist outside of work and i'm at a level where i can get a few paid gigs here and there doing what i love  not enough to really sustain myself right now so the pay and benefits and stability of the full time gig were too good to have until my side gigs takes off more and hopefully i could turn that into something full time   i'm nearing 30 and still living with my parents so i thought with this stability of my job  i can finally move out into an apartment and start being more independent  i had finally selected an apartment i liked when i unexpectedly got the news that i was being laid off     it was a shitty thing to deal with at first  but over time it became a really nice vacation  i had enough saved up and was still living at home so expenses weren't too bad  i started seeing a therapist cause i actually had time for it  i produced more art  i got to do things on my schedule and it's actually been super nice having the freedom   during this time i still interviewed for more jobs  i was really hoping this layoff would be something that redirected me closer to working with my passion  i found some job opportunities i got super excited about  i put my best foot forward and put effort into showing how perfect i was for the job and they all rejected me  it felt like shit to find a random super rare opportunity 10 minutes away from me doing exactly what i love and i'm good at and not even getting an offer  those opportunities almost never happen and it almost felt divine the timing it of it all  and yet nothing came of any of it   eventually i finally got an offer and you guessed it  it's basically doing the same technical work i was doing at my last job  i'm starting it next week  which means i also don't get to enjoy the holiday time  and while it'll be nice to have a paycheck and benefits again i really have no interest in going back      i really don't know what to do  i feel trapped and unable to escape  i worry about never realizing my passions fully  i worry about how if i move out and become more independent how i'll even have time for the things i want to do with my independence  finding time for my art or having a family or having a pet because i'm too busy working 40 hours a week to realize all of those things  i don't know how people are doing it or how they are affording it either      at least if i don't move out i can still keep saving a good chunk of my money and have time for art  but then i worry about how i'm getting older and still in this same sort of adolescent place in my life while everyone i know is slowly getting married or having kids and somehow transitioning into  being an adult  whatever that means  i worry about the life experiences i'm missing out on if i don't push myself in that direction     so idk  sorry this was so long and thanks to anyone who reads it or gives me advice  i just feel stuck both professionally and personally and wish there was an easy solution ,e4kfd4
718,I dont know what to do,so i recently graduated college this year with pretty damn good cgpa  thinking i would get hired my first day out of college  how wrong i was   i applied to several jobs without any luck and stayed unemployed for nearly 6 months  up until recently   i got a job as a trainee officer in a pretty big firm  i had a primary interest in marketing and really wanted a simple desk job of sorts    the first couple of weeks went well  typical 8 30 to 5 30 timings  orientations and all that   however  after that  they put me into the field  with a fucking 12 hour shift  from 11am to 11pm at an outlet of the company   ill be honest  when i first started the job i wasnt that happy either  the only real thing i looked forward to everyday was when i would go to the gym around 7 30-ish  now i cant even do that  and i feel completely miserable    this 12 hour shift thing is only temporary apparently  most likely around 2 months  but i cant even stand the thought of it still  wake up  go to work for 12 hours  go home and sleep  repeat  i also forgot to mention the commute is nearly 40 minutes one-way   am i overreacting with this being my first real job or is it something else ,e50jff
719,"People face a lot of shit at work, it doesn't even make them productive for the CEOs. It's a lose-lose situation.",when i worked in a call center  i remember getting many calls from customers who wanted me to do stuff that were against the company's policy  they insisted they had the right to get these services and threatened me they would press charges if i wouldn't  check with the manager and give them what they wanted  when i told them  the manager says no  they still argued with me they deserved these services and when they realised wouldn't get what they wanted  they decided not to use our services    these calls wasted a lot of time and energy and eventually  did not contribute to society anything  they didn't even make the rich richer because the customers decided not to use our services    then what is it all good for ,e5iytu
720,The job hunt sucks ass even when you're overqualified...,i wasn't having any luck with job openings that i was qualified for  so i decided to look for roles where i was overqualified for the position  it's more important to me to have job where i just work normal hours  have reasonable expectations  more than just the standard 2 weeks vacation  and maybe if i'm lucky  something in the private sector instead of selling myself to the corporate world   this is now the third consecutive time i did the interviews only to be rejected and told  in one way or another  they either don't believe me when i say i'll stick around and won't get bored  or they think i have ulterior motives for wanting a job i'm overqualified for  it fucking sucks  welcome to capitalism  where you can't have a job you're underqualified for  but could easily learn  and you can't have a job you're overqualified for  it's wonderful isn't it folks ,e5b5ca

724,Getting Fired,tl dr at the bottom   a little backstory    i'm currently working as a caregiver for adults with mental illness  tbi  and early onset dementia  i've been at this facility basically since i graduated high school  took a year off after graduation to fuck around then straight to work  i've been here for about 5 years  this is the only 'legit' job i've had  i worked for my ex husband's in laws for a few months before our marriage fell apart  they own an auto shop  worked some under the table stuff  making ice cream cones for a family friend's gas station  babysitting  house cleaning for ex in laws  etc    yesterday i was working a 12 hour shift  a coworker had a death in the family just before thanksgiving and i opted to take on some of her hours  our administration says we are responsible for covering our own shifts  i like my coworker and wanted to help her out  in the middle of this shift my supervisor asks me to come into her office  i always get a bit nervous as sometimes she calls me in to reprimand me for some bs but other times it's to give me sweets or have me watch some yt video  when she asked me to shut the door i knew it wasn't going to be a fun conversation  i had assumed i had another complaint from a specific resident  resident constantly complains about everyone but i'm his favorite  the resident is often bored and uses it as a way to entertain himself  we're all very used to him doing this  turns out  it was a complaint  from other people  peer support  cbrs  social workers  etc  these people come in once  sometimes twice a week to spend an hour to an hour and a half with their client  the complaint read that 'i don't smile or interact with the residents'  what  i smile  fake as all hell but i force it  i've got extreme rbf  and i'm not going to be smiling every second of my shift  i do interact with the residents  there are often times when i dont speak at all though because the residents prefer to sit in their rooms vs in the common areas of the house where most of my time is spent  i cannot force them out or to converse with me  it's useless trying to play board or card games with them  i've tried endlessly  these people come in for a few hours and assume that i just totally neglect the residents social needs  and because of that i've been told that 'i need to make improvements within the next few weeks'    i've been looking for another job since the beginning of october  i'm just having a hell of a time finding anything decent without taking a pay cut  i own a house so keeping up with my bills is difficult enough  making less is only going to make it harder  it's to the point where i'm saying fuck it and willing to work any other pay grade just to get away from this place  it's toxic as hell and has been draining me for years  i suffer from my own mental issues and they're only getting worse  i've started contemplating suicide more seriously  havent made a plan though  so i've decided that sunday  my monday  i won't be coming into work  i'll call in on friday  probably get written up  and i just simply don't care  they'll fire me and i'm going to be terrified but incredibly grateful  as much as i don't want to work for anyone else ever again  the free time will make it easier for me to find something new  something less stressful and harmful to my mental health    sorry if this seems all over the place but i seriously needed to get that out  i spent all of last night crying  i'm an angry crier  and drinking myself to sleep  thank you if you took the time to read it all   tl dr my jobs firing me for 'not smiling or being interactive',e62584
725,Anti LinkedIn Social Media,hey antiwork  so recently i've been putting a lot of thought into opening a small social media platform  that resonates the message of this sub  but on a much larger scale   in summary  a work focused social platform without the pretentious bullshit of linkedin  a platform that fosters real meaningful discussion debate on the pros and cons of work culture today  a platform where people can choose their identities similar to reddit  and post their true unfiltered opinions about their jobs  industry worklifebalance company compensation culture etc  a platform away from greedy recruiters and corporate kiss ups  a platform that also includes your regular memes   shit posts  and the regular nuances of a social network    is this something you guys would potentially be interested in  i've put a lot of thought into this but need help identifying whether the demand is there  i know plenty of people that are tired of the pretentious bullshit found of linkedin  but i guess i'm just a bit nervous on taking the next few steps  i've got quite a few really good names for it too aha   and mods  if this is not the right place method for me posting this  please feel free to remove and i'll have it reposted on the correct channel ,e52td7
726,So glad I found this sub...,and people who share my sentiments  i graduated with a masters in cs degree last year and got a job this past spring for  a lot less money than i'd hoped for  whatever  staying at parents place and all  right     god i never realized how much i could hate something until i started working  the people at my job are surprisingly nice  but i can feel my body slowly degrading away because of my job  for whatever reason i could sit behind a laptop in the most fuck-all posture for all of college for 10 hours a day playing video games  but as soon as i do it for 8 hours at my job i develop the worst back shoulder pain known to man  or at least  a 24 y o me who should be in fairly good shape     i've lost about 10 pounds since starting this job  despite my best efforts to try and keep up with the gym  a lot of this summer was spent in a weed haze back when i could get legal carts from dispensaries a few states over because i just didn't want to deal with the reality of dragging myself up every day just to hurt more     the kicker is that when i got the job  i was promised a performance review at 6 months for a potential raise because of my advanced degree  my boss wanted me to tell hr everything i'd worked on so far  which was basically just the projects he'd given me  never got any notice of anything past that     also this job has basically killed my motivation for doing any kind of coding outside of work  11 hours of my day  roughly  with commute  is taken up  leaving me with about 5 hours a day  4  if you count the process of getting up  showering  and looking  presentable  in the morning  to do whatever  my soul is slowly draining away and i have another  40 years of this to look forward to     anyways  that's my intro rant  gonna have to drag myself out of bed soon so i can contemplate driving my car into a tree on the interstate  keep it real ,e4yd2u

738,I love when people judge me for not working full time,whether it s from my family  my peers  or my girlfriend  i m constantly receiving judgment for only working my 30-35 hours a week at  12 an hour  i ve been searching for better work for years  but being in ct without any sort of degree or useful skills is a death sentence    i used to let it get to me  i used to beat myself up for settling on such a shitty job  i climbed the corporate ladder as high as i could to be the front end supervisor  but if i wanted to continue moving up i d have to transfer to a new location  this would mean a long commute  along with approximately 50  more responsibility and hardly any raise  i don t really mind my job though  it sucks  but it sucks marginally less than every other grocery store in my area    i m constantly being pushed to do better  to work harder  for what  all my basic needs are covered  i pay plenty of bills  i ve got a roof above me  but still i m told daily that i  need  more  i don t need shit  i ve learned to be more than happy with what i have  to want anything more than what i have currently would just be greed    i put in my  35 hours and spend my remaining free time painting and being with my friends  the only things that keep me sane anymore  but that s not a valid way to spend my free time in the eyes of the public    so my advice to anyone reading this  just stop caring  stop trying to change how people view you because it s a lost cause  it s an uphill battle trying to convince people that you re not actually a loser and all we can do is hope that they too see the light someday ,e64ee1

740,At what point do I say enough is enough?,i m not sure how to phrase this  but i m just graduated from college  and i work in finance  in the few short months of working ive realized i can complete my work within 2-3 hours where the rest of my time is spent getting frustrated with the lack of reasons as to why i should be there  i really do not want to come off as entitled but sitting in a cubicle for 9 hours makes me want to shatter both of my kneecaps with a hammer  it s a depressing life and i can t cope with the fact this is seen as normal in society  minimal human interaction  minimal fresh air  artificial lighting  absolutely mind numbing  theres got to be something more to life   i want to quit so bad  this existential dread will be the death of me  since companies would rather have asses in seats as opposed to efficiency is complete and utter bull ,e60we6

744,"For anyone taking anti depressants, does it make work feel more bearable?",i never thought id see the day come but after constant thoughts about suicide  i feel that i have no choice but to medicate myself just to function like a normal corporate robot  is anyone else in this situation and does the medication help alleviate your morbid outlook on life  is it worth the potential side effects ,e5s0b1
745,Tales of office life: brown nosing &amp; forced fun,i hate my job  waking up at 6am every morning fills me with dread and anxiety and i survive everyday by popping various pills that help ease the pain of a monotonous day at work however  this job has an end  i took this job so as i can live closer to my parents to move back in with temporarily and save enough money so that in about 6 months i can move abroad to where there are jobs related to my degree  i still have slight hope that i won't be forever on the breadline and i'll be able to have a nice lifestyle at some point  i know i'll always be a slave but maybe it won't be so bad if i can still have sometime to enjoy some of my life    this job i work now pays really poor  i mean like just above minimum wage  this part of the country really lacks skilled jobs so finding something that pays well takes time that i don't have  now it's coming upto christmas everyone is trying to push for all these different activities and this is now putting me over the edge  colleagues of mine are trying to get everyone to put money in from my team to pay for a present for the boss because he's been so  nice  even though he gets paid more than us and is practically forced to be nice due to union rules  it's just a way for them to brown nose but i'm forced to take park  i hate how people treat their job as a lifestyle  like for example secret santa  it's just a waste of money to buy pointless things for people you don't know yet you're seen as anti teamwork etc if you don't partake and waste hard earned money on it   i'm just exhausted and want an easy life  yet people put silly pressures on you to conform in their way ,e5yaef
746,How are you managing to still go to work?,my work is nice  my colleagues are nice  the work is nice  it's so nice  i'm not getting fired even though i stay home a lot of the time  but right now it's the middle of the day and i'm sitting on a bench outside too demotivated to actually walk into work  i feel like all is wrong with me  i just want to live a slow life  get up slow  take care of some plants  chill  maybe now and then do a little bit of work to stay afloat  but with this society  i feel like that's not possible  i don't know what the point is of this post  thanks for reading ,e5z9xk
747,A suggestion for post-automation world.,plus giving a ubi and other regulations the government mandates that in order for a company to be allowed to operate within the country the company must pay the same or possibly more  number of people it would have otherwise employed with a minimum salary dependes on some variables  and mandatory benefits imposed by the government  but i think the government should give something to the corporations to persuade them to stay ,e68s78

749,Linkedin Lunatics are at it again,     that time do you wake in the morning   everyone always asks me  how do you get up at am everyday    always reply  because   know what i want   building discipline is like building muscle  for example  every time i work on my side plank  despite the burn    strengthen my oblique  similarly  every time   force myself out of bed    strengthen my discipline--not just for the next morning  but for life  these days  for instance  i'm better able to focus on a single task  i'm keeping habits i never could before  most importantly  i'm building confidence in my own willpower  once   get out of bed    know i can tackle everything else that comes my way   takeaway  try waking up at 4 or am for a week and see if you like it  most people who try it  never return to their prior sleeping habits  dinners are made in the morning when your competition is sleeping  parting  crying or losing  ,e5yvt1
750,I finally have everything I’ve ever wanted but my soul is desperately unhappy,i was always a believer in being your own boss  after a brief stint in 9-5  i realized it wasn t for me and became a server blogger to supplement my dream of writing   3 years later i became a full time blogger and i was really happy except for one thing  the money was extremely inconsistent  some months i was flush  but most of the time i was struggling    this financial struggle really hindered my marriage  my husband was the sole provider most of the time to help me with my dream  he supported me to no end and i love him for that  but the power dynamics  the resentment  the lack of my contribution to the team almost made us divorce several times  there s a bit more to it but we basically were not contributing financially on the same level and i felt very dependent on him   finally  when a 9-5 opened up in a field i m really good in  i applied and got the job immediately  i was very qualified  and to be honest  it s not that bad  i realize how good i have it and i should be grateful  i also love the stability  i kept my blogging job while doing this and for once in my life  i actually have money  i m not always afraid and my husband and i aren t strained anymore  he s proud of my hard work and sees me as an equal now thanks to my contribution  we re happy together and i can finally buy something for myself once in awhile and not feel like i m putting us behind    but the problem with this job  and every other corporate type of job  is that i just don t believe in it  the quality of life  the idea we all have to act and look a certain way  the fake business banter  the corporate american dream and selling things people don t need  i work in the  luxury  field which means everyone has nice cars just bc they want to  they dress in seersucker suits bc they feel like it  and that vain and shallow materialism makes me sick to my stomach  i feel like i m compromising my morals and integrity    i should be happy  i m getting a new type of peace i ve been yearning for  but my soul is unhappy ,e582cy
751,At least they were honest?,someone where i work is leaving  i told my manager i was interested in the job  i'm basically a shoe-in if i want it    a little while later she emailed me  she wanted to clarify that they're modifying the position  they're changing it from a boring  fill out paperwork and don't talk to anyone  job  what i'm looking for  to a job where you answer phones for half the day and do the paperwork the other half    thanks  i'll pass ,e66y80
752,Overtime should not be mandatory,i recently found this sub  so i thought i would come on here and vent about my job overtime   i've been at my job for 12 years now  one of the things we have to deal with there is mandatory overtime  i used to have to work 6 days a week  about 50 hours per week  but then i took my current position 5 years ago which allows me to only work 5 days a week  but i still have to put in mandatory overtime during those 5 days   i just wanted to say  i think that's b s  a 40 hour work week is bad enough and still barely allows us enough personal time  since much of that time is spent doing errands  sleeping  getting ready for and then commuting to work  i personally think that overtime should be strictly voluntary and that you should not be mandated to work more than 8 hours a day   i also personally think that overtime should be calculated by daily hours  not weekly hours  so if you work more than 8 hours in a day  anything over that should be time and a half  it doesn't seem fair that you could bust your butt working from the time you get up until the time you go to sleep  and then possibly come down with an illness and need to call out sick  so you don't even get extra compensation for those long hours you put in that day   plus  at my job  we don't even start getting time and a half until 42 5 hours  instead of the usual 40  i thought for sure this was illegal  so i previously did some research about overtime laws in my state  and it turns out that it's not  since we get paid 30 minute breaks each day  that's not counted toward hours worked  some companies don't pay you for your breaks  so i should probably be thankful  however  sometimes we're so busy that we won't even take our full break  if we take one at all  that's what grinds my gears about it  of course some people would say   well take your break then  this is exactly why i usually do take my break  however  some days i just know i am going to be there forever and would rather take the loss than have to stay there any longer than necessary  i try to get my work done and get out of there as soon as possible  that's another thing about my job  we have a set time of when we need to be there  but we don't get to just simply clock out at a certain time  we each have an account list and the accounts must be done each day  we have to stay until we've completed everything  or else we will be reprimanded at risk of termination ,e5ukhf

755,"Got home from work 4 hours ago, and it's already time for bed",even if i fall asleep immediately  i will only get 7 5 hours of sleep  by the time i actually fall asleep  it will be 6 5 or 7    i had enough time to cook  eat  wash dishes  take a shower  and play ps4 for two hours   but i'm out of the house during the day for 9 5 hours  this is fucking unfair bullshit and i'm sick and tired of nobody outside of this subreddit feeling the way i do  gen z will have to revolt against this nonsense  millenials like me are too indoctrinated for the most part because we started working before technology took over ,e5t4qf

757,What is the point of developing skills and even trying?,whatever you decide to be good at will be corrupted by profit  literary any job that involves some sort of a passion will be disgusting for anybody that has this passion  there are simply no jobs where you truly will want to work  and what is the point of just slaving so that you can slave more the next day  they should just make a universal lottery  you win - you can live another day  you lost - someone else will live instead of you  that is far more enjoyable than constant lying  scamming  scheming  pretending  all this bullshit just to put food on the table ,e4by6z
