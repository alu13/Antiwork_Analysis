1,Escape routes for the terminally impoverished?,so i've been trying  for the last few years  to save up a modest bit of savings that would allow me to travel for one year  to try and find some other way of existing in the world than wage slavery   i've been working my ass off  on a good wage and trying my hardest to save  my goal was 10 years of saving and then escape for a simpler life  however  in order to find a job i had to move to one of the most expensive cities in the world and have barely been able to save  1k this year  i cannot do this for another 10 years  and even if i could  one large expense could wipe out any savings i've made  a couple of years ago i'd hit  7k  then i lost my job and the whole lot was gone in the 6 months it took me to find a new one    they just 'extended my probation' at work and i'm so done  they want me to fight for my job  but i don't even want it  so i've tried to do this the responsible way  i've tried to be an adult  to work hard and save  but that's clearly not going to be an option for me    so what are my other options  the nomad van life is out of the question as i don't have the funds for driving lessons or a vehicle  go live on a commune or intentional community  i've looked into it - a lot of them want you to buy your way in with a land or property purchase  an ashram  a kibbutz    send me your suggestions  no matter how wild     but please remember that lots of ways to 'live free' actually have quite a high start up cost  i'm likely to be homeless and jobless in jan with approx  2 5k available ,e1htxf

4,People who say they would continue working if they won the lottery,i find it breathtaking when people say they  wouldn't know what to do with themselves  if they quit work once winning the lottery  i have to assume it is some kind of delusional coping mechanism  maybe they think they sound honourable  and less  lazy  it's also extremely selfish to hold onto paid employment that you don't need that someone else desperately does  even if you wanted routine or some other crap are you so reliant on your job to give you that  why can't you create that for yourself with volunteering or a self study schedule   there are so many things i could think to do with my time that i honestly cannot believe people who say that  i would practice piano playing  learn french and spanish  play all the video games i'd missed  read a ton of books  travel all over the world  start a home business  learn how to sew  take up a degree in philosophy  volunteer teaching kids to code  mentor children from backgrounds like myself  spend more time with my grandmother who is really old  go back to writing stories and poems like i did as a teenager  the list goes on and on and on ,e1pdgq

10,My boss gaslit me tonight :),since it was the day before thanksgiving we were packed  and even with three cashiers we had a rush that was over an hour  when it finally stopped i took a minute to see how empty the front end was  and then went about emptying the garbage  as i had been told it's part of my job  and have been doing it since i started last week    while doing the garbage  my co worker was looking at the list of things to do she'd been given  and mentioned that it was weird they gave us to do lists  she saw that they wanted her to sweep  and she said 'okay cool  don't know how i'm supposed to do that when i have to use a cane' and i responded  jokingly with 'what  you don't know how to grow a third arm  how dare you  she replied half jokingly that she's not going to be able to work under those kinds of conditions    the next thing i know my store manager is pulling me and another cashier into the office and is literally screaming at us that we haven't been doing our jobs and he's tired of it  he singled me out repeatedly and even let the other employee go to yell at me more  saying since i've started working i haven't been doing my job    aside from tonight and my interview i've literally only fucking seen this guy  in passing  like three other times  he kept insisting that he's been constantly telling me to do things  and that i haven't done them  he got mad because i did the garbage  asking why i did it  when 'no one told you to do that  but you have time to stand around up here complaining about what you're being paid '  no one said anything about what we were being paid  which  even if we fucking did mention salary  the fucking company code of conducts specifies we're allowed to discuss not only that  but also working conditions    he also ended up sending everyone else home at their scheduled time to leave  and forced me to stay an extra half hour doing restocking because 'it hasn't been done  so no one gets to leave until it is'    i kept trying to mention that he literally has not told me except for one time to do restocking  and the reason i ended up back at my register and not getting it done is because i was called back by the other manager  and he kept while not outright calling me a liar  implying that i was lying    i ended up upset the rest of my shift and i'm fucking pissed but i don't know what to do  no one told me doing fucking restock is apparently more important than fucking cashiering  which is what i got hired to do  this fucking guy literally told me to ignore lines of customers to do restock  and berated me that i should 'know that' because i've worked retail before  if i fucking walked away from 'three or four' people in a line to do something else at my old jobs i would have been written up for it    i just don't know what to do  i've dealt with asshole bosses before but this mother fucker was literally gaslighting me and i didn't know how to react  what the fuck ,e2u06i

21,Why I refuse to work full time.,i generally work about 28 hours a week at most and refuse to do more  there's a variety of reasons for this  but the main one is just the fact that i value my time and health  i hate giving my time away in exchange for being able to survive and be miserable  i never asked for any of this   i hate every second of my work  and it's so annoying when people tell me to find a job i like  which is stupid advice for reasons i'm sure you understand  but i'm also terrible at focusing due to adhd  which everybody i tell assures me isn't real  despite the destructive impact it's had on my life  also  due to not living in a civilized country  i can't afford health insurance  so i have to rely on medicaid  the income limit for receiving medicaid is absurdly little  look it up  it's ridiculous  you can be obscenely poor and not qualify  and on top of all that  i get taxed a fucking lot but feel like i don't get that much for it ,e37kt9

29,Rant about working in hostile London,i've been working in a high-pressure environment in london for the past 2 5 yr since graduation  some things i really hate about the uk system are     -unpaid overtime  seriously  i have lost count of the amount of times i worked hours extra to cope with deadlines    -having to finish someone else's work despite having finished mine  he will then go home early and i am forced to stay and finish someone else's work because sr manager says so   -london is full of materialistic people    -drug use drives me crazy  these employees now have more energy to cope with high demands making you look  lazy    -extremely poor worker's rights  you can in fact  lose your job if you become pregnant  no rights until you've worked with them 2 years  also if something bad happens like unfair dismissal  even if you were to win the case the next employers won't touch you and you may be unemployed forever    -directors higher people have a habit of screaming at employees  not always  but in 50  of places they do    -backstabbing colleagues  esp as a woman working with other women    -lack of appreciation towards your work as the city has such a large talent pool they can get someone new anytime   -obsession with process improvements  like  there is only so much you can  improve  without risking making your own role obsolete    -obsession with after work drinks and failure to attend will make you look antisocial  for me  ever if i like my team  i have no interest in alcohol  i want to go home and recover or walk in a park    -extremely few annual holiday and sick days  this isn't norway    -extremely poor low salaries compared to cost of living  and this is even for highly-skilled people  unless you're a director getting  100k  you may struggle  most beginners get between  20k-24  pathetic    -no tolerance for employees being late  even though we have some of the worst trains i've ever seen  frequently late cancelled  overprices and dirty   -no willingness to let people work from home,e3u08s

41,New job advice - an employers dick move that I'm not happy about,not sure if this fits in with the sub but it seems like the best place i could find  i started a new job this week that i actually love  good pay  good team  perfect location from where i live  the boss is a character and seem to care about his employees  i couldn't see any problems  that was until yesterday  my second day  the boss drops on me that we're moving office  not in a few weeks or months but this week  tomorrow in fact  which will only be my fourth day  now the problem with this move is i wasn't told about it when they offered me the job or even in the interview process  there was mention of an eventual move but i can guarantee they haven't organised this within a week  the 2 concerns i now have are   1  the new office is further north from the current location which means it's also further north from where i live  i've estimated it's going to add hour to my daily commute  i use public transport  to get to and from the office  essentially an hour that i won't have for rest or relaxation  doesn't seem fair to me  2  the other thing i'm worried about is if they've kept this from me then what else have i not been told  is there another piece from crucial news going to come out next week or next month or next year  how can i trust these people when my employment has started on a lie   personally i think these are both very valid complaints  i will say that the location was one of the things that attracted me to the job and if i knew about this move  amp  where they're going then i wouldn't have even applied for the job in the first place let alone accepted the offer  i've told a few people close to me about this and also mentioned that i'm going to bring this up tomorrow with the boss  almost everyone has agreed it was a dick move but also said to be careful as i could lose the job with nothing to fall back on  so be it if i lose the job  as i've had a lot of other companies call me sine i started about other jobs i've recently applied for  and i feel if i don't speak up now while it's still early then i'd be pulling a dick move to them when i say after a month that i'm not happy about this  i'd love some impartial advice because i'm really not happy about being lied to or taken advantage of  has anyone else experienced something similar  and if so  how did you handle it  are there other things i should consider before speaking up  thanks to anyone in advance who sees this and offers advice   tl dr  started a new job this week and the boss told me after i started that we're moving to an office which is further away from my place this week  i feel he should've told me this before offering the job and i want to talk to him about this tomorrow but want some advice first ,e2ddxx

44,There is no way to win in employment as long as competition is accepted as the norm.,i've been reading  22 immutable laws of marketing  and  zero to one  and decided to apply what i learned to work culture  here is why it is impossible to win being an employee     the law of competition   when entering a competitive market  such as an industry or a certain field  one must automatically adjust to the rules  this means taking on the same rate and expectations  however  to achieve excellence in that field one must offer exceptional value which means higher returns at a lower cost  when labor is evaluated on hourly basis  the person who does it then becomes a commodity  thus the competition doesn t become over what the person can do but rather over the person themselves  squeezed for resources until they cannot give anymore  they are discarded for not being able to handle a high stress environment  this revolving wheel of exploitation leads to lower rates  higher expectations  and higher profits to those who hire hourly labor to create a product that brings them value  when workers are forced to compete between themselves  only the owners benefit     the law of leadership    the opposite of competition  is leadership  being a leader in a certain market segment allows one to charge a premium rate until competition catches up  in employment  carving out a new niche is the best way to increase earnings  the challenges here are originally and charisma  one not only must invent a new market segment but drive a demand to it  in essence  a new specialist is an entrepreneur    the reason why it s so difficult to win in employment is not due to the lack of education or skills  not enough jobs  or terrible bosses  but due to harsh competition between employees themselves  breaking away from the norm rather than striving for excellence is the only way out of the downward spiral ,e2pwmd

60,America was founded by people who hated work.,i learned from an article entitled  our forefather s failure http www libertyunbound com sites files printarchive liberty magazine march 2010 pdf   at  libertyunbound com http www libertyunbound com  that the colonies at plymouth rock and jamestown tried both free-market and communist systems long before karl marx was born   the liberty unbound article appears to have been based on a 1985 mises institute article by richard j  maybury entitled  the great thanksgiving hoax https mises org library great-thanksgiving-hoax-0  and on a 2000 article by dr  judd w  patton entitled  the pilgrim story  vital lessons and insights for today http jpatton bellevue edu biblical economics pilgrimstory html   the pilgrims landed at plymouth rock in december 1620  and in spite of help from the native americans  half of them died the first year as a result of their initial system  during the second year  more of them died  they would quickly learn that their initial system was tragically incompatible with human nature  it was simply unnatural   the colonists had the ideal conditions for their initial system because they all had a reputation as virtuous hard working people  they were all of the same race  religion  politics  and nationality  and of course  they all had agreed to this system voluntarily  although somewhat reluctantly  they also knew that failure meant death   nevertheless  under their initial system  they simply weren t producing and storing enough food  which lead to starvation  disease  and discontent  their first solution  in their second year  was to institute beatings for those who did not work hard enough  but this had little effect on productivity  and it further increased discontent   the colonists astutely observed that their system tended to retard productivity while breeding confusion and discontent  we know this because they wrote about it in their journals  clearly  their initial system was incompatible with human nature   by the spring of 1623 the pilgrims feared they would not survive another winter  so in desperation  they adopted a radically different system  and it saved their lives  productivity increased  and in 1623  they didn't have just another harvest feast  that would have to be when they had the first real thanksgiving   which system failed the colonists initially  and which radically different system saved them  which system was so incompatible with human nature  and which system was so compatible with human nature  which system was so ugly  and which system was so beautiful   in order to escape persecution and establish the plymouth colony in america  the puritan separatists  who would later be known as  pilgrims  made a somewhat reluctant agreement with their investors  the virginia company of london and the virginia company of plymouth  a k a  the adventurers  in this contract  not the mayflower compact  they agreed to share everything produced by any one of them from each according to his ability to each according to his need  and then after 7 years  they would divide the common accumulated wealth and property with the adventurers  according to dr  judd patton's article based on the 1647 book by governor bradford    gt the contract between the adventurers and the pilgrims consisted of ten points  the most critical of which stated   that all such persons as are of this colony are to have their meat  drink  apparel  and all provisions out of the common stock and goods of the said colony  further  it was agreed that during the first seven years   all profits and benefits that are got by trade  traffic  trucking  working  fishing  or any other means of any persons  remain still in the common stock until the division   the result was that only a small percentage of them worked hard  and the rest were freeloaders to varying degrees because they would rather risk death than be exploited by others  they were so reluctant to work that they even left food rotting on the vine  the result was indeed death  half of them died  this reminds me of the saying by the people of the ussr   they pretend to pay us  and we pretend to work   then  in the spring of 1623  the surviving colonists decided to let each person keep the fruits of his labor  and the colony s total output increased so much that they were never hungry again   the governor wrote in his journal that under their initial  communist  system  some of them claimed to be too weak or sick to work  and they were so convincing that it would have been the height of tyranny to force them work  then  after they learned they could keep the fruits of their labor  those who were too sick to walk suddenly recovered and began working the fields   communism was killing the colonists at plymouth rock  and by switching to a free-market system  they became more productive and saved themselves in a single growing season   the transition from communism to free markets still lacked full property rights however  whereas each individual owned the fruits of his labor  he did not own the land he worked  and thus he did not own any improvements he made to that land   in 1623  the colonists were still growing food on parcels of land that were reassigned by random lots each year  which they astutely observed was a disincentive for each farmer to make permanent improvements to his parcel of land because in the following year  someone else would inherit the fruits of any labor he devoted to improvements  therefore  in 1624  they adopted full property rights where everyone owned the land he worked  and the result was another productivity boost  whereas  the first step toward property rights and the free market had increased productivity enough to feed everyone  the move to full property rights produced enough extra food to export and trade for furs and other goods   the article goes on to explain the similar experience in jamestown    gt jamestown  the first permanent english colony in america  established in virginia in 1607  had an experience similar to the pilgrims at plymouth  early years of starvation were followed by converting to a system of property rights and a free market  which brought abundance  under collectivism  less than half of every shipload of settlers survived the first 12 months at jamestown  most of the work was done by only one-fifth of the men  to whom the socialist system gave the same rations as to the others  during the winter of 1609 10  called  the starving time  the population fell from 500 to 60 but when jamestown converted to a free market  there was  plenty of food  which every man by his own industry may easily and doth procure  wrote the colony secretary ralph hamor in 1614  under the previous system  he said   we reaped not so much corn from the labors of thirty men as three men have done for themselves now   ralph hamor  friend of john rolfe  whose wife was pocahontas  also described the failure of communism in jamestown like this   for formerly  when our people were fed out of the common store and labored jointly in the manuring of the ground and planting corn  glad was the man that could slip from his labor  nay  the most honest of them in a general business would not take so much faithful and true pains in a week as now he will do in a day   governor bradford of plymouth further explained the fatal conceit of communism there by saying   the experience that was had in this common course and condition  tried sundry years and that amongst godly and sober men  may well evince the vanity of that conceit of plato s and other ancients applauded by some of later times  that the taking away of property and bringing in community into a common-wealth would make them happy and flourishing   as if they were wiser than god   none of these articles mentioned the roanoke colony  whose people simply disappeared  and many speculate that they were killed by the native americans  but i think we can all deduce that it is more likely they were killed by communism  given how they disappeared without any sign of a struggle  an even more likely explanation is that they merged with the native americans  but one can easily imagine how such a desperate move may have been precipitated by the failure of communism   although both my first hand experience and observations as well as my research and analysis have long since led me to conclude that the free market and property rights are superior to communism  i would have believed that communism could have worked in the case of the first american colonies because they had every advantage one could give communism  they had already unanimously agreed to communism  they all shared the same race  nationality  religion  political views  and economic views  failure meant starvation  and slackers were beaten  but in spite of every advantage possible  communism was a catastrophic and systemic failure in the first american colonies   consider that the colonists at plymouth rock had no historical precedent on which to evaluate communism vs  the free market  and yet when communism failed them  they invented and adopted a complete free market system with full property rights in just two years   in just four years  the colonists proved that that communism was a very unnatural and ugly thing  and that free-markets and property rights were a very natural and beautiful thing   our ancestors  understanding of the superiority of the free market and property rights made us the dominant nation on earth  whereas  today we are rapidly losing that status  americans have forgotten the hard won knowledge of our ancestors   consider that barack obama  the us president as of this writing  had 400 years of additional historical precedent as well as a harvard education  and yet he still doesn t understand how the free market is superior to communism  contrary to the  myth of obama http endofinnocence com the-myth-of-obama-busted  he says   when you spread the wealth around  it's good for everybody https www youtube com watch v rhotivisudu amp t 19s   those colonists at plymouth rock  who seem so much more in touch with reality than the president of the united states  remind me of small town americans of my childhood  of course  the president sees small town americans as basically racists who have  antipathy toward those who are different  and who  cling to their guns and religion   although  barack obama is a dilettante  whose image was  manufactured by the media http endofinnocence com the-myth-of-obama-busted   progressives http endofinnocence com american-progressive-manifesto-fascism  have told me that he is right because communism in early america was too soon  they claim that it is not human nature to be a freeloader and that the people themselves have learned a lot since then and would no longer be freeloaders  in case anyone cannot see that the progressive argument is bs  then consider that  the danish recently proved that 90  still prefer to be freeloaders when they can http endofinnocence com unemployment-benefits-increase-unemployment even when they can make more money working   one has to ask why  this critical lesson http endofinnocence com communism-free-markets-plymouth-rock-jamestown  is not taught to every american  and every human  multiple times per year even in government schools especially  in government schools  such a thorough conspiracy by the global mainstream to hide the definitive failure of communism made most of the horrors of the 20th century possible  such as the bolsheviks and related horrors ,e2q93r

76,Today I finally figured out why I'm so tired all the time for the past years,i've been feeling tired all the time for the past years  whenever my mom would call me and ask how things were  i'd reply that i was tired   you're tired all the time  you should check that with the doctor  and so i went   i tried sleeping pills  benzos and pregabalin  still same problem  could it be sleep apnea  doctor didn't think so but still gave me something to open up my airways  didn't work  could be stress  maybe  so i took a mindfulness course in which i practice meditation for about 60 minutes every day - been doing it for the past 6 weeks  still tired as fuck  after a work day my mind is completely foggy and during weekends i need to rest to recover from the week and so i don't have time to do anything else   today i woke up with a strong hangover and for some reason found this sub  shit  it's work that's been killing me  it was so obvious and it never crossed my mind it could be the cause  the more i browsed the sub  the more i started to despise work  and the more i despised work and the whole system surrounding it  the more i felt guilty  guilty because i have a seemingly great job that pays way above average  where i can do things that i find pretty cool  the salary may be way above average but the average is way too shitty  which makes my salary just a bit less shitty  no way i can buy a home with this  so i have to live in constant fear that if i ever lose my job  i'll have to live on the streets   i also realized how much i attached my personality to my job  how much i thought how much self-importance i gave myself based on what i do and my salary  how i compared myself to others based on what i earn and even started to think myself as superior than a scientist friend because i made twice they made - when i've always fucking loved science and think it's one of the most meaninful things a person can do   i've been fucking brainwashed and was becoming more blind every day and browsing this sub was a refreshing experience  cleaned the fog a little bit  so i went out to the city center and looked at the world like i had a new pair of glasses  while rethinking about life and for some reason i looked at people more empatethically  a friend texted me and for the first time i asked them how they were  and meant it  i genuinelly wanted to know how they were and actually paid attention   thank you  r antiwork  i'll have to rethink my whole life  may start an union later ,e468g1

79,How do you all feel about the job application process?,i feel like this new process adds to the fact that people are complacent in their shitty jobs  it takes like 30 minutes just to submit an application to mcdonald s and most employers don t even read them they just get tossed in a bin with 400 other resumes    boomers could at least walk into a mcdonald s and talk with a manager which you can still do but it doesn t usually work  i had a bad day at work and went on indeed and remembered the 3 months i spent looking for a job on there and then decided i d rather just stay at mine then to through the whole process just to have my resume discarded ,e43jju
80,Why does work take up the entire day?,it's almost like we're just slaves  i honestly wonder how a slave in 1850 would feel about sitting at a desk in a cubicle with no windows or sunlight of any kind coming in  from 8am to 5 or 6pm every single day  do you think they would trade their lives for this  i struggle to believe they'd find this way of life to be significantly better ,e1ra2j
81,The great contradiction of the current work system,i think 100 years old 8 hours workday and bullshit like that is only secondary to this one regarding salaried employees   the employer wants to extract the maximum amount of work from the employee in the shortest time possible while it's in the best interent of the employee to provide minimum work output possible across all their allocated hours  they get paid the same no matter the output so there is no motivation and better save the energy for things that actually matter   the empoyer is aware of this and tries to fight it deploying various tools like  company culture  industrial psychology  events organized by hr  useless benefits like table football  employee of the month award and so on   raising salary actually doesn't help in the long run at all  raising salary doesn't solve this contradiction  so if your salary gets raised  you will feel momentary happiness and then it's back to normal   this  in my opinion  is one of the biggest reasons  not the only one of course  why people are so miserable at work ,e4ao1b

86,I am moving toward a more free life and I'm both excited and nervous,hello   i feel like writing now  so read this if you're interested   i've had the idea of anti-work in my head for a while now  i've been extremely anti-capitalist for a long time  and i'm at the point in my life now where i can't take living in the capitalist world anymore  i do not want to work full-time or even part-time  wasting my hours of my weeks for my employers  i mean  i work my ass off full-time for employers and i can barely afford to live  where am i going in life  i'm 22 and wasting my youth for nothing important  is there really some point where shit will get better  fuck no  these past few months i started working full-time again  started renting an apartment again  trying to start a  normal  life again  not because i want to  but because i like the idea of security  it's why i work my life away  i like living in a warm apartment and i like knowing that i'm secure  but even with this barely-security  i still cannot stomach the idea of work anymore  i am trying to play by capitalism's rules and i'm extremely depressed  crying everyday  barely eating now  barely living  i want out  working so much is killing my mental health   i've been thinking about anti-work a lot more recently  and thought about different options  do i move to the south  where it is cheaper to live  can i join a commune hundreds of miles from my home state  should i live in a camper or my car and try and survive the winters of maine  sometimes i only think about one option  prematurely ending my existence  but i cannot do that  i love life and myself and i cannot let this economic system hurt me   now i'm at a turning point  my room-mate needs to move  like next week  and i've already been doing shitty at my job lately because i'm a depressed mess  i've also been moving toward freelance work  i've been looking for clients for work such as housecleaning or babysitting  so that i can make just enough to survive  this is my chance to move away from the 9-5  or in my case  1 30-10  life  the boring life and move toward freedom  what's the point of working full-time  and making enough money  if i don't have enough time to actually enjoy life  these past few days i've been extremely happy again because i feel like if i can work hard toward an anti-work lifestyle i can reach my goals toward a more free life  i'm getting clients now for freelance work  i need to work so i can afford food  my phone bill  and my hormone medications because i'm transgender  and thinking about how i can live life with more time on my hands    i'm a little nervous  i will have to be moved out of this apartment by the end of december  but not sure what to do next  ideally i want a small motor-home so that i can live rent-free and travel  but i don't have any money saved up unfortunately  i also do not want to live in my car  it's very cold at night and i like to shower everyday  i could move back in with my parents but i really want to be independent and i don't want them to be disappointing in me  i really should just stay where i am in life  but i cannot afford to be a wage slave any longer  i have to change  to save myself and my mental health  unfortunately i'm very impulsive but lately i've been trying to plan things out   has anyone else made a sudden change from a wage slave life to a more free anti-work life  i really want to live this life so that i can have more time to reach my goals  i really want to have time to actually travel the country  have time for friends and family  have time for art and political activism and education  i don't care if it's hard  i don't care if i have to live in my car or whatever  i honestly need to live anti-work in order to save my life and live life to the fullest ,e2d0ur

92,Time Based Pricing,here's an idea to fix the mess we're living in    time based pricing   below some  examples   a cup of coffee costs everyone 1 minute of working   a bag of groceries enough for one household  4 persons  for one day costs everyone 1 hour of working   a new commuter car costs everyone 2 months of working   a ferrari costs everyone 1 year of working   an apartment costs everyone 1 year of working   a house costs everyone 1 5 years of working   a large mansion costs everyone 4 years of working   --  before people start to rage that this is a bad idea  take time  no pun intended  to think about it and give reasons why this would be a bad idea in your opinion   i'm absolutely not dogmatic about this idea  and it could be that i'm missing something very important  that this idea  might in fact be dangerous or something   --  everyone is always saying time   money   with 'time worked' as a way of paying  things get more equal for everyone    but then everyone is going to be an uber driver   toilet cleaner   painter   crap-art maker   etc   by that same 'logic'  everyone would be a doctor or pilot right now   i assure you i'd never want to work as a doctor or pilot  too much responsibility for me  even if the education for these jobfunctions were free  i wouldn't do it   --  if businesses decide to ask 2 days of working for a cup of coffee  then they probably won't get much business   other than how it's managed now  landlords can't ask one month of working as the renting price  unless they allow 10 persons in the house   --   how are people going to be able to spend their 'worked hours'   pretty much the same as it is now  1 credit per minute or something   --   who controls the credit system   who controls it now   --   it means there's an  unlimited  amount to spend  inflation  etc   not sure about that  as one needs to work  no work means no credits  the more people work  the more credits there will be   --   what if there isn't enough work to do   we need to realize that this is already the case with automation robots taking over  it means we either should all benefit from these robots or cost of living should be  far  more reasonable and affordable   --   this idea is extremely dangerous   why   --   what about the people who are doing labor that they can only do for 4 hours a day   why should we work more than 4 hours a day anyway   --  it's an idea  obviously it's never going to be implemented  because tptb won't let it happen  but it's an idea   just thinking out loud  what say ye ,e2u9lw
93,Super frustrated. My boss won’t get off my ass,so i ve been working at a small business for over a year now and almost out of no where  the owner boss started getting on my ass for slip ups and minor mistakes  some of it is perfectly warranted  and i ve tried to adjust accordingly  but other issues he s raised are nitpicks like   1-  why don t you come in early anymore  are you starting to slip    when i first started  i used to come in early  eventually i saw that there was absolutely no benefit to continue to do this  fyi i m the only employee who continually comes in on time or early  the other employees are either 15min late every day or an hour late every day  my complaints to the boss owner about the tardiness of my coworkers  that leaves me alone on shifts sometimes  were met with excuses and double standards about how long they ve worked here  i m being too harsh  blah blah   when i was coming in early  i ended up fulfilling duties they should ve been doing if they were on time  so i decided to just come in on time when scheduled  but still not late   2-  why don t you clean like you used to  are you getting complacent   when i was first hired  the first thing i noticed was that the place was a disgusting mess  so in order to show  leadership  and  initiative  i began to clean the store at least once a week as well as attempt to clean whenever there s down time  my coworkers stations were are so disgusting and cluttered that i couldn t even begin to clean without bothering their daily routines  my suggestion for them to help me fell on deaf ears   a year later and i m still the only one who cleans  so i decided that i m only going to straighten up the bare minimum  once a week  and nothing else  i have the same responsibilities as my coworkers and i get paid less than them  what am i  the personal maid around here   3- miscellaneous issues with my timesheet  so this one really bothers me  at this backwards ass job  we have to calculate everything with our timesheets  our hours  our labor commissions  our floor sales commissions  receipt numbers  people we worked with  etc  etc  and email them to the owner boss who submits it to a third party payroll company that pays us  i ve never been at a place that operated this way  usually there s someone  like a manager  who calculates most of this stuff with the assistance of a time clock program or something  anyway  over the last 3 weeks  my boss has been riding me about errors i ve made with my math when it comes to my commissions  again  some of these complaints seemed to make sense at first  as i know i ve made a mistake or two in the past  but now i m beginning to get suspicious or at least paranoid that he s trying to rip me off or something  it s happening far too often despite how careful i ve been   now my complaints  1- we don t get breaks  we just don t  i m tired of being unable to get through a meal without interruption   2- we re on camera all day and we re watched by the boss owner and micromanaged on occasion   3- i m tired of being messaged about work shit on my time off or day off   4- one coworker in particular is hostile  he demeans everyone  is blatantly racist  sexist  etc  and loses his temper whenever he s slightly inconvenienced  i could have a line of customers and he won t help  he just stays in the back        i don t know why my boss is suddenly on my ass  i don t know if i m making errors that are serious or not and i m not sure i care  i m just feeling burned out ,e1oa2q

102,Economic Possibilities For Our Grandchildren,recently i read an essay by john maynard keynes called economic possibilities for our grandchildren  which was pretty depressing  in the essay  he states that because of improving technology  efficiency  and productivity  by the time his grandchildren are his age  which is now  the average worker will only have to work 15 hours a week  and they will be paid more than they were in his time  obviously this hasn't happened  but it's not because he was too far off base   ever since the industrial revolution  there was a trend of workers working less and being paid more  while the overall production of the economy increased  due to improvements in technology and productivity  at the beginning of the industrial revolution  the average worker had to work pretty much constantly just to barely scrape by  by 1900 it was around 65 hours a week  and by 1930 it was about 55 hours  at the same time  the average income for the middle and lower class was slowly but steadily gaining  but around the 1950's-1960's time period  this trend all but stopped   wages stagnated and haven't really grown since  and the hours worked has barely budged and has even increased in several industries and professions  basically  the worker is working just as hard as they were 60 years ago with no gains to show for it  this isn't because the economy hasn't grown  keynes predicted that by this time  technology and productivity improvements may have caused the economy to multiply by eight times  this was actually a low estimate  and the surplus wealth in the economy has multiplied many dozens of times since then  so why hasn't the well being of the worker increased along with it   if you follow this subreddit you probably already know  the vast majority of the incredible gains of the american economy over the past 60 years have gone straight to the pockets of the wealthy  while the workers position has remained stagnant decade after decade  the rich have doubled their wealth year after year after year    to further confirm this  a study showed that the average worker today produces the same amount of product in 11 hours that a worker in 1950 could produce in 40 hours  and though consumption has obviously increased in recent decades  that doesn't even come close to accounting for this  the worker today has come to accept that they will never see their lives improve  they will never get a break  and they will never see the value created by their labor  they accept that they are being exploited  and it's a travesty   the main thing we can do is try to organize and educate our fellow workers  both within the workplace and in politics  i'm currently nearing the end of college  and when i graduate i'm going to join the labor force full time  rather than just part time as i'm doing now  after a few years of experience in the private sector  i am going to run for city council in houston  texas  my hometown  on a platform of worker's rights ,e41egp

105,You can never have enough money.,thats the trap  no matter how much money people make  they can always make more  and they always want to make more  a lucky few get rich and make millions  but even they are not happy  they are still trying to make more  the average person never gets to make millions of dollars though  so the dream of finally making enough to relax and enjoy life acts like the carrot on a stick that keeps them going   what nobody ever tells them is that if you spend 50 years of your lufe in a state of tension chasing money  when you finally retire you'll wont be able to relax because always doing something and working has become a habit  so alot of retired people either get depressed or they go back to work because its where their whole identity is based   most people don't enjoy their jobs and yet  if they didn't have to go to work they would be bored to death because they don't themselves and what they're actually interested in  which is what education should help people do ,e2zkqb

a dated gaming pc  some tools and power tools  some kitchen stuff  stacks of books   i don t have a car or a licence - i did a course years ago  so i know how to  but never did the exam because money  and also didn t have money for the car anyway  and i wouldn t use it daily as public transport was and is much quicker   i don t drink alcohol  i don t do any kind of drugs  i don t smoke tobacco  i admittedly vape  i might spend up to a  100 per month on games - humble bundles  some dlc to my favourites  but of pay2win crap elsewhere   i wear clothes i have  i m not bothered by labels  i don t have anything of a recognisable brand  i buy just  quality  clothes that will last me a long time  and usually only replace them  trends don t apply to me  i m either jeans and t-shirt most of the days  and tweed if i feel fancy   i rent a flat  i d say in the middle of a price range  1 bedroom  rather cramped  but good commute and safe neighbourhood   i spend probably a bit too much on takeout  because as much as i love cooking  after a full day of work it s not very enjoyable  but still  it s maybe 5-6 times a month  and it s pizza or mcdonalds  nothing fancy   i also spend a bit too much on food  i could go for  italian style hard cheese  instead of parmesan  or just bacon instead of pancetta  but did i mention i love cooking  also candies and pastries - i m a sweet tooth  sue me   i haven t had a steak in months  beef is too expensive  usually the meat is either sausage  bacon or sometimes mince  often there s no meat  just legumes  cheese  eggs and dairy as a source of fat and protein   i have stopped going to starbucks and other crap coffee establishments  switched to black tea with milk  i stopped eating lunch at work  i ll just bring something from home to keep me going until the evening   and i m still just spiralling down  well  i kind of know why  i have two people who are financially dependent on me  don t really want to go into why and how  but the fact is they are  and if i leave them hanging they are absolutely and completely screwed   one of them i just spend flat 18 5  of salary on as a handout  the second lives with me  so it s hard to estimate the actual cost  some electricity  some food  some cash  while it does explain the gaping budget hole  i m still blaming the current economy for it  i m supposedly wealthy  on paper  aren t i   recently i ve been looking around on an app there like a facebook for neighbourhoods  i did some computer repair  pc building for an older couple  i did some handyman work as well - i m a diy enthusiast  while i highly enjoyed it  i also did it for money  some bucks here  some bucks there  usually i just say with perfect honesty that i m not a registered self employed person  so i cannot ask for any money  but i can accept a gift  people are quite generous when they are happy with what i do  and i m an honest and conscientious guy  i show up on time  i get stuff done  i don t bullshit   however as i ve mentioned i don t have a car  i also don t want to incur wrath of the tax authorities  so i only just offer my services  outside of my day job hours  on the neighbour board  when someone is looking for something i can do  i don t advertise  because i feel it would be silly to be a handyman on the weekends and late evenings only  but i m happy to do some actual work with my hands  interact with people  and put the tools to use  as i m currently renting a flat  they don t see any real use   i m at the end of a rope really  i probably could hail mary  get a loan from my bank and continue the status quo few more months  but that is not a solution   i will probably be forced to hang one of the people who are dependent on me out to dry  and it s killing me  i worked hard for over a decade  i m really good at what i do  i kept away from most vices  i spend my free time either doing some side gigs for spare change or doing things for friends for free -

You'd think with all the advances in technology we could all be working less,the eight-hour day movement or 40-hour week movement  also known as the short-time movement  was a social movement to regulate the length of a working day  preventing excesses and abuses  it had its origins in the industrial revolution in britain  where industrial production in large factories transformed working life  the use of child labour was common  the working day could range from 10 to 16 hours  and the work week was typically six days a week     from wikipedia   so how come we are not fighting for our rights anymore  really interested in your thoughts on this ,e0fzvd

128,I need to rant about call centres,i absolutely killed myself working for a telecoms company  i took pride in my work and pushed for the best stats in the place  i got a badge for being top 100   not an actual monetary benefit    every time i peaked and hit a target  they switched the goal posts and pushed me harder for the next threshold   there is no endgame  no completion or reward  they just squeeze and push you on repeat   my immune system was shattered by stress so i took some sick days to recover  they put me in a room and had me justify the sicknesses infront of three managers  they put me on a  sickness stage  which is essentially a disciplinary after weeks of hounding because i didn't want to take strong painkillers to get me back into work    i was micro managed to a ridiculous extent  penalised for taking too many pee breaks basically forcing me into a state of permanent dehydration  i was placed in an  evaluation  where i again had to justify the amount of times a day i urinate  these meetings play out like police interrogations    any sort of career progression involves being a manager on secondment  this is something i'd never heard of before working there  what it essentially means is you are a manager  with all of the responsibilities but none of the pay  you do the exact same job as managers  you've got all these desperate people wanting a better wage  absolutely killing themselves for the title  they're taking their work home with them living and breathing the company in the hopes of getting paid for what they're already doing  i knew secondment managers that hadn't been offered the actual job for 5 years    the company would fend us off against other call centres in stat competitions and reward us for winning  they gave us little packets of haribo  one year they put a ferris wheel in the carpark  they'd give us a spin on a roulette wheel for transferring to sales  1 in 10 chance of a 2 minute break         i'm just so sick of being treated like a fucking child with these pseudo rewards so they dont have to fork out for any meaningful rewards yno like money  or being fairly paid for the work you do   the absolute worst thing of all is the people around me eat this shit up  they love it  you're taught to think you're some sort of grinch if you dont play along with a smile on your face  if you dont take the overtime when asked you're considered a maverick   and the long term managers holy shit  the personality types they hire for these positions are uniform  these small people who milk situations of hierarchy and a minuscule amount of power for all it's worth  you can tell they relish their position because it gives them the opportunity to talk to you poorly    i managed to get out of there and into a more traditional office job where they treat you like an adult  but to all my brothers and sisters still in the trenches  please know that you come first    your mental and physical well being must be a priority  they will make you feel guilty and shame you into pushing past your own boundaries just because they did the same  dont let them normalise this toxic awful culture  they dont care about you ,dzgrjk
129,The Belmont School, amp x200b   born to a family in america s lower middle class  i worked my way through a bachelor s in mathematics  for whatever reason  i had loads of trouble finding internships throughout university  i got one  but it was volunteer  the work was good  i was helping organize bee farms in a village in africa  but as i needed money i couldn t dedicate much to that  i had to work  i worked in restaurants and did manual labor mostly  after i graduated  i still couldn t find meaningful  read  high paying and or interesting  so i got a job with a moving company  moving things   it was here that i felt the most horrible reality i had ever had to face so far in my life  it was here i realized no matter how much i worked  no matter how much i studied  no matter how much i appreciated the world and culture  that i would never be able to leave my caste  i was set far behind from the bourgeoisie  and i was low class  end of story  this moving company allowed me to feel the full weight of that   one saturday  the crew and i had to empty a high end private elementary school in a very wealthy town  i got there about 6am with my team and we started emptying it out  people started showing up for whatever reason  there were two ways we were looked at by the people within the establishment 1  with pity 2  with disgust  it was plainly obvious that we were different  first of all  our group was a motley one  varying races and ethnic cultural backgrounds  i mean  our masters on the other hand were entirely white  the older women who looked at us almost uniformly did it with pity  and they even attempted to  tip  us  personally  i find that extremely degrading  so i was put in a horribly bad mood already  almost all the men and many of the middle-aged women looked at us with disgust  almost as if they did not recognize us as human   i should mention at this point that the  vast  majority of folks here did not even notice us or ignored us  this is a fairly small minority of people i am talking about with disgust pity  i say this because at least three of us were almost hit by cars  as though we were rodents in the way of their escalades  in the parking lot    the day was wearing on and we were all exhausted  i became almost physically ill when the manager of our company came and brownnosed the super of the school and i even heard him apologize for some of the men s appearance  i was appalled and disgusted  now it is about ninety-five degrees and i am exhausted  i start walking back towards the cigarette scented semi that took me here when i hear something very nice  it was part of mozart s 40th symphony  neither the tonality nor musicality was there  but i love art pretty much always  it was very refreshing after a day of work to hear the piece  i fell into the gravitational field of the music and wandered closer  unconsciously  finally  i saw a bunch of children playing the piece with a woman probably in her fifties conducting it  i watched for a few moments and went from happy to hear the music to completely dejected  it was as though i had become awakened from a dream  i realized in that moment  i could not be like them  i love their music  i love their art  i love their easy lifestyle  i desperately want to have their educations and opportunities  but right then  i realized that those things aren t for me  they are for them  i am a utility  i help their communities run  i do the work they don t want to  and what do i get for it  i get ignored  i get pitied  i remembered all the times i spoke to people above my caste   oh wow  you know schoenberg  i am very surprised  or the most memorable one   i believe that even people like you could achieve in an elite university  the realization crushed me with an immense weight  almost making me drop to my knees   i have never felt more worthless or hopeless than in that moment  i wept when i got home until i fell asleep  when i woke up  i went to the next job   postscript   this was written about a year ago  i would like to raise everyone s spirits a bit with an update  i still can t find work and now my student loans are due  also  as a result of the nature of my work  i have a severe back injury as well as nerve and muscle damage in my thumb  hope that this post brings everyone up  ,dzpp61
130,Please bear with me through this diary entry of a post,i am 23  i've been working 45 hours a week for the past 7 months  my job has afforded me the opportunity to live in the city i wanted to  half of my biweekly paycheck goes to rent  it's not possible to save money where i live  i understand that  i get it  i accept it  i just wanted an opportunity to get the fuck out of my parent's basement  i wanted so badly to leave there  and it's funny how  now  in hindsight  i would do anything to pack up to return to that basement   here's the thing about full-time  office work  you become devoid of  thought  without thought  there is no existence  you see         i come home at night  i'm tired as all hell  i wake up tired  i go to work and i'm tired  with my tire comes a nonexistence  i don't care about my job  i don't care about the work  it's all so remarkably meaningless  i can feel myself shrinking  i can feel myself melting into the abyss of pure nothingness  this is not hyperbole  my friends  this is the reality of what work does to a man   my question is this  how do i escape  i have 6 months left on my lease  i can't just get up and leave  so i'll need to afford the monstrous rent for the remainder of time  6 months  half a year of continued decay  that shit can bring a man to tears  fucking lord and jesus   apologies for this diary entry  i'm just so very tired  i haven't the slightest fucking clue how folks do this for decades  i'd rather be in a minimum-security prison  reading books and working out for years   i'm begging for somebody to understand what i'm saying  i feel like a madman sometimes when my friends and family simply can't wrap their head around what i'm trying to articulate -- however jumbled it might be  and it is jumbled  surely  how can it not be    thanks ,dzqeuk

132,From “The Glass Escalator Revisiting: Gender Inequality in Neoliberal Times” by Christine Williams,however  upbraiding these jobs may not be in the interests of all women  i do not assume that the women at the top of the occupational pyramid share common cause with the women at the bottom any more than men do   it exxonmobil corporate headquarters in houston  for example  janitors  who currently am  8 35 an hour  are fighting for a pay raise  of course  because of the neoliberal work organization  they don t actually work for exxonmobil  they work for cleaning subcontractors who bid on temporary contracts to provide cleaning services  and who employ lesions of women workers on an  as needed  basis  consequently  the spokesperson for exxonmobil can claim that his company doesn t  have anything to do with  the low wages paid to janitors who clean their offices  but there is no question that the immense profits of the oil and gas industry and the high pay of the geoscientists who work for it come from squeezing the workers on the bottom  outsourcing  temporalizing  and shifting risk onto workers is the essence of the neoliberal business model   for these reasons  i believe that feminist demands for gender equality in the workplace are not enough  to women janitors deserve to be treated the same as men janitors  yes  of course they do  but they also deserve more than  8 35 an hour  which will not happen unless their employers are forced to pay them more  that is why a critique of capitalism must accord- any our critique of gender inequality  his is my  new  feminist agenda for the sociology of work   his  new  agenda is in fact at least 40 years old  hardening back to the  socialist feminist  of the 1970s  that agenda has been lost in recent years  overcome by what fancy fraser has called the  feminist romance with capitalism   2009  110  his is the idea that women s emancipation requires their entry into paid work  his idea has been used to motivate women around the world to seek dignity and equality in the labor market even though  for the vast majority of women  paid work is son- anonymous with extreme exploitation and family hardship  feminist school- as rightly criticize women s economic dependency on men and the evaluation of women s daring labor in the home  but we must not ignore the fact that the alternative can be just as bad  capitalists rely on women s unpaid work in the home to reproduce the labor force and they exploit women s labor to generate enormous profits  in effect  they have had- passed the dream of women s liberation to the engine of capitalist act- emulation  feminist have been implicit with this insular as we endorse the model of competitive individuals in the marketplace for women  collins and layer 2010  eisenstein 2010  i now believe that a feminist  his content download from 128 119 168 112 on due  01 act 2019 07 27 17 utc  clause subject fo its about just org terms  626 gender   society   october 2013  that is divorced from a critique of capitalism will only make things worse for most women   the glass escalator explains the advantages that straight white men receive in professional jobs in traditional work organizations  because it analyze male privilege without critiquing capitalist exploitation  it loses sight of the diminishing rewards available to most workers  it may be time to retire the concept  he need new metaphor to explain gender inequality in our neoliberal age  ,dzdusn

137,Employment Agencies Where You Are?,hello there  i'm from australia and i'm very much underemployed  so i've been at an employment agency for several months now  and my god they're so inefficient and almost perfectly not helpful    our government is run by the liberal party  who are our right wing conservatives  and i know that our job agencies use public money to make profits for private companies   luckily the whole place seems to be moving into an online-only model - which sucks for the workers there  but at least i won't have to come in every single day to fill out pointless sheets and look for jobs under their supervision   what they've got people doing is this  you have an obligation to apply for a set number of jobs per month - i was on 20  but it's been lowered to 11 for the time being  they've got a lot of us to come in every day monday to friday and spend about 3 hours  basically cold calling employers - what sort of approach is this  employers must hate it  they also promise to get us all the licenses and qualifications we need  but very often they'll just tell us to not bother because we don't have a job lined up   it's clear the whole system is purposely designed to demoralize and demonize job seekers  to make them so fed up with it all that they stop coming to appointments and then get their welfare payments cut  i used to think that places like this where just inefficient and broken in the way that lots of places just are  because people are stupid  but damn  i'm now fully aware that the inefficiency and cruelty is built into the system  the liberal party hates poor people and is actively punishing them with cruel systems like our job agencies      rant over  i was just wondering what the employment agencies are like where you're from  are they the same  better  worse   cheers ,dylfp4

146,Am I in some kind of nightmare?,the adult working environment will be looked back at with amazement one day in the future  if there is a long-term future  i ve been to many job interviews recently  talking to my interviewers you d think they weren t even human  maybe lizard people do exist  they were all cold  brainwashed by this system known as capitalism  i ll never forget the demented look in their eyes  no sense of humor or humanity  100  self centered  i ve not heard from either of them  i think their senses told them deep down i m not that interested  it feels like everyone is obsessed with a fake social hierarchy rather than seeing the benefit of individual traits  everyone has their strengths  we evolved this way  i would never call someone  my boss  or  my manager  - how can you claim someone is  your boss  to use the word of conservative suck ups  yes that makes you the biggest cuck of all in the animal kingdom   everyone says this is the best time to be alive  just because capitalism is at it s peak and the world is economically better off than it was 50 years ago  it doesn t mean we re better off  in fact  people have never been more unhappy  suicide rates are at their highest levels  look at the proportion of people in the west taking antidepressants  whilst money is a more efficient tool than barter  it s a human invention and makes up only a tiny part of life  yet it s all people care about  no one has time for anyone  just their own greed so they can consume more things that supposedly make happy  when it reality it makes them miserable and unhealthy  people use  sorry but i m at work  as an excuse to get out of everything  but can you blame them  because i understand it s exhausting wearing a fake corporate mask all day around people who wouldn t be phased if you died  working a lot doesn t make you a hero  it makes you a sad sheep  stop bragging about all the overtime you worked  when i look around most people aren t healthy  look at the deadness in their eyes  the blackness underneath  they have to take stimulants just to keep going  downing multiple coffees throughout the day  drinking alcohol at the weekend to mask their pain   consumerism strongly goes against the evolution of humans  it kills our morality and opposes our natural requirements of good health  you can t be healthy working all the time in most jobs  family and community  maybe there is something wrong with me  but i ve never been interested in consuming plastic junk  what do i need it for  it doesn t make me happy  expensive products just are a burden and a liability    with the technology and scientific understanding we have  we could constantly strive for perfection  but people always have to be doing something  interfering with and destroying their surroundings  here s a beautiful river  lets purchase a loud boat to spew out diesel fumes into the water and effect the whole ecosystem  isn t this beautiful  that s a nice forest  let me burn these trees down and cover it in concrete  don t you love my home  we no longer live amongst the natural environment  we live fighting against it  there is no peace or silence ever  simplicity is better  once men used to be just hunters  instead they ll scam their neighbor just for money   when i sit at standstill in traffic  i cannot help but think  in what way are we benefiting the world  as we are at the moment we re a major burden in so many ways  casting pain and fear throughout planet earth  most jobs don t benefit humanity at all  they go against it  noise  pollution  unhealthy chemicals are pumped out of their metal boxes  breathed in by the same people  cities were designed for cars  not walking  cars that are paid for and maintained by the employee  just so they can get to work  there's always only one person in each car  how is that supposedly efficient or sustainable as capitalism tells us   the poorest countries in the world have the lowest suicide rates out of all countries  the evidence is there  if neo-liberalism is the most effective system then how come i m at my happiest when i have nothing  when i walk through the forest is the only time i m truly happy   i m not against all work  just work in the way it is now  many jobs need not exist at all  a lot of people spend their time just pretending to look busy  society would be much better off if we worked for the best interests of the future of the planet  for humanity  rather than soulless corporations  if people followed the laws of science  of nature  of what s best for all of us we could develop in a healthy and sustainable way   the problem is everyone just goes along with it without question  they even enjoy it  spouting nonsense and lies fed to them by advertisements and the media since birth  sucking on the feet of the wealthy  voting against their own interests in the hope one day they will be rich  the media is obsessed with identity politics  divide and conquer has never gotten old and has never been more effective   i d rather die than live in this mess  count me out ,e0ffpf

154,"After 19 years, I've finally realized I spent my entire life working hard to become a slave",it's the end of the second semester of my sophomore year in college  i'm majoring in computer science  this means i have a ton of assignments due next week and i've only finished one so far  what a terrible time to come to this sub and have the epiphany   i've been a responsible kid for a good portion of my life  i studied a lot and got very good grades  my classmates called me a 'nerd'  there were two main reasons for which i dedicated myself to study  1  to have more days of vacation and 2  to achieve my dreams  since i was a small child i've dreamed of moving abroad  some times it would be america  other times the uk  other times canada and a few times japan  i'm from brazil btw  all my life i've lived in fear  i can't leave the door of my house and go for walk unless i want to be robbed  i can't use headphones in the parking lot of the mall unless i want to attract the eyes of robbers  the mere sight of a motorcycle on a street sends shivers down my spine  stories of burglaries and robberies are something i hear often from acquaintances  and i've experienced it directly  since i've been robbed once  that's why i've always wanted to escape from all that shit  i didn't want to live in constant fear for the rest of my life  i don't think that's a life with dignity  i thought if i studied and worked hard enough i'd be able to move to an idyllic place where i'd live a happy and fulfilling life surrounded by great people    my energy was sucked by school but i was still satisfied because i was always looking forward  to the next holiday  the next winter break and  in the more distant future  a happy life in a place i loved  my mental health started deteriorating in my sophomore year of hs  i had to go biking twice a week at night to clear my mind of all the stress  it was hard but i kept moving forward  when the time came to choose my future path i chose computer science  i liked coding and the idea of having a high-paying job in california sounded nice to me   my first semester in college was pretty cool  i had more free time than when i was in hs and i liked the subjects i was studying  then things started to change  it became much more demanding and i started hating my life  it wears me down  every day that i have to go to those dull-looking classrooms and watch lectures for 6 hours sucks my life energy a bit more  i spend my weekdays thinking of my weekends  which i mainly use for studying and doing assignments  but they make me feel  a lot  better than going every single day to college  fortunately  whenever i'm feeling completely worn out i can simply miss classes  i don't need to explain to anyone why i missed  because it's our right to miss 25  of all the class hours in a semester  that's what keeps me sane    and then it struck me some time ago  i'm not going to have this luxury when i start working  i won't work for  just  6 hours every day  i'll work 8 hours  i only have 4 days of class per week  but that number's going to increase to 6 when i start working full-time  i won't have 4 months of vacation per year  i'll only have 1  that's assuming i live in brazil  if i move to america  it's going to be half that number  i won't be able to simply miss work whenever i want  i'll have to justify it every time and i know i'll feel guilty and afraid of calling in sick when i get sick    this leaves very little time for the things that make us humans happy and healthy  exercise  either squeeze it in the morning and neglect sleeping or do at night when you're exhausted from spending the entire day working  sunlight  better get used to spending 5 7 of your life not seeing the sun  socializing  the best you'll get is hanging out with your friends on sunday with each passing hour weighing on your mind as you get closer and closer to monday    work is not sunshine and rainbows like i thought it was  it's actually the complete opposite of it  i hear adults saying it all the time   i thought i had it bad in hs until i went to college  then i thought i had it bad in college until i started working  now i understand why  i look at the full-time working adults around me and  maybe i'm wrong  none of them looks really happy  they either look like tired all the time or stressed all the time  some of them keep their sanity by thinking of retirement  but the thought of spending my entire life unhappily surviving until i can retire at 65 is frankly depressing   no matter where you live  even if it's not a crime-ridden shithole like the one i live  that's a miserable existence   i found this sub yesterday and i'm thankful that there are other people who aren't being fooled by the lies they feed us every day  now it makes me even more sick in the stomach when i hear people like my dad  who have miserable lives  singing praises to capitalism and spewing the bullshit they watch on youtube far-right channels    the worst thing i've realized is that all my hard work was in vain  i can't believe society led me to believe being a corporate slave was a dream worth pursuing  i wasn't any wiser than the people who spent their teenage years having fun  in the end we're all going to end up equally miserable    i guess now this realization will haunt me for

222,We sacrifice our health for this...,i realized last night how insidious this is - my best friend works in an office  she actually likes her job  which is nice for her  the place that she works is  in all honesty  seemingly far better to its employees than most   this is a large office building  and it has a cafeteria where they serve all kinds of delicious  calorie laden foods  think like a high end college cafeteria    on a daily basis  when i meet my friend at the gym  she tells me a story almost every day that is food related  either a coworker has brought in cake or candy  or some dish they made at home to share with people  or the employer themselves is giving out a  reward  of food  yesterday  it was a  comfort food buffet   my friend arrives there at 7 30 in the morning and leaves at 4 30 in the afternoon   she s trying to lose weight for her health  but how are you supposed to take care of yourself when you re at work nine hours a day and people are just throwing food at you all day  and then you sit at a desk  it s not right   add to that about an hour and a half at least of commuting time every day  and she s set up to fail  11 of her waking hours are spent essentially stuck in a building  mainly sitting down  or sitting in a car  having unhealthy food offered at every turn   11 of the supposedly 16 waking hours available to her   of course  what actually happens is that she stays up too late  doesn t get enough sleep  and it just makes things worse   i almost feel guilty  because i made a choice three years ago not to go back to full-time work  i knew it was killing me  but she lives alone  she doesn t really have that option without completely changing her life   and frankly  i don t know how it s going to work out for me long-term  but i just can t do it ,dw8woh

239,"i made a ""commitment.""",i work as an intern in a registrar's office at a private university  paid minimum wage  our office has been going through some chaos  people leaving  new incompetent people getting hired  and so a majority of the work has been put on the interns  since we've been here a while and know what we're doing    i'm moving dorms this friday and my boss told me that my request to have off  a day in which i work 9-5  is really inconvenient and not  an ideal situation  she told me that a lot of interns have been calling out  because of the influx of work  and that she has to say no at some point  she also said i  made a commitment  to work 8 hours that day  to which i told her i know  and that's why im telling her a week in advance that im moving  she tried to argue with me asking if i could just move that weekend  and i told her no  because i have plans and it's getting close to finals so i have a lot of assignments   she said she had to think about it and then she emailed me the next day saying she had spoken to a coworker  who is above her level and who is more understanding  and that they would support me if i really needed to have off that day  but she also asked if i could come in at all that day  even a little  my pity for the office gave in and i agreed to work 3 hours in the morning so that i could get a little work done before im gone the whole day   in my email confirming this  i asked her   in the future  is there another process you would like us to use to call out request days off  should we be telling you more than a week in advance  i hope she reads that question and realizes how dumb it is to say no to someone on the principle that  she has to say no at some point  letting your boss know a week in advance you can't work that day is acceptable   we are interns  we should not be vital to office operations  we get paid minimum wage  my loyalty is not to this job  and not to academia  it's to my need to freely be able to do what i need to without bosses and professors breathing down my back  my loyalty is to my own sense of free will and self ,dvrzhe
240,A comment someone made on r/antiwork,so in a r antiwork thread someone commented this   i can't wait for the next recession which is gonna happen probably   someone else's commented this   why   he responded back   the reason we didn't storm their ivory towers and killed them is because these days everyone is comfortable with water food video games and other material things   but he said   when you take that away people are gonna protest people are gonna go on a strike,dvq9p7

242,It sucks having coworkers with no solidarity,i work at a major public institution that recently banned smoking  so i usually smoke on the sidewalk right off the formal property  this doesn't make any real difference  since its about five feet distant from where i'd smoke otherwise  but those are the rules  i guess   anyway  a person who i see in the hallway and know vaguely i guess saw me smoking a cigarette two feet  onto  our property instead of two feet  off  i think maybe she said something but i was about 30-40 feet away and couldn't hear  i looked up  and she was hiding behind the bushes  taking pictures of me   i assume she's going to report me to someone and try to get me in trouble  i'm not terribly concerned  since i've been receiving good feedback thus far  but it just really rankled me  everyone here is an utterly individualistic prick who spends as much time as possible trying to chide or reprimand their coworkers and peers  it's great for management and bad for the rest of us   another example  they recently decided that a failure to lock an office door by janitorial staff would result in an immediate termination of the custodian responsible  even though they replaced our full-time custodians with severely underpaid contractors  they notified of us that  after  an email encouraging us to report failures to lock our office doors  i smelled bullshit from the beginning and didn't report the few times it has happened to me  but i just don't understand what kind of a scum-sucker can report their coworker for such a non issue   i've only been here six months and it took me a year after grad school to find this  so it's the only thing making me an actual human right now  i hate it here and i'm going to start applying to other positions soon  but in the meantime  i just don't understand why people internalize intra-class aggression instead of like  anything else ,dvxp75
243,"I recently quit my job because it was destroying my mental health, but even in my final week the company found another reason to convince me that leaving was the right thing.",my job didn't used to be so bad  the work itself wasn't too taxing or too boring  the people were nice  the money was good  and the office was only a 10 minute commute from my house  but over the years the company decided to implement rounds of voluntary redundancies in order to cut costs  so you can see exactly where this is going  fewer people to do the same amount of work  so everyone had to pick up extra workload and take on additional responsibilities in order to pick up the slack  for the same amount of money  naturally  as a result of all this the company became obsessed with productivity management  so it became a world of stats  targets  performance monitoring  everything that you did being constantly recorded and scrutinised  etc etc  i'm the sort of person who takes pride in their work  and that attitude eventually started to get me in trouble  the company didn't want people taking the time to do things right  they wanted people to just churn out reams of complete garbage in order to satisfy their completely arbitrary  and ever-changing  targets  couple that with the fact that i can't stand working with someone figuratively looking over my shoulder all the time  so their drive for 'maximising productivity' had the complete opposite effect for me  the more pressure i was under to hit targets  the more stressed and less effective i became  when i started at the company my productivity was fine  but after years of these changes it ended up in the toilet   this eventually led to me having to take a total of 9 months off work in the last 2 years due to what it was doing to my mental health  and ultimately led me to handing in my notice  i feel relieved at having left  but also guilty  i'm leaving behind a lot of good people who're in the same situation as me  battling with stress depression anxiety and regularly having to take time off as a result  but who can't quit because they have more responsibilities  supporting their families etc  to think about  it sucks   so that's my rant  but what did the company do in my final week as it's last  fuck you  well  my manager was off on one of her many holidays that week  and it was decided that someone else needed to be in charge in the interim  because obviously we couldn't be trusted to get on with things by ourselves  now  on my team there were about a dozen people  with 5 of us each having over a decade's experience of the job  myself included  so who did they put in charge  that's right  they chose the temp  the guy who'd been there for 3 months  i know what you're thinking  that that's insane  but don't worry  it's ok  apparently his family are very good friends with our director of business services  so i'm sure that he's got a bright future ahead of him at the company  i even heard that he and the director had started playing golf together  so that's nice  in fact it's quite incredible how well family friends do there  and if your surname happens to be the same as someone else higher up  you're pretty much guaranteed to rise through the ranks  hmm   but now thankfully i don't have to put up with that bullshit anymore  at least until i get a job somewhere else and have to deal with whatever dysfunction that particular company has  looking forward to it ,dxquc4

253,The struggle to date in this hellscape we call society,my antiwork persona and overall disdain for the chore of the modern day existence was what caused my previous relationship to crumble  my lover unfortunately had to field constant questions from her older brother  and other respected family members about my unwillingness to work full time  and also my comfort in making just enough to get by  i made enough to support my small hobbies of cooking  playing video games  going to movies  playing park basketball  hiking and smoking that good denver grass  my relationship was one of stories of old we were best friends all through our high school years and both attended our local community college and remained close  this developed to full scale lovers through the natural love we held for each other once she moved states away  once the questions started to come down about my direction in life  seeing that i wasn't going to university because i refused to take on the debt  she would defend me and take my side  but during my brief period as a pizza delivery driver even she mentioned not feeling good about having to tell others what i did for a living  i told her how hurt i was because i thought she saw through that useless identifier and how i thought of myself as so much more than a pizza delivery driver  her older brother was also our roommate so it uncomfortable  him taking issue with my lifestyle and never having the balls to say it to my face  instead just preaching to my love about how it was eventually going to get old  a majority of this time my girlfriend worked 40 hours in the kitchen at a restaurant downtown  which was badass as a lady  and meanwhile i was putting in around 25 as a banquet server and this did not sit well with him  even though i made enough for rent and my immediate priorities  eventually the stress and anxiety it was putting me through would have me leaving the house for no reason at all  driving aimlessly or sitting in my car for hours pretending to have more going on than i did because otherwise they  her brother and his fiance  would silent judge me for not maximizing my time to the capitalist definition   wasting time on a video games or watching basketball  i'm somebody who has put a lot of time and effort into my spiritual and intellectual growth so this weighed a lot on my soul to be so heavily misunderstood  i want to be a positive  giving  light of a person and this feeling of being unequal because of my financials became too much to bear  i left  and me and my girlfriend grieved the situation recognizing me going back home and finishing my associates would be better for my longterm capabilities  and after getting in a car accident   losing my job  i really had no other choice  eventually after being given the space  and succumbing to inadequacy of a long distance relationship she broke it off with me  and neither of us have been entirely whole again in the year thats followed  i've managed to successfully move out of my parents house again  and got that associates degree and now work a full time job where i relocated to  after that experience i'm in fear of dating  i've yet to meet the woman who shares mindset like mine against the stupidity of modern societies  work to live  problem  it makes me feel like i'll be forever alone  or forced to sacrifice myself  this is a great tragedy as someone who considers deep love the best life has to offer but i've been hurt in various long term relationships because of my lifestyle  anyway the point of this post is i just want deep love again  i'm only 23 but meeting the right people just gets harder and harder  do any of you antiworkers relate to this struggle ,dw74mg

257,Would there be more tolerance of work if there was more give and take between you and your figurative employer?,for instance  if the work week was 4x32 instead of 5x40  and your salary was doubled overnight  would this make working more tolerable or are you antiwork no matter how favorable the arrangement is between you and your figurative employer ,dwwzwv
258,I Ended The Job Interview Mid-Way and Manager Lost It,hi all    thought you might enjoy this one    so i'm back at college  and am looking for some work to help pay the bills  i'm lucky in that i have enough financial runway from student loans to look for a job properly and be a bit selective  so i can avoid the worst managers and work environments    i went for an interview at tesco  big uk supermarket a couple of days ago  the hiring manager interviewer was really rude  she started by asking me how old i was  and then interrupted me when i was answering her second question  she also took a really rude tone  so after she asked my the third question  i said that i'm ending it because she asked me my age  interrupted me and was asking me ridiculous questions    she flipped out hard  i got up and started walking out  telling her she needed to tell me where the exit was  she then threatened to call security to escort me out  and called me rude  it was so lolz  i told her that she can call security to escort me out as long as they show me the exit    she then started walking behind me and giving me directions to the exit because i wasn't going to stop walking lol    i was in the back offices of a huge supermarket at the time and kept on walking so the manager was forced to walk behind me and give me directions    it's so funny - these petty mindless asslicking tyrant fucks can't handle it when an interviewee isn't submissive and decides to reject them,dxghyd
259,Work feels like solitary confinement,i work at a low traffic niche store that sells software and shifts are designed to only have one employee working at a time  back when we were allowed to use smartphones i didn't mind the job at all but recently corporate had a strict crackdown and now phone usage is zero tolerance  this has been unbearable for me and other employees because we go two to three hours without seeing another human being or having any stimulus  since there is nothing to actually do when there are no customers i just sit there staring at the wall alone with my thoughts and the deafening silence  it's not so bad the first couple shifts but five days a week and 8 hours a day it really starts to feel like solitary confinement ,dxhnbw

269,I almost quit out of spite,i work at a startup which just opened retail stores  as a supervisor and i am managed by people who worked at lesser retailers but were managers so they continue to hop from job to job doing very little in the way of actual work   i decided to spearhead organizing our offsite inventory area  it was a mess of trash and disorganized inventory which i recently started counting and came up with major discrepancies   today another employee and i put in 3 hours of back breaking work disassembling and reassembling shelves  moving mattresses that weigh up to 160 lbs  shit that they ostensibly had months to do and is actually a better use of payroll than dicking around standing in an empty store   it s not fully done but it s a world better and needs maybe another 3 hours to actually be complete  these two dickheads just came upstairs to see what we did and literally just said what they would have done differently even though they both admitted that it was a ton of work and they wouldn t have done it  i could have murdered them both in that moment but i just made a mental note to never volunteer to do anything for those two ass clowns  last shit i ll ever do besides the bare minimum ,dvo7zr
270,"Work Time, Live Time",anti-wage labour piece from italian left communists     the battle  in which  the proletariat has been engaged for a couple of centuries to shorten the duration of the working day is part of the historical heritage of all humanity  what today is normally considered a trade union claim among many is  in reality  one of the greatest achievements that our species will have to make  the future man will not be content to simply increase the so-called free time  but will eliminate from his own life those activities that most of the species have dedicated for millennia to a tiny fraction of themselves and  in the specific capitalist mode of production  exclusively to the enhancement of capital  not only that  but also the equally inhuman one that man dedicates to the realization of this value  that is to the foolish consumption of goods of all kinds  will be eliminated  therefore the elimination of work time  which today means unemployment  will be a conquest of the proletariat  not only for itself but for the whole human species     the objective prolongation of the working day has today different effects than in the past  it no longer occurs in a backward world where masses of men are torn from the earth and sent to the factory  where it is enough to increase the number of workers and make them work longer to increase surplus value  today the many hours of work are accompanied by the introduction of very modern and scientifically organized production processes  so an enormous amount of surplus value is obtained with double exploitation  absolute and relative  to produce longer and with machines and procedures that increase performance of work  the immediate result is that productive work is increasingly concentrated on a few individuals  while the rest of the population is dedicated to the useless work of immense social waste  or simply remains unemployed   an increasingly high part of the world population is completely  superfluous    and the adjective has nothing to do with chatter about demographic control  in this society overpopulation is  relative  that is  it is a surplus of humanity only in relation to the possibility of capital to use labor power  the ratio between productive workers and unproductive mass is always given in percentage  never in absolute figures of living men on the earth's crust  the question of the balance between the number of men and the space existing on the earth arises on our part according to completely different criteria than those of ecologists or followers of religions  it is not a problem of absolute number or even of the relationship between man on the one hand and nature on the other  but of a global vision that integrates man  and  nature in an inseparable whole  as indeed it has been for millions of years  and how it will still be with the use of greater future knowledge  obviously every exponential growth  ecologists or not  is in contradiction  over time  with any man-nature harmony     in his book  the woman and socialism    bebel recalls the calculations of an austrian economist of the nineteenth century  t  hertzka  who in his book  the laws of social progress    proceeds to a  very exact research  on what was the working energy necessary to maintain the population of austria with the standard of living of the time  the method used is that of calculating large aggregates  average fertility is assumed for the entire cultivated countryside and sufficient food production is obtained by applying capital and labor-power to the land  an average productivity is assumed for the whole industry and the production necessary for the entire population is obtained  on which the work is distributed excluding women  children and the elderly  the result  which is certainly realistic for the data available at the time  is nevertheless surprising for those addicted to the capitalist propaganda of life dedicated to work  every valid man would have to work  an hour and a half a day  for 300 days a year   of course hertzka  who is only a  national economist    as bebel says  and certainly not a communist   also takes into account the voluptuous needs of the most educated people    therefore he adds the production of luxury goods with the related employees  bringing the overall result at  two and a half hours a day    for 750 hours a year  if we compare with the contractual 2 400 of our post-war period or with the current 1 900  we have the real measure of how increasingly the divinization of work in this society is increasingly aberrant  otherwise so unwilling to the divine and rather devoted to the trivial   today the calculation of hertzka would take into account other parameters  given the general better organization of work  the socialization of production and the integration between the productive spheres due to the communications network  then almost irrelevant  above all  it would take into account the fact that this is the era of major state interventions in the social field  for which a certain distribution of labor is already effective  although obviously based on criteria for safeguarding the production of surplus value and social cushioning     in france  the law of 35 hours has been in force since january of this year  it will be from january 2002 for companies with less than 20 employees  but the possibilities to apply a longer timetable are such that in practice this law works more than anything else as a regulation for overtime  but you only pay 10  more than ordinary hours  the law is completely generic  specifies nothing other than the field of application and tax relief for companies  leaving all specific legislation to bargaining between industry and trade unions  it is therefore not surprising that  even before final approval  there were many companies that applied the criteria of the law to come in advance  with 2 418 300 workers already subject to the 35-hour timetable  that is about 30  of all those who they worked in companies with more than 20 employees  it is even less surprising that the first practical effect of the law has been to make the exploitation of the workforce even more flexible through derogations from previous contracts   in germany there have been many reductions in local time  the most notable of which is that of volkswagen  where the time was lowered to 28 hours a week  with a limited salary reduction  that is not proportional to the hours cut  many factories have adopted the 32 hours a week   the figures show that it is one thing to launch a social plan for the generalized reduction in hours  another is to organize the latter within a factory  while the french labor minister states that the 35-hour law has produced 200 000 new jobs for now  volkswagen claims to have saved about 30 000  as you can see  there is a noticeable disproportion  200 000 out of about 26 million french workers   0 76  and 30 000 out of 250 000 workers in the automobile factory   12  this means that the mechanism of time reduction can be better controlled  with respect to the result  within the perimeter of an organized unit such as industry  which is able to scientifically plan the consequences  rather than in the whole capitalist society  by definition anarchic and unpredictable  but above all it means that the industry is able to reabsorb when it wants every reduction of time obtained in exchange for the free hand in terms of  flexibility    amp x200b     source https translate google com translate hl pl amp sl it

292,I’ve been lurking on this subreddit for a few days and this is what I have to say (rant/advice),i am very young  still in college  i will be graduating around spring 2021  and this subreddit has made me think quite a lot about where i want my life to go after graduation  since childhood i have always been artistically minded  loving to sing and dance and write and express myself however i could  i have maintained that mindset to this day  though with college i rarely take the time to hone my skills    and i have known since i was a teenager that i never ever ever ever wanted an  office job   cubicle job   9 to 5  deal  whatever you want to call it  i have said aloud many times that i d rather be a waitress who works on music in her spare time or even homeless than work a desk job    my parents set me up from the beginning that being  successful  was the most important thing in the world and that is what they want from for me  but their idea of success is quite different from mine  they re less strict than the typical parents you d think of  but still prioritized my grades and  success  in classes over everything  while hypocritically at the same time trying to tell me to pursue my singing and writing interests    i have dreams of being a singer  making albums and touring and sharing my music with the world  on top of that i have dreams of writing novels and tv scripts and movie scripts and sharing those with the world too    but guess what  my major is russian  yes  russian  the language  i do like it a lot and am good at it but it has literally nothing to do with my true dreams  i have literally no intention of getting a job in the translator government whatever the fuck russian field  i will not do it  i blatantly refuse  because it s not what i want   no one besides me knows this  but since perusing this sub and seeing how miserable it is to be stuck in this work-all-day system  i have decided i am going to join a commune after graduation  i spent a lot of time yesterday going through many in several states and have bookmarked a few i m interested in for further research  i will do whatever it takes to join one of these and contribute to a community whose goals aren t productivity and profit but rather reconnecting with nature and the natural world around us  with other human beings  taking time to actually breathe and go outside for once in a damn while  it might sound hippy dippy but to me it also sounds like a dream come true    i see myself living on this commune  doing physical labor in exchange for my shelter and just enjoying the sunshine and i have no problem with that  and i m a tiny physically weak girl who s lived in the suburbs nearly her whole life   still  i d rather work on a farm with other individuals than work a desk job  that s how terrified and disgusted i am with the work culture we have   i don t want my life to end up a dead end before it even starts  i see myself living on a commune for maybe about a year  working on the land and then coming inside to write sing make instrumentals cook clean maybe even paint or draw even though i m not very experienced with it  no morning alarms  no commute  no fluorescent lighting replacing sunshine  no meaningless slog  whenever i get bored i can just pick up another hobby interest or go out to the field and work some more  is it going to be utopia  of course not  i don t expect my life to suddenly become perfect  but is it much better than any alternative i can think of  absolutely    here is the site i used to look up communes  https www ic org  i see a lot of people saying they wish they could just pack up one day and leave and i think one way to do that would be to join a commune  easier said than done of course but there are so many options out there and ways to earn money on the commune by working on the farm land or doing other tasks  if anyone reading this finds the idea of joining commune interesting  take some time to go on this site and research ones in your state or even in a state you d like to live in  the site splits up the communes by many many factors so you can narrow your choices down by a lot  keep in mind there are some communes that require membership fees and monthly fees to keep things running so if you re seriously considering this make sure you can scrape together the money if necessary  i myself have to figure out how i m going to do that as well    maybe i m just a naive kid but having these communes bookmarked gives me some sense of hope that i don t have to run my life into the ground and i can take my time for myself and do whatever the hell i want instead of joining the traditional workforce the second i m hot off the college graduation press  i can t see many downsides to joining just for a year or two or even a few months and again maybe that s just my dreams clouding my judgment but i still think it s worth some consideration  hope this helps some of you  thank you for reading my emotional word dump ,dwcaku

297,Ever wonder how a drastic reduction of hours of labor would affect the economy? Look at what the black death did to wages.,the black death sucked  but for those who survived  wages were so good that the people who benefited from the plague are still treated as the very incarnation of evil  villains  a term that once simply described a class of peasants   by killing off a third of europe  the black death acted as a supply shock to the labor market  driving wages up so high the state stepped in to preserve the feudal pyramid    read about it here  https spartacus-educational com u3ahistory8 htm,dx2tqd

330,As a millennial I think the best way to change things is to start doing nothing and start proving them right.,this is the world that they created and want to maintain  not the world we were promised and led into like sheep to a slaughter    boomers want to hoard wealth and housing  let em have it  their time is almost up  they say we whine  are lazy  and need to pick up life by the bootstraps  lets prove them right  who are we fighting to impress  a bunch of people who can't recognize us for our talent and hard work  we're forced to work so someone can live out their dreams and live in luxury    but we have one thing they don't have and that's time and youth  why waste it on a bunch of ungrateful pricks who keep trying to whip us to work harder and faster with no compensation    something tells me things would change real quick if we all simply stopped participating  why destroy our physical and mental health for someone elses benefit  the longer i spend the more i realize how the old prey on the young  they hoard their wealth and brainwash us into thinking we need to buy all of their products and services and buildllshit material  all the while expecting everything for free    i think it's time we live or lives and let the ones creating this fucked up reality  boomers or whoever else  to pick themselves up from their bootstraps  we didn't create this dystopia so there's no reason for us to maintain it  all we need are food and clothes the rest is just filler   sincerely  a pissed off millenial ,dwb8an

332,How do you think hours and wages should change?,after seeing a compensation vs wages chart  which diverged a few decades ago to the point where we should be getting at least 1 5x the amount we do now  and knowing that the logistics of service jobs would make it difficult to change to odd hours  i propose a ratio of two 3 day 4 hour shifts per one 2 day 8 hour shift  that way its still easy to block off the same 5x8 as before while drastically reducing hours to either 16 or 12 weekly  also based on the 1 5 ratio above  companies should be able to afford a 0 45x rate as before for the 12 hr blocks or a 0 6x rate for the 16 hr based on simple math  if the ratios seem too low  you could combine a 12 and 16 for a 28 hour week that pays 1 05x as before   i'd like to know what this sub wants in terms of numbers for this kinda stuff  im expecting some 0s for hours and i support those as well ,dwejy0
333,Capitalism comes with elitism,capitalism breeds elitism which furthers enrich the capitalists and the elites of society  the idea the status and wealth reigns supreme belongs in the trash in the 21st century  take a look at some of the elite scums  they come from wealth  attend a cushy ivy league school and when they graduate they get a high level position in corporation be in a family business or some scumbag business associate  you have many of these scums of society as leaders  they have everything handled to them on a silver patter and they think they deserve to manage you  they handled to them on a silver spatter  handled to them on a silver spatter and will never understand the struggles of the working men and women  this is one of the reason you get an of out of touch  leader  who doesn't give a shit about his her employees   elitism also brings about another set of issues and one of them is the discrimination based on of career choices  jobs such as bankers  c-suites  fund managers  investors and basically all the high level management in a business are seen as the some of greatest jobs you can possibility get  a look at the list and you can see that all of them are bullshit jobs that provides no value to society at all and they are paid absurd amounts of money  most of the essential jobs like janitor  cleaner  construction laborer  teachers  cook  grocery stock worker  etc are deemed low status jobs  but yet without them society can't function and will fall apart when they go on strike  it is sad that everyone in these jobs are treated like shit and looked down upon by the very elites that manages them ,dwribf

364,I hate how work has turned me into such a dishonest person.,i ve been reflecting lately on how goddamn often i lie in workplace settings  when i almost never do in my personal life   i m a grad school student  and i work two jobs  one is a main job and the other is a side gig  i have so many examples  i can t just say  i need a personal day  or   i really need to finish some important schoolwork study  and take the day off  i ll end up lying that i m out of town  working my other job  i m sick  etc  i can t even count how many times over the last 5 or so years i ve said i m sick when i ve been perfectly fine  just because i genuinely needed a day off for whatever reason  i often work 8-7  and obviously  a lot of places  including doctor s offices  aren t open before or after this  once again  i often need to lie to get a standard checkup or get ongoing treatment for my chronic psoriasis  most employers don t see either of these as important whatsoever  but if my psoriasis gets bad enough  i don't want to leave my house   i ve also lied about my availability a lot  because if i didn t  my main job would overwork me into the ground  with no overtime of course  and my grades would suffer accordingly   and then of course there s the lying i do on the clock  i have to be fake af and put on a thick mask when dealing with some parents at my main job  i work with kids in schools  who are often neurotic  rude  unappreciative  and entitled in the extreme  i actively and greatly dislike one of the mothers of the kids i work with and it kills my soul to strap on an artificial smile and cater to her ridiculous demands like they re legit  when i think she s genuinely a crappy person  she s awful to me  awful to school staff  and awful to  most importantly  her son  the director of the company i work for is all about the money and doesn t give a shit about the kids  well-being  every time she informs me of a choice she s made that s clearly motivated by money and somehow screws the kids  i have to pretend like i m fine with it when i m goddamn screaming inside  i do everything in my power to help the kids i work with  but my power is so limited  it s exhausting  i ve realized the reason why i ve gotten so much  better  at jobs over the years is because i ve essentially become an absolute expert actress bullshitter  if there s anything genuinely or  me  on the clock  it s when i m one-on-one with the kids  they re the only ones who get anything real or good  otherwise  i play an incredibly artificial role and i play it well  and i m not proud of that  i m absolutely ashamed   the worst part is that it s inescapable  every job where you re not the boss owner requires this superficiality and sacrificing of one s true self  how people do this happily willingly will never make sense to me  but at least i have this sub  where i know i m not alone in these kinds of feelings and have an outlet  thanks for listening ,dutenu

393,Follow Your Bliss,joseph campbell  when you are a child  when you are young and a young person  you are a camel  the camel gets down on its knees and says   put a load on me  this is obedience  this is receiving the instruction  information that your society knows you must have in order to live a competent life  when the camel is well loaded  he gets up on his feet  struggles to his feet  and runs out into the desert  where he becomes transformed into a lion  the heavier the load  the more powerful the lion  the function of the lion is to kill a dragon  and the name of the dragon is  thou shalt  and on every scale of the dragon there is a  thou shalt  imprinted  some of it comes from 2 000 years  4 000 years ago  some of it comes from yesterday morning s newspaper headline  when the dragon is killed  the lion is transformed into a child  an innocent child living out of its own dynamic  and nietzsche uses the term  ein aus sich rollendes rad  a wheel rolling out of its own center  that s what you become  that is the mature individual   the  thou shalt  is the civilizing force  it turns a human animal into a civilized human being  but the one who has thrown off the  thou shalts  is still a civilized human being  do you see  he has been humanized  you might say  by the  thou shalt  system  so his performance now as a child is not simply childlike at all  he has assimilated the culture and thrown it off as a  thou shalt  but this is the way in any art work  you go to work and study an art  you study the techniques  you study all the rules  and the rules are put upon you by a teacher  then there comes a time of using the rules  not being used by them  do you understand what i m saying  and one way is to follow and i always tell my students  follow your bliss   bill moyers  follow your bliss   joseph campbell  your bliss  where the deep of sense of being in form and going where your body and soul want to go  when you have that feeling  then stay with it and don t let anyone throw you off  have you ever read sinclair lewis s babbitt   bill moyers  not in a long time   joseph campbell  do you remember the last line   i ve never done a thing i wanted to in all my life   bill moyers  quite an admission   joseph campbell  that s the man who never followed his bliss  well  i heard that line  i was living in bronxville when i was teaching at sarah lawrence  before i was married  i used to be eating out in the restaurants of the town for my lunch and dinners  and thursday night was the maid s night off in bronxville  so that all the families were out in the restaurants  and one fine evening  i was in my favorite restaurant there  it was a greek restaurant  and at a table was sitting a father  a mother  and a scrawny little boy here  about 12 years old  and the father says to the boy   drink your orange drink your tomato juice  and the boy says   i don t want to  and the father with a louder voice says   drink your tomato juice  and the mother says   don t make him do what he doesn t want to do  the father looks at her  and he says   he can t go through life doing what he wants to do  said   if he does only what he wants to do  he ll be dead  look at me  i ve never done a thing i wanted to in all my life  i said  my god  babbitt incarnate  and that s the man who never followed his bliss   well  you may have a success in life  but then just think of it  what kind of life was it  what good is it  you ve never done a thing you wanted to in all your life   https billmoyers com content ep-4-joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-sacrifice-and-bliss-audio ,du8dp0
394,Excerpt from The Jungle,all this while that he was seeking for work  there was a dark shadow hanging over jurgis  as if a savage beast were lurking somewhere in the pathway of his life  and he knew it  and yet could not help approaching the place  there are all stages of being out of work in packingtown  and he faced in dread the prospect of reaching the lowest  there is a place that waits for the lowest man--the fertilizer plant   the men would talk about it in awe-stricken whispers  not more than one in ten had ever really tried it  the other nine had contented themselves with hearsay evidence and a peep through the door  there were some things worse than even starving to death  they would ask jurgis if he had worked there yet  and if he meant to  and jurgis would debate the matter with himself  as poor as they were  and making all the sacrifices that they were  would he dare to refuse any sort of work that was offered to him  be it as horrible as ever it could  would he dare to go home and eat bread that had been earned by ona  weak and complaining as she was  knowing that he had been given a chance  and had not had the nerve to take it --and yet he might argue that way with himself all day  and one glimpse into the fertilizer works would send him away again shuddering  he was a man  and he would do his duty  he went and made application--but surely he was not also required to hope for success   the fertilizer works of durham's lay away from the rest of the plant  few visitors ever saw them  and the few who did would come out looking like dante  of whom the peasants declared that he had been into hell  to this part of the yards came all the  tankage  and the waste products of all sorts  here they dried out the bones --and in suffocating cellars where the daylight never came you might see men and women and children bending over whirling machines and sawing bits of bone into all sorts of shapes  breathing their lungs full of the fine dust  and doomed to die  every one of them  within a certain definite time  here they made the blood into albumen  and made other foul-smelling things into things still more foul-smelling  in the corridors and caverns where it was done you might lose yourself as in the great caves of kentucky  in the dust and the steam the electric lights would shine like far-off twinkling stars--red and blue-green and purple stars  according to the color of the mist and the brew from which it came  for the odors of these ghastly charnel houses there may be words in lithuanian  but there are none in english  the person entering would have to summon his courage as for a cold-water plunge  he would go in like a man swimming under water  he would put his handkerchief over his face  and begin to cough and choke  and then  if he were still obstinate  he would find his head beginning to ring  and the veins in his forehead to throb  until finally he would be assailed by an overpowering blast of ammonia fumes  and would turn and run for his life  and come out half-dazed   http www online-literature com upton sinclair jungle 1 ,du3qth

420,What's the worst job you've ever had and why?,i'm not sure if this is the right subreddit  but here goes   i'll start  i managed to land a job earlier this year and was impressed that i even managed to get a job to begin with after having spent 2 years trying to get one  the job sounded pretty decent   i get to maintain this small company's social media accounts and online presence as well as making them have a better rep  cool   but boy was i wrong  i had  some  experience with interviews  since i went to university interviews and assumed that they were more or less the same as job interviews but for different situations  but the interview i had for this job wasn't what i expected since they pretty much told me about the job rather than asking questions  the boss didn't seem interested in me at all   anyway  i somehow managed to get the job and was eager to start since i was  finally  able to get some sort of income as well as getting the all important work experience  it started off okay  i got some training on how to use some software and quickly got the hang of it  that's when it started to go downhill  that was the only  training  i got  being trained in something so stupidly easy like learning how to use new software for the first time  since it was my first job  i wasn't sure if it was normal to get trained on one thing each month  so i stuck with it  i mastered that aspect and got bored quickly  idk if it's because i have adhd or because of how companies work in general  so i asked to get training in other areas  only for the guy training me to sarcastically and bluntly say  it's a workplace  not school   so i spend the next couple of weeks doing nothing but mindlessly uploading content to their crappy website using that software i was  trained  to use  trying to avoid doing it but also not getting caught for slacking at the same time  i ask time and time again if i can get trained in other areas  but the guy who trained me  or was  supposed  to but didn't want to  claims to be extremely busy  which i kind of understood since it was a small business of about 10 people   fast forward to mid august  my boss reappears after mysteriously going away on holiday to another country for about a month and tells me my performance was bad  even though i asked to be trained in things other than uploading things to their site all day long  i get ignored and i get told that i'm underperforming although i did every task that was set  during my time at that  awful  place  i was encouraged to ask for help  so therefore i did  only for the guy who was supposed to train me to say that i needed to understand things better despite the fact that they gave me vague and unclear instructions to begin with  and this is why i'm reluctant to ask for help   all of this  just  to work full time  i worked about 30-35 hours a week  and be paid a measly  3 90 an hour  it was an apprenticeship with a legitimate provider and training was due to start in september  not to mention that  they  cut my hours  first they took off half an hour each day which meant i worked 6 5 hours rather than 7  then they did the same again  which meant i worked 6 hours each day  and reduced my wage from  4 60 hr to  3 90 hr during my first week there for no reason at all  i lasted 6 weeks there  got sacked in the end  but i'm glad to be out of there since i managed to get to go to university instead  and that was pretty much my summer down the drain  but hey at least i got work experience and money  although i've pretty much spent it all on places where i've  had  to spend money  i e  food  rent etc    amp x200b   tl dr - i worked 30-35 hours a week for just over a month this past summer for below the minimum wage  they told me it was an apprenticeship and that training was due to start in september  doing nothing but uploading items to a small company's website and getting sacked for poor performance although i did the best i could  not the best experience for a first job  but i'm guessing first jobs are like that ,duxm3w

473,"How come most of society is so willfully ignorant, does time just beat us into complacency?",i mean  i m a 26 year old male  i got my workers permit at 14-15 and worked ever since  but over these last few years  it kind of hit me harder than ever  the pressure of what the fuck am i doing with my life  one may call it a  quarter life crisis  it s almost as if we are born and forced into a life that almost everything depends on this magical thing called money that spins all of the  developed  world   i feel like almost 80  of jobs are monotonous and repetitive and you have to almost forcefully dumb yourself down to convince yourself you re making an impact   but  like  that impact  for our quote on quote  communities  are people we don t even know  strangers we have no connection to  we evolved in deeply connected tribes where everyone you knew and mattered to you and was a part of your team  even if you didn t like them  now  we all work with strangers  are surrounded by strangers on a daily basis  and it feels like everyone is simply out for their own  to get head  to make more money   i can t seem to see  how older people  who have been in the work force for so long don t stop and think what in the fuck am i doing  my one life  my one existence  i spend half if not more sleeping  working  commuting  preparing for the next day etc  it s like our own lives  where we actually get to love  laugh  create  relax  be human is such a small portion of out actual one existence before we disappear into blackness and nothingness    i ve worked in machine shops  i recently got hired and quit my first day at a factory that made bottle caps  fucking bottle caps  plastic  any free moment i had  i would look up  almost screaming for help internally at all the people who seemed content  satisfied  even proud to be there  a good ol fashioned  hard worker  which to me  seems like an adaptation people had to make in order to live with themselves doing back breaking work for shit pay  literally  the job was working a line  where this machine spit out bottle caps so fast you couldn t see them  and it never stopped  on break  someone had to replace you  you couldn t stop  just bagging boxes  taping them  labeling them  putting them on a pallet  and trying to keep up with the conveyor as the boxes kept filling  i stopped  in the moments i could  looking at my fellow humans  some old  some young just like what the fuck are we doing  we are replaceable robots filling boxes with caps  but unfortunately this type of work is a commonplace for many  so we leave exhausted  to do it again tomorrow  to hardly get by on our bills  only to have a day or two off  to sleep and do it again    so people ask  why are we all on anti depressants  why is mental illness so fucking rampant  why is suicide so sky rocketed  why are there mass shooters  why does everyone look for escaping in drugs and alcohol   i think from this post alone  you know exactly why   how can we be aware of our own demise our own death and spend so much time just trying to simply survive  are people just blissfully ignorant to the system we are apart of   the funny thing is  this is all new  industrialization  is so new  couple hundred generations   for millions of years we existed in a much different way  we are living against our own nature  it is making us sick   and you  reader  me  writer  this is our one life  our one experience on earth  and it s spent stressed  worried  working ourselves exhausted just  to  live   fuck me   can anyone relate ,dst4nw

481,"A conversation about work, wealth, and morality.",so i've been rolling this around in my head a lot lately  and i don't have all that many people in my life that seem willing to consider the idea  i'd like to ask the good people at r antiwork  since we seem to be of similar philosophy   it's probably going to be long  so don't feel bad if you don't read it  if you do read it  i'm honestly looking for your feedback and thoughts on it  and awaaaaaay we go   christopher columbus landed in the americas in the year 1492  so we'll use the last day of that year as a starting point  it has been 192 425 days since that date  if you started working on december 31  1492  and you made 5 000 dollars a day  every day  without a single day off  you'd have  962 125 000 00 usd  to put that in context  if you made 5 grand a day every day for the last 527 years  you'd still be worth less than 1 100th of jeff bezos  you wouldn't even be a billionaire   so it is apparent from that alone  that  work  in the traditional modern sense of the word  is not the way to aquire wealth   so why should we aquire wealth  well  to quote wallace d  wattles    a person develops in mind  soul  and body by making use of things  and society is so organized that man must have money in order to become the possessor of things  therefore  the basis of all advancement must be the science of getting rich  the object of all life is development  and everything that lives have an inalienable right to all the development it is capable of attaining  a person's right to life means to have the free and unrestricted use of all things which may be necessary to his fullest mental  spiritual  and physical unfoldment  or  in other words  his right to be rich   if we are to adhere to this philosophy  from the work  the science of getting rich   which  for this post at least we are going to  then we can infer two things    1  a society that inhibits the acquisition of wealth for the majority of its population also inhibits the mental  spiritual and physical growth of its population  and 2  the penultimate goal for that population should be to aquire as much wealth as possible  among as many people as possible  in order to maximize their own mental  spiritual  and physical growth  because the alternative is to accept a life of controlled mediocrity  enacted by the money making elite   so  at this point  we've established a few points that are important to the conversation  that  working  will not make you rich  that not being rich is an alienation of your potential  that you deserve to be rich and feel all it's benefits  that the system is rigged to keep you from being rich  and acceptance of that system is acceptance of failure to reach your potential   i feel it important at this point to mention  from empirical evidence  that the system is indeed rigged  i know many people my age  late 20's  with college degrees  some are bartenders  some baristas  some carpenters  you want to know the one thing they all have in common  not one of them is using their degree for employment  i know many retirees  who paid their taxes and did their time  and now struggle to stay afloat off of their social security allotments  you know the one thing they all have in common  not one of them has enough money to live their  golden years  in comfort  your degree won't get you a job  and even if it does  your job won't make your retirement comfortable  and one day  you'll be writing a food budget and realize  you wasted it all  they lied to you  and you bought it  and now your life is gone  and they didn't even pay you well enough to retire right  and they got away with it   so this has all been the preamble to the actual subject of the post   to get rich in a 2019 capitalist landscape  it appears that one must sacrifice their sense of right and wrong  good and bad  and look only at one metric  profit and loss  i say this meaning to say  that should you be writing books or making music or acting  you will not meet success until your product or service is one that people will buy  this means that more often than not  the moral standpoint is not the selling point of a person or service  to reference bezos again  look at the working conditions of his warehouses  straight up  unfiltered slavery  and so many people know this  yet so many of us still order frivolities with one day shipping from amazon  the morality of the company is less important than the convenience of its service    as more evidence  watch stock prices when a large company like gm rolls back benefits to it's employees  thousands of people losing health insurance at a job they've worked for decades  obviously a moral deficit  but it makes the company's numbers better  so stock prices invariably rise  wealth being generated by the disenfranchisement of the working class  the economy in action   what this means is  doing the right thing for people is not going to make you rich  doing the right thing for money will  and therein lies the moral ambiguity   i find it of utmost importance to free myself and as many others as i can from the grips of salary slavery  but to do so would be to sacrifice my conscience  the stocks that make money are often not the stocks that hold a moral high ground  the products that sell often encourage the masses to remain small  stay high and drunk and have sex  so they never see the part they're playing in a system working against them  and to top it all off  the goal seems so insurmountable that i often lose hope it can be achieved  and the only motivation i've found that has any real staying power  is greed    my greed tells me to win  no matter the cost  lives might be ruined  but others will be saved  it tells me the only way to win is to play the game  that the only way to make an omelette is to break some eggs    but we're not talking about eggs  we're talking about human suffering in countries around the world  where the poor get poorer as the rich get richer  but to really enact change  i first must become unimaginably wealthy  but to become unimaginably wealthy  i must first play part in the game that so direly needs to change  and no matter the motivation  those who have not been fortunate enough to be guided by a burning and undying greed  they will hate me    this all comes up because i see a path now  i know how to do it  develop products and services that people will buy  invest in stocks that make money  innovate with ideas  make my money make money  and do all of this without any regard for others  as long as i'm looking at that one  all important metric  profit and loss  and it can be done  by any of us  all we have to do is develop products that will sell  sell them  invest the money  rinse and repeat  regardless of your current condition or circumstance  you can do it too  find a gap in a market  fill it  reinvest  in that formula lies the potential for exponential growth   but it also means investing in companies that profit off of  tragedy  the ones who make money on cancer  the ones who experience growth after mass shootings  the ones who steal healthcare from employees and guard their bottom line before anything else  the system is inherently evil  and regardless of the motivation  doesn't knowingly playing part in it make one evil as well   if you're still here  i really appreciate your time and i'd love to hear your thoughts  tell me what i'm missing  fill in my blind spots  i've found myself a moral paradox that i can't seem to unravel on my own power ,drp66s

495,Then and now: your boss and you,from a book i'm reading on  modern  project management practices    historically  the rules were simple  your boss made assignments  you carried them out  questioning you're assignment was a sign of insubordination or incompetence    but these rules have changed  today your boss may generate ideas but your assess how to implement them  you confirm that a project meets your boss's needs and then you determine the work  schedules  and resources you require to implement them      i've seen this so many times in practice  heavy exploitation disguised under  empowerment  not only you're doing your work  but you typically do what should be your boss's work  you make sure the project meets your boss's needs  you plan it  you execute it  you evaluate it  you report on it    and what does your boss do in the meantime  plays with his her balls behind the desk   generate ideas  this bestselling book says  oh how fucking noble    don't get me wrong  empowerment is great if marthed accordingly by a higher salary  but the evidence points out to the contrary  wage gaps between management and everyone else rising dramatically  while bosses working less and workers working more    my point is  be very aware of  empowerment  where your boss takes advantage of you and makes you do their work  don't get psychologically manipulated into believing that you're given that work because your good and only if you work hard enough you'll be the boss  fuck that  know your worth ,dse342

549,Expensive and time-consuming commutes should be paid for by the company.,hi everyone  antiwork lurker  first time poster  i m sitting on my train to work right now feeling bitter and resentful about my commute  so i thought i d get this off my chest and see how everyone here feels about it  i work in new york city and take the metro north train into work everyday  i ve been doing it for this job for about a year  i can t afford to live in nyc because it s too expensive  but that is where my job is  so i live upstate  i spend about 5 hours per day commuting   2 5 hours each way  first i have to drive 15 minutes to the train station  gas money  then i have to park  3 50 per day parking fee  then i take the train  475 per month  then i walk a mile to my job from grand central to avoid the  130 monthly metrocard for the subway  i leave my house at 6 30 am and am at my desk at 9 00 am  i am exhausted before the day even begins  i don t have time to do anything  i get home at 8 pm and just want to lay down  no time for exercise  no time for dating  no energy or motivation to care about basic household chores or shopping  i just want to sleep  and i am broke  i am single and have to do everything myself  this commute takes up so much of my day and a huge part of my paycheck  it s not even cheap to live upstate  my rent is  1050 per month for a studio  i ve been at my job for almost a year now so i was hoping for a good raise   but i heard from coworkers that all i can expect is 2  which equates to about an extra  15 per week  wow  that just helps me break even because my health insurance is going up and i m sure my rent will increase when my lease ends too  i feel so trapped and don t know what to do  i m seriously considering looking for a new job and quitting  this makes me sad because i actually did like the job itself  but it s so hard to feel like it s worth the effort when all i do is stress about money and whether or not i can afford the transportation to get to my job  imagine if the company reimbursed me for the train ticket and also paid me for the time spent traveling  i would want to stay with this company forever  for context  this is a very very successful company  not a small struggling business by any means  so  i just feel angry and helpless  what should i do ,drhchz

552,My boss hasn't had her period in months and I work AND live with my girlfriend but never see her., long post   i am lucky enough to work in a family-owned moving and storage company  i love all the people i work with and i love what i do  but because it is a family owned business  we're all kind of expected to do extra  i'm all about going the extra mile  i'll come in for an hour or two on my day off every once in a while if i know its busy  but we all work at least 10 hours a day  7 15-5 15  and i like my time off  as i have a house  a girlfriend  two cats  and our families to take care of spend time with  etc   as i said in the title  my girlfriend also works at the office with us  but she runs the office and i go out on estimates  so i really dont spend any time with her  and getting the same day off is very rare  and when we do we have to tend to all the other things i listed off  we also live  30 minutes away from work and get home at the earliest around 5 45-6  because we have to be up at 6am to go to work  we like to be in bed for 9  so that gives us at most 3 hours to    cook and eat shower clean the house feed tend to the cats work out brush teeth get ready for bed  i dont know about you  but it's very hard to do all those things in 3 hours  also please note no where did i mention actually doing shit we want to do  so a lot of times we have to choose  usually it's the house and working out that take the back seat  also my family and hers are always asking why we dont come around often or stay that long and we're like we have to fucking live too  can i just lie in bed with the person i love and watch a goddamn movie   now taking a look at my boss - we have actually grown very close and i strive to be like her  as she is extremely good at what she does and i admire her work ethic  for the most part  she doesnt take days off  like ever  she works probably a minimum of 11 hours a day and works every sunday  we're not even open on sundays fam  shes taken maybe 6 days off in the past 2 years and she told me about 6 or 7 months ago that her period was late and she thought she was pregnant    we were both excited for her until she took several prego tests that came up negative  girl's been working herself so hard and stretching herself so thin that she doesnt get her period  i didnt even know that can fucking happen  she said this happened a couple of years ago too  now shes been going to acupuncture therapy just so she can have her goddamn period again   i started to feel like  well i've been working my way up in the company and i want to get to where she is someday so i should be doing more  i started coming in on all my days off at least for a couple hours  and i've taken to eating my lunch  a sad little turkey wrap  at my desk so i dont have to stop working  i was thinking it's all for the good of the company and itll pay off down the line  but looking at her and seeing how my life is going  i'm afraid i'll end up like that too and i dont want to just live  if that's what you can call it  to work   is anyone else in this kind of bind  like i don't mind doing a little more because i like where i work and it's not like in a corporate setting where you're just a cog in the machine  theres 8 of us that work at the office and we all play a very important part  so i have really been an actual influence in the company  and we've been growing - actually opened up a new storage facility last year and we're almost full  i want to make sure i'm doing the best i can  but i dont want to kill myself over it  i dont know if when what i'm doing will be enough ,dqja6a

582,Rant.,so i know this dude   yesterday  i asked the dude  what'd you do if you won the lottery   note  the guy gets a boner when his manager shakes his hand  so you know what kinda person i'm talking about    he went  oh man that would be awesome i'd buy a nice car and a nice house    nice  i replied  how would you quit work    i wouldn't quit work  i'd keep working  and whenever i'm on vacation i would go to nice places   i was shook   you'd keep working  fucking why   he hesitated  before going  idk man that's all i've been doing for the past decade idk what else i would do   btw he's not like a doctor or something  hes got a standart office garbage job   this is what happens when people are succesfully  indoctrinated to the maximum  they literally don't exist  as i kept talking to the guy i realized there is no guy  there is no person i am talking to  it's just a drone    so i went  dude if i'd win the lottery i wouldn't even call work  i'd just get the check and fuck off to the caribbean and roast in the sun while planning my next steps  i wouldn't even waste half a thought about work  i wouldn't even bother emptying my flat i'd just be on my way lol   he looked at me  obviously offended as fuck and just said  haha  ye    after that has very short with his answers and clearly didn't want to be around me anymore  his whole persona was being threatened and it seems like he couldn't handle it  he seemed to become aggressive even    few days later i went out walking in the woods with a girl i was dating  she was a total fucking bore  no hobbies  no interests  all she cared about was relationships and her future   saving up to buy this and then i may get a better car in case i got kids blablabla   i asked her the same question  about the lottery  and got the same exact answer  she'd also keep going to work    am i weird for finding this terrifying and insane  even if they had utter freedom in form of a gigantic money supply  their minds are so broken that they lost any form of autonomy and free will   like a caged bird that forgot  or lost the will to fly basically    in a way  i pity them  in another way  i envy them  they don't contemplate life  they just walk around doing shit  they don't feel cheated  they look up to the authorities  see them as superior overlords who  surely know what they're doing  they are experts after all    while i go home depressed  fuck man people own me and i'm like cattle  and walk around angry and bitter  i don't get it ,drtyef

610,The extent of brainwashing,should i just give up  today i had a chat with my mother about post graduation plans  and it s been making me feel worse than i ve already been feeling   firstly  a bit of background for myself  family wise  i come from a lower middle-class neighborhood with nigerian immigrant parents   income-wise  my father is muddle class as a self employed attorney  and my mother is very much working class as a permanent substitute teacher and part-time retail associate  i m a  minority   black  though i don t like thinking about people in such arbitrary and useless classifications   my father is a abusive man  both physically and mentally  to practically everyone he meets  myself and my sister were typically subject to beatings and insults whenever we didn t behave in a way that he found acceptable  and he sometimes had huge arguments with my mother  my mother used to join him in his abuse  though in a lighter scale  but ever since an incident  long story short  mother had a medical hernia bill that needed to be paid  father started getting angry that she didn t get a job with health insurance for the family  he s self employed so he didn t have insurance  he then started talking down to my mother for making a pitiful wage as a substitute teacher  to which my mom replied that she spent most of her years as a stay at home mom making sure that the house was in order  my father s nightly meals were cooked  and that the children were looked after  the argument ended with my father threatening a divorce  this happened 8 years ago  to this day  he s still in this house because he doesn t want to go through the financial hell that divorce courts would put him through  so he simply moved to another room in the house  my mother started putting her focus more on her children and basically started being a lot more supportive of me and my sister  especially me  since feels that i m impacted the worst by my father  though she stills has her quirks inherited from her culture  like expecting me to say good morning to him even though my father and i have not been on speaking terms since i was 16  due to another incident  she herself still greets my father despite their separated status  i now have a decent  positively leaning relationship with my mother  though i m eternally frustrated at the fact that she can t see what i believe i see   school wise  im now in the final year of university  majoring in music  the problems with the education system itself make this barely tolerable  but honestly  i went to college because of high school propaganda and parental pressure  18 year old me practically believed that the world would end if he didn t go to college  not realizing my mistake  i don t know how i did this  considering i really went through a lot of hell just to graduate high school  anti-authoritarianism started manifesting within me  skipping classes  having to be sent to counselors for  oppositional defiant disorder  or whatever  etc  rowdy students that tend to be a feature of disadvantaged communities  etc  back in high school  i was kept sane by my feelings of belonging to a music group  among others  as well as my blindness to how the world worked    throughout my college years i  by means of continuously growing daily bullshit  was more or less forced to see our society for the absolute mess that it is  for the first two years  i went to community college  now normally  i should be debt free  but of course  my naive younger self took on debt to try and cover the costs of self-publishing a book that i wanted to write   because of that and university tuition dorming costs  i will graduate with a debt of around 35k  my goal back then was to make a lot of money  though i m not sure i truly understood why  even back then  i utterly despised the educational system  it s one of the traits of my novel s protagonist  though back then i only thought about the restrictive feeling of school  and i wasn t as acutely aware of the economic system that practically needed school to work  capitalism  however back then  i was alarmingly materialistic  my plans were to become a super rich author and buy cars and jet planes and such things  i wasn t quite aware why i wanted these things  because clearly they re far beyond what i valued now  though now i believe that my past materialism   as well as people s current materialism  is because of the social respect associated with having things  being the analytical person i am  i feel like i can understand why  with the soul crushing 5 day 40 hour work week  my mother sporadically works depending on what her two jobs demand  and my father typically works 12 hours 6 days a week  we can t settle for social fulfillment by being things  hobbies  talents  so we have to settle for having things  and an entire culture of materialism grew from that  i suppose  interestingly  my plans towards owning the expensive vehicles were mostly to just pilot drive them on my own  which kind of makes me realize that at the very least  my will to pilot planes is genuine  though now i can think of better ways to achieve this    everything thing changed when i transferred to university  some top ranked state school in ny  i felt completely alienated from the people around me  i felt like they grew up in lives and backgrounds that i could never begin to understand  of course  it doesn t help that i ve been encountering rich chinese students every now and then with their fancy clothes and cars while other people worldwide are struggling  i m in school because belief that i need it for a better future  and they re practically here for fun  don t ask me how anyone could see school as fun  but i guess that when you grow up with a lot of money  you can find a way to make anything fun  i suppose  i don t have any friends here to this day  it feels like every day here  some new thing would bring me in a worse mood and i would be continuously and endlessly trying to analyze why  much analyzing and an existential crisis and depression later  i deduced that all the problems that i feel exist in my life can be traced back to capitalism  eventually  as i started to think about my future  i started regretting choices that i wasn t aware that i made when i was fourteen  i started regretting not being a top student since 14 so that i could get a scholarship to go to an aviation college so that i wouldn t have to suffer more after graduation  i started feeling guilty for daring to try and find peace in my rough childhood with video games and music as my hobbies  instead of studying to get good grades  i think about my future life and i realize that there s not hope for me since there s now that many jobs that i d be willing to do  currently  my goal is to be an airline pilot  one of the few jobs that i believe i could enjoy  or at least tolerate  but there s a massive barrier to entry in the form of 80-100k for training  the only way i can make the money needed for that is to have an income from a corporate job  that s all i imagine i can do  given my useless major  though i feel better when i remind myself that most computer science jobs are still corporate helljobs  so that i can have a high enough income for the loan or paying it directly  however  assuming that the cards are right  that i can live with my parents rent free  as long as my mother is present my father won t do anything to me  though as part of my father retirement plan he wants to sell the house after my sister s graduation in two years so i ll have to figure out housing by then  i might still have to live with my mother  but knowing that my mother will be strained to afford an apartment by herself  we live in the ny metropolitan area  i would probably have to contribute to rent  supporting my mother as a concept doesn t bother me  but having to extend my time in the corporate world would  i would be in a corporate hellscape for at least two years  i ve realized that corporate culture is an extension of everything i despise about college  whose real purpose is to make you a corporate drone  in college  unfettered liberalism is rampant  note that i don t support either  liberals   conservatives  or any political leanings for the most post  i tend to imagine an anarcho-communist society  but their terms are still useful for outlining my frustrations  liberals are typically middle class or higher people  like the demographics of my school  who seem to pretend to care about social progress  but will never do anything to address the underlying issue  in the fear of it uprooting their content lifestyle   as an analogy  think of it like how psychiatry and therapy treats the symptoms of depression  but not the root  which is our broken society  they will talk about the environment  but not point the blame to the capitalist system that causes environmental damage  they will talk about oppressed immigrants  but not talk about the fact that we live in a world that necessitates people being in worse off conditions  they live in some fantasy world  and seem to pride themselves with adopting corporate doublespeak  best practices  work as  family  etc  to be honest  i pity them   now today  i just got back from a dental operation  which was needed because i put off needed dental care for too long  3 years  which happened because of my fear of getting into more debt  the tooth now requires an extraction  i ve been in a lot of pain right now  i m wondering if my gum abscess will spread to the rest of my body and kill me  i m on antibiotics  but still  and i can t stop myself from feeling like there is absolutely no hope of things getting better  either for myself or the world  this whole experience has taught me that if i don t develop an obsession towards making money soon  i ll have to waste my days eroding the remainder of my soul making corporate dollars if i ever hope to become a pilot  one of the few jobs is be willing to do in this broken world  plan b  if i m medically incapable of being a pilot or if i can t take shit anymore  is getting out of this wicked country to tefl somewhere else  i would have considered being a music teacher  and in a perfect world  i wouldn t mind something like that at all  minus the authorial educational system part  but that requires grad school  and i really don t want to go through that   i was talking with my mother about graduation  and she went on ad gave the drivel about how a college degree will guarantee that you re never poor as long as you  make the degree work for you  you know  i really have to wonder how an immigrant who has strong ties to her own hone culture can be so caught up in american propaganda  this is a woman who seems to base her entire life on what other people tell her  regardless if it s truly right for her or not  she got into huge debt to have a us masters degree in esl  simply because her cousin told her it would be a good idea  the school  my former high school  that she s been working in as a permanent sub refuses to make her anything more than a permanent sub  my mother suspects racism in the hiring practices  which i m inclined to believe is a valid reason  the school  despite typically being 99  blacks and hispanics  apparently refuses to hire or promote anyone who isn t black or hispanic  or rather  that at the least  it rarely happens  she got her degree 7 years ago  so i suspect that she s no longer fresh in the job market  she didn t take a teaching position in maryland after graduation because she wanted to make sure she was near myself and my sister  and had she moved away  my father would have definitely uprooted our lives  she s also in her mid fifties  so i m inclined to believe that it s too late for her to have any chance with another school  and i m pretty sure that my high school knows this  which means they know that she seriously can t challenge them lest she damages her remaining livelyhood  she s also still working after school at retail   tldr  feeling untold dread and hopelessness   wondering how people around me don t see anything is wrong  and have no clue if there is no real escape for myself or other people   my apologies for the very long post  i typically aim to be as concise as possible for people to understand things more easily  thank you for reading ,dqdevs
