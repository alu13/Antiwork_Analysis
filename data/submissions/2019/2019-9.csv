3,"Well, I think I’m ready to say fuck it","
Call center job (though I am privileged to work from home as the last month) with quotas that put your job performance in the hands of others depending on if they comply with scheduling workers comp appointments..
If I don’t schedule X amount of people and work Y cases I am penalized for lack of performance. Kicker is that you can work a significant amount of cases and schedule less that a half of them. It’s dependent of if you can reach the patient, if they are willing to schedule, and a bunch of other factors like state laws. Not to mention the network loses connection so that interferes with performance. It’s just shitty.
In regards to my job, I feel like that guy from office space. I’ve been working there as my first full time job for the last year and I feel like I’m just dead inside because of it. I thought that it was the long commute wearing me down. It is actually fact that the job is a boring day after fucking day same pile of shitty work.
So, I think I’m just done. It’s boring, not intellectually stimulating AT ALL, I am stuck at a desk for 8hrs a day, the security I have is a regular (and decent) paycheck and health insurance.
I am young, smart, and well-appearing human. I feel that I am resourceful enough to make money in other ways. My boyfriend advised I can always hop on his health insurance. We’ve been together 6 years now and I’m pretty sure the only reason we aren’t engaged is due to that we have been getting out of debt for the last 2 years while also spending more than we should on little things here and there. 
Anyway,
I believe my bills are minimal enough that I could make due until November. All of my October bills are paid. 
I know I could call my creditors and let them know if I needed extension days for later in November for bills at the beginning of the month.
I live in a nice middle-upper middle class area where being a nanny and grocery delivery service person is possible.
I’ve applied back w my old part time position as well due to that the work I had there was at least bearable, though low wage.

6,Nobody should have to come to work sick.,"I'm sick. Like real sick. There's been a flu going around the farm for a week or so and it finally got me. I'm not upset with my coworkers, they need money, too. I'm angry that only a few higher ups have PTO. I'm also angry that the farm owner is also landlord to most of us. I work ten hour days just to give a significant portion of my paycheck back to this guy every month. 

I'm also upset, scratch that, I'm pissed off at the level of guilt tripping that happens any time someone can't be at work. It's an established fact that I go above and beyond to pick up other folk's slack. My bosses joke about it all the time. That sucks. Watching people who make more money than me slack off and bask in the bounty of my labor is bad for me in every way. I haven't been sleeping or eating well for months, and I weigh significantly less than I usually do. My body isn't healthy and this illness is kicking my ass. In spite of all of this, one of the guys who does have PTO made me feel like absolute shit for leaving this morning. He knows how hard I work. He knows my body isn't healthy because of the job. Still, he had to make me feel like shit after our boss told me to go home. I'm still working from home (spreadsheets for seeding, cultivation, and harvest). I'm working from home while sick, already not getting paid for two days this week, and on top of it all I feel like I'm about to have a panic attack because I don't want my team to think that I'm ""lazy"" or ""wimpy"".

I am amazing at my job. I don't deserve to be put in this situation. I don't deserve to feel this way about myself.

14,Am I missing something in this Labour proposal for a 4 day work week? Throwing this out there.,"CROSSPOST: In this Forbes article, a Labour guy drops some interesting fine print in the Labour Party proposal for a 4 day work week: businesses are expected to increase productivity of labor first. 

As the article puts it:

&gt;The implementation of McDonnell’s plan will depend on companies successfully automating processes and improving worker productivity...

In other words, the Labour Party is promising that after workers have been rendered redundant by improvements in the productivity of labor, the party will allow a modest reduction of hours to four days. 

But no promise appears forthcoming on converting the increased productivity of the last 90 years into free time!

Do I have this right?

So if you are so sick that you can't leave the house it's an unexcused absence. At the doctors office you have to wait 2 hours till you can see a doctor, and while you're waiting you're catching all the germs from other sick people in the waiting room that also want their sickness certificate. Sometimes I think if you're healthy enough to go through that ordeal you might as well show up to work and make everyone sick out of spite. Because I've been at my workplace for less than three months, all sick days are unpaid.

I am in a small agency and our IT department is just me and two other guys.  The IT director and the network admin.  Two years ago, they changed my job role and expected me to just know this network shit when my background is data analytics and software support.  The admin began my new boss and this guy went to town uses his new found powers against me.  He would get pissed if I asked him for help on what felt like a very simple thing to him and take it out on me by writing me up if I made one small mistake.

Even worse,  I now have to submit an hour by hour log report showing that I am constantly busy.  Problem is the role has 90% downtime and they are like that's not our problem, figure out on your own how to contribute.  I'm a very shy person so getting out among the people and forging my own path is terrifying.  I feel I only have one card to play.  Convince HR that my job isn't needed and lay me off.  The anxiety over not having a clear job role plus working under this asshole boss has me constantly having panic attacks at work and calling in sick more and more.

However, 90 days into this new job and I feel as if I'm slipping deeper and deeper every single day and I can't stop it. Every night becomes a little bit more excruciating and every morning I have to ask myself why I'm still bothering to wake up. 

I'm honestly not sure what to do, I'm at a loss. Unfortunately, I need to leave the state ASAP for numerous personal reasons as well as a strong dislike for it in general, so I need at least another four months of steady income to make it to the marker where I can leave finally. While there is a definite end goal (February of 2020), I'm becoming increasingly concerned that I'm not going to make it there. The ultimate idea is to hop to Alaska for a year or two then finally leave the country, but Alaska needs to be the first step and I'm at the earliest of steps with barely anything in my savings. I'm not sure I can endure another five months of this if the downward trend keeps going

1. My boss leaves  earlier than I do. I still sign out at 5, but from 4 to 5, I don't work. Why would work a full day when he doesn't?

49,Is this abusive? (Boss and culture),"Joined a pretty awesome startup this past spring. Went through the whole interview and exercise process. I really liked the team (a bunch of chill dudes) and I felt really optimistic. Good benefits, pay, cool company mission, Opportunity to build a great portfolio.

They were looking to hire someone above me and I recommended my friend. Helped her throughout the whole interview process and her English describing each project  and told her that they appreciate personality here and to show more of it. She took my cues. She had experienced for working at really large corporations and I had more startup experience.

Pressure to launch a bunch of projects follow down the line. I'm handling more than 5 projects a week , along with random fire drills. My anxiety is through the roof and I'm not taking care of myself. Can't sleep, take my work home and work until 12am only to find I have to change everything the next day. 

She reprimanded me for my performance and wrote all the places I can improve and where I made mistakes and asked if she sees why I am frustrated. Said she didn't realize my skillset was so junior and I have an attitude issue. Wasn't going to be emotional (cue for dissolution of our friendship). I told her I'm afraid to ask her for help because she usually says figure it out, sighs, rolls her eyes, and says I shouldn't need to ask her to repeat the feedback. There's a lot more but trying to stay general.

She gives feedback like my work is bad, doesn't like the shape of something, asks, do you see why I'm frustrated? Does this look like a perfect circle to you? Does this look like a designer with skill and knowledge would make this?

I started to go nuts when last Friday she said I'm really disappointed in you, I feel like I'm working with a college freshman. I feel like you don't take this seriously.

My insecurity issues are triggered and I'm scared to go to work everyday. I can't even look her in the eye because of how bad I feel about myself I just take feedback and stare at the screen. I try not to dip the tone and cadence of my voice and remain positive. I'm just nxious all the time and don't fully recover until Monday, only to be in the cycle all over again.

I didn't realize how depressed I've gotten. My body is withering away and I used to be quite fit. I'm too exhausted to participate in life. I just go home in the suburbs and don't even spend time in my apartment because the stress of living in a city is getting to me.

I feel a little hopeless and very insecure and have heightened imposter syndrome. I see her chummy with the boss and everyone else right in front of me but when she deals with me she sighs and seems like she doesn't want to deal with me. Also cut me out of meetings because she says I'm forgetting things or I'm too slow on my other work to be in the meetings. I'm feeling weeded out.

I'm not looking to compete with her or play this stupid game. I just want to live a happy life. I have considered quitting and moving back home if talking to my boss's boss doesn't work out.",False,db2epz,charandom,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/db2epz/is_this_abusive_boss_and_culture/,35,17

For a place like North Korea, their slave owner decided to own everything in the country and separate themselves so they can keep control.

But for the United states, they found that a distasteful way of owning people.  The better way is to setup lots of financial traps for people to fall into.  Leave them uneducated then offer them a lifelong salvery debt agreement to pay for their education.

The United states strategy by comparison is almost more devious because they get their own citizens to root for the enslavement of each other, to push the rest of people off the cliff of stability so their is more room for themselves.  We think we are suppose to be mean and financially cutthroat just to survive.  We are being molded into mean little slaves that knock the legs out from under each other until finally we gladly accept our place as a lesser race to the people in charge(the banks and the rich).",False,dbc0ct,Garowen,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/dbc0ct/whats_the_deal/,5,13

59,“What are you doing this weekend...,"aside from working?” 

My supervisor just asked me this as a, not so subtle, way of informing me of a mandatory overtime shift this Saturday. It’s his way of making light of a pretty common occurrence at the manufacturing plant I work at. But every time he asks, it just pisses me the fuck off. It doesn’t matter what plans I may have made or what I want to do this weekend, because you just cancelled it.

But that doesn’t matter to him, he’s put all his eggs in one basket. Him and his wife both work here, he’s spent most of his adult life at this one factory. His previous wife worked here too! Guy is here 10-12 hours every day 6-7 days a week, on salary. Basically giving his life away for free. 

 Every new hire and veteran employee are all “crud” in his eyes. So he martyrs himself for the good of the company, then complains constantly. Dude is just a toxic ball of negativity. But he knows that if he keeps working hard, he’ll one day fulfill his dream of rising from the rank of supervisor and become a “MANAGER”. That is his DREAM. Sounds like a goddamn nightmare to me.  

Even more frustrating is that I share an office with him, and am do for a promotion into a salaried “supervisor” title soon. The more I think about it, the more I don’t want that. I see him, and I worry for my future. Scared that if I stay at this place I’ll end up like him.

64,I'll never forget an experience I had about 5 or 6 years ago,"I was with a good friend of mine at the time and some of his friends. They were all in university, talking about their experience in university and how it might relate to ""real world"" workforce experience. 

Back then, I was a student too, but a struggling one. I was to university on and off again, lacking any real motivation to see many of my classes to their conclusion. My mind was awash with uncertainty that graduating and getting the opportunity to get a cushy ""career"" might not be the end all fulfilling experience that I was expected to believe

In the conversation, one of the guys said this:

""If you think school is bad, just wait until you're actually start working.""

Everyone there seemed to dishearteningly nod their heads in agreement, inferring ""yes, that does suck"", but no one in the group, even for a moment, questioned how absurd it was to spend the huge investment of time, money, and effort to graduate college or university only to set yourself up with a position that's even more miserable than the one you left. 

The conversation quickly moved elsewhere while I sat in thought for a few moments longer, realizing my fears had more validity than I thought.

We're all so used to the idea of the 9-5 work week, slaving away your whole life at an incredibly dull and unrewarding job for a modest sum of money that we never question it? We're all so ready to unquestionably believe that this paradigm forced into us is the only meaningful and honest way to life a rewarding life?

I know compared to some of the posts on here this one sounds pretty mundane, but even this small experience of mine has had a big impact on my life. Since then I've tried to distance myself as much as I possibly can from that kind of thinking while focusing much more on understanding who I truly am, and the parts of myself and my life that genuinely fulfill me. Even if I'm still a million miles away from the person I would like to be, I finally feel like I know who I am and what I want out of life.",False,d8so3e,alfalfalaffa,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/d8so3e/ill_never_forget_an_experience_i_had_about_5_or_6/,2,31

I did not give a concrete reason in my resignation letter but people kept asking so I made up the excuse of ""pursuing grad studies"". But the questions did not stop there. People asked me what specifically that I would study, and I was so tired to continue the bullshit. Told them that nothing is confirmed yet and I am in the planning stage.

At this point I just want everyone to stop asking me questions. I have 3 events to handle and every day I die once inside. 

I never thought that leaving would be so difficult as well.

I surely wouldn't miss my open office environment. Even sounds trigger me. The sound of Boss #1 shuffling his feet. He's always rushing somewhere and asking for things to be done urgently. 

The sound of Boss #2  pen-clicking when he nervously walks around. He is a ball of stress mainly because he is incompetent, doesn't speak human language and therefore can't get things done on time. 

I can tell that Boss #3 is coming to check on task no. 1571 that needs to be done when I hear her heels clicking from far.

&amp;#x200B;

If I never rang up this place to confirm just what is going on (because nobody rang me back for over a week and a half - despite my efforts)  I would never have known that I am due to start my first shift soon!

I have another job and may have to cancel shifts there - because nobody from my new workplace took charge to ring me up and tell me when I will be starting.

I have asked for a certain number of shifts and a certain pattern, which they said they definitely could provide/honour.

I now find out that I will be working \*over\* the amount of hours I asked for, and not in the pattern I asked for. Just ""temporarily"", that is.

This is not a very good first impression for me at all.

I will give them a chance within the time-frame of my probation period. If they still are this disorganised and I am still working over the amount of hours they promised me, I will just leave.

I didn’t know what I wanted to be when I grew up and during my high school career and my parents always implied that me going to college is a long shot since they couldn’t afford it at the time so I never focused on my grades. 

Summer of 2016 my dad got me a job as an oilfield truck driver for some company I never wanna see again. 40+ hours a week, 24 hour call including weekends, working with with people who smoked cigarettes every 15 minutes, I’d come home smelling like cigarettes, oil, covered in cement dust, it was the worst. I hurt my back, my tooth chipped because of the bad diet I had on the road, burnt my arm and my left side of my torso with acid, and cut the skin of my jaw open with a grinder when I was helping a welder, and ALL this was for $13.50 to $14.50 an hour. To top it off the although these people were nice but the constant bullying because I was soft and mild racism made it even more miserable I was NOT happy and was basically going insane just force laughing at jokes and pretending to listen to conversations since I couldn’t ignore these people and only to go home to do it all over again.

I quit that job only to go to another oil field job as a pulling unit hand this summer of 2019. $16 an hour, guaranteed weekends and no 24 hour call but it was WAY worse. My first week I had heat exhaustion, my body was SORE and my hand joints were crippled the whole summer. I had to share a motel room with my coworker bcuz we had to work 3 1/2 hours away from home. We averaged 50-60hours a week(one time we got 42 hours in 3 days)  don’t even get a proper lunch break and when we were done i still had to eat dinner with them and head back to the motel. The weekend was never long enough to recover. I had to see these people every minute of the day and I hated it.

After my first year in the oilfield I decided to go to college in 2017 but even with the money I made that one year and a summer of 2018 I couldn’t afford my third semester of 2018. The summer job I had this year was supposed put me back in school but after ALL that I was still several thousands of dollars off.

I figured out that it didn’t matter how hard I worked in that amount of time it wasn’t enough to pay for school. I can’t stress enough how miserable I was and how many times I’ve cried this summer and the past couple years I worked with the other company, seeing my savings disappear and having every check go towards to in-state tuition, I just didn’t want to live anymore, at least the way that I did then.

My parents ended up owning an embroidery and we’ve been living in a nice area a little outside of town for about a year now they saw and understand my misery as well as my dad working in pipeline and oilfield for almost 15 years, but they’re still pressuring me make something of myself. Currently I’ve been unemployed for about a month “looking” for a job since I couldn’t go back to school but other than the debt I still hold I never felt so relieved. I’m gonna try to look for work but I’m definitely getting a part time job or an easy low paying job. Capitalism just isn’t worth killing myself for an education or ANYTHING at least the way that I had to do it. 

I understand I’ve made my mistakes during high school but seeing the uncertainty of my future along with not knowing what I wanted to be i didn’t have any incentive to thrive knowing well that I was taking advanced classes and could’ve been top ten percent. I wanna study something I like but the suffering it took just to get there and as well as it not being enough to pay for my tuition or even my to support myself I’d rather take this time to act at a slower pace.

99,Boss told us to work even harder 'for the sake of the company'. I am so FED UP.,"I thought I'd share with you here my work story because you'd understand.

About a year ago, I accepted job that was offered to me in a startup. Looked quite great at the beginning. Great people, the boss seemed nice and it was really close to where I lived.

It is turning to hell. I love my coworkers and they've became good friends and they are the only reason motivating me to go to work every morning. 

The boss is an absolute nightmare to work with. He seems friendly but he's horrible in the workplace. Everything a boss shouldn't do work related, he'd do it. Slowly, I started getting more and more stressed because of it.

Recently, the startup is going through some BIG financial problems. Our salary is late almost every month (yey the stress for the bills!). Last week, he told us in a general meeting that he doesn't know when this month's salary will be paid (we knew already dude, it's been going on for months) and that **he was asking us to work even harder** to try and close some deals.

HELL NO! I haven't been sleeping correctly for months and the last two weeks were a nightmare because I am trying to support my family financially so I am NOT doing additionnal hours (not paid, because we're a startup, everyone knows we all love to work extra!). I am already working the strict minimum so I can still enjoy evenings work-stress-free.

Honestly, I am on the verge of taking all of this to the court (I can but I don't want to do it as it means I am 'taking away' my coworkers salary for months). 

I booked a holiday in december and that helps me SO MUCH during the day just thinking about it.

I just want for the company to close because that means I'm sure I'm gonna get my salary (from the government) for few months without even being obliged to work (I live in France, it's normal to get this).

101,I HATE my job,"So I just need to vent. I don't necessarily hate every aspect of my job. I enjoy the people I work with but that's about it. I work for a payroll company as a payroll specialist. I have a list of 362 clients that I have to maintain account maintenance and run payroll for. My clients are the part of the job I hate. Some of them I enjoy talking too but I have some who make my life a living hell. They seem to think the world revovles around them and that they can treat me like shit. It's gotten to the point where I cry almost everyday at work. I'm depressed and stressed out like crazy. I have panic attacks every other week because I don't want to deal with the bullshit every week.  For background, I have a degree in bachelor's in HR and only graduated in May of 2018 from college. I've tried applying for jobs that I think would be more suitable but every job that's listed as entry level needs 4 years of experience and is only willing to pay a measly $13/hr. Not that the job I currently work at pays any better especiallu for the amount of work and stress this job brings. My clients make me feel like I don't deserve to eat or enjoy life. Some say ""you're lucky to have a job,"" but if I am miserable 40 hours  out of the week I don't really know how lucky I am.

I'm essentially a one man department (IT) and I recently had a medical issue which prevents me from driving for up to 6 months and as such will probably need to work some remote days. I let my manager know about this yesterday and his first question wasn't anything like 'how are you feeling now' or 'is there anything I can do to help out' but simply, 'how soon do you think you can drive to work again? Are you sure it will be that long?'. His only questions were about how soon I could get back into the office and if there was some way I could convince the DMV to let me drive ASAP (mind you, more than half my work can be done from home).

I felt so taken aback by it... it was an awkward thing to confess to my boss and for his focus to so immediately be on my physical attendance at work felt weird. The whole experience just made me reflect on other managers I've had and how I feel like none of them would have given much of a shit if I fell off a cliff or something.

111,First week at a new job and i’m already going cray,"Long post

I’m a frontend web developer with almost four years of working experience and a bachelor’s degree in computer science. A week ago I joined a company which seemed like a good option for professional growth and a source of a pretty good income. I was really enjoying my first days working there because the office is really nice, has a shower, massage chair, lots of other cool stuff, I was provided with a very powerful PC and two wide screens, when I asked if they have any wired headphones they don’t need that I could use to connect to my PC (I only have wireless headphones that I use with my phone), a guy came up to my desk a couple hours later and just gave me a box with brand new Sennheiser headphones. I wasn’t expecting anything like this at all, was ready to buy some headphones for work with my own money and thought I’d be lucky if they would find some old headphones they don’t need that I could use. I think it’s worth to mention that I live in Russia, and I guess all this stuff is pretty standard for Europeans and Americans, but I’ve never worked in such good conditions before.

This post is mostly oriented on people who work with something IT related and can understand what I’m talking about.
I’ve encountered some problems during my first days here and I’d like to know should I blame myself for these issues and be responsible for them or it’s the company’s fault.

A little info about the company: it’s basically a dating website which was created in 2008, had some success in the beginning but wasn’t really successful overall. Still, they have pretty large user base which is paying for being promoted in some way expecting any attention to their personas. The site looks like it was never updated and it objectively sucks by all standards. But the company still gets a decent income generated on this site, so it continues to exist. Realizing that the main site really sucks they have created different startups, side projects, which would help them create additional income on a modern market.

The main reason I’m telling that the company is pretty old is because many people have been working there since the beginning and I guess they are really comfortable doing the same things while getting paid.

So, the problems I encountered:
1. The project I had to develop had a design made in Adobe Illustrator, which was pretty strange since almost all designers use Sketch nowadays, or at least a Photoshop. I’ve only seen icons that were made in Illustrator and in such situations I just converted them to SVG and had no problems with using the icon in a project.

But here I was given a huge file made in Illustrator that contained designs for the whole project.

I’ve tried several options for working with this type of file like Avocode, Figma which make it really easy for the developer to get all the static files, CSS rules and everything else a developer might need. I have tried many options like Adobe XD, Avocode, Figma, Zeplin, but they all had some serious issues with working with my design file (from crashes to wrong colors) that made them unusable for the current project.
Of course it took relatively big amount of time testing each option, trying to configure it for editing AI files and looking for possible reasons of some errors I encountered while using these tools.

After that, I realize that the manager don't really care that I've never worked with a site design which was made entirely in Illustrator and I had to do the task as fast as I can because managers only looked on the amount of tasks I made and the amount of time I spent to do them

And in my case I spent a lot of time simply trying to figure out the most comfortable way of working with AI mockup as a web developer
Then I decided to ask my manager about installing Illustrator on my PC, he gave me a Slack username of an employee who is dealing with this, I immediately wrote to him and asked to install Illustrator asap since I can't work without Illustrator on my PC. He was online and I thougth it'd be  rude to write many times

Then I called him and waited for a pretty long time: he didn't answer
Then I asked about the location of his office desk, but he wasn't there
On the next day the first thing I did is I went to his desk and finally found him. I told him that I can't start working because I need Adobe Illustrator installed, my manager is noticeably not happy about the whole situation and I need to start working as soon as possible.
He asked my about the manager's opinion and does he think that I really need Illustrator, I tell him that we discussed it many times, and he's perfectly fine with this
Did anyone come up to me for help that morning? No one. They started installing the program only at about 5-6 PM.
Turned out that guy didn't believe me about the manager being okay with me using illustrator, but still, he decided to contact him directly, to confirm that I really need this program. And, by the way, we are not allowed to use cracked software so the only way I could get this program was only through contacting him, because he activated the product
Only then I finally get Illustrator installed. I don't know how many hours exactly passed, but I think I was waiting him and doing nothing for about 8 hours.

2. Second problem came up when it turned out that no one in the whole development department uses Visual Studio Code (the most popular and objectively great program, which is lightning fast and is absolutely free, I think that most devs use it). Everyone in my department was using PHPStorm

I was really surprised because I was almost sure that the majority of developers uses VSCode
I have nothing against PHPStorm, it's a very powerful tool, but it's old, slow and costs some money
It wasn't a problem for me, because I didn't really care what other people use here, I only wanted to use the tool I've been using 1.5 or more years and I have lots of different plugins, key combos that help me write code fast and easy
All developers sync their code with the remote server, usually after every save command
I easily found a plugin by Microsoft that was able to do lots of stuff, it was a plugin specifically made for remote development


After the installation, I try to set the synchronization between me and the server. I was given basic server info (username, password and personal folder) But even using all the info I was given I couldn't connect to the server and the error log was pretty vague, it was hard to tell if it's something wrong with my client or the project serverI was trying to do everything by myself, reading all the documentation
But then I thought that I'm a frontend developer, I can write some backend code or do some easy server-related text, but it's out of the scope of my professionBut then I remembered that we have a lead technician, who has been working here for a long time, and he knows everything about our server and it would take 10-20 minutes of his time or maybe less to estable connection and synchronization on my VSCode

I ask him to come up to my desk, and guess what I hear when he comes to me? “What's that on your screen? VSCode? Remember — there are no good products that have no price. Also, who made this thing? Microsoft? Ha-ha-ha, what a piece of shit, no one here uses this crap”
And then he walks away

I'm destroyed by his ignorance (he really said that all open source is crap and that's a fact) and his unprofessional behavior. It was the first time we met, he knows I'm a new guy here and I don't really care what's his opinion about VSCode. I love it, I've been using it for almost couple years and it's the most popular tool for writing code, way more popular than PHPStorm. I think that's a good enough reason not to say these things, they're rude and really stupid (he believes that all open source projects are crap simply because nothing good can be free)

I'm still stuck trying to connect to the server, but now I also understand that this guy probably considers my favorite code editor as pure crap and most probably he won't spend his time helping me to configure this awful piece of crap.

Anyway, he's still the only lead technician, and he's the most competent server-wise. I try to forget this crazy incident and ask him for help again.

I don't remember the specific questions I asked, but he gave me the minimum info through slack

only after I asked him to help me crazy amount of times, he finally sits by my computer and tries to make a connection. He configured the connection and synchronization and spent about 15 minutes of it.

On the next day the manager asks me to talk with him in a conference room.

We go there, and he says that I'm trying to blame everyone but myself, when it's me who is actually accountable for all the troubles I experienced. He says that the lead technician is a great guy, and he doubts that he declined to help me. (he really didn't decline but his motivation was extremely low). Then he says that I'm the only special cornflakes with an editor nobody here uses and it's completely my duty to configurable the connection to the server and tech lead only has to give me the most basic server info, and nothing else. He doesn't owe me shit and he can decline any requests that are connected with my shitty editor, I must express gratitude for his help. Then I say that it's a bit strange that the tech lead refuses to help with the configuration, simply because for him it would be very easy and will take up to 20 minutes. I spent about two days configuring everything by myself, not realising what half of the stuff I do does, as I do not support servers and know noting about them. I say that maybe it would be a good idea to ask the tech lead to configure server settings when someone new joins the team? It would be easy for the both sides. The manager tells me that I'm wrong and the tech lead shouldn't waste his time configuring some crazy editors they know nothing about and the developer is completely responsible for all configuration, technicians have all the rights to ignore me.

I'm pretty amazed by this, because it seems to me that it's very clear and logical to ask a tech lead to set the configuration and spend 15-20 minutes rather than say that “nobody owes you shit” and in the end I spend days doing server-related things

He says that I'm the only reason that I didn't complete any tasks yet, I'm the only one to blame, and he doesn't care what kind of troubles I have. He is only interested in two things — how fast can I generate income for the company and how much income I generate at all.

It feels to me that one of us is insane, and I don't know who it is. Maybe I'm really not getting the point and I should shut up and deal with my shit by myself, not interrupting everyone? Maybe it's normal to come up to the new employee and tell him that his favorite editor sucks and it's so shitty that nobody else is using it here, i have no desire to learn how to configure this crap.

I think that the company should allow and be absolutely fine with the fact that everyone has his own preferences, favorite editors and these choices should be respected. A technical lead swearing at me for using the most popular editor is a complete fail and reveals many facts about the company. He should read the documentation for the chosen drug Also, I believe that the manager have to think and count all the factors of the reality, not simply saying that “you still didn't generate any money for us and this means that you suck”

The manager is also obsessed with deadlines and when telling me the deadline for my latest task he also casually informed me that the office works 24/7

In the end, I ended up spending extra 5-6 hours at work and left the office at 1 AM.

And, of course these extra hours I were working are completely unpaid and not listed anywhere. , and they don't even consider paying me for these hours. I'm sure that if I'd ask about the money they owe me for these 6 hours, they would be very surprised that I even dare to ask about this and I'm sure I wouldn't receive anything,

What should I do? Listen to the manager and be a good slave?

Or I should run from this hell?

112,Had a job interview today,"Today I had a job interview for a production manager position, at a medium size company. I was first contacted by a headhunter that got me the interview with the company looking to hire a new person. 

I did my due diligence, researched the company, their products, clients, etc. Practiced my speech, ironed my shirt and pants, cut my hair, polish my shoes. I go there and everything seems normal, nothing unusual. I meet the HR person and the person I would be reporting to. He asks me the typical, recycled and rehearsed boring questions, and I answer them promptly. Everything is going well, until the ""do you have any questions for us"" part. I asked how much time is spent on the floor and how much time is spent in the office on an average day, to which the person replies ""8 hrs on the floor, 2 hrs in the office"", to which I reply ""so your average day here is a 10 hour shift right?"". The person replies with a ""yes, and saturdays are not unusual too"". So I, professionally say ""well, this type of position sure demands a lot of overtime, which I believe is compensated accordingly right?"", and the person replies with a ""no, you earn a yearly salary so there is no overtime compensation"". 

So, instead of me getting a better deal compared to my current job, I was actually getting probably something like 60 hours a week which at the end would be way less per hour. 

I stressed that if they wanted to continue the hiring process, I would need a written contract stating that overtime will be compensated accordingly. I shook their hands and left.

The people I work with don’t see it as an incentive to work at a reasonable pace to get your hours up on quiet days. Another thing that pisses me off is that these shorter days really dig into the seasonal bonus (based on up to $1/hour, which could be less due to performance).

130,Thinking of quitting after 3 weeks in new job,"r/NEET

Thinking of quitting after 3 weeks in job. Had the worst day ever

u/Alexasissy

Well its not even 3 full weeks yet.

Let me preface by saying i DO have plenty of experience in retail jobs like this, AND im not looking to go back to being NEET until ive worked for a good 6 months and saved several thousand dollars up.

So today I was 2 minutes late to work, literally 2 minutes due to abnormal traffic and my Boss made an issue about it, had an angry look on her face etc, strike 1

Then, i dont actually know what my boss did all day because from where I was standing I did basically everything, every task, serving all customers etc.

The part time girl arrived in the afternoon in a bad mood and was basically rude to me the whole time, i had to recieve a delivery and they interrupted me about 10x to do other tasks for them. They seemed to spend the afternoon chatting and whispering.

I literally did not stop all day, i was doing tasks or serving every second of the day. Non stop.

Come end of day it was 5 to and the part timer was fiddling on the computer so i said its time to close, the whole close down process takes forever as they have a million redundant processes and systems, and i had to write so many notes because you need to write a note if you sneeze in this store. Got out at 20 past (me being 2 minutes late is unacceptable but leaving 20 minutes late is fine)

I missed the 5.20 bus and had to wait 45 minutes for the next one while the part timer has a car so isnt as big an issue leaving later.

Like, i can haul myself into work just fine, but i just felt so disrespected today, not happy at all, this is just a retail job at tge end of the day, it pays the same as other retail jobs ive done which are nowhere near as stressful.

Also keep in mind im on the good old ""90 day trial"" which means they can end my employment on 2 weeks notice at any time. Now because its not long until xmas i doubt they would so that but i feel far from guarenteed in my position.

Maybe im overreacting but i just dont think all of this is worth it, im not happy at all.",False,d8jeit,Alexasissy,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/d8jeit/thinking_of_quitting_after_3_weeks_in_new_job/,6,5

ESR “SICK LEAVE” ETHICAL DILEMMA NARRATIVE

  
    
   
    
 
 
 
  
 
  

You supervise 10 employees. Him, the best performer, called in sick today with a very high fever. You learn from
very trustworthy subordinate whom Him is meeting for lunch that Him is not actually sick. Instead, Him is taking a
“mental health” day and just wanted some unscheduled time off from work. The company’s sick leave policy does
not allow for mental health days. You suspect that Him might do this once or twice a year, within the allowance
sick day allocation. Allowing Him to take a “mental health” day off when not sick can damage employee morale by
creating a double standard, one for Him and one for everyone else.

That would you do? Would you

1. Demand that Him work an extra day without pay to make up for the missed worldly?
2. Must give Him a warning?

3. To nothing?

Why?

 
 

Narratives are most effective when they are stories to which employees can relate. The narrate
should be specific to the types of ethical issues the workshop participants experience. Sharing ethical stop
about the organization’s founder or other key leaders is momentarily invigorating, but the narratives p

147,So I talked to a life coach...,"I had a free hour-long consult with a life coach last night, and thought I'd share the main takeaway she gave me about my frustrating job situation. I have been talking about going solo as a consultant with what I do, but for other life reasons, am committed to my current job for at least another year. (Expensive benefits and guaranteed income I need for a time.) 

Her advice to me was that I needed to understand that my job isn't negative... situations are neutral, and it's what we think about them and how we react to them that is positive or negative. So her suggestion was to work on rewiring my thought patterns so that my feelings about my job were more neutral than negative, and then devote that emotional energy I'd be saving on building my own business and solidifying my skills so I could do the healthy thing and eventually break free of this cycle.

This is not a new concept to me, and is rooted in cognitive behavioral theory. I have gone through periods where I have actively tried to find gratitude for my job, and focus on the positives, just to make my time more bearable. It always lasts a week or two until my company does yet another asinine or offensive thing, and then all the negativity comes crashing back in. She says she knows the tools to help me make that a lasting change, but honestly, at her going rate, I just can't afford to take a chance on whether that is true or not. And also, it doesn't feel right for me to pretend the emperor is fully dressed, when he has no clothes. Nothing changes for the better if everyone numbs themselves to reality, but OTOH, nothing really ever changes in corporate America, so maybe that's just a non-starter.

So if anyone has any suggestions about how to more pleasantly bide your time somewhere, or build a side gig that you want to turn into your only gig, I'd love to hear them.

173,"I'm giving up, don't know what to do.","Hi, I'm a 21 years old developer.  
Unfortunately I had to quit school when I was 15, and I started working for many companies as a web developer.  


I rarely got a job for more than 1 years, just because I used to get bored very quickly and got to change job (and sometimes even technology/skills).  


On February of this year I became a freelance, and luckily I found one big company that sometimes assigns me tasks, bug fix etc. to do, so I can earn some money, but it's not enough for me.  


I lived my whole life with a dream: building something mine online, no matter what it is: a casino, a game, a popular software, I just wanted to start earning passive income this way, and I kinda did it when I launched a BTC faucet back in 2017 that got 67k users (unfortunately I realized that's not a sustainable business and I had to close the website after a year).  


I feel like I'm walking in circles, and now I'm back to that point where I need a job and money, but at the same time I don't want to say bye bye to my free time, to my daily not-stressing routine.   


Everytime I think about working in a company I get anxiety. I'm just starting hating everything about IT.  
I don't know what to do next. Every developer I see has a full time job and he's ok with that, but I'm not. Last night I googled everywhere to find a community of developers who don't have a job (lol, I don't know why, I kinda what to see people without a job earning money by projects etc) and I failed to find it (maybe because everything I want is fucking utopia).

177,Applied for disability the other day,"So the long and the short of it is I was in the workforce for about 10 years, during that time I managed to develop an issue with drink, severe anxiety, and major depression. I kept telling myself to man up and keep pushing on despite the abusive shitty work environment and I kept going back to due to golden handcuffs(Good pay, free benefits). I kept telling myself I was the problem and I just needed to get better, constantly pushing while society and everything around me kept pushing the idea of ""harder, faster, better, stronger"".

When I moved out of my parents house I used to be able to talk to anyone, had hundreds of aquaintances, many friends, many ambitions, the whole lot. By the time I realized I had developed all these problems I had lost all the friends I made by my own doing thanks to putting work and advancement first and this idea I had in my mind about being better thanks largely in part to my parents and upbringing. 

A few years ago I decided to move back to my parents but by that point I was completely far gone. I was struggling with total sobriety, replaced alcohol with weed, the anti depressants I was taking in my opinion made me worse, and overall completely lost my control over life. I sold my condo, my cars, and just about everything I had and was still left over with about 20k in debt. At this point the stress was crushing, my parents and brother kept telling me the only way to get better is to get a job and I was coming completely undone because I had been ran so ragged trying to ""make it"" and ""get better"". 

That's when I had a total mental break, I was smoking weed daily at that point, cut my anti depressant cold Turkey, and out of the blue one day I started believing and doing some crazy shit. Without getting into too much detail, I ended up arrested for felony trespassing because I went into someone's truck thinking it was my own. After being released from jail I had a couple of nice stays in the mental hospital which only made things worse and that's when I got diagnosed as bipolar. 

It wasn't until this point that my parents realized I needed help and were finally willing to somewhat let me back in. Nowadays I'm almost 30, on probation to get the felony off my record, back on anti depressants, and now have a mood stabilizer added to the mix. I have no more emotion other than the occasional anger, no more ambition to do anything, no more willingness to find a partner, and after lurking reddit and seeing the state of the working world it's clear things are only getting worse.

My family and my psychiatrist are convinced I'm bipolar and the only treatment is these meds, after my history there's no way in hell I think I'd be able to find another conventional career, and I have no where else to go. So I'm claiming bankruptcy for the 20k, I'm already on medicaid, and now hopefully I will be granted disability. I don't have the power to stand up for myself anymore and I've completely been backed into a corner. 

Nowadays life ain't so bad, I've got a roof, bed, and food. I play video games, drink coffee,  enjoy my last vice(cigarettes), and ride my motorcycle daily as my therapy. I still have dark thoughts most days and what I see online mostly just reinforces them but I get by. I stay sober(2years now) and don't fear any of the stuff I used to that gave me anxiety. Bad credit? Dont care, can't afford a house on a single income anyway. Dont care about cars anymore like I used to. Health insurance? Dont care, hoping to get cancer by 40. Work history and how good I look on paper? I blew that up, with any digging into my medical history I will never get a job. Partner? Had plenty of those, never panned out, wont get one with my current status and the one good/bad thing the meds do is kill my sex drive. 

So I guess the point of this post is this, if you feel you need to keep pushing, deep down you can't stand life the way you're living it, don't do what I did and damage yourself beyond repair. Get out while you can, if you can and don't ignore your inner voice. Had I done that I don't think I would be where I am today. They sell you this idea that something is wrong with you and you are imbalanced when in reality if there truly is an imbalance its because of the way we are living not because there is something physically/mentally wrong with us. Also be careful who you talk to and what you say, in my desperation I tried to look to doctors and police for help and that only sunk me deeper both spiritually and financially. Be careful who you trust. 

Also I felt like putting these thoughts out there just for someone else to see as I spend most days in solitude and I am not in a position to speak to my family without them jamming their opinions and advice down my throat. Right now I am just doing what I need to in order to have my basic needs met because that's all I CAN do. 

I know I'll never be who I used to be thanks to the wonderful experiences I had, and there's tons more I could go on about, but I'm hoping someone out there can read this and it will be a catalyst for some self preserving action. Don't let your the mold they want you to fill destroy you like it did me.

186,The Caste System,"What do y’all think about the caste system?

The idea is most well-known from its Indian variation, but it is attested to in the following sources:

• Hinduism (mentioned above)
• Iran (Zoroastrian myths about Jamšid, the Avesta, and it is an idea attributed to some Sasanian kings)
• Plato
• Medieval Arab–Jewish Philosophy (Alfarabi, Avicenna, and Maimonides, but particularly Alfarabi and Maimonides)
• Islam (see _Hierarchy and Egalitarianism in Islamic Thought_ by Louise Marlow)
• Traditionalism (particularly Evola, but Guénon, Schuon, and Coomaraswamy, all paid lip-service to it)

It seems pretty universal. One striking thing about medieval mythology, particularly its European variant, is the consistency of ideas across cultures; for example, the French, the English, and the Irish all possess similar themes when it comes to their knightly or aristocratic mythologies.

Good resources on Indian caste system: _Śūdras in Ancient India_, by Ram Sharan Sharma, and _Caste and Religion in Ancient India_, by Jayantanuja Bandyopadhyaya.

It seems like there was a natural tension between those predisposed to, and capable of nothing more than, productive labor, often called _śūdras_, and the “ruling class,” characterized by chivalry on the one hand (the “warrior”), or ascetic knowledge (the “priest”), or sometimes both, combined.

Our modern labor system is tellingly not the product of any one individual or group of people engineering it. It seems like the world at large simply lazily allowed the situation to progress this far, without anyone trying to exercise any agency to stop it. If you think about it, a large group of people letting whatever happens, happen, is actually the very definition of chaos.

I guess my question is: how do we reinstate the caste system? A system characterized by such a hierarchical dimension, and subsequent confinement of individuals to their natures and roles, is what Alfarabi called the Virtuous City (see Antony Black’s _The History of Islamic Political Thought_).

Without controlling the masses; by arbitrarily allowing people to accumulate wealth and start businesses (especially people who are not qualified for leadership or commerce, i.e. the _vaiśya_); without controlling women (separate topic, but somewhat related); by letting who Myatt called the Magian and Homo Hubris, or who some people call “normies,” completely dominate the cultural sphere, and its accompanying confused philosophy; by allowing democracy to exist as a form of government; by relegating all questions to indeterminacy via postmodernism, all we do is allow chaos to rule.

Certain people have certain natures and temperaments, other people have certain exaltations, and still others have deficiencies. These realities cannot be erased, as their variancy is natural and therefore part of nature. To ignore them is to abolish what is natural, and to usher in what is unnatural. Not everyone is an “employee” and(_śūdra_) by nature, but our society force-fits people into that role.

Religion should inform public life, people should not drink or have extramarital sex. But secularism and scientism undermine the ability of religion to control people. The very fact that people vocally disagree about so many cultural and social issues, already means that _someone_, _somewhere_, is wrong. People are not unified in their beliefs and aims, there is therefore conflict.

How do we once again institute these traditional laws into society, in a practical and forceful manner?

How do we arrest the creeping tide of time, and prevent impersonal slavery, wanton lust, shallow philosophy, pseudo -“spirituality” (characterized, perforce, by Western Buddhism), abject lust,  and general ignorance, from wreaking havoc on the world?

Corrupt regimes in Africa commit genocide and starve people. Young men in America voluntarily shoot strangers and casual acquaintances, and then themselves. Women, as a political and cultural monolith, have more power than ever before, and contraception, normalized extramarital sex (dating, hookups, Instagram, and so on), and the push for abortion, only seek to enforce this. Men are now more variegated, more atheistic, humanistic, skeptical, and intellectually lazy, than ever before. People crave wealth, or they crave power, or they crave fame, and subject to rulership by their desires, the whole of society is then ruled by people, ruled by impersonal forces. This manifests as an impersonal sense of slavery, subjecting everyone unnecessarily to its non-discriminative tide.

How do we stop this?

Armed rebellion?

Quitting work en masse?

Rhetoric?

Thinking through history, I am reminded that there are very few cases of things changing for the better, without forceful and sudden revolution. In fact, history is very bloody. The world, at the moment “incomplete,” cannot be without conflict. Therefore the apparent lack of conflict in certain sectors of the world, is just that: an appearance.

Wasn’t the U.S.A. founded on a revolution? When has anything ever changed for the better without forceful and sudden revolution?

Or is there another way?

I feel that rhetoric will only be “Judo-ed” by the collective ego of most people. Changing the status quo is difficult... without changing the status quo.

Let me know your thoughts.

I know, and care very little, about any kind of political philosophy from the time of the Renaissance, or the Enlightenment. My concern is mainly reinstating the caste system, from the first principles put forth by thinkers like Alfarabi and Maimonides, and secondarily, Plato. I do recognize that the entire system was encapsulated and manifested within the summary Epic, the _Mahābhārata_, and subsequently elucidated in the Purāṇas.

So the VP walks in and asks Jim if he can postpone his retirement until February 2020. I looked out the side of my cubicle for a second and expected an argument of epic proportions!

He is a coder and works completely from home, so right there he is already saving a ton of time that would otherwise be wasted on commuting. He actually doesn't even have a car so he saves a lot on gas, insurance, car payment etc. He also is allowed to work his hours whenever he wants, as long as his tasks get one. And the kicker is since he works from home and has that freedom, he constantly travels and is currently living 10 minutes from a beach in Hawaii making 65k from his computer.

Still, he insists 40hrs/week is too much and despite his blessings feels like a slave and not living a true life.

205,"Got completely financially screwed by work, my boss couldn’t care less. Putting my notice in within the next few days with no backup.","So, I work two jobs, but my main job is working one-on-one as a school aide with a special needs little boy (all day, every school day). I’m employed by a company who sends us to individual clients. So while I’m technically employed by an agency, it’s really the families who personally “hire” me.

I’ve been working with this little boy since the beginning of this year. I care about him, but he’s VERY tough, and this particular (rich) family is very neurotic, bordering on abusive. They like me, but it’s a miracle they do. They freak out constantly about very minor things, and they don’t follow any of the advice that’s given to them by my supervisors (mostly things to the tune of, “Have you considered trying \[method/item here\] to make your son less unhappy?”). They basically don’t think he really needs additional help (but the school won’t allow him to attend without me), and his challenges will just disappear with age. Also, it’s not really good to have a single aide on a full-time case like this, mostly concerning burnout for the aide (which I absolutely have at this point, I’m miserable with anxiety at work every day) and adjustment issues for the child. 

But because this case is so big ($$$) for my boss, and the family has hated every other aide before me and won’t tolerate trying new ones, my boss has accommodated their request that I be the ONLY one to work with their son. This wouldn’t be so bad if not for the fact I have no other clients (before this case, I used to have several I saw on alternating days). This basically means if this family cancels, for whatever reason, I get nothing. Usually, however, the damage is minor; I’ll lose a day (8 hours) of work if the kid is sick. I can usually just scrape by. But what happened last week was something else.

So basically, the family decides, out of fucking nowhere, to take a *vacation* for A FUCKING MONTH, taking my client with them. Zero warning whatsoever. The mom actually lied to me and said they'd be back this past Monday. *They didn’t even tell my office this*, by the way, so for the past week and a half, I’ve had NO hours. And until they return in early October, I’ll be getting about 9 hours a week if I’m lucky (my office is “currently trying to find me some hours” with other clients). My boss doesn’t care at all how much this has screwed me financially (40 hours of weekly work down the drain…for a MONTH). Note: I only work my other job for 4 hours a week. So that won’t help me much.

I’ve put up with so much bullshit at this job/on this case because I really cared about my client, but this is the final straw. I’m planning to put in my two weeks within the next few days (with no new offer) before the family gets back because I just can’t take this anymore. The pay at this job is terrible as it is but in situations like this, I’m up the river without a paddle. What’s worse is I’ve really bent over backwards for this family, even changing my availability to accommodate them and their son, taking their calls/complaints well after work hours, etc.

I’m just looking for advice, at this point, on how to draft my two weeks effectively. I put in my two weeks once before (about a year ago) and my boss begged me 4 (yes, 4) times not to go, offering the raise she denied me for a year and a half, and even had my supervisors emotionally guilt trip me into staying (""The kids love you and need you, NaturalRattle, please try to find a way to stay with us!""). They know I have a soft spot for the kids, but I can't do it anymore. I’m trying to avoid all that noise and just have a clean break while I still can and GTFO, for good this time. Thanks guys.",False,d6kvxg,NaturalRattle,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/d6kvxg/got_completely_financially_screwed_by_work_my/,0,3

218,This past year I realized I'm just a cog in the machine.,"Hi ya'll, I'm glad I found this subreddit.

Up until this year I didn't mind working a 40 hour work week. I was grateful to have a job in my field (mental health). I'm also in school studying to be a counselor. It's been my dream to help people.

Then I hit the fieldwork portion. I knew it was going to be hard. This past Spring I had practicum. First I had to find a site that even did evenings and weekends. In my search, I realized that most places weren't catered to the full time working adult. 

""No sorry, we don't do evenings and weekends"". 

I am one of the few people in my cohort who still works, and who works full time. I was surprised to learn how many of peers were able to get by on part time work or not working at all. 

They relied on family, or are married so have a spouse to financially depend on. I have no family in the state, and am not married. So I pay rent and other expenses on my own. Admittedly, I became jealous of my peers who discussed not working and being able to dedicate their time to fieldwork. I got surprised looks when I disclosed I was still working full time on top of fieldwork. I feel I am in the minority. 

So began the long days. Go work an 8 hour day starting at 7 a.m. (9 if you include my break), get off work, go to my site, and do that until 7-8 at night.

Mix in classes and homework and I soon began to feel myself breaking down.

I enjoyed my professor who taught my practicum course, but at the end she gave me feedback about how I seemed not to take much risk and was tired due to working still. 

It's not like I have a choice. I have been told, ""Well, take out some loans to live on"". I already have so much in student loan debt. Why would I want to take out more loans? I refuse. Plus, I need health insurance, and my company has the best health insurance I've ever had. Plans from the health care marketplace are basically unusable with high deductibles. My current health insurance doesn't even have a deductible. 

I made it through practicum. 100 hours of fieldwork. Now I'm in the middle of internship. 600 fieldwork hours I need by next May to graduate.

Before I started internship, I talked to my job about flexing my schedule so I wouldn't be so overwhelmed. I was worried about my mental health working 50-60 weeks with only one day off a week. 

I was denied. Told by a supervisor they couldn't change my schedule because of what my job entails. I then began to look for other jobs more accommodating, but nothing came out of it. I even applied internally within the company, and got rejected from every position. It's not that I'm a bad work. Quite the opposite. I've kept the program together when my coworker at the time went out on medical leave for 3 months. I was the only staff person there. My company even refused to hire a temp to help me. 

Imagine being with 10+ clients 5 hours a day? I couldn't take breaks because I have no one to relieve me, and I was expected to be there.

But I did it. So imagine my feeling of betrayal being told that after all I've done, they couldn't work with my schedule? And it's not exclusively a company thing, as I know a couple of other people in my company who are also in master's programs doing internships, and who were allowed a flexed schedule.

I was pissed.

So I knew I had no choice but to work 50+ weeks. Getting off of work to go to my internship, and then going in on Saturdays. Not getting off until 8 p.m. or later. So in a blink of an eye, here's Sunday. I feel like I didn't even have time to relax. Or if I start to, it's Sunday night, then I do it all over again.

Then I think about the fact it's unpaid. It's hard to find a paid internship for a counselor, and the fact I'm sinking all these hours to not be paid bothers me. I enjoy my internship and my clients, but after a 13 hour day, I feel like I need something to make up for it. The money doesn't go to me, but my supervisor.

But it really hit me in June that I'm just a worker.

In June I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. 

Fuck me right?

This changed a lot. As soon as I told my job about what was happening, I felt how I was viewed changed.

I live in America, so we have the American Disability Act. There are rights that should protect me from being let go based on my condition.

Stress management is really pushed in having multiple sclerosis. Too much stress could cause a flare up. With this in mind, I decided to bring up the flexed scheduling again, because I thought it may be taken more seriously. In American, physical health always seems to matter more than mental health unfortunately.

But I got told I may have to find a new position instead. 

After all my work and dedication. It didn't matter. It's not like I can't do any parts of my job I did before. I'm fortunate enough to not have symptoms.

That's when I knew.

I was just a worker.

I could be replaced.

I got my FMLA paperwork underway, to protect myself in case I needed time off for my health. 

In the midst of this, I was told that client care comes first, and that the company is the one paying for my health insurance &lt;which is paying for my treatment&gt;. Pretty much, I still needed to be at work. No matter what.

I cried for days. Knowing this is my new reality. Fear of discrimination from future employers. Knowing that I am a slave to work because I need health insurance to pay for my treatment, so I can prevent my MS from becoming worse.

People in the MS subreddit talk about being fatigued and struggling to work, but doing so to have that health insurance so they can keep going. What a fucked society we live in.

So here I am, trucking along with my 14 hour days with my chronic illness.

I wish I was as lucky as my peers who don't have to work. If I even had one extra day off, that would do wonders.

I know the internship part is temporary. I have until May next year. But the MS is not. That's something that's going to impact my job security the rest of my life.

I eventually do want my own private practice. To be my own boss and set my own schedule sounds amazing. The only con is the health insurance.

Butt after this job, I don't plan on disclosing my MS unless my condition deteriorates. I don't want that risk, I realize companies don't care. They want you fit, young, and healthy. I realize now the struggle of people with chronic illness in the workforce. It's bullshit.

228,Fake money at work,"TLDR at bottom. Just some background, I've been at my current job for nearly 2 months and I hate it but I've found another job so last week I called my manager and said I was leaving. I've been spied on and had a lot of criticism so I don't think anyone there likes me. Last night was my first shift back since I said I was leaving. My manager said, ""can you tell me about the incident with the fake 20 pound note."" I had no idea what she was talking about so I said I didn't know about it and she asked if I checked the notes to see if they were fake and I said I checked some of them. When I took my till off last night all the 20 pounds from my till were in a tube in a safe so I don't know how they would've found a fake 20 note. I have to pay the money back which is annoying but I was thinking I'd do it. The manager said the other person working with me could pay 10 pounds towards it but since they don't like me I don't think they will. I was on the other person's till at one point so I'm wondering if it was their fake 20 and they said I was on their till. Also the manager was on the till before me so it could be their fake 20 and not mine. My dad was saying the manager could be lying so that they can get money off me. Should I just pay the money?

Erm sorry, but it really is not that easy to adapt hospital appointments.. I made sure I got one as early or late as possible, I did end up getting one outside of work hours, i just can’t get there on time if I leave on time. She basically said she wasn’t happy about it and asked me to make the time up tomorrow. I wouldn’t mind having to make the time up if she hadn’t bitched and moaned at me about it beforehand! Also she clearly isn’t taking into account that I have frequently come to work early and left late. I feel like she has made a stressful situation more stressful. She also then proceeded to ask me if everything was okay?

235,So fed up of work!!,"Ugh, I need a new job but this job is making me so pissed off I am too drained to search when home. I feel like I’m stuck in purgatory. At weekends I do chores and am too broke to do much else. I did post on the work subreddit but got no response, lol. I don’t even know why I’m posting this but need to vent I guess? This forum has helped the past few weeks (thanks).

When I joined this hell hole over a year ago (work!) I made an effort, but people seemed cliquey so I decided to let them speak to me if they wanted and guess what happened? I speak to hardly no one there. Out of hundreds. This makes the day drag more and having listened to enough of their bitching I wouldn’t wish to speak with them anyway. Grown men and women gossiping and living for a bit of office drama at someone’s expense, sad. Yet they look at me like I’m the weirdo.

I complained to my boss recently that the work is thin (doesn’t help my overactive mind) and now I’m currently being treated like an even bigger leper?! Even a contractor on my team was trying to be sarcastic with me before (there’s no confidentiality so they’ve all been having little chats about me, not paranoid, they did it with the last guy) and I’m so close to telling them all the fuck off, but... bills.

I’m tired of being ostracised for not being a brown-noser. It happens in every workplace. Work sucks and I haven’t got the energy to pretend whilst being underpaid. I don’t want to waste my energy on people who will slag me off when I’m out the room. I just want a job that at least has some crossover with my values and one I can switch off from, but you’d think I was asking for a lottery win.

Fast forward to now and I still don’t have privileges for the program that my department uses so I have nothing to do all day! I still don’t have a key to access certain entries into the building (major inconvenience) and I have no way to sign up for mandatory trainings because that information hasn’t been shared with me. When I ask Management, they tell me to ask someone else, when I ask someone else, they tell me something different. 

My last job was super toxic but at least they were well organized. I don’t know what to do at this point. I’m trying to stay positive and not be frustrated but I’m getting frustrated.

I finally found a job in April I thought I would enjoy and build a career upon. In my first week it was clear to me this place is not what I want, what they described to me in the interview about the role did not match what I was going to do in reality. I told myself just stay to build some experience cos that will look good on the cv. I have been depressed ever since I started this place. The friends I have made at work are what was keeping me sane, they are very nice and supportive. It's the higher ups who are ruining my mental health.

I always get reprimanded for the tiniest of things that I do wrong. I'm hardly ever praised, I remember once telling my manager I did everything on this particular project by which I was told ""you were expected to do that"". I also go to a psychologist every week and my line manager is aware of this, but he still feels the need to get on my case in a pretty harsh manner.

Lately the depression had worsened ten fold and I was thinking a lot of suicide. Like for example I would be doing my work and touching my throat then suddenly I'd think about slitting my throat. One day I came back home, then my sister asked me how I was and I bursted out crying cos I couldn't keep it inside anymore, I essentially broke.

I am now off work for a couple of weeks, I feel somewhat guilty for leaving some of my coworker's (the ones who aren't horrible) with more work due to my absence.

&gt;Technology And The Labor Shortage: Automation Can Empower Workers

&gt;https://buildhoustononline.com/technology-and-the-labor-shortage-automation-can-empower-workers/

A lot of people argue against getting rid of wage work because they think automation can't replace the need for labor in production. What these people overlook is that reducing the work week accelerates automation by creating a labor shortage that must be filled by machines. 

In a labor shortage, wages rise and profits are squeezed--they even go negative. To recover their profits, capitalist firms are forced to introduce improved machines in order to squeeze more output from workers in less time. Human labor is replaced by machines across industries. 

This accelerated development of the productive forces hastens the day when all labor can be abolished.",False,d50vu0,commiejehu,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/d50vu0/reducing_the_work_week_can_drive_automation/,8,37

Also, the longest breaks that people take are 10 minute breaks, even for an 8 hour or longer shift. Another red flag.

Recently I came in 8 minutes early, went to clock in but someone was using the register so I had to wait. My boss saw me waiting and said ""Hey snickitysnackity, can you run this food?"" I said ""I haven't clocked in yet!"" and he responded ""it's ok you can do it anyway.""

277,Two Wrecks,"Let me tell you the story of two wrecks that I witnessed (briefly).

One was 4 years ago and the other was today, coming home from work, exhausted.

Four years ago I had just gotten some food late one weekend night after smashing some chick. Not a subtle brag, just important because obviously I was on a high note. Happy with my life and not worried about anything.

Suddenly, at an intersection some drunk driver absolutely plows into two cars causing them both to spin out and spewing debris everywhere.

I immediately run out to help, and the drunk driver leaves his car and runs away from the scene. I check for injuries and help the drivers of the other cars. They’re to panicked, so I call 911 for them.

I wait there until the cops arrive. Give my statement and leave once I know everything is in safe hands. My food, in the car is now cold and dry. But I feel good for helping out.

Fast forward to a couple hours ago.

I am driving home from work. At an intersection.  An SUV tried to cross my lane and gets plowed by a car speeding in the lane right next to mine. The SUV got hit so hard that it got lifted into the air and thrown into the grass.

This was 10 feet from me.

I felt nothing. It was as if I saw a leaf fall from a tree, just some absolute nothing event.

I looked at the cars with apathy and drove away just like everyone else trying to get home from work.

Corporate life turns us into numb apathetic zombies. If I still had a heart, I would care. But I quite simply just cant muster the heart to care anymore.

Every person I see is either trapped in this bullshit game like I am, or they are actively recruiting more people into it to lift themselves up or share in their misery with them.",False,d5oft2,auraJS,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/d5oft2/two_wrecks/,38,0

289,Defense Contractor,"

Please give me the motivation to quit my job. I am a recent graduate and I was having trouble getting started in the career I am suppose to start- I went to interview after interview with no luck. Eventually I was offered a position with a defense contractor. I took this job, feeling like I finally got my break.

I am now two months in and I realize that working in the defense industry is completely against my morals (some emotions I had originally oppressed). I have gone out and protested the things I am now supporting.

Before taking this job I was also briefly apart of the Peace Corps (ended up having to leave my post because of medical reasons). The contrast of working in an undeveloped country to my job right now is a lot to process. I hate corporate America. 

I feel like if I quit this job I will have no other options or my options will be worse then what I have right now. I have been applying to jobs like crazy but I haven’t found a good opportunity. It seems that working for a non profit/ a genuinely ethical company is very competitive and I really don’t have much professional experience. I know that the world is full of possibilities but for some reason I feel trapped where I am.

What do you guys think of working in the defense industry? Has anyone here found a job that completely aligns with there morals? I want to make a positive impact on the world, I don’t want to support the greed of others but I am really lacking direction.

You can probably guess which sandwich chain I work for (hint: the one that had the pedophile spokesperson) but I would rather just work on houses and build furniture. I hate food service so much, but I'm good at it so I know I always have some way of making money, and all it costs is my self respect. 

I was saving money to start own business, doing the things that are undeniably hard labor, but have never been able to see them as work. That's about to go away soon, as rent is coming up and I just don't have the money to cover it without smothering my dreams. 

I'm tired, I smell like ham, and I'm too depressed for sex. I don't want to go back to sandwich hell, but unless I get more work from a man that I know isn't trustworthy. If I had enough land I would just grow food and sell at a farmers market, but land is wealth. I'm poor. I just want to escape this parade of pointless drudgery, but I am trapped by my unwillingness to cut myself off from society, and my ignorance of the necessary loopholes.

329,"This has been the best time of my life, and I don't want it to end.","All my life, I have always had so much to do and so many places to be. I was an extreme overachiever in high school and graduated as valedictorian, but I still used to fake sick two or three times a month because I felt like I just couldn't take another day. I graduated from a top college with a 3.8 GPA. I got a scholarship and financial aid and faced zero debt. But I still broke down crying from anxiety at least once a week. Every paper I had to write and every test I had to study for was torture. I just kept thinking that if I just pushed past that hump, it would end, but it never seemed to end. Even summer vacation was ruined because not doing anything with my summers would ""look bad"" on my resume or grad school application.

I panicked in my final semester because I was sure it would be impossible for me to get a job. Nevertheless, I managed to snag a cushy, well-paying office job right out of school. We had a fully stocked office fridge. They brought in Panera on Monday mornings. We had pizza parties and theme weeks and played video games during lunch. I was almost never required to stay past normal hours. The office was a five minute commute that didn't even require me to take the freeway. It was supposed to be over. That was supposed to be the goal. But it never ends. Instead, I went in five days a week for two years, staring at a screen, pouring my prime hours of my prime years into shit I could not care less about. I would sit in front of my computer for hours procrastinating, constantly looking over my shoulder, hoping nobody would notice I wasn't working, wracked with guilt. I made all my deadlines, but I constantly felt like a fraud because so much more of my effort went into just getting through the day. I took up smoking just to get out of the building. I went into the lounge and cried into the throw pillows. The hours between leaving the office and bedtime, everything I did was eclipsed by the knowledge that I had to do it all over again the next day.

So I played it smart. I lived with my parents, put away almost all of my income, and amassed a nest egg that most of my friends could only dream of. I was a millennial with a net worth. That was supposed to be it. The goal. The end. But every day felt like walking through honey. Or tar. Even though I was making money, I was also wasting money. I was spending a lot on food because I was too tired to cook, and I felt like I would go crazy if I didn't get out of the office at lunch. I was spending on a gym membership because I was too tired to go hiking regularly. I was spending money on vacations because I needed escape, and my whole hometown felt like a prison. It never ends.

After three years, I knew I couldn't do it any more. I had saved money, and there was no point if I didn't use it to escape. So I moved to a rural area and took my ""dream job"" at a non-profit, taking care of rescue animals. It was low-paying, but the area was much more affordable, and I was doing what I wanted to do. Despite the low pay, I lived frugally enough to save a modest amount without even touching my prior savings. For a while, it was great. Then the bureaucrats struck. With budget cutting, short-staffing, and a widening range of duties, we were being asked to do more every day without any increase in pay. We were treated by management with a disrespect that bordered on disdain. The animals suffered. We suffered. Eventually, a little over two years after I started, I threw in the towel. That was two months ago.

I decided to take a real break. Although I have been making small moves toward becoming a freelancer, I have largely been taking it easy. I have been spending time with my pets, reading in my hammock, gardening, playing the guitar, doing art, going hiking, cooking, baking, housework, minor repairs (that I have been meaning to do for ages), and doing all manner of other things that require little money or even leaving my neighborhood. I eat fresh baked bread every morning with herbs I grew myself. I finally cleared out my garage so I can use it as an art space. I don't feel the need to run off to Japan or Germany or any of the other places I used to vacation because I needed to be as far away as possible from my job for a few weeks. I am probably the happiest I have ever been in my life, at least since I was a little kid.

But the future keeps pressing on me. I have enough savings that I could pull this life off for a while - a year at least, probably a good amount more if I really keep my expenses low. My rent here is super reasonable, and even if I am in the middle of nowhere, I don't feel the need to escape as much as I used to. What used to be the prison I retired to to cry in between stretches of wage slavery is now my little modest corner of heaven. But I keep worrying about how long it can go on. I'm haunted by the thought of eventually running out of money and having to go back to the rat race. I've been looking into WWOOFing, homesteading, joining a commune of some kind. I am not afraid of hard work, and I would be willing to work much harder even than I have in the past if I were not so alienated from my labor and the beneficiaries of it. After years of living like Sisyphus, always trying to pretend the boulder won't come rolling back down on me, I finally know what I want out of life. I am finally learning that there is nothing wrong with it and nothing to be ashamed of. Now, I just have to pursue it. I can't let up, I can't chicken out, I can't ever go back. There is no way I can go back now that I know what I'm missing.",False,d62wyf,BlitheCynic,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/d62wyf/this_has_been_the_best_time_of_my_life_and_i_dont/,13,68

&gt;This includes working hard, not being afraid of trying anything, helping each other out when needed, and being POSITIVE. Positive energy is big here!

&gt;Salary: Commensurate with experience

&gt;Here's what we provide

    &gt;An office conveniently located downtown
    &gt;Snacks and COFFEE
    &gt;The opportunity to work with a team of amazing people in an entrepreneurial, forward thinking environment
    &gt;A dog friendly office
    &gt;Incredible social events

Oh they provide **COFFEE**.  How generous of them.  Wouldn't want employees ducking out for 15 minutes for a bit of air and a break while they get their coffee from an outside place.

""Dog friendly"" but is there actually a dog?  Are you actually allowed to pet it?  I'll bet someone in that office needs the emotional support of a dog.

366,"Join Childcare, they said. It'll be fun, they said.","Incoming rant, but I feel like I'm losing my sanity here.

Since the start of this school year, the business I work for has been turned upside down due to building work in the place that we rent. We've been squashed into a room which is half the size of our previous room, and our previous room wasn't big enough to begin with. The children hate it, the staff hate it, we all bloody hate it.

In particular, the children who already work hard to control their emotions are struggling more now than ever. Every day now, we have one child *at least* having a meltdown. The inspiration for this post, in fact, was that today, a child retaliated to me asking him to sit with the other children by throwing a plate at my head and calling me a twat. 

I've come home crying more days than not this month, purely from either stress or fatigue. My body aches all the time, and all I ever do now is work, eat and sleep. The worst part is that I understand their frustration but there's nothing that I can do to help. This is our situation for the next 6-12 months.

Anyway, I've been flicking through this subreddit today and I've related to a lot of the things you guys have to say. So I want to say thanks, because it means I'm not alone in what I'm feeling right now.

367,Quit my job this weekend,"I quit my job this weekend. I'm a student, so it was more possible than it might be for most. The only reason I quit is because they lied about the responsibilities and underpaid me.

It was a remote transcription job where productivity was clocked. It was so monotonous. I had to buy wrist braces and blue light filter glasses too because of the wrist pain and eye strain. And I had to take at least a five minute break every 20 minutes, unpaid so as not to affect productivity. And the breaks literally consisted of staring at the ceiling to try and avoid too much eye strain.

An 8 hour task took at least 10 hours if you accounted for breaks. After taxes, I was making like $6 an hour, so I quit with no notice. It felt great to quit but now I have to find another job and I don't know where to work.

377,Saving up for a down payment on a house so I can mostly leave the system,"Looking at cheap mobile homes and small houses in my area. I turn 19 next month, no credit and still living at home with parents. Found a decent mobile home with a small plot of land for $67,500. A couple cheap condos for $65,000, and a couple cheap houses in the $75-$90k range. With a 20% down payment I'd need between $13,000 and $18,000 for the prices I mentioned.      
  
I currently have $7,250 in the bank due to my saving habits and no current bills except for gas and car insurance. I have a shit job that I've been at for 2 months with a 53 minute commute one-way but it pays $12/hr vs. $7.25 being legal minimum wage, $9.50/hr being local economy. I figure I can probably save up for the $67,500 down payment in roughly 5-6 months  + whatever closing costs. I'd want to save up for a little bit after too to have more of a cushion. After that, my mortgage payment, property taxes, and home insurance would be roughly $304 (according to Zillow). Add electricity, water, sewage, garbage, food, internet, etc., and maybe it'll be an extra $500-$600 a month. After I pay the mobile home off, all I have is $19/month ($228/year) for property taxes. As long as I pay that, I have a house. + The other bills that if I get fired or take some financial hit, I could hold off on a bit.      
  
I think it's a decent plan. Once it's paid off, I'd only need a minimum amount of money and could live somewhat free. I can tell you I'm serious when I say I don't wanna work the rest of my life or work to live paycheck to paycheck. Work will just subsidize my bills and I'll hopefully be much more free.    
Of course all financials are speculative, could be more, could be less. I'd hope I could get a nice first time buyers loan or some help from USDA (though I heard they don't do mobile homes).

384,I've only worked one day at my new job and I'm already miserable (vent/seeking advice),"I was fired from my last job at a jewelry store about 3 months ago (the week of my birthday) for being ""too awkward,"" and I was honestly quite devastated as I really liked working there. I thought I'd get really depressed and suicidal after a couple of weeks of job hunting/unemployment like I usually do, but these past few months have turned out to be some of the best in my life. I've been learning about homesteading and gardening, and making plans with my boyfriend to get a small house and large plot of land so that we can eventually live off the land. We've managed to grow cucumbers, green onions, potatoes, garlic, and even an eggplant on our apartments like porch, and that filled me with a different kind of joy and hope, like maybe I could really get this going and spend the rest of my life gardening for a living. I was the happiest I've ever been in my life, I think.

I finally managed to find a job, which I was somewhat excited about because we could finally start saving money for a home. My first day was yesterday, and even though it went smoothly and I like my coworkers, I cant help but feel nauseated at what I'm doing. I'm working for a business founded by a certain Uncle Sam, and I hate myself for it. I cried for the first time in a long time yesterday night, and today I feel like I cant bring myself to even get out of bed.

I moved over my weekend and only been here for less than than 24hrs with my dogs. My dogs are used to free roaming a house, whereas this one I have to keep them in my room while I’m away, which makes sense as there’s about 4 other dogs that live here. One of my dogs is blind, the other is developing cataracts and is hard of hearing, therefore they take a little more time to adjust and get used to a new place. They’re whining even when I’m in the room, and pawing at the door, which only gets substantially worse when I leave my room. I’m trying to get a day off so I can spend the day with my dogs, helping them adjust, however my employer is trying to tell me that I need to come in. It’s not a busy night, I’ve worked a shift very short staffed on a busier evening, so I know it’s doable. What’s the difference between me calling in to take care of my dogs - my family, vs me calling in sick with the flu? At the end of the day, my position is replaceable. They can manage without me for one evening.

398,labor struggle sessions,"next monday in our local bar we're going to try a new program dubbed ""labor struggle sessions"" where we are inviting people to talk about their work and general conditions.

the idea came about because there's two distinct social grouppings that develop around adulthood:

1) standard friendships where work is mentioned mostly in passing

2) work relationships where most of socializing is centered around the subject of work or how the collage or boss is an asshole etc.

so by taking some ideas from we are plan c (C is for consciousness raising: https://www.weareplanc.org/blog/c-is-for-consciousness-raising/ ) we're trying to mix this together, to kind of get people to reflect on the conditions in a more critical and hopefully more productive way.

now of course there's a standard set of questions that come up (such as: is there a union and is it doing anything), and I think there's a lot of stuff to be uncovered in people's conscious and unconscious coping activities.

but if anybody of you has experience in doing things like this, please share. we're welcoming all input and ideas, and my biggest fear in the mid-long term is that consciousness raising can simply end up being a hugbox rather than the basis of any meaningful organization.

Slaves, toiling away for their masters in a desperate bid for survival, all while, ""Arbeit macht frei"" hangs over their head. 

Just like in our society, where we are expected to dedicate our lives to labor and ""careers"". We live in a culture that clearly believes in that phrase, with leaders and masters who would pretentiously spout it every time one of their slaves complain.

414,Eye-opening experience at work today: some suffer in silence.,"I quit my job recently. I'm on my resignation notice period. Today, I said my farewell to a very kind/polite woman I never directly worked with in my division. All I knew was that she seemed cool, and something told me she was suffering there too (the expressions on her face when I'd run into her occasionally led me to suspect that).

Everyone I said my goodbyes to before her pretty much had the same robotic reaction. Everyone in this office acts like cult-robots, except for her. 

But boy, was I surprised today. This woman suggested I have a seat and closed the door. I was very curious as to why she specifically closed the door. She asked me why I quit - I told her hate the field, making a career shift, nothing lined up but I'll figure it out. She goes ""I'm leaving soon too - same situation, nothing lined up."" Next thing you know, we're having a full-blown conversation about soul-crushing office jobs and how nearly all jobs are boring as fuck these days. She was very open and honest, and even shared that the job has been taking a toll on her mental health. 

She said she doubts she'll find a job she truly likes, but wants something at least a little better than her current role. She complained about micromanagement and pointless, inefficient processes. I agreed. We were so in sync, honestly I was astonished by this exchange.

We both congratulated each other for building up the courage to get the hell out of there and move on. She was so genuine; she didn't judge me for taking an intentional employment gap to recoup at all. I didn't judge her either, of course. 

She said the discussion was extremely comforting and reassuring for her; I said the same. As simple of an interaction this was with a woman I barely know, it felt amazing. Finally I see some humanity in the office. 

This taught me that though we are a scarce breed, the few of us who are against workism suffer in silence. It's a very comforting reminder to break that silence with a coworker every now and again. For me, it was literally a beautiful moment. Every damn day, I thought I was the only one there going crazy. She said she felt the same way.

430,The Prussian School System conditions children to accept corporate slavery,"Our schooling system has not evolved in over 100 years. We still use the Prussian school system which is designed to instill obedience so that children will not learn how to think for themselves.

""Mass education was the ingenious machine constructed by industrialism to produce the kind of adults it needed. The problem was inordinately complex. How to pre-adapt children for a new world – a world of repetitive indoor toil, smoke, noise, machines, crowded living conditions, collective discipline, a world in which time was to be regulated not by the cycle of sun and moon, but by the factory whistle and the clock.""


This isn't different from today. Schooling instills obedience in us so that we are prepared to obey our superiors in the workplace and never think for ourselves. We went from taking orders from teachers to taking orders from managers. Lunch breaks are still lunch breaks. Exams turned into performance reviews. Bullys are still bullys. What's changed?

445,"Alternatives to ""work""","Hello everyone!

I am so glad I came across this subreddit.

I have spent my life thus far despising the modern-day concept of ""work"". Why, you ask?

My father spent his entire life working for a billionaire who did not know what to do with his money so he hired my father along with a couple of other individuals to set up and run a business for him. 

My father started in a small dingy office with four other colleagues over 40 years ago. He retired about 2 years ago at the age of 70, after slaving away for years and successfully creating an empire out his employer's liquid cash and assets.

And what does my father have to show for it? Some savings from gathering whatever amount he could from his monthly income (after the expenses of living alone abroad) and an ""end of service award"" i.e. some bonus cash. For spending the bulk of his life living far away in a different country from his family. I barely knew my father growing up. And he comes back into my life, a frail, old man suffering post-stroke symptoms after an ischemic stroke caused by heart arrythmia which had remained unnoticed because who cares if an employee ends up in the hospital for ""heart problems"" multiple times over the years as long as he makes it back to work, right? And no need to check if his family knows of his condition or whether the employee himself is taking care of his health on his own - or whether he is even capable of it?

So how could this scenario have played out differently? How could my father's employer have structured his business, being in a position of power/authority and having the resources to do so?

1. Grant a share of the profits of the business to my father. Whether in cash or in shares that my father could hold and sell as he desired/needed. IMHO, that would ensure that the success of the business would define my father's ""salary"" or compensation for his time and effort rather than an arbitrary decision from his employer. It would also motivate my father to work harder.

2. Pay my father on a contractual basis. For every project in the setting up and running of the business, negotiate with my father on the price he sets on his skills applied and time given to the project. Pay him at the end of the project instead of monthly. Prevent abuse from either side. No trying to milk each other for their full worth without compensating accordingly.

Thoughts?

TL;DR: Either give your employees a share in the profits of the business (instead of a monthly salary) or work on a project to project basis, paying the contractual employee on completion. Prevent abuse by both the employer (setting unnecessary tasks not related to project or skillset of employee) and the employee (sleeping on the job, ""look busy, do nothing"" etc.)",False,d46ovw,h2ohful,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/d46ovw/alternatives_to_work/,2,13

I'm trying to figure out which type of job would be best for me. I've narrowed it down to either going back to retail or working in a warehouse. The only benefit of retail (but it's a big one) is that it's an easier job both physically and mentally. If I'm working somewhere for 8hrs a day I still want to be capable of doing activities outside of work without being exhausted all the time. The benefits of a warehouse job would be:

* Better pay by a few dollars
* Better hours (evenings and weekends off)
* Won't have to deal with customers

I'm pretty torn on which type of job I should keep applying for.

451,"Today I met the person who replaced me, and I encouraged her to quit","I'm an IT major. I worked two years in this company until last july, with a special kind of contract mixing school and work.
They paid me minimum wage although I already had IT school diplomas, so it was very advantageous for them.

When my contact got close to its end, they told me they were very happy with my work and they wanted to hire me again. They asked how much I wanted, and I asked for 40K€, which is the really low-end wage given my level of education.
They said they were going to think about it and one day, I heard them on the phone with my school, asking for a new person to hire instead of me. They didn't warn me before.

So, I don't work for them anymore and currently enjoy my free time for the first time of my life.
Months later, a few days ago, I received a mail from the girl who replaced me. And we met today around a drink to discuss her work conditions. 
Apparently, my employer said that things were not good with me because I left work too soon every day (despite the fact he was supposedly very happy with me).
I always stood my ground and respected the hour rate specified in the agreement we both signed, i.e, 35 hours per week.
After all, they never went beyond the *salary* rate specified in the agreement we both signed : minimum wage. Why should I have gone above and beyond that for free ?

So, this poor girl was very desperate. She is working unpaid overtime every day and regularly works 50+ hours/week for 1261€/month.
She said that she didn't dare asking them to work less. I said, don't ask, just leave when you have done your 7 hours. It's legal.

And if it's really urgent, they are able to pay you. I was paid 900€ for a project which earned 12k€ to my company. And for a small JavaScript work which kept me occupied for 1-2 hours, they billed 1000€ to the client. That's insane.

They play the friendly card with her, so she feels guilty leaving ""early"". I told her it was clearly manipulation.

On the top of it, she barely does any IT-related work so she isn't learning anything like she's supposed to, and she has a work-related project to show to the school to validate her diploma. So, I strongly encouraged her to quit, and she was receptive. I hope she'll have the guts to do so.",False,d4bo37,ManthBleue,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/d4bo37/today_i_met_the_person_who_replaced_me_and_i/,9,30

454,"We do the work, the business gets the reward","So the hotel I work the front desk at was sold out last night. Weddings, hockey, concerts, and an anime convention had most hotels in the area sold out. Most of the guest services reps at my hotel are working well over the number of hours they’re scheduled for trying to handle the logistics of juggling everything. My boss told us before he left at noon (3 hours before check-in) that if we finish the night with 93% occupancy, “we get a reward.”

By the end of the night we’re at 100% occupancy. All rooms are sold, all the guests and their groups are set aside in their own blocks, and we’re making bank off of alcohol sales. After working 3 hours alone for the first time since I started this job, I ask one of the people serving food at the wedding when we’ll see our reward for not only selling out but also goodbye above and beyond and functioning properly without *any managers or supervisors on site*. Their response: “Oh, the GM just gets a boost to the marketing budget for the next month.”

So we all work our asses off making sure everything is running smoothly, and in return we get the possibility to do it all again if that marketing money leads us to sell out again. My response to the wedding server was “Goddamn fucking capitalism,” to which they responded “that’s just the start of society’s problems.” At least there’s some class consciousness in my workplace.

When I talked with my boomer dad on the phone after work, and told him about this and how it was total BS that we don’t see proper return for our work, he said “Maybe if you keep selling out and working hard, you’ll get a pay raise in the future.” Gotta love the innocent view of capitalism boomers have :/

Studies also show that heart attacks and suicides occur more frequently on Mondays.

Work being a shitty suckfest is kind of the 800 lb gorilla in the room; No one openly talks about it because it's taboo - most everyone has to pretend they care about their jobs, because they can be fired and replaced at any minute, and be unable to feed or shelter themselves.

While education is important and useful, the rigid school system also seems designed to indoctrinate generations of obedient worker bees to make them fall in line.

Baby circus elephants are tortured and tethered when they are young, so that they give up on the idea of escaping. After they are grown and could actually overpower restraints, it doesn't even try. This concept is called ""learned helplessness"".

When I complain about modern work life, some people tell me ""that's just the way things are."" Well, fuck the way things are. It shouldn't be this way. We should have &lt; 20 hour work week by now.

- Always make it a journey if you have to walk across job area. Find longest route possible

- Seem frustrated or really focused when a manager sees you. A lot of this is just simple expressions and body language to seem like you're working hard.

I’m a medical assistant for a private doctor and my hours Monday through Friday are 8-6. I have a decently long break that could allow me to get errands done in but find myself too tired and taking naps instead. The job itself isn’t exhausting, it’s the length of my day that is. Combined with a micromanaging boss-but we won’t go there. 

Now I’m going to do M-F 2-6pm shifts, with a few extra morning hours on Mon &amp; Fri’s, to be there during the busiest hours. It’s possibly temporary, contingent on the doctor’s staffing needs and if he finds someone who wants to take the position full time. But I feel a weight lifted. 

I know it’s not plausible right now for me to not have some sort of work to pay bills, but being part time gives me some freedom to explore other options for me. My husband and I talked about me doing several part time jobs (I already have a side job working at a church so this isn’t too out there for me) to keep me from going crazy the way I do with jobs after the first few months of starting. I just get worn out on the monotony! And it’s not like I have benefits now working full time so nothing will change there. 

Thanks for letting me get this all out there, you guys. I didn’t realize how many others feel as trapped as I do with the slave wage system in place until I started lurking here a few weeks ago.

485,I just want to live an easy life?,"I have a Bachelor’s degree and I’ve worked very hard in the past. I’ve held down full time jobs (and went to college at the same time). I had goals of getting my Masters degree. I was a big proponent of “grinding”, “working hard,” all of that. I had tough days and emotional breakdowns but I powered myself through it. I pushed and I pushed and I pushed myself, even when I had to go outside of my comfort zone. I was a huge fan of “fake it til you make it.” 

Now, I’ve been out of the workforce a few months as a housewife. I’m trying to get back into the workforce because I’m worried I’m not contributing anything to society by staying home. 

However, my drive just isn’t there anymore. I feel like life is so short. It’s like I want constant rewards without any risk or work to get there. It’s like I just want a constant dopamine rush, constant comfort, constant just doing whatever I want. I want an endless weekend/vacation/holiday. I don’t want to be pushed anymore. I don’t want to hurt, or be tired, or go outside of my comfort zone. I just want to stay home, go out when I feel like it. Have no committed schedule. Hang out with my cats. Consume entertainment. Clean the house according to my own energy levels. I’ve pushed myself enough to get a new job, but I’m worried I just don’t have the stamina that I used to. For example, if my boss or a co worker pisses me off once I feel like I’m likely to just walk out and say screw it, it isn’t worth it. Whereas before, I knew I’d tough it out and recognize that life isn’t always easy. Yeah, now I have no tolerance for that almost. I just want an easy life.

I grew up getting decent grades in highschool, went to university, got a job in industrial sales with an expense account and travel perks. Gained 50 pounds, near drank myself to death, began to have night terrors. Stressed out everyday trying to sell industrial widgets to people who didn't give a shit. Felt trapped working 50 weeks out of the year. Said f this to corporate life. 

Went the other road preached by reddit to the trades. Became an electrician, grinded out 70 hour weeks in the middle of nowhere, made more money than I ever did in my life, suffered depression, could only relate to 1 out of every 10 coworkers, everyone was miserable, the work was drudgery. But the benefit was 6 months off out of the year. Now the trades are dead in my country due to being heavily dependent on oil production and city trades work is a whole other shitbeast in itself. 

I moved to a high cost of living area, making 17 dollars an hour in a factory making widgets competing with foreign labor who will kill themselves day after day with the hope of moving up in the company. I see management walking around acting busy, but I can tell it's mostly bullshit. they're glad they're not doing the ballbusting labor anymore.

I was listening to some bullshit ted talk trying to be inspiring and one guy said that to succeed we must be minimalistic, mobile, and machiaveliian. 

This got me thinking instead of constantly settling for these bullshit jobs and being at the mercy of management. Could we not join them. If we agree work is bullshit, could we not scam as much of it as we can, climb the ladder, leave companies when it suits us and become the overlords that we all hate? And then when we are management and see people slacking off like we once did, who gives a shit? is it all just a game? Should we make it one? if we can't beat them join them and then be the change we want to see in the world while making bank?

I know for myself I hate staying in one place for too long and like to travel so I am not sure I can give this a go and may be doomed to low paying shit jobs forever that I don't need to care about, but maybe it's time to settle and just play the game looking out for number one.

Freelance job is neither tough not easy, but you should work towards yourself. That?

They sent out an email saying ""only reply to this email if you don't want labor day paid."" So I didn't reply. I need my money. Yet they didn't take out my pto and I didn't get paid for labor day. 

We're being forced to go to a symposium today that has nothing to do with us. I've been here 4 years and never had to go. They've always sent us home. They sent an email 4:00 yesterday saying it's mandatory (it's been scheduled for months and everyone was counting on it being a half day today).

Over time, I've come to the conclusion that any of these ""people"" you call managers actually give a crap about you.

509,Co-worker made fun of for taking off work for having food poisoning,"This happened last week. I work security and been at this job site for a little over a month (2 months at job). Each shift has 2 guards, 1 on gatehouse, 1 roving. Some have multiple properties they work at but at this property 7/10 are boomers. Most are stereotypical ""pull yourself up by your boot straps"".     
  
My 20-year-old co-worker who joined the property about a week after I did isn't too liked by the boomers. He doesn't put up with corporate shit, I respect him. He does the bare minimum work for the pay. He's a pretty nice guy to me. Anyway, last week he comes in and looks like shit, says he has food poisoning from bad fish or something he ate earlier and said he was puking. Came in anyway, apparently he didn't do amazing work that night. This is an 86 acre property in about 90 degree heat, where I typically walk 13.5 miles a day. I can't imagine doing my work sick.      
  
He calls in sick the next morning and all the boomer fucks that were there at the start of my shift were like ""He wasn't even sick"", ""I come in when I'm sick"", ""He didn't check this door properly last night"", etc. Ridiculous shit. Then just a few days ago, one of the boomers (who sits in the gatehouse all day) comes in with the flu and makes a remark ""If I can come in and do my job, Joshua can too"". First off, you're stupid to come in for an 8 hour shift when you're sick. Is your life and well-being that meaningless? Secondly, you're sitting in the gatehouse all day vs. constant walking in 90 degree heat. They also took Joshua off this weeks schedule, didn't update his schedule in the app, didn't call to let him know and he came in to work his shift from a 45 minute commute, only to see someone else was working that shift.

I told him I'd bring in a drug test that moment, or that we could go to the police station and take a drug test because I am NOT doing opiates. What happened is I was crying in the stock room for a moment when no one else was there, and he said on the camera it looked like I was nodding off. In reality, I was crying about a friend who passed.  


He asked me which co-workers I've been hanging with outside work, and I didn't want to tell him at first because I felt it would be invading the privacy of those other co-workers (maybe he has suspicions that they do opiates) but I cracked and told them all their names because I felt I was being fired if I didn't. He told me I'm being evasive and avoiding the truth and that I look like I'm on opiates right now (I look just like I looked every other day working there) I told him the truth is I cried for a few minutes in the vault  and that I asked my superior if I could go to my car and make a phone call (our pockets are sown shut) for a moment as my 10 minute break and she said it was okay. These are my apparent transgressions. He sent me home and said the last 15 minutes of our conversation are really not looking good for you.  


I'm supposed to come back Thursday, but I was scheduled today, tomorrow and wednesday. I think they're just gonna ask for my company shirts back and fire me.

My uncle hangs drapes for a living and sometimes brings me along and pays me for it. He’s been doing it since 1975, and, although he’s pretty damn broke now( he’s had a few addictions/ two grown children/ a wife/ a big house/ General spending .) from what I’ve seen, it’s good money. 

The only thing keeping me sane right now is that he said I can take over once he retires (in a few years, he’s like 66 now). Sometimes he has to deal with bullshit (like his contracts (the middleman between the designer and installer(him) who go to the house and measure windows and order the blinds/drapes) not answering his phone calls etc.,  but the work he does do is high paying for the amount of hours he’s putting in.

From what I’ve gathered his rates are a $75 flat fee, and $15 per blind/drape ($5 to remove an old blind/drape),  so there was a day where we worked about 7 hours in a nursing home (a relatively long day for him) and did 17 blinds.  I went ahead of him and removed the old blinds and he put the new ones up. Now that I do the math, he must have made $415 that day.



Now I will say it is inconsistent work, (for him at least, as he seems to spend no time putting flyers in people’s doors, which I would do), but I can totally imagine this being a tolerable way to make a living  for me (unless god forbid it doesn’t happen). I mean,  sometimes he works two hours and makes over $100.

530,A constant struggle,"I am a 26 male currently living with my father. I have multiple anxiety disorders (OCD, social anxiety). Anyways, I dropped out of college because it was a little bit too sociopathic for me to handle so I started working at Domino's as a driver because those capitalist pigs force you to suffer one way or the other. Recently I quit Domino's because of multiple reasons. One, I get no benefits. No lunch breaks, no car insurance, health insurance, vacation days, fucking nothing. We were also severely understaffed which lead to me often having to hand people 2 hour old food which was humiliating and demoralizing. 

The manager was also a childish egomaniac. Just some examples, I was discussing my schedule with him one day and he says in the midst of the conversation: ""Ultimately, I decide when and how much you work per week."" Or telling me to fuck off when I made a lighthearted joke. He is also delusional. To attempt to solve the understaffed store problem, he offered fucking 40 dollar GIFT CARDS to people as a reward for getting people to join the store. They also had to be working for 3 months straight and they could not be previous employees. I simply told him this would not work and that the owners of the store should just pay their employees more and offer benefits instead of paying the bare minimum to attract more people to come work with us. He then goes to list off cowardly, right wing talking points as to why we should not be getting paid more such as ""If everyone got paid more, everything would be more expensive and people should just work harder!""

He was also lazy. I would often come in to help open the store. This included prepping the food, which took a long time as I was also a driver and had to take deliveries. I worked at this store before and all the other prior managers either did the prep on their own or we did it together. This guy was different, he would just sit in the office on his phone not helping at all while I had to do all of it. Of course I could not finish it all most of the time and had to spend an extra hour or two after my shift was over to finish all of it. The temperature in the store was pretty much at a constant 85-90 degree temperature which only added to the emotional tension. There was also little things, like this:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/ABoringDystopia/comments/9chmwh/please\_do\_not\_feed\_the\_employees/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ABoringDystopia/comments/9chmwh/please_do_not_feed_the_employees/) \- which is in every store. It only added to the dehumanizing nature of this corporate shit hole. 

So I quit and now I am enjoying freedom temporarily. But I just feel like all of this is just a constant struggle for me, I just can't fit in and accept the status quo. I just fucking can't. There is a part of me that refuses to let capitalist pigs imprison my existence and it makes surviving in this world all the more difficult. I do things to help me though, like meditating for and hour to 90 minutes every day, tripping on high doses of LSD and mushrooms, lucid dreaming, audio books with walks in nature, Classic WoW, hanging out with my hippie friend, etc. I have a lot that I am interested in that makes me feel fulfilled but a millionaire/billionaire can't profit off of it, so I'm unable to devote my time to these things. Obviously I am going to have to do something eventually but I don't know what yet. I am good with computers, maybe I'll learn to program or edit videos or something IDK lol.

569,"A Positive, Uplifting Story About My Antiwork Hero Housemate","I thought I'd share a positive, uplifting story about a guy I used to live with.

The guy works in an Amazon Warehouse. He was a quiet Romanian lad who played computer games and liked smoking weed. Nice guy who enjoyed making music.

One day, he comes back home, knocks on my door, and enters my room to see me playing on my PS4. So he asks me what games I want to play next. I told him that I am looking to buy the new Assassin's Creed.

He comes back the next day with a copy of Assassin's Creed, and gives it to me. I ask him where he got it from and he tells me not to worry. I then offer him money and he refuses it. I don't ask anymore questions and put the game on.


He knocks on my door again a few days later, and asks me if he can test a game on my PS4. I say fine, and he continues to test random games on my PS4 for about a week.


I've realised that he is obviously stealing games from work, and ask him wtf is going on. 


He says he is stealing, because 'if they won't give me a payrise I'll just give myself one. He then shows me the ten PS4 games in his backpack that he had stole from work that day. He was selling them online, I think. 


The guy was an absolute hero. A gentleman and a scholar. ",False,cyfvm6,tomsmith856,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/cyfvm6/a_positive_uplifting_story_about_my_antiwork_hero/,9,74

572,About to lose a job offer because previous employers aren’t responding to reference requests...,"I’m not even trying to gain personal references here! All they need are standard references to confirm what I’ve been doing for the past three years. After dropping out of uni, all I’ve done is short-term work, so trying to gain references from the university itself, along with the employers I had afterwards is proving to be very difficult. 

It’s honestly ridiculous, and the first time I’ve been asked to do this. Usually they just want one academic/employment reference, and a personal one. 

I requested a proof of student status from the university which was meant to arrive via email within 5 working days. It’s been well over a week now. I’ve now requested it via post. 

I called HR for one of retailers I worked for (three different stores over the past 3 years) but was unable to request a generic reference for 2 out of the 3 times due to not knowing the previous employee numbers.

Previous boss for another employer no longer works at the company anymore, and I’ve been unsuccessful in contacting HR to gain a reference. 

The only reference I’ve been able to gain so far is for another retailer that has an automated online system which generates a generic reference once you provide your name and national insurance number. Didn’t even need an employee number!! 

I don’t even think I want this fucking job anymore. It’s for a stupid, low-paying apprenticeship which probably isn’t even worth all this stress. I rejected an offer for a higher paying retail job for this! I would’ve been working there for the past two weeks had I accepted. And I really need the money...

I thought the apprenticeship would be a good opportunity to do some academic work again whilst earning money, and would look great on my personal statement when I go back to university in the future. It’s in business administration, which sounds about as stimulating as watching paint dry...plus I hate office work and how stagnant it can feel...but it involves liaising with hospital workers, occupational therapists and nurses which, I guess, loosely relates to my future plans to work in healthcare. 

I’m broke AF and have debts to pay, so I applied for a couple retailers last week (two I previously worked for) and have have managed to secure an interview for both. Again, both of which pay much more than the apprenticeship. 

I know the apprenticeship is a decent opportunity... but fuck, I’m tired of struggling. I need money for an ADHD assessment, after which I’d like to have driving lessons again, pay off my debts, raise my first year tuition fee for uni, save for a future holiday, etc. I’m kinda tired of retail, but the department stores I’ve applied for do pay more, and I’d have the option to do overtime to make more money in a shorter amount of time. 

They ideally want me to start the apprenticeship on 16th but I highly doubt I’m gonna gain any more references than what I have right now. They won’t take me on unless they gain all my employment history from the past three years, so looks like that offer’s down the drain!!!

576,Stupid manager,"I've talked about my manager to my parents and they say she's a bad manager. She criticises me but it seems more like an attack on me personally. A month ago I had to tell her 4 times that I was going on holiday before she changed my shifts cause she kept forgetting. She puts me on at night on my own to close up the shop and it's my first job and I've been there a month! I'm worried that some man could attack or rape me cause I'm a young woman and I'd be alone and vulnerable. Also I could fall and become unconscious and no one would be able to help because they wouldn't know and customers wouldn't be able to get into the store to help cause there's a lock on the door. And I'm worried about someone robbing the place or trying to get in when we're closed because customers have got into the shop twice when we've been closed! I'm not allowed a friend or family member in the store to keep me company and help me feel safe cause they have rules against it. She could easily put me on during the day or on days when there's two people on but she gives the shit shifts to the new trainees. She's also got my coworkers to soy on me which I think creates a very bad environment and I know I can't trust them. I only like two of the people I work with and one of them is leaving soon.

Then today my manager was telling me to pack out the fridge and she gave me the heavy stuff to do when I told her a few weeks ago I find it difficult to lift. I've been at work 3 nights in a row and today I had an 8 hour shift on my feet nearly the whole time. She asked what my plans for the weekend are and I was thinking you actual bitch! You took up my weekend with work! I'm too exhausted to even do anything on Sunday and my whole Saturday was taken up by work.

Just like the Matrix, we have been reduced to a battery through tecchnology.  What if we are not using machines, but machines are using us?  What if we are just the means to the end for technology to surpass us, and become autonomous and conscious in itself. We are literally the tools, and the servants of machines.  We are helping them grow, and we are feeding them with our time, until the point where they are inescapable and occupy our entire lives.  We are in a symbiosis with machines in this age.  We create these abstractions, and they become more and more abstract as technology grows.  Right now, machines need us (I guess equally) as we need them.  Machines, like advertisements for example, both create a ""need"" (possibly needless) that we didn't know we had, and fulfill that need.  We need, but don't really need, Facebook or Reddit for example.  Time, labor, energy, is used for so many things that we could otherwise live peacefully and simply without; we are literally giving our lives away to machines.  What about universal basic income, barely any internet except what is ""needed""
""Google Maps, Books, Answers to Questions (what we already have, no more ""bullshit"" really needed)"", and sitting home all day enjoying our time; a ""trimming of the fat"" of technology, getting rid of all useless (advertisements, etc.) things not really needed.

I feel that's pretty reasonable, to feel angry or at least annoyed by. However, I carry the burden of resentment for another group of people who definitely don't deserve it, and there's a number of them in this sub.

I am so, so jealous of people who are able to scrape by on minimum work or low-paying work they really love. I'm so jealous of people who decide ""fuck it"" and move to another country or another city with no plans. I am so, so fucking jealous.

My boyfriend is chronically ill and relies on my health insurance. We have 5 pets that I could never consider giving up. Animals are probably my greatest passion in life, and I wish I could be working with them every day instead of doing data engineering to figure out what kind of products our players (we make games) buy the most while all those surveys of them telling us what they want are ignored. I know exactly what I would do if we had a windfall large enough: buy a ranch in Montana, join a farm collective/land trust, and rescue animals from abuse and factory farms. I would give fucking anything to do that. Hell there's a ton of things I would be happy doing, I'd live in a fucking RV, I don't care. But I'm not even able to work from home without easing into it over the course of a year or so. 

I make great money. I support a 2 person, 5 pet household as the sole income earner at 24 years old in a very high cost of living city. We have a good life, my workplace is... As ideal as it could be, and yet at least once a month I break down in tears and make my boyfriend promise on his life that I won't have to do this forever.

So to the people who risked it all, who have the freedom to say you're heading out into the world and see what happens... I hate you, and I'm proud of you. Live your best life for both of us. Because as much as I hate working in this soul sucking job (that even has interesting work to do, good people, great benefits, good pay, etc really the perfect job on paper for the most part) I would hate to see my boyfriend sick or give away our pets more. 

And to the people who have the ability but choose to wither away at a desk or grind to the bone when they could be living their life on their terms, is it your ""work ethic"" that will hold your hand as you pass away? Will your ""passion for the grind"" hold you when you find out you have cancer? No. If you're going to throw away such a fantastic opportunity, at least let me pick it up. 

The hellish part is I know someone, a friend's boyfriend, whose family is legitimately rich. Like, be private island/private jet rich. You know what he does? Works retail part time, plays video games all day, and doesn't even fucking pick up after himself while his girlfriend works full time. You piece of shit, you could change my whole entire life, the lives of so many people, what the fuck is wrong with you? How do you sleep at night? 

We leave for a vacation tomorrow, 2 weeks at a national park, 4 days completely off the grid. I'm of course so excited, but I'm so scared. I'm afraid I won't be able to come back. I'm afraid we'll return, I'll sit down at my desk and realize I can't do this anymore. All this stress, all that school, all the crying and anxiety that I wouldn't get a good job... Only to realize this won't make me happy anyway. I put my expiration date at about 5 years before I completely lose my shit. 5 more years and I have to stop. Maybe we'll get some universal healthcare (dare to dream) so we don't need to worry about my boyfriend's illness, but I'm not counting on it. 

I hate feeling like a coward when I sit down to work each day. I hate feeling like I'm wasting my time and being an idiot. It's not my fault the man I love was born with a defect. It's not his fault. But we're both punished all the same, and I'm shackled to this desk. I fucking hate it. I'm so angry all the time. I cry a lot. I lash out. My days slip by so fast, and I'm so, so tired all the time. I hate Sprint planning. I hate being the only woman in a room full of men. I hate work being the only place I can make friends. I hate happy hour, I hate bars, I hate being inside, I hate sitting.

605,R&amp;D paranoia," I work in tech R&amp;D. Yesterday was the first day at a new project as my old one was over. Two coworkers have warned me about the bullshit factor in this one. The first meeting was awkward as fuck. The project is a 3 year one and our job tech wise is to integrate the work of our partners and generally to manage them. The project is running for 6 months now and the first review is coming.   


 So the project manager want us to do a demo for the review. He also said that ""Our demo has to be the best because we are the coordinator"" and continued ""probably the director himself will do the demo so it has to be good"". Since I was the new guy I raised my arm and I asked ""Since we are the ""integrators"" we have to wait for our partners to finish and it is too soon. Also our work and demo is gonna be combining the work of our partners so how exactly can we differentiate from them?"".  Actually if we did a demo it is like completing 50% of the project and its the fucking first 6 months out of  3 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the project manager had the brilliant idea to not wait for the actual project components from the partners but ask from them some previous iterations of their work that are suboptimal for our project and initial design, in order to integrate them and make a demo. And for some components that there are no previous iterations we would just go and buy off the shelf components that are similar and integrate them. So we are gonna make something that is not even close to the goals of the project just to showcase something.  This is literally a whole new project which has to be done in 2 months. Of course its gonna be a sloppy prototype that just has to survive the demo, but I see no point at all at any of this. 

Managers are terrorizing everyone here about the reviews but my experience from the reviews is totally different. If you talk sense to the reviewers they are cool. In my second review I was told off for revealing some vulnerabilities of my designs (every design has them) however the reviewers were happy to discuss them and that didn't even hurt our rating.

614,Moving from the biggest nightmare of a job to one that feels fulfilling and allows me to maintain my mental as well as financial health.,"I dont really have anyone else to talk to about this, but thought this sub might find it interesting.

I'll start with the hell-job. For the last few months, since I graduated college, I've been working a job that I can only describe as absolutely horrendous. I've always been willing to go in and put in the grind and deal with the dehumanization that is inherent in that, but this was something else. 

It was at a medical lab where samples go for processing, and the entire thing was draining. Firstly, it was third shift. It wouldnt be so bad (I always want to get things done more at night and it fit what my sleep schedule already was) except for the fact that the overtime was unacceptable, mandatory, and insane. I was told when I was being hired that there might be some overtime, like 1 or 2 hours every few days. That's a joke: 70 hour weeks were common and there were 16 hour shifts where, because of my commute, it was impossible to get more than 4ish hours of sleep even if I had good sleeping habits. Already its fucked up, but add in the fact that it's a night shift and it becomes untenable for anyone. Everyone working there suffered immensely because of this and that was just expected, in addition to being made to feel lazy if they had to leave early or anything. Imagine feeling lazy while working this.

Because of the aforementioned commute, I told them that I would leave at a certain time every day (still several hours after my shift was supposed to end), and my immediate bosses, who were also basically just cogs and had no say but were thankfully friendly, allowed me to. The next day, after enjoying one shift that was ONLY 11 hours, I was told I had to come in two hours early to offset my leaving early. Having no other options, I basically had to say yes. So every single day was a 13 hour day with 2 hours total in commute, and that was monday through friday with half of Saturdays being the same. I dont like to complain or pull the 'do you know how hard it isn't card, but imagine working almost 80 hours on overnights in a week.

And I thought this was bad... until I got my first full paycheck. They told me before I was hired, at least 10 times, that I was going to be making a specific amount of money per hour, with overtime being time and a half. Because it was on a nightshift, there was differential, and so when I received my job offer it was represented as a base pay in combination with a percent. I figured, because they had been nice to me and I thought they wouldn't be as blatantly greedy and awful as they were, that the total amount after the differential would be what I was supposed to be making. Turns out no. I was making a full dollar less than they claimed I would be. Asking around, pretty much everyone was lied to and paid between 50 cents and a dollar less per hour than they claimed wed be making. This from a medical lab where I processed 100 samples an hour, spilling god damn blood and urine on myself constantly, each netting them hundreds of dollars for the company while we were making 15 or so an hour, or about 15 cents per sample.

When I realized that, I started looking for other jobs more seriously. As much as I'd love to be able to not work, or work very minimally, as our society would easily be able to maintain at this point, I had to. Then I got lucky: my friend had an opening at her job.

I've already rambled quite a bit so I'll be brief, but it's like night and day. For the last two weeks I've felt respected and important, doing work that is demonstrably useful for people. I'm making more per hour and only working 35 hours a week. On top of that, so much of the job has downtime where I'm not only permitted but encouraged to work on my own projects, or read books, or do whatever I'd like while maintaining my other responsibilities. I feel like this is a dream that will be yanked out from under me, because this is the kind of job I didnt think could exist under the lecherous system we have now, but the kind of job that should exist for everyone (with maybe even less than 35 hours but I digress). Its been such a breath of fresh air to be able to work a fulfilling job that allows me to survive, but also makes me so angry that this is such a rarity and that the vast majority of people are shoved into these dead-end, cruel job where they are being fully exploited by greedy bosses and corporations.

Tl;dr: went from the worst job i could imagine to the kind of job that should be more commonplace in the world but is instead an extreme rarity.",False,cza41i,Despite_Humanity,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/cza41i/moving_from_the_biggest_nightmare_of_a_job_to_one/,7,7

So I am stuck sitting, trying to find something to do to either keep busy or just appear to be busy. I spend the vast majority of my time here doing just that: pretending to look busy. 

What’s worse is I start looking at job openings at other companies and it’s immediately depressing. They all sound the same. I think this is just what I’m stuck with in this career field.

624,I can’t believe my self worth and value was tied to corporate jobs,"Unbeknownst to me I was living with undiagnosed and untreated ADHD. All my life. I turned 25 in August.

When I started working full time things went downhill from there as I couldn’t function like everyone else and do what I needed to do as a diligent employee. Cue me being fired from every job I’ve ever worked in, in the private sector which led me to a deep dark depression that has led to self harm and frequent suicidal ideation. I had dreams of teaching the top of my career and being ‘successful’. I had failed at doing that. 

There were months where I couldn’t even leave my bed I felt like such a complete and utter failure. My mental health was in the drain and I had to go on benefits and was signed off work due to mental health. 

Because of the way this world is set up, my ADHD wasn’t picked up as I went through school, through work through life, and adulthood. I just wasn’t good enough, not working the way I should and producing results. 

Companies have their bottom lines and nobody is ever thinking or trained to think...woah this girl might actually have a problem? This world is so fucking ableist and us with hidden disabilities have no chance. Because our ‘impairements’ aren’t seen we have ‘no excuse’ and just lazy and dysfunctional.

Anyway it’s been a whole year since I last worked in an office and I feel a lot happier and reassured. I used to feel so awful and ashamed that I was home most days whilst everyone went to work but I’m at home healing, resting, going at my own pace and trying to build up my confidence and self esteem. This sub has done a lot to change my perspective, if you guys read my first few posts I was going through it. Thank you all so much for the support honestly. 

I’ve started helping my mum out with her tailoring business and it’s going well! I’ve taken over her social media and getting her more customers and have even launched a sewing school for her to teach. It’s really fun, and it’s ours. Nobody will fire me and take that away for me. I’m in control.

I’m also going back to study something I’m genuinely passionate about and work in the public sector instead helping young people.

I currently run my own small business from my local library, helping people with resumes, cvs, job applications and giving people free advice on things.

I no longer see corporate success as the be and end all and I’m a lot more spiritual now and less materialistic.

Spent 10 hours with her and her ego, trying to boss everyone around and whining every few minutes about stuff. After fielding half a dozen complaints I finally asked her into the office.

Me: ""you're being really abrasive and people are tired of it.""

Her: ""well things are gonna change now that [CEO] put ME in charge""

Me: ""you realize you're not in charge right? You have no authority. It's like ""assistant to the regional manager...""

She stormed out of the office and proceeded to yell loudly at everyone that I was a ""jealous faggot"", to which I responded ""sleeping with the boss's son doesn't really comes with as many benefits as you thought, huh"".

656,This thing happened at a job I had years ago and it made me so angry...,"I had my first (and last) office job pushing paper when I was about 20. It was as horrible as you would expect- long hours, crippling workloads, catty coworkers, inept management, nonsensical policies... 

I had been managing fairly well for about 5 months, I was past my training phase, sort of... (I asked my manager to explain how to do a certain task a second time and she absolutely lost it, saying I couldn't just keep asking her how to do stuff and essentially to get my shit together, never asked again.)

Anyway, the Big Boss called me into his office via email and I nervously went, I'm very sensitive and felt my palms sweating and mouth drying even as I stood up from my desk. I went in and sat down and was treated to a lecture about my productivity, how it had decreased in the past month and how I needed to pick it back up (he wasn't sympathetic at all, very condescending and angry). I was honestly baffled as they had posted the productivity levels publically and I was 2nd (out of 5). I was too anxious to say anything other than ""okay"", but got angry about it after I had time to think.

My numbers were *double* those of the two super catty middle aged teenagers that had been there for YEARS before me, but I was the only one reprimanded because my numbers had decreased from what they were. They decreased because I got comfortable, I had been working at an unsustainable pace and slowed down so I wouldn't get super sick! 

I *did* end up having a nervous break down by the end of the year and quit without notice. 

I used to think there was something wrong with me, that I had never grown up/developed properly to be able to handle a ""normal"" job like this. I'm only just starting to realize it's the culture that's sick, not me. 

&amp;nbsp;

(Fun final story about idiotic policies: three months into working here, management banned the use of headphones with music while working, even if you only had one headphone in so you could easily be talked to. But, *don't worry*, you were permitted to listen to the radio out of the horrendous crackly speakers on your 20 year old speaker phone!

662,This is how we are treated,"Today, two things happened.

I gave one month's notice to my employer. I am a local supporting staff of a foreign Embassy. One of the senior staff was nice and she told our officers that the workload I face should be divided among 2 people. She was hinting them the reason I resigned. The response was, ""Well, we did not have enough budget to hire 2."" 

And yet someone had the guts to ask me ""Why are you resigning? Is there anything wrong with your current position?"" I hate that I have to be a fake ass and pretend that everything is okay because I don't want to cause more trouble by telling the truth. Oh, everything's fine, I just had other plans in my life, which don't include working myself to death.

Our driver also had a difficult day. He worked 30 hours overtime this month but our HR did not let him know that there is a limit to claiming OT pay (10 hours' pay). You have to accept the compensation for the rest in the form of paid leave. The driver was unhappy because his schedule is always so packed that paid leaves are of no use to him. 

This is when we found out that the labour laws and the ministry in our country cannot adequately protect their citizens who are working in a foreign embassy. The local government ministry told us that there is nothing they can do, basically telling us to go back and get f\*\*ked by the rules and regulations of the embassy country.

668,We have no idea how much power we have,"I had an exchange with a redditor in the r/antiwork subreddit who felt any attempt to impose a reduction of hours on the capitalists and the state would backfire, causing greater economic damage to the workers than the capitalists. The redditor summarized their thinking this way:

&gt;any withdrawl of labor significant enough to 'cripple' profits would seem to my, admittedly amateur, eye, to almost by definition, hurt wages. Its like the regressive tax thing, that day of lost wages means much more to the worker than it does to the capitailist. And the capitialist is getting some return by saving on labor costs, and meanwhile, workers still need to be purchasing necessities so, just like with UBI, capitialists profit there too.

The workers, when they cease work for a day, lose a day's wage, while the capitalists see a reduction in their labor costs. At the same time the workers still have to eat and must purchase necessities, on which the capitalists profit. 

Since the workers must eat in any case, and since the capitalists will make a profit on the commodities they buy, what excuse do we have to oppose a non-wage income like UBI? 

&gt;Anyway, it feels obvious to me (although I guess it is not) that it would be much easier for workers  to withhold labor via a strike or via a reduction of work hours if workers had some income that wasnt derived from wages. The goal of shortening the work week does not appear to be at odds with a basic income, in fact, they seem complementary.

Personally, I think the answer is obvious. It rests on the fact that the working class produces, perhaps, ten times as much value as it consumes. By reducing its labor by one day, the impact of this reduction is felt ten times more by the capitalists than the workers. 

To understand what this means, you have to realize that a withdrawal of one day's labor a week  -- not even a complete strike, a partial work stoppage -- amounts to a fall of GDP equal to that last seen during the Great Depression, a 20% collapse in economic output. 

No capitalist economy can withstand the loss of one day's labor by a committed determined working class. It is their nightmare scenario. It requires no army, no parties, no protests. It just requires people who hate work and want to abolish it. 

It is also the direct path to communism.",False,czmlqy,commiejehu,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/czmlqy/we_have_no_idea_how_much_power_we_have/,13,31

I quit my miserable office job but was then offered a different, (relatively) better position in another division of the company. I have reason to believe it would be significantly more bearable than my current position due to different management, less boring work, etc.

The problem is - I deliberately planned on quitting and having an employment gap that I can use to record an album. I'm on my parents' health insurance for a limited amount of time and have tons of savings + no debt, so this is the only time I can realistically do this.

On the other hand, it's a ""good"" position for an office job. It would teach me a great deal of ""valuable"" experience in the world of corporate slavery, and open doors in the future. It's in a field that's relatively less boring than what I was previously doing. On top of that, we're potentially going into a recession so that places even more pressure on me. Part of me wants to bitch out and just take the job.

But if I do that, I know I will never forgive myself. I will never have this unique privilege to work on my music full-time (no debt, savings, live with my parents, and on their health insurance).

696,My introduction,"I found this sub 3 days ago by typing ""I fucking hate my job Reddit"" into Google just so I could relate to others. I ended up finding this sub and loving it. This is a place where not only certain aspects of jobs are hated but pretty much jobs themselves, markets, etc., are all absolutely despised. This is my home now. I will have a post to discuss my job soon.      
  
I've felt the need to talk about my experience for a while. I created this account just to share my hatred of jobs. So, to point where I'm at/have been financially, I don't come from a poor background (according to small town standards) but not one with money. Born and raised in the deep south, live in a town of around 1,500 and a county around 200,000. My parents had me at 30 and 33 so they had a bit of time to land on their feet by the time they had me -- I'm the 3rd child of 4. All our clothes came from Goodwill's &amp; Salvation Army -- My hand-me-downs (already clothes from Goodwill) went to my younger brother and my oldest sister's went to the 2nd oldest sister. We had a PS2 as our main console up until November 2012 when I was able to buy a PS3.      
  
Again, we weren't/aren't poor for the south. My dad didn't go to college but was in the navy and landed a job at USDA a number of years ago. Me personally? I'm turning 19 next month. I probably will never amount to shit. I'm not going to college, I have no drive for any career, and I will most likely be poor or just barely staying afloat for most of my life. I don't align politically with most on this sub and I'm not sure socialism would work or if it did that some puppet politician would allow it (or the politicians besides him who want to remain in the 1%) but if there's one thing we can agree on, capitalism does not work.",False,cz11nd,IhateJobsAlot,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/cz11nd/my_introduction/,5,13

I am currently applying for jobs in a major US city. For the most part, I've just embellished on my resume and have gotten absolute shit. A couple days ago, I bought a cheap domain and made a mediocre website for a made up company that I am using as my most relevant experience. It's gotten me a couple of phone calls so far, although I realize I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing. I'm claiming I signed an NDA, so that when I was asked why the company dissolved (I'm claiming they closed just a few months ago), I didn't have to provide an actual answer.

A few questions: 

What can I do to make this seem legit to recruiters, so that I can address concerns when they try to verify it? I already have a trusted friend acted as a reference.

Is there anything I should be wary of? 

How can the NDA help me, how can I maximize that claim?

704,My job is a pit of stress that’s holding me back and going nowhere but I can’t work up the motivation to quit. [Long Vent],"I work in the Parts department of a car dealership. I got the job because I was one of the few lucky people who had family connections to the manager, and I was in the right place at the right time. Previous guy had been slacking off real bad and let everything go to shit, I had volunteered at annual inventories with the company for years so they knew I was good at the work, and I needed a job. It all lined up beautifully. I always wanted an inventory job because I have a knack for organization, and thats what I was told I would be doing - checking the shelves, running reports to make sure everything is in order, arranging the occasional retail display. My manager has been a family friend for years so we all saw him as a good guy and very trustworthy. It looked like it was going to work out great, and it did, and I was very happy with it... for a few months.

I’ve been here over a year now though, and everything has changed so quickly. It fucking sucks. Everything has gone downhill rapidly and I want to blow my brains out coming in here every day and smelling the same fucking brain-melting concoction of gasoline, motor oil, tire rubber, and stale coffee. Seeing the same dull gray stained cement floors with trash all over them because my coworkers are too lazy to take the 5 steps to the trash bins for their toothpicks and candy wrappers. Having to handle the same damn oil and coolant-slathered parts all day long and get it in my hair and on my clothes that I can’t afford to replace because I’m stupid short and khakis in a 6 Petite don’t seem to fucking exist for under $70 a pair. Having to grin and bear it through the same dull, monotonous small-talk conversations. And worst of all, I have nothing to show for it. I believe that it’s unfair and completely evil that people are forced to work like drones doing unnatural, artificial tasks for decades on end in order to earn the right and the means to exist, like everyone else on this sub believes - but I have been raised being constantly beat over the head with the philosophy that if I have to work, I’m going to do the best damn job that I can. Because even if it sucks and you hate it and don’t agree with work as a societal construct, you have to live with it whether you like it or not and biting the bullet and busting your ass is how you move up and make it in life. But that’s not true and I learned it the hard way. I have been busting my ass since Day 1 and if anything I have been DEMOTED. 

Like previously mentioned I was told that I was going to be working inventory, and I did for the first few months. I helped out with other jobs occasionally but I was told a new guy would be hired to take care of Warranty, which is like a sub-department of Parts, is seen as the absolute pits of every Parts and Service store, and is what I was helping the most with because there was no one else back here to do it. The guy gets hired though and he’s instead been designated a position as our Shipper/Receiver Nick’s assistant Lost Puppy. He is bar-none the most pathetic human being I have ever personally met in my entire life, but I could go on an on about that and I’ll just tell you that my nickname for him is Virgin Chihuahua because he looks like a fucking human Chihuahua with his giant buggy eyes, little scrawny body, and anxious energy that he constantly radiates like a Chernobyl reactor and he may as well have “VIRGIN” tattooed on his forehead in big bold letters and neon glow-in-the-dark ink because he is in his mid-20’s but still has the brain of a 13 year old boy. He is extremely lazy and wanders around tapping away at his phone or making extremely awkward and forced banter with everyone else when he isn’t following Nick around and holding his dick for him because Nick’s been here 30+ years and rarely needs any real help, and he used to flirt with me until I chewed his ass out to my manager after he made a comment regarding me and my boyfriend’s sex life that made me want to peel all of my skin off. He takes credit for everything me and the only other person in this department worth anything more than dog shit both break our backs to do because no one else wants to, and he is always whining that he deserves a raise. My manager fucking babies him to the point where I wonder if something is going on like bribery or under-the-table favors or if my manager has really just stopped caring THAT much. Either way, Chihuahua had 2 days of basic Warranty training then fucked off to never set foot back here again unless he wants to commandeer my phone charger or demand I share my weekend plans in excruciating detail so all of it has been dumped on me, and it is fucking impossible to keep up with. 

We get massive amounts of shit in every day and a lot of it is physically massive, but the Warranty room is a glorified broom closet about the size of your average guest bedroom so I have to go after Nick and Chihuahua with a cattle prod to get them to use the forklift and help bring the stuff out to the storage container on the other side of our huge and very poorly-designed parking lot, and the thing is a giant convection oven all day long because I live in the South and it is sitting in direct sun on hot pavement. They don’t do it half the time though, even though it takes 5 to 10 minutes at most to set everything up on a pallet and drive it over, and they always come up with excuses that my manager waves off, so I resolved to taking the stuff out myself in multiple trips with shopping carts. I can’t leave this stuff lying around because it either sits in my way in the Warranty room or gets in everyone else’s way sitting out in the narrow hallway. However, I recently actually almost passed out from heat stroke trying to get things out there because there was so much that day. I came back inside through my manager’s office red as a fire truck and panting like a dog, and what did he do? Did he get me some water, or ask me to sit down and rest before going back out with someone else to help? Did he scold Nick and Chihuahua for slacking off and making excuses? No, he scolded ME like a child for “coming in looking like that” and established a fucking curfew for when I am allowed out in the storage container. I can only go out there for two hours in the mornings, which makes for only two days out of the week since I usually work afternoon shifts due to a medical condition that interferes with my sleep. I wish I could post a picture of my view right now from my desk - so much has built up that you can barely walk through the hallway and I can only roll my chair about half a foot in either direction before hitting a box.

And I only get paid $10 an hour for all of this shit. Glassdoor says I should be making $15.

Last month, I sat down with my manager and tried to discuss all my concerns regarding my workload and Chihuahua and everything else that has been bothering me this past year. The company gets even more into brainwashing you than others and orientation composed of watching over 20 videos, each 10+ minutes long, of the HR director touting how much they value hard work, and if you have a concern bring it up to your manager and “we WILL make it right!!” and all the typical corporate rah-rah circlejerking type shit. So I foolishly trusted the system and hoped that my manager would understand and make things right like I had been promised would be the case when I started. He listened to me intently as I spoke, but what he said in response really hurt me on a personal level. Paraphrased, he said; “You’re too much of a perfectionist. You work too hard. You act like I’m a slave driver. No one is putting this pressure on you but yourself.” 

I gave up my perfectionism long ago. I just want to do my job and earn my money without spending every second of it wanting to tear my hair out. I come in here and as soon as I enter the building I feel so hopeless. With each day I’m quicker to anger, quicker to crying, quicker to wondering if I should go lay down on the train tracks to get away from it. I want to quit, but people are always telling me that I have it so good and that I’m so lucky to have this job to the point where I’ve become petrified at the idea of turning in that resignation letter. What if I can’t find someplace that is as accommodating of my medical condition? What if the people at a new job are somehow even worse than Chihuahua? What if the schedule they give me is drastically different and prevents me from being able to see my boyfriend every weekend like I can now? What if I quit and can’t find a new job at all and I have to humiliate myself crawling back to this pit? Every time I go through this motions of weighing the pros and cons I feel like such a sissy for finding the job so difficult and stressful because there are people who would likely kill to have what I have. But I’m still so miserable and I don’t know what to do.

I could just use some support, and some encouragement. I need to hear that I’m not crazy and ungrateful for being miserable here, and that I need to quit. I just need to quit and find something else but I’m so scared to take that leap. I need someone to push me.

710,Working for a local restaurant was the worst.,"I worked at a local restaurant up until today. A small, family-owned restaurant. I got the job as a host and wanted to train to be a server. Well, that never happened.

No room for growth and the owners were REALLY bad about paying us. I only got paid $7.25 an hour and we didn't get any tip share. They said we could use the tips from to-go orders only, but we rarely got to-go orders, AND they actually lied about us getting those tips because we never got them. They'd conveniently forget and would just take them for themselves. 

Also, they kept saying they'd let me be a server, but they didn't. The servers they had were family friends of theirs and also their 2 sons. So I just kept being promised but got stuck as a host making minimum wage and not enough hours.

Had to quit. Not worth it. And now I have no idea what I'm going to do for work. I'm so burnt out on retail/food service jobs. Thankfully I don't have to worry about rent right now because I live with my family/have good support, and I start college next year but damn.

Money is a neutral resource being controlled by the ""1%"" for their own selfish endeavors while simultaneously having to give just enough of what people need so that they can survive all to repeat the process of having to do others work just to get the scraps of your ""boss"" or leader or ""owner"".  I'm not saying that money needs to go entirely but we need to fix the system in a way that is for the majority fair and isn't putting people in a system that is based on ""power levels"" through money but through equality and better communication. I want to see a world where my descendants can all work together and do what they want with out having to worry about whether or not they are accepted enough or able to be apart of ""society"" because of there ""lack of funds"" or because they don't have a job. Instead of being an independent culture being driven by the unseen voices and following what is deemed as right we need to unite and be one. But how do we do that? Psychedelics are one big answer to the puzzle since they open us up in ways that others can't but with the laws and control over them and the fact that many people can have a hard time with the experience or are busy with jobs and trying to survive, we need other ways of improving as a whole and not helping to make the ""1%"" better off while they make us suck on their toes for the sweet nectar of life through money and material possessions to keep us occupied and distracted waiting to go to ""work"" the next day. I won't be another cog in a system that wants me to perform in a better and better way without letting me the time and resources to be able to improve.

718,"The definitive solution to fucking end work forever. Listen please, this is SERIOUS shit.","Wanting the end of work is a noble cause, since working causes a lot of pain, distress, suffering and humiliation.

If we really want to solve this problem, we need to look at the root of its cause. Surprisingly, the evil is not capitalism, billionaires or corrupted governments, even though they are also part of the issue. 

The real evil has always been in front of our eyes, and it is... Human Nature.

Humans beings are *needy creatures* by default. We feel hunger naturally, while satisfying this urge requires our *effort*. We have to *strive* in order to survive. 

The fact that we feel hunger and others neccesitties every day is, to me, overwhelming. It's the way we are. 

What can we do? For me, the solution is *stop reproducing*. 

Reproduction is the cause of all human problems.

Think about it: We were all brought into existence without our consent. We are force to deal with a situation we didn't agree to have in the first place. 

We do not break any moral rule by not reproducing. However, we can cause a lot of unnecessary suffering by having babies, creating necessities that didn't need to exist in the first place. 

Sadly, I have no the solution to end work during our lifetimes, but this is the solution to end work *in less than 100 years.* 

Forever.

719,I hate my job,"Where to fucking begin here?
I work in care for adults with learning difficulties (I actually love the people I support and the job itself) but the staff especially the seniors amd management are the biggest assholes ever that shouldn't even be caring for dogs. Im just going to bullet point some of the shit that has happened
1) for the past 8 weeks I've been under ""investigation"" for an argument I was involved in with some asshole outside of work and I still don't know if I'm gonna be fired
2) I've overhead staff gossiping and saying mean things about me on numerous occasions
3) I've often worked 50 hrs or more a week and very rarely have a full weekend off. My social life is none existent
4) a staff member said to one resident ""there's a hugh difference between you and us""
5)management and seniors talk down to me lile filth and I feel dehumanised
6)I struggle with communication sometimes and staff mock me for it.
7) unsociable hours make pursuit of outside work hobbies difficult 
8) shitty pay
I have over 5000 uk pounds saved... Should I tell these fuckers where to shove it? I have anxiety with leaving the place. I feel trapped.

722,Are most of the people here men or women?,"I find it interesting that anyone who isn't a drug addict would want to abolish work.  Honestly, what would you do with your life?  Produce more children to consume more?  Endless consumption without really paying the price, work?  Work limits our ability to consume.  If we don't have work, population growth will explode out of control.  There are still places where people starve to death and we are talking about creating a system based on endless consumption.  So my questions are two.  How many of you are men and do you still live with your parents?  Because I would understand, if so.  Or maybe if you're past retirement age but still working.  But if you're a working age male, why would you want to end all work?",False,d0atiu,askmenisashitsub,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/d0atiu/are_most_of_the_people_here_men_or_women/,76,0

Moved to the UK from Pakistan with no qualifications, worked on the rail tracks to put himself through night school, then went to Kings College to study engineering.

He then became an engineer at Alcatel. Some of the cables in the tube tunnels of London were designed by him.

He passed away a year after retiring. He said he never took a day off and always turned up on time.

I learnt a valuable lesson when he passed away. I was 11 years old.

728,I’m really glad I found this,"I’ve been in my own head beating myself up about not wanting a job these last three months. 
I gave 6 years of my life starting at 14 to 2 different jobs. And both broke me, small towns so they made it so I couldn’t get jobs elsewhere, knew I was the breadwinner so I needed the jobs. 
My current boyfriend stole me away and back to his hometown and I’m living with his family rent free but my savings are dwindling for food and phone bill. I know I need a job. God I know it. But I just can’t. 
I got a fast food job for four days and it was already worse than my other two jobs that had me saving money for my own funeral. I quit and since then I’ve felt so guilty. 
I don’t know how to say it without sounding like a spoiled brat. I want to work. I enjoy the tasks and even the customers. But it’s always been managers and aggressive coworkers that’ve made it a nightmare. 

I don’t want a job I just want to go to school and even then I’ll be so in debt I’ll have to have a job anyway. But I just know if I go work another waitress/fast food/retail/minimum wage abusive job I’m going to kill myself.
