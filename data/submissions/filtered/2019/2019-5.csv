0,Does anyone else just feel like work is inconvenient?,for lack of a better phrase    i spend 40 hours a week doing things i don't care about  i spend most of that time thinking about things i could be doing at home from cleaning to watching netflix to going to the gym in the middle of the day  if i wasn't working  i would have more energy and maybe actually think about finding a passion hobby  but instead i'm so exhausted when i get home that i just veg out   yes  it sounds like making excuses  yes  maybe i could  change my mindset but i'm just so tired  and i think that's what  they  want     in the meantime  i've applied for several maybe less shitty jobs this week related to something i maybe care about ,brq7em
1,What about an Anti-Work Union,i am still fleshing this out but what about an anti-work union that focuses on issues related to precarious work and the gig-economy that rejects state intervention to create full employment  it could have as its explicit goal the freeing of people from work as necessary to their survival  something like what iww once was but with more explicit focus on abolishing wage labor   it could have as one of its tenants something like capitalism is in a moving condradiction in that it presses to reduce labor employed to a minimum and yet posits waged labor as the only way for 99  of people to make a living   does anything like this exist  it is a stupid idea  how could it function ,brhyrs
2,Attendance Is Mandatory (Rant),what the fuck  just what the actual fuck  i am just so annoyed right now  the management team at my office wants to schedule a 4 hour  gonna end up being maybe twice as fucking long  training on the day off that persons get and as they claim attendance is mandatory  that's such a fucking passive aggressive phrase    i'm just tired of this place  right now i'm just hiding in the  sick room  because everything here is shit  i'm trying to grade a 4 minute call and it's taking 15 minutes because word keeps crashing because their computers are from the dark ages based on today's standards    i'm just tired of work and these dumbasses thinking that this shit gives their life worth or some fuckery because all it truly does is stress me out and i can't sleep at night or enjoy anything because i'm stuck here having my life sucked from me  i just wanna go home man god damn ,brdymy

6,retai/food service is first world hell.,remove this if it doesn't fit  but i felt like you all would be kinder to my ranting than the rest of reddit   im about to quit my job since i have the safety net of a slightly better job in a field that doesn't make me want to blow my brains out  so heres some things that made my job the piece of shit that it is    amp x200b     the phrase  work theft  i've been talked to twice since i started this job in this location less than a year ago  both times were about me taking too long breaks  the worst part of this was them not taking the blame  my two bosses told me my coworkers didn't trust me and were coming to them constantly  to complain about me taking a 20 minute break  instead of a 15 minute break    to reduce shoplifting in the store we have to walk the floor and greet customers and fix up messy areas  this walk should take 5-10 minutes   now you know why i took long breaks  our  shrink  walks never reduced theft  except for greeting known shoplifters  i was told that i wasn't dedicated enough to the job  and they could tell i didn't take pride in my shrink walks       they were fucking right    pizza parties arent a replacement for more money and respect   my store manager is a creepy fuck and has literally been caught punching walls in the back room and makes all of our  majority female  employees uncomfortable  i've personally complained to his boss but uh  he's allowed to be a dick because he makes the company     store credit cards are a scam    specifically the cards from my store are dumb  dont get them    also  this is probably true for the majority of big box stores  but employees  who do all of the work selling the cards  get little to no rewards  at my store we get  reach  cards that get drawn randomly every month and one person get either a  25 gift card to the store or a shit piece of store merch  my managers get bonuses and raises    now  if you catch and can help lp prove than an employee is stealing  product or   guess what  you can get up to  350 as a reward  cash  not gift card     because of this ive been snitched on for  shopping  our merchandise   i was fucking looking at the color of the lipstick  i wouldve bought it too if my discount was more than 10  at my old location we shopped during work all the time    not only do i have to be polite to everyone at work including employees and bosses  i need to be overtly friendly  i have coworkers that do this and its fucking unsettling  and customers that i speak to as a human being  appreciate the store much more than when i treat them as a thing to sell too  fake friendliness is not something people like   ceos    amp x200b   i think thats all i really wanted to say  fuck my job  i cannot wait to say goodbye  i just wish my coworkers didnt have to stay  no one deserves to get paid fuck nothing and treated like shit 40  hours a week,bsb8dj

13,A more honest exchange,i have been really depressed about work lately  but i'm starting to come around  it's been a struggle to give myself the credit i deserve  i tend to lose motivation and let more routine organization and communication tasks slip by me  but i am still pretty good at getting our main tasks done  when there is urgency that calls for it  i work as hard as anyone else  it's actually when things slow down that i can be lazy  i have motivation issues that i need to work on  likely related to a deeper depression which has nothing to do with work  or maybe it's add  maybe laziness is just laziness  i don't know   but sometimes i just wish that people knew and accepted my work performance for what it is  because it's this unceasing imagination of people's judgments which really makes me anxious and depressed  can't this somehow be a part of the negotiation of labor  despite how often i slip up  i know i am not going to get fired because i have skills and experience which are hard to find  i would be difficult to replace   at the end of the day  i know that my presence is a net positive for them  losing me would make things more difficult  why does it seem impossible to be open about my flaws  to lay them on the table and say  take it or leave it  why should the burden be entirely on me to change for the better  or else feel ashamed by my repeated failures to improve  i do want to get better  but i also want this guilt and shame out of my life  i feel anxious for 8 hours a day at work  and then guilty or ashamed for another 8 when i leave  that's no way to live  it's an unfair exchange for my livelihood   for just the bare right to pay for an apartment  some food and other necessities  i just want to fucking  be  why does that have to come at the cost of so much mental or emotional strain   to me  the ideal situation would just involve some simple  but perhaps radical  honesty about the exchange of my labor  i would promise to put in my time and do my best to improve my performance  but in addition to my wage i would want some basic understanding and acceptance of my flaws  i would want to drop the fa ade i put up from day zero  when i first sit down to interview and only list my strengths  never my weaknesses  i don't want to feel like an impostor anymore  i don't want to feel like i have been trapped by the very perceptions of myself that i try to encourage  i don't want to feel like i need to escape before anyone finds out who i really am  i want my employers and my co-workers to say  we're at last glad that you're here to help  because having you is better than not having you  and that's good enough for us  is that such a big ask  am i being naive ,bv0ylw

15,Hired on the Spot and then Fired Immediately,so as the post title said  i went to an interview at a local branch of a company who's expanding their operation  and was hired on the spot  my work experience just prior to this was at a very successful company with a good reputation  and i had glowing recommendations coming from my previous bosses  i went into the interview knowing full well i was overqualified for the job  as my last job was doing basically the exact same thing  but i didn't expect to get hired on the spot       side note  in my experience  hiring on the spot is actually not a good sign  it means the company might be more desperate than they're willing to admit       but anyway  i tell her more prior work info and start filling out the legal hiring forms  but then the interviewer starts asking me weird or even possibly illegal-to-ask questions   so other than yourself  who requires you to be employed  even at the time i knew this was a red flag  so i know this interview  which again  was technically over  as i was filling out hiring information  is gonna get awkward real quick  for the sake of my own clarification sanity  i somehow worked up the nerve to ask her a few questions as well   so what's the next step from here  interviewer lady says she'll  submit my paperwork to my new boss  and he will contact me on wednesday about drug testing and a start date  this was also a red flag to me  why would my new boss need to see my resume and cover letter and prior experience  is he somehow involved in the hiring process  something about that just seemed real out of place to me  but i thought maybe it was just some weird  unorthodox hiring procedure     amp x200b   anyway  the interview ends  my paperwork is filled out and the interviewer tells me i'll hear back from them on wednesday  well wednesday comes around  and guess fucking what  they retracted their employment offer  not gonna lie  it was like a movie where i read the email like 3 times to actually comprehend it  my brain starts going a million miles an hour trying to figure out what went wrong       -failed background check  nope  never been arrested or in trouble  not even a traffic ticket     -bosses said something unbecoming of me  no  i worked with them a long time and they were also my friends  definitely wasn't that     -something wrong on my resume or cover letter  nope  double checked and it all looks good     -did i say something wrong  no  don't think so  i wouldn't say i aced the interview but it definitely didn't go badly      so then i start remembering the real minor details     amp x200b   interviewer was late to the interview  despite it being a time she told me and that we knew ahead of time for 2 weeks  security guard accidentally slipped that she was in a meeting   she was in a meeting at the same time she was supposed to interview me  on a time  she  set      employees seem to be coming in late as i was waiting for the interviewer to show up  and not like 1 or 2  but like 20 kept filing in and going through security  no idea why       when i first walked in  i had to correct her on some things she misunderstood about my previous employment  it seems like she did some research on my last job  but some of the things she  ass   u   me  d were objectively wrong  my last workplace manufactured things in a proprietary way and she just researched the industry standard way of doing things  i literally specifically mentioned that on my resume as well  so i don't know if where she went wrong there  again  looks like she was winging it       call me cocky  but i think i was fired out of their own incompetence  the being late to the interview and then not understanding the things i mentioned when contacting her earlier  i don't know what else to call it  i should have been an obvious hire for this company  and i guess i was at first  before whatever happened behind the scenes went down  anyway  i'm just kinda taken back but their lack of professionalism  i'd love to hear what you guys think about this or if something similar has ever happened to you      also  because they wasted a fuck ton of my time i don't mind dropping their name  the company was msc industrial ,buwxg1
16,Do you like being relied upon? Do you ser that as a benefit of work?,this is from an interview with sam harris  adam grant says that what makes me people feel as if they matter- at work or otherwise- is feeling noticed  cared for  and relied on   38 45   just thinking about how this is one of those benefits of work that i have a hard time finding elsewhere  i know that when i'm not working  i start feeling depressed and i think some part of that is the need to feel relied upon by others   when i think about being anti-work i can't seem to get over all these small intangible benefits beyond pay  the sort of baby-in-the-bathwater type benefits that i don't want to lose but can't seem to find elsewhere   i could be wrong  but it does seem that there is some psychological benefit to being relied upon  to being held accountable to complete tasks even if you don't wanna do them  i don't know how to square that with my sheet desire to not work  or my politic leanings towards ubi ,bvemce

19,Anyone here work in social services or the mental health field?,i work with seniors who are low income  have mental illnesses and other disabilities  i would like to find meaning in this work  but most of the time i feel like i'm a  duct taper  most people i work with are really isolated  some have no friends or family at all  so my interactions with that person might be important to them  but i really don't feel like i'm making a difference  even if someone tells me i helped them  i feel nothing  even though i do empathize and care    for me  i think years of suicidal ideation are also taking their toll  making me feel obligated to constantly be justifying my purpose to myself  but i think it also has to do with expectation vs  reality  and pretty much omnipresent burnout  i've done other types of jobs  like especially pointless data entry  and that was much worse  but i'm getting weary of my constant job-related dark night of the soul  i'm 34   i know most of us here want to limit do away with paid employment  but i'm interested in hearing from folks in my field  how are you coping  and do you think your job is sustainable for your own mental health  do you feel like you're succeeding in helping people or improving their lives  do you feel disconnected from the work ,bukj2d

21,'i was henry sy's slave' by Danilova Molintas [long],  i was henry sy's slave   first published in i  the investigative reporting magazine  jan-mar 1995    a up 1   undergrad tries to see if she has what it takes to be an sm salesgirl   i dropped out of college in the second semester of 1989 to joint manila s hordes of jobseekers  i had a government grant in a good university  but i was tired of trying to make ends meet with the measly p500 2  a month i received from the state   i was 19 and felt deeply alienated from the rest of my middle-class classmates at the school of economics  and the grumbling of my belly forced me to leave school to join the nameless  faceless swarm of filipinos looking for a job   like many job-seekers with neither skills nor business contacts  i scouted the classified ads of the  manila bulletin  then i beat the pavements on my way to an interview or a typing exam   i passed several exams and was able to bluff my way through countless interviews only to find out that my biggest disadvantage was my height  i am fourth of an inch short of five feet  this meant i was disqualified from relatively higher-paying jobs as a hotel receptionist or even as a secretary in a makati firm   i was desperate  by december that year  i finally came across the shoemart ad looking for  200 young girls from 18 to 24 years old  good looking  at least 5 2  with pleasing personality  guaranteed minimum wage    what the heck  i told myself  so i gave it a shot    amp x200b   applying at shoemart began with an encounter with an arrogant security guard  he first asked us around 15 young women between 18 and 20 years old  in pretty dresses  heels and make-up  all looking and smelling like flowers wilting in the noonday heat to line up in front of sm city s rear entrance   we were told to arrange ourselves according to height  while the guard went around checking if each applicant had a complete set of requirements  a bio-data and four colored 1 x1 photos  those of us who did were then marched into the store   i was amazed to find the premises dingy  in stark contrast to the rest of shoemart or at least the part revealed to customers  while waiting to be interviewed  i chatted with the other applicants  one of them asked us whether we were catholic  i failed to understand the relevance of her question  until i noticed that the others eyed her with envy when she said she was a member of the inglesia ni kristo  ink 3   later  i was told that sm preferred ink members because the sect explicitly bans its members from joining unions  many of the few temporary employees who were eventually  regularized  belonged to that favored religion  and not a few desperate men and women were said to have converted to that faith to ease their entry into the job market   as in every exam or screening  there were leaks  one applicant whispered to me that there were only two questions to contend with   why do you want to work  and  why do you want to work with shoemart   i thought that was easy  but when it was my turn  madam supervisor jolted me with a new question   o  taga-up ka pala  bakit hindi mo na lang tapusin yung pag-aaral mo   you re from up  so why don t you just finish your studies   i told her my father had died when i was in high school  forcing me to support myself through college  i said i was so impressed by shoemart s success that when i finished my studies i wanted to continue working with the company in a better position  fat chance  but i told her that in one nervous breath and was rewarded with a sympathetic smile   madam supervisor warned me she wasn t sure i would make it since the store was only hiring 200 or so temporary employees for the expected stampede of christmas shoppers  and that there were at least 120 applicants in a single day  but she asked me to return the next day at nine sharp for another screening    amp x200b   the following morning  i was herded with 50 other applicants into a classroom-of-sorts  we were asked to write two essays on  why do you want to work  and  why do you want to work with shoemart  argghh  again  i thought  but obediently scribbled away   then the sales supervisor began a lecture  he started with the tale of how the young henry sy had risen with the simple conviction that if he sold a pair of shoes at one peso to at least a million filipinos  then he was on his way to becoming a millionaire  that  and determination  were supposed to be the secrets of the sy empire   after the lecture  composed of company trivia and the location of the various departments within the store  we were given another exam   when we were through  the supervisor arranged the test papers from the highest to the lowest score  each applicant was asked to come to the front of the room and retriever his or her test paper  those who had failed were asked to stand on the right side of the room  dejection in their faces as they clutched their papers   i saw no need for such a humiliating procedure  but it was not the last act of petty cruelty i witnessed as an sm girl    amp x200b    walang pangit sa shoemart   there are no ugly people at shoemart  were the first words of the personnel manager  a cheerful  chubby woman who was assigned to orient new employees    and when you use that sm uniform everyday on your way to work  you can be proud of the fact   na  walang pangit sa shoemart  she then revealed to us the secrets of being a beautiful sm girl  starting with what she called  personal hygiene   we were told to keep our uniforms clean and well pressed  the boys were told to keep clean-shaven and to have their hair always cut above their ears  the girls were supposed to keep their hair always neat  we were also expected to wear make-up    and don t forget to change your underwear everyday  girls and boys  she said good-naturedly   shoemart did not provide us with uniforms since most temporary employees were sacked after six months  so we had to have our own uniforms sewn  only a handful the most good-looking and obedient were eventually retained as regular employees  i learned that because of this policy  many sm girls became landmark girls  then robinson s girls  hopping from one department store to another every six months   while shoemart paid us minimum wages  it cut costs by keeping only a few permanent employees who received maternity  sick and vacation leave benefits    amp x200b   the sm girl is not only pretty  she is also quite sexy  employee uniforms are cut a little above the knee  permanent employees wear body-hugging navy blue dresses that button up at the front  for temporary sm girls  the attire is a navy blue pencil-cut skirt and white cotton blouse  all female employees are required to wear two-inch high  open-toed open-heeled sandals  the effect of the entire get-up can be quite fetching   but more than to charm  the sm uniform was developed for a less benign purpose  to deter employees from stealing  our uniforms were not supposed to have pockets  the open-toed shoes were meant to make it inconvenient for us to conceal money or goods in them  we were not allowed to wear jewelry or carry handkerchiefs  no slips or chemises were to be worn at work   if an sm girl stole some merchandise or cash  she has no place to hide it  except maybe in her underwear  but even that was difficult because every time we entered or left the  selling area  we were thoroughly frisked   the management took other precautions  an entire department the customer relations service was tasked not only to catch shoplifters but to spy on other sm employees   even when we needed to go to the toiled  we had to guard against theft  first  we had to make sure another employee took our place a very trying affair since there were just enough employees to fill each station  then  we had to ask for a  pass  from the supervisors  whose main job  i soon began to think  was to remain unavailable  the process was so exasperating  most of us chose not to relieve ourselves   as counter-checker  my job was really nothing more than that of a bagger  while standing beside the cashier  i was to find the right-sized bag for the goods sold to a customer  but i was supposed to check that the number of items the cashier punched into the cash register corresponded to those that i would pack into the bag  i was also supposed to ensure that the cashier would not steal money  although how i was to do so  i had no inkling   all these procedures were guaranteed to create an atmosphere of distrust among employees  and i worried about how i could make friends in such an atmosphere   the last step on the way to becoming a full-fledged shoemart girl was the medical and dental exam   the dental exam was to ensure that toothaches would never be given as a reason for sudden absences from work  said the dentist who examined me   the medical exam was rushed in a cubicle with only a curtain to shield me from a long line of girls awaiting their turn  i was examined by an aging male doctor who felt for lumps not only around my breasts  bu on my nipple too  he was assisted by a woman  but she was either too jaded or too ignorant to stop him from what i felt was a sexual assault  i knew there was nothing i could do at that point  except resolve never to get sick and put myself at that doctor s mercy    amp x200b   my first day as an sm girl began with a struggle to put on all the regulation  war paint  even when i had won the skirmish with make-up brushes  rouge and mascara  i still worried that all that paint would melt on my way by bus to work   i was an  opener  on the first week on the job  and that meant i had to be at my station by 9 a m  30 minutes before the first shoppers invaded the store   at about 9 15  a husky  female voice announced the singing of the national anthem  and all sm employees stood at attention  this was followed by the recitation of some credo  the exact words i have since forgotten  but with was a vow to serve each customer with a cheerful smile  this entire morning rite  we were told  was part of a japanese method of management   after that  it was check  check  stamp  dump  staple  smile  check  check  stamp  dump  staple  smile  check  check  check  check  dump  staple  smile   any other time of the year  the job would have allowed me time to daydream  but it was christmas  the season of nightmares for sm girls  by noon  the store was mobbed by shoppers  i speeded up to work  spurred on by the sighs  leg-shaking and and other impatient gestures of customers waiting in line   after a few hours  i had abandoned any attempt to smile  or even look at any customer  i was stressed  and my feet unused to standing for so long on two-inch heels began to hurt   there are at least 100 sm employees in a shift  and they all break for lunch at the same time  causing long lines to be formed behind the bundy clock  the lunch counter  the water fountain   and the toilets  every lunch break  a hundred girls would be competing for six cubicles and the same number of faucets  this stampede would happen every time a shift took a break  so while the janitress never seemed to stop mopping the toilet floor  it remained constantly muddy  i thought the sign  comfort room 4  should be taken off the door   each time i went for lunch  i had to have myself frisked before leaving the selling area  locate my time card  punch out at the bundy clock  line up at the employees  canteen  eat  brush my teeth and retouch my make-up  by the time i was done  it was time to return to my station   when i had gotten used to the lunch routine or when i brought a sandwich to eat i managed to get a few minutes to rest at the cramped locker room  where only regular employees had lockers  some lucky girls were able to lie down on the few benches there for a catnap  others just slumped on a bench from fatigue and dozed off  uncaring about whether their skirts were in place    amp x200b   there are ways that the powerless get back at those who exploit them  stealing was the first way  when a customer chose not to buy a chocolate bar and left it at the counter  some cashiers and counter-checkers would conspire  not only to eat it  but to eat it on the job   small items like hair clips and bracelets could be artfully concealed in our underwear  these little things were stolen  i felt  to break the monotony of a mindless job more than anything else   what really went on in the minds of the other workers  i never found out  we were forbidden to  gossip  with each other during work hours  after work  our thoughts were of soaking our tired feet in warm water  so most of us chose to go straight home   i left shoemart after a month and a half  with little regret  while i earned the minimum wage  much more than i would have received as a semi-skilled worker at a smaller establishment  i felt bled for every single centavo

78,[Thursday Rant] Maybe seeing a light at the end of the tunnel,well the last few weeks were brutal  i'm for a long time in the same job  i don't know how i could put up with so much bullshit  but maybe it's because i bullshited myself that my side passion which i put in all my money and effort in would blow up in the meantime  guess what  it didn't and it's gone now as every other person who was involved finally resigned    amp x200b   maybe it's because i had the illusion that i actually can gain financial independence with saving a lot  investing and crypto and stuff  guess what  yes since i focused on it i came a long way  but realistically speaking with the annual wage i earn  it still would take at least 20-25 years and then i would be anyway near retirement age  so it's more like fuck you money for a short amount of time when i'm out of a job   most people on financialindependence and personalfinance are already privileged people with master phd degrees and cushy jobs in big companies where they belong to the top earners  or doctors  like mrmoneymustache  lawyers from wealthy families  also a near illusion that it is possible for everyone to quit their job at age 35-40    amp x200b   so after that realization and instant feeling of being trapped set in  i've never experienced so much existential crisis like this year  it's agonizing   on top of that my boss made it pretty clear that i simply can't stand working for him anymore    amp x200b   so what did i do  i looked for another prison  employer  who maybe has some better slave  work  conditions although it's the same shitty job in a part-time way  i actually had an interview and it look promising  soon i will know if they accept   what did i do  i just asked for so much that i would earn the same amount for only 4 days instead of having to work for 5 days  can't believe that they would even consider that   that would mean 52 days more  almost 2 months more life time in a year    amp x200b   wish me luck and don't give up   - gt  don't kill yourself  don't let the system win,bs0w9i

Well, here's a solution: kill yourself", this may be a controversial post  hear me out before you downvote it  i just want to initiate a discussion  not close the door on it   imagine the above headline on fox news or your local tabloid as they blare how america is  threatened  by people demanding an end to wage work  only that statement isn't being blared across fox news  it's being promoted right here on this subreddit by many folks who sincerely advocate less work    i just want ask why people think it is appropriate on this subreddit for people to suggest they want to kill themselves as a solution to wage work  why is such talk tolerated on this subbreddit  when mods would not tolerate other abusive language  do people really think killing yourself is rational solution to wage work   i understand that suicide is a social problem  but is this the subreddit to address this  either people are really suicidal and lack resources to cope  in which case they need to seek professional help  or they embrace terminating their life and should seek assistance where it is available  either way  it has nothing to do with this subreddit as it will not get rid of wage work   i don't know how it should be addressed  i don't advocate any form of censorship at all under any circumstances -- not even forms that are practiced on this subreddit  but suggesting that killing yourself is the way to address wage work seems rather problematic to me  i am also concerned about the effect it has on the morale of the subreddit   perhaps i am completely off-base on this  if that turns out to be the case  i can accept that ,bs6jz6

114,I had a good run,nearly four months of minimal work  occasional casual shifts here and there in that time  but really bugger all  it was amazing  i had to take time away for my mental health and basically lived off my savings for a little while  i hated how people had the expectation that i should have been working more and why  because i'm a male with two arms and legs  fucking ridiculous  the expectations society has  i worked away at my degree a little bit  played lots of my favourite video game  cooked stuff i like to eat  has road trips  set up life in a new city  where my campus is based  and simply enjoyed what life had to offer  i'd almost go so far as to say that i feel ready to go back to stable work  9-5 full-time stuff  after this much time away  thank you all for knowing the struggle and making a community on here for it ,btlr02
115,Why do employers always try to make us work harder AND HARDER?,if we meet their expectations goals  they will raise the stakes and require us to work twice as hard as before   then we do that  and then they want us to work harder than even that     you give a company your 100  then they will want the next goal to be 200   why the fuck would i do that for a 1-5  raise   why can't i just keep working at the same pace  why do we have these quarterly reports where they want me to keep working harder than i did last time ,bto1co
116,I think I finally understand why companies prefer young employees,yes  it could be because of the possibility of offering a lower salary  or because  old dogs can't learn new tricks  but what i have realized only recently is that young people are naive  they think they will make a difference  they are genuinely interested in the company and are willing to work until late unprompted  they think that their bosses are thinking about them and will recognize their effort   it took me 15 years to realize that you're just a tool  just like a hammer or shovel  if i lose one of my tools  i'll just get another one  sure  i have my favorite tools  but as long as their self steem is fulfilled  they will do their jobs just fine ,bs10ql

120,Complacency,i've made several attempts to  fixing  my life  even created this account to try to once more  i don't know how people can go on trying and being motivated  hobbies  enjoying little things  relationships  they all seem like a whole bunch of  feel fine  opioids to keep on wasting the real opportunities and time 40 hours a week  and being complacent to the system  you see  while yes  most people think the system is sh t  you can have that movie night or go out with your friends once in a while  this goes for addictions too  they're really two sides of the same coin  only one is  better  you are making progress  you are happy  or you are happy by escaping and indulging in momentary pleasures  afterward  you are less likely to protest   i'm starting to think that we're all playing into the capitalist game  like it or not  we think we are mentally healthy  that we are living a good life  but in fact  it all amounts to nothing because for 40 years i'm wasting my talent  my happiness  my time  in order to survive  in the 21st century nonetheless  we are failing to see that we are falling right into individualistic solutions  even when giving advice to people  we always think about something on the lines of  there's nothing that you can really do  but here are 5 tips for surviving your life  i can't deal with that anymore  i'm too conscious to believe that life can  really  get better if i clean my room or meditate for 10 minutes a day   i've been following subs like nofap  stopgaming  getmotivated  etc  for 2 years  other accounts  and no matter how much effort i put in  how much i enjoy a walk in the park   go out and meet people  or study new languages  i can't get the  why  i even moved to a new country for crying out loud  this society has made me into a nihilist that's too scared to really act like he doesn't care  a person that finds no motivation in anything because everything seems so dull in relation to the big problems of life and others  and finds no value in money or career paths  i'm not made for this system  sometimes i envy ignorant people that can go on with the bs and still be happy in their own small worlds   i like buddhism but my rational self tells me that it is used to tame people into overworking  discipline and patience  zizek says something like this as well and it stuck with me  we are in a trap  a big cave where one side can be brighter  but you never get out of it  i want to get out  i want to experience freedom   help me ,bmzrxu

122,They want you to work 24 hours a day,from capital volume 1 chapter 10   as a capitalist  he is only capital personified  his soul is the soul of capital  but capital has one sole driving force  the drive to valorise itself  to create surplus-value  to make its constant part  the means of production  absorb the greatest possible amount of surplus labour  capital is dead labour which  vampire-like  lives only by sucking living labour  and lives the more  the more labour it sucks  the time during which the worker works is the time during which the capitalist consumes the labour-power he has bought from him  if the worker consumes his disposable time for himself  he robs the capitalist   p342   the prolongation of the working day beyond the limits of the natural day  into the night  only acts as a palliative  it only slightly quenches the vampire thirst for the living blood of labour  capitalist production therefore drives  by its inherent nature  towards the appropriation of labour throughout the whole of the 24 hours in the day ,bnv4tk

135,I don't feel motivated any more,i tried  i quickly learned when i entered the working world that i wanted to do a job that helped  ultimately  i knew if i did a for-profit job i would end up resenting everything  i've spent much of my working life in the public sector - now i work in a university research facility maintaining the facilities here  think plumbing electrical   so i should be motivated  i was  when i started last year  but my fucking  superiors  have worn me down so much that i've just stopped caring     when we got on top of our work  we were made to mop floors that were clean and dust cupboards designed to get dusty  just so  we look busy  well  shit - i can look busy without doing those things unnecessarily    i've asked for one day off to go training  as suggested in my appraisal  i got told that i was needed here  despite the fact everybody is in and nothing is behind    i am not allowed to take ownership of many problems  as any external communication needs to go through my manager for no fathomable reason   my lunch break  yes  i know i'm lucky to get one  has to be taken at a specific time for no good reason  i once missed it because i was busy doing an urgent job  then got a talking to  when i sat down an hour later to take it    i'm spoken to like i'm an idiot when i dare to ask how a specific machine works that i've never used before  maybe if there were manuals procedures i could figure it out by myself  but i'm not allowed to organise that because every time i try  i'm asked why i'm not  out working   christ  i could go on all day  my point is that i just don't care any more  i wish i cared  maybe then work wouldn't feel so much like a prison sentence commuting in an hour every day  i go home so mentally exhausted from the frustration of it all every day   and because i've job hopped in the past  and have bills to pay  and know i'll find problems wherever else i go  i'm too scared to tell them to stick it  i just needed to rant   what a wonderful life  eh ,bowjsj
136,Immigrants have an abstract value unrelated to their economic productivity or willingness to do shitty work.,i was at a pretty big state library and archive yesterday and saw that they had put together a big series of exhibits on immigration in virginia over time  when i took the time to look at those exhibits  literally every single sub section emphasized - to the exclusion of all else - the role played by immigrants in the economy  it was entirely an exercise in justifying immigration in terms of the easily exploited labor power of people trying to build new lives for themselves    anyway  i see this shit everywhere and it s extremely common for modern democrats to frame immigration in these terms  the things a person contributes to society are manifold and important to their friends  family  neighborhood  and society irrespective of their productivity in the narrow frame of private interests  imo demolishing the narrative that human movement is only legitimate when used to create wealth for others is one of the first things that needs to be deconstructed when attacking the edifice of modern labor    just a thought that occurred to me and i felt like this subreddit was the best place for it,bm9lig

156,One of my major life goals is just to work less.,this is the first time in months i've had two consecutive weekends off  and have only worked 40ish hours per week   i can feel myself slowly adjusting to it  i'm slowing down  taking my time to smell the roses a bit  engaging in my hobbies more  thinking about big picture stuff   this isn't possible when you're working 50  hours a week  it's just not  now maybe there is diminishing returns there  maybe after 6 months of working only forty hours a week  maybe i would cease to enjoy these weekends and start to be more concerned with my bank account   and certainly i wanna do some work  even if it is a job i dislike  there is some value for me in being forced to leave the house to meet obligations  to accomplishing tasks etc    but any more i think  i wanna minimize my expenses and maximize my pay so that i can get by working 30-40 hours a week  one of the major ways i'm going to do that is having a vascetomy  it's a decision i've been thinking about for years  and i finally had the consultation and scheduled the operation   and i feel great about it for a lot of reasons  but one of the big ones is that raising a kid costs 200k and i don't wanna have to dedicate 10k hours of work to that   think about that  at 20 hr  that's 10k hours that i no longer have to work  i'm investing  800 to save potentially  200k  i can't believe anyone would go to their job and think  'boy i'd really to spend more time here  how can i make that happen '   not me  friend-o  not me ,bqggnt

169,We're all going to die one day.,i think a lot of people either forget or try to ignore the fact that they are going to die one day  this becomes more evident when it comes to having a job  or when someone brings up the idea of how fucked up it is that generally you have to do something you dislike for most of your life  so you can keep living  which is mostly doing something you dislike  most people have been so conditioned to the idea that you have to  work hard  to earn the right to live  which is ridiculous  we're all going to die one day so why do we  as a society  make the time we spend alive unnecessarily unenjoyable  we have the resources to take care of all of our basic needs without too much strain and yet  people frown at the idea of universal basic income  it's so sad that most people have been conditioned to love their slavery so much so that when they come across someone who doesn't want to be a slave they call them lazy and a leech  but why  we're all going to die  what's the point of spending our time alive chasing money  which is really only paper we choose to give value collectively  i honestly would rather die than live my life this way  because what would be the point    amp x200b   everyday i remind myself that i'm going to die one day  and when i face this fact  it becomes hard for me to waste my time doing something i hate for money  which has no ability to make me truly happy  in a better society  from a young age children will be given the space to explore their talents and what they're passionate about so that when they grow up  that will be their vocation  one person who seemed to really understand this idea was  alan watts https youtu be vcfb4jsgtmw  and he inspired me to spend my time doing  what i enjoy https soundcloud com remedy97 van-gogh  instead of chasing paper ,bno8i1

175,Letter to my coworkers,to my coworkers and management   work is making my life miserable  you don't have to make it even worse   i don't give a damn about productivity  i don't care how many phones i test and or repair in an hour  i dread the working day and i just want to go home or throw myself out of the window  i'm about to snap at any second   i hate being at the office early even if there's nothing to do for an entire hour  and then you put the blame on me if i  slack off  and i don't get on  doing something useful  fuck off  will you  this is not my house  i don't care about this place  i don't care about profits  i don't care that the  machine  works  i work tirelessly to do everything in half  i  work like a cat  in that i will undoubtedly take longer breaks  poop on company time and  play  as much as i can with clocking in and out  for example  only doing it after i begin to microwave food  prepare my lunch  and never going to the bathroom when i'm clocked out  i only work at a good pace if i have my zionist boss watching me as a prison guard watches over his her inmates  and even then i mostly simulate doing anything or lie about my productivity rates   there are weeks where there's no work at all  and others where we can't keep on  flexibility  you call it  adaptation  we have to learn to  do other things  so when there's nothing to do we can just sweep the floor  organize our desks a thousand times  and take on others' jobs  or we just have to become automata  seeking only to produce more and more to the point of exhaustion   but why  have you ever wondered about the why of it all  ignorance truly is bliss  that's the lesson i'm getting  you are working hard  putting the blame on others  and complying to every order  and even so  guess what  all of that is meaningless and only serves the purpose of making a disgusting man richer than he is  the planet more polluted  people becoming more stressed out  that's your daily life  fellow workers  i don't get how you can live with that  orwellian doublethink  like when one of you tries to teach me ways to be more productive  i just want him to fuck off and ask him  are you seriously trying to make me work even harder for nothing but a shitty pay  in this anxiety-filled environment  for a man that supports an apartheid state  but you wouldn't compute that  you just go on with your lives  like nothing's going on  gym this  party that  holidays  netflix and bs  i envy you  i really do  i also consume media and have hobbies  but damned be me if i ever alienate myself like that  they say people are anxious  but what i constantly see is people that can miraculously detach themselves from any kind of structural-level of questioning  focus on the individual level and be filled with energy and motivation  hell  some of you are even friendly to the boss  zen buddhists to the core   what strikes me the most about doublethink is that you  management  while being a worker like the rest of us  still comply to every order and have no problem kicking your coworkers' asses around and treating them badly to be in good terms with the boss  bootlicker pragmatism  you should encourage us to live  slack off  but instead  you are totally fine being the front face of exploitation and anxiety  i get it  the boss is a piece of shit that can fire you at any moment  you were just following orders and getting paid  right  how can you be happy with that   oh  and this is the best part  bosses and management are like bff  referring to themselves as  we  and to the rest of us as  them  there's also a subtle condescending attitude  where they  jokingly  call us ableist terms  or things like  dogs   human trash   bags of shit  homophobic and racist comments passing by like  jokes  hatred toward muslim and black people  i can't stand it  even more knowing that the boss is a zionist  you  my coworkers  go on with that  congratulations  however  this is better than thinking you are friends with your boss  at least i notice the distance   indifference  ignorance  lack of critical thinking  ableism  racism  shitty attitudes  heck  i constantly get to receive  advice  and rebukes from a coworker  in a condescending manner  of course  because people love those 5 minutes of power to vent off  doing the same task as i am because  i'm not doing it right  hell no i'm not  i'm trying to sabotage as much as i can while not putting my survival at risk  can't you notice  i skip testing stuff or i do it without paying attention  i steal supplies  accessories  i slack off  i browse reddit  the news  i try to recover the time and energy this asshole is stealing from me  and i try to cheat society as much as i know how  the same society that would let you rot in the streets  you idiots  i don't owe anyone of you anything  but i still am not a piece of shit and i understand the stresses of work  i never complain about your work and i treat you with patience and respect  why can't you do the same  your lack of solidarity amazes me  you are quick to throw others under a bus whenever the opportunity arises  most of you are quicker even trying to shift the blame to others if it's not clear who fucked up in something  egoists to the brink  still  i respect you  i'm the stupid here  i should just become an apathetic narcissist and focus on my own life  that seems to be the key to happiness in this wrecked world    ----  this is going to be my letter of resigning to my coworkers when i'm done with the bullshit ,bq2xot

179,Interesting fact about the minimum wage since 1970,a few weeks back i created a bit of controversy by suggesting the minimum wage should be set at  45 not  7 25 as it is now  or even  15 as some union activists are demanding  a few folks thought this idea was outrageous  so i have been doing some more research and guess what i discovered  basically  that is what took place in the stock market    my suggestion was that the minimum wage needed to go up by 35 times from  1 45 to make up for the depreciation of the dollar since 1970  guess whose price actually did go up -- an astonishing by 34 times since 1970     the dow jones industrial average    amp x200b    change in the price of the dow jones industrial average since 1970  source  macrotrends https i redd it vgsqrtmyzsy21 png   that's right  although people think it is absurd to suggest the minimum wage should rise to reflect the loss of purchasing power of the dollar  almost no one seems to notice that the djia has risen almost exactly as much as it would have taken to offset the depreciation of the purchasing power of the dollar since 1970   wage slavery doesn't work for wage slaves  that's why they call it slavery ,bptx79

183,Corporate work is little different from farming commodity goods,i've come to regard the farming of goods that sell on commodities markets as absurd   it takes away your control over prices and forces you into the  get big or get out  mentality of agri-bussiness con-men   it leaves you relying on insurance and subsidies to weather bad price years  not to mention the insecurity costs of herbicides  pesticides  and fertilizers that come with monocropping  when you could instead be growing and selling a diverse range of produce and fruit to your regional buyers   so how is pursuing training and work experience in a specialty for improved corporate  or even government for that matter  employability any different   i've considering this as i look forward  to developing yet another tech or adding another degree to my cv in order to get work   the wages of employment are almost always just another form of commodity pricing   you're time and life are the commodity of course   the opportunity cost is what you could be doing instead to both enrich yourself and your community   unfortunately  too few communities offer the structure and maturity to support this kind of life approach   access to workshops  to land  to raw materials  or to experts and apprenticeships is a rare privilege when you look at the vast number of people in the world who inhabit disrupted and disfunctional communities   that's just the world we've inherited   i think about this and wonder if maybe i should just skip the crap and spend some years doing a trade like musical instrument repair which can reliably become an independent income   there are a number of trades that i've pursued but simply lack the money to turn into anything more than hobbies ,bp8lkn

Then I found this sub.,  i m 31  the first major career type job i had was as a janitor for a state run facility  i did 6 years of that  the job included cleaning up bodily fluids  cigarette butts and receptacles  cleaning patient rooms  stuff like that  the  profession  i found was demeaning to me  after some negative workplace relationships and leadership being subpar i left that job of 6 years  i took 2 years off to focus on myself and hopefully learn some more skills  when i was ready to go back into the workforce i told my mother my feelings about that kind of work but what i said basically went in one ear and out of the other  several months down the line she asked me what my plans are  i said i have no idea  then she suggested janitorial work  i started filling with rage at that      i cannot be more clear in my feelings for that type of job  i hate it  i hate it so much  i hate cleaning up piss and shit for 12 dollars an hour  i hate cleaning infectious rooms and areas with no hazard pay  i hate getting up at 5am to commute in one of the worst counties to commute  basically  this type of job drains me mentally and physically and i am so serious when i say i would rather die than pick up another cigarette butt  the whole thing about my  profession  is that it caters to people but guess what  if people would clean up after themselves my job would be nonexistent     but i still do it  i m miserable  but at least everyone s toilets are clean      i thought i was the only one that felt like this  everyone has the mentality that work is normal and expected of you to contribute to society  i fail to see how my profession accomplishes this      saying all of this brings me to this point  thank you r antiwork  i thought i was the only one being overwhelmed by  duty  and expectations  i ve been lurking for a few days and i can honestly say you guys have helped me so much  the fact that there are like-minded people who feel like work is draining and sometimes useless and all-the-time unfair helps me to see other sides of the same story  i ve been in therapy because i thought something was wrong with me  why can t i find a job i like  why can t i get paid more for doing a somewhat important job  why do people who sit behind desks all day make a lot more money than i do  i m the one breathing in chemicals all day  i m the one swinging a mop until my shoulders are busted  i thought these questions were wrong and i was trying to figure out why i was the only one who was seeing this bullshit     sorry for rambling  and also for formatting as i m on mobile  but all i can say is thank you to this sub  you have helped me realize that i might not be so broken after all ,bq6eh1
195,Thinking outside the box on wage labor and wages,i have been noticing that a very vocal minority of persons on r antiwork insists workers wages should never rise more than inflation  one person even suggests it makes it more difficult to convince republican-leaning voters to support  common sense reforms  when i propose a minimum wage equal to the exchange value it had in 1970    gt you  ever argue with a republican and you're making arguments for common  sense reforms like medicare for all and a minimum wage that tracks with  inflation and they counter with  well where does it end     gt     gt this stupid ass argument is why they say that shit  people like you exist   if this is the sort of objections made to a modest increase in the minimum wage to  100 000 per year  how then do we answer the objection that we can't reduce hours of labor by half  to address climate change and inequality because such a reduction would cut workers' wages and leave them in poverty    we seem fucked either way  don't cut hours by half and climate change will cause a massive global catastrophe  do cut hours and no one can live on  7 25   9 75 or even  15 an hour    something has to give   perhaps it should be the box we keep thinking inside of ,bq791d

202,"When you think about it, having a career is ridiculous",a bunch of effort dumped into work just to make money  a lot of people think   oh if i just work hard enough and i make myself likeable  i'll move up the corporate ladder and get rich   everyone  society  parents  and teachers  trick you into thinking getting a college degree and having a steady job career means you made it  no it fucking doesn't  why do i need a job or a career  just because it makes successful  can't believe i fucking fell for this shit  i wish i just skipped college altogether and focused doing my own shit that way i wouldn't have been saddled with debt  now i'm stuck with debt that i have to pay off  don't even get me started with getting a car loan or mortgage    office politics is a thing  middle aged women love to gossip since they're past the college age drunkedness and are so bored at home  power hungry men try to backstab you at any moment in order to look good and get brownie points for a future promotion  you have to broker alliances to even consider moving up  sticking to yourself only makes you look like a loner  where people will just generate gossip or take advantage of you  once you move up the ladder  you receive marginal pay increases but double the amount of responsibilities and duties  your bosses are always on your ass and you gotta deal with potentially rebellious subordinates that you gotta keep in line or else your boss will demote you  fire you  or cut your pay  it only gets worse as you move up since the stakes are raised  this added stress is one of the reasons why managers always intrude into your personal life  they're only looking out for themselves and are looking to see who is the most vulnerable-looking or easily manipulated to work outside of their prescribed schedule  show some balls and be ready to assert a firm  no  in real life before they even text you  don't show them you are someone that always follows orders ,bq7eqq

207,What Is The Purpose Or Meaning Of Life If It Isn't Work?,sorry if this is a little outside the range of the normal anti-work threads  something got me thinking a day or two ago there has been talk in my city of a recycling plant closing down that employs mostly people with physical mental disabilities  some of their families have been pretty upset and they're trying to keep it going and several of them have said  it gives them a purpose in their lives  and the fact that they are unlikely to be employed anywhere else or have reasons to leave their house anymore if the plant closes down  even for an anti-work guy like me it's hard to come up with an argument against this  myself i hate work but if i didn't have a job i wouldn't even leave my house probably and then what would happen ,br3qsd

223,The reason why most people don't seem to mind working.,is because they have no real hobbies or interests  all they do in their free time is lazy  recreational things like watching tv and drinking  most of us are guilty of this as well because in what little free time we have it's the end of the day after a full shift and we don't have the time or energy to do anything above relaxing media consumption  the amount of memes i see about watching endless netflix sessions should prove this    i have people tell me that they were bored when they were unemployed or if they won the lottery they would go back to work   i think it's because they have no challenging hobbies or interests that require skill or effort  they just bum around in their free time and even the laziest people would be bored with no sense of purpose  even if you are unemployed  you have no money to really do anything so you can't develop much in the way of skills and you certainly can't travel anywhere too far from your town or city   if we only had more free time people could discover a whole world of things to do  there are far more skills  arts  hobbies  crafts and things to do than any one person could even scratch the surface of in a single lifetime  even with unlimited free time  many people take decades to master a single skill such as a language  an instrument  writing novels  martial arts  building things etc   i think it's a horrifying injustice that so much human potential is wasted with people believing its better to do mindlessly dull  soul drainingly boring and unfulfilling repetitive grunt work for almost no pay off besides small amounts of disposable income that is no where near the hours wasted and time lost  just for the sake of not  being bored  or  having nothing to do  i really hope in a few hundred years  or hopefully decades  we look back on this age as the insanity that it really is ,bnlacp

233,The System is Fucked,tl dr   after being thrust into a post-employment world  the protagonist discovers that the system wasn t set up to help him  but rather entrap him  as he begins to rebel against it  he discovers the only way to deal with a system that s designed to fuck him is to fuck it right back   earlier this year i was laid off from a  66k  per year job  i immediately filed for unemployment insurance  for the first time in my life  only to discover my state s ui benefit maxes out at  500 per week for a maximum of six months    to add insult to injury  i found out that my ui check would be reduced by 80  of any wages i earned in any given week    don t even get me started on how long it took to even begin receiving the benefit  or the mandatory  waiting week  that added an additional seven days to an already drawn-out process    anyway  let s do some math    right now i m earning the equivalent of  12 50 an hour at 40 hours per week for doing nothing  keeping in mind this is less than 40  of what i had been making when i was employed  if i earned any more than  15 65 an hour  still less than half of what i had been making  my ui benefit would be reduced to  0    so  effectively  at  15 65 an hour i would  really  be earning  3 15 per hour  after you deduct the  12 50 an hour i get for doing nothing    this makes accepting a job for any less than  25- 30 an hour absolutely pointless  hell  i would have to make at least  19 75 an hour just to be making more than minimum wage  again  when you subtract the  12 50   so what has been my response  first off  i minimized my monthly expenses as much as i could  this included no longer paying the  600  in credit card bills i was dealing with each month    i could make an entirely separate post about how i was throwing  7 200 per year at about  30 000 in credit card debt  but because of high interest rates it was still going to take me about nine years to pay it all off  at a total cost of over  65 000 literally almost an entire year s salary  not to mention  despite 100  on-time payments on my credit report  my credit score had been stuck at around 600 for several years  so i couldn t even get a lower-interest consolidation loan believe me  i tried  i m honestly considering bankruptcy at this point  i d rather spend seven years with shit credit  it was already shit anyway  and  not  have to pay  600 per month than to continue working my ass off to throw over 10  of my pre-tax income at my debt for the next nine years   but i digress   eventually i was able to reduce my monthly expenses by about 40  but that still didn t bridge the gap between the income i had been making and the income i m making now    so what did i do   i found alternative  i e  non-w-2  sources of support for myself  i won t go into further detail  as i would hate to possibly admit to any possibly unethical or  even worse  possibly illegal behavior  suffice it to say  i figured out how to bridge the gap    what s crazy is that the system all but forced my hand in all of this  i lost my good job through no fault of my own  and expected there to be a support system  unemployment insurance  a system my employer had paid into on my behalf for years  capable of getting me through what i expected to be a brief period of unemployment    but instead  i found i could only draw about 40  of my previous salary in benefits  and were i to take a job earning any more than about 49  of my previous salary i could draw a big fat zero    so i had to cut back on my expenses  a process made easier by the machinations of yet another component of the system  the debt-industrial complex  whose excessive interest rates and brutal  if opaque   credit score  formulations made it a no-brainer to simply default on my debts    then i had to figure out how to sneak money past the watchful eye of my state s ui department  all so i could maintain something vaguely close to the standard of living i had grown accustomed to  or in capitalist propaganda terms   earned  prior to being laid off    and the funniest part of all  the real irony in this whole situation  is that the very mechanisms that were supposed to keep me in line  ui  fico scores  have put me in a position to learn how to subvert the system    now i have three months of ui remaining  and i m doing everything in my power to ensure i never have to return to wage slavery  or debt slavery  again    oh  and did i mention the free health insurance  never again am i going to spend  25 on a doctor s visit copay  or  10 on a prescription  or 20  on an overpriced specialist or hospital visit  not when i can get all of that and more for free   and before anyone chides me for   taking advantage  of the system  i ve been paying over 20  of my income in taxes for years and years  damn right i m going to take advantage of it    i fucking paid for it    thank you for coming to my ted talk ,bpmnvj

236,Retirement. LOL,i'm just thinking how impossible retirement seems   i've been working full time jobs for the last 12 yrs or so  plus part time 7 years before that  and i have nothing to show for it   still looking for that  right job for me   never have been able to keep more that  200 or  300 in savings because of bills  debt  medical  housing and food costs   the only retirement i have is a 401k account and a state retirement account  both of which i can't touch  one of which will instantly drain the employer match like it was never even there  totalling maybe  6k altogether   seriously  how the hell is this life remotely sustainable  i have health problems and chronic pain from office jobs plus genetic disorders  mental issues  i'm not even 30 yet   i'm thinking my life looks like this  wage slave until death or around 75 or 80 yrs old  at that point i will have to commit some sort of felony to go to jail to keep a roof over my head and food in my old tummy    i just thought i'd share these thoughts and angst  it's so laughable  the u s  is bs ,bpieou

240,"I hope one day modern day work is viewed as an antiquated, obsolete institution like slavery, racial discrimination etc.",you know how you talk about things humans used to consider normal in the past  which modern society completely or partially rejects  well  i think the concept of work the way it exists today  will completely change and people will look back at it the same way we look back at slavery today   the good news is that in many western countries  governments and corporations have started realising how obsolete and unproductive 8  hours of compulsory work minimum 5 days week is and work schedules slowly become more flexible   also fuck the people who say  well if humans don't work  what are they going to do all day  really  you are such a bland  boring  uncreative fuck you can't imagine life without wage-slavery  well let me explain what people are going to do in work-free societies  they are going to live more happily knowing they don't depend on forced labour which occupies most of their time just so they can survive and they will have free time to pursue creative hobbies and interests  as well as engage in social activities  activism and further educate themselves   nah  50  hours week of data entry for minimum wage is much more interesting ,bqn4f1

242,Joe Rogan rant.,i'm a frequent listener of joe rogans podcast  which i really like most of the time  one thing he does that drives me nuts though is he'll have another comedian on  and they'll talk about how being a comedian is great and how they couldn't ever work a  real job  he'll then go on to lecture about how anyone can do it  they just have to try harder  this comes across as condescending  and niave to me  for one  no one wants to work a  real job  but some people didn't get lucky or don't want to take the shot to be the 1 in 1000 people that makes enough money as a comedian to have a comfortable life  how many comedians do you think we can support  if everyone decided to be a professional comedian who would make all of the food  produce all of the goods  repair our infrastructure  and so on  don't get me wrong  i love joe rogans comedy  but he doesn't account for how insanely lucky you have to be to end up like him  hardwork is a factor of success  but a much bigger factor is getting lucky ,br6wyw
243,I used to think there was something wrong with me.,i've been severely depressed as long as i can remember  i've been formally diagnosed with recurrent major depressive disorder and have been on many different medications  nothing works    i realize now that medication will likely never work because this is it  this is my life  i wake up  go to work  and use the few hours i have at home to enjoy my life escaping reality because if i can't experience something different from the constant  boring  painful  day to day bullshit i can't see myself not taking my own life    even then  it's always in my mind  and it's always seen as such a release  the only form of real freedom i can imagine    my friend asked me last night what my worst fear was and i couldn't give him an answer  but my worst fear is that this is the way it's going to be  i'll always feel this way  for the rest of my life i'll wake up  go to work doing something i don't like  come home and mourn my life's potential  go to bed  and do it all over again tomorrow  and this will never change because it's the only way things work and i'm too afraid of hurting other people to end my life    i'm scared that i'll never get better  things will never get better ,bqvqsg
244,There is no such thing as an enjoyable job for 99.9% of the population,all jobs eventually turns to shit over time  take those people in hollywood as an example  do you actually think those a-listers hollywood actors and actresses love doing what they do if they aren't paid to do it  they might be eager to  work cheap when they were enthusiastic young men and women but they will eventually grow tired of it  pretty much all of them are doing it for the money  and a few are doing it for their fans     maybe you could be one of the lucky selected few working in stem field that you are really passionate since young and working is such a joy for you  perhaps you work in nasa and discovering a new star or whatever excites you  but for the rest of us working in paper pushing white collar jobs or blue collar jobs our work simple sucks  it always suck and always will be  i absolutely refuse to believe there is such a thing called  a fulfilling career  for the general population ,bquo8v
245,I stopped going to work so I can do what I enjoy.,i've always been of the opinion that it's better to live a short life full of what i enjoy doing  than live a long life full of things i don't like doing  work  so i stopped going to work so i can focus on studying counselling and also mainly make music  the past few months i've been writing a lot of songs and i've really enjoyed it  i managed to put a few songs together with a main theme through out and now i have a complete album i created  it's called  'going nowhere' https soundcloud com remedy97 lost in remedy97 sets going-nowhere  and it's basically about a character who starts of very depressed about his life and the fact that he has to work a shitty job and through out the album his perspective changes and he becomes free  so at the beginning he feels that he has no purpose or direction  he is going nowhere  but at the end he realises that there is no destination in life  there is just  this moment  now-here    amp x200b   it'd be cool if you  listened to it https soundcloud com remedy97 lost in remedy97 sets going-nowhere  it would also be cool if you didn't   i just wanted to share something i enjoyed creating  ,bqheww

248,White collar work is useless,so i m a recent college grad  first generation  low income  relatively good grades  three year grad  etc  i just landed a salaried career in a nonprofit that s been in the news lately for some truly shady shit    my pay is garbage for all the responsibilities of course  and i was supposed to be paid yesterday but nobody gives a shit and apparently the boss doesn t care unless you pester him  it s not like i have student loan payments due tomorrow   point is i feel useless and helpless every day i m here  my talents aren t being utilized  i d kill to be a writer or an academic someday  but if you have a skill that can t be sold to shareholders in some way in this capitalist hell s ape you basically don t matter  white collar jobs are the ultimate manifestation of the machine that is our hypercapitalist society and being in the  middle class  is one gigantic joke myth    sorry if this doesn t make sense  i m just pissed bc i want my fucking money ,bjhnq3
249,What about financial independence and early retirement?,much of work nowadays is glorified slavery  but there is an escape and i think it is found in frugal living and investing   i am a childfree antinatalist so i don't have any children and don't follow the traditional life script of marriage  have children  get a mortgage  and become a wage slave    having children in a capitalist society is economic suicide   it is possible to live a frugal and environmentally friendly childfree lifestyle and save enough to retire early ,bjh3p7

257,There's Hope,this is a rant i've had on my mind for a few weeks now as i've been lurking in this sub  and i apologize if its semantics aren't fully on point  i haven't spent a lot of time hashing this out  i'm just kind of hoping you all can see what i mean  this is not an attack on anything or anyone nor is there any anger or frustration behind it  only the desire for us all to lead happier lives   i first want to say that i empathize with all of you  i am anti-work in the sense that i don't believe in forced wage slavery and i think people's avocations should be their vocations if they so choose  i think the current quasi-capitalist system is a biased sham  however  there's a lot of really  really negative stuff in this feed  it's as if most of you are just waiting to retire or die  being miserable for every second of your workday and spending every free moment dreading the next workday  to reiterate i totally empathize  and i'm not here to tell you that it's all sunshine and rainbows  in fact i'm here to tell you that a lot of aspects of your job  or most jobs  are kind of shit  but you don't have to completely give in to that   i work a minimum-wage job where i put in between ten and twenty-five hours a week as a pizza chef and occasionally an arcade game attendant  and a second job where i drive for a notoriously shitty food delivery service  both jobs have abysmal aspects to them that i dread  however  i've learned to find joy and purpose for both jobs  getting people their food  helping them out with games  seeing people's reactions when i fix something for them  even just helping my co-workers with their tasks is rewarding  is it rewarding because the company cares about me at all  no  i'm just a cog in their machine  easily replaceable  i don't believe in the current capitalist system  and i don't believe in a minimum wage that isn't a living wage  etc  etc   howevrr  my job is rewarding because i found a company that has a bottom line i can support  delivering and or producing quality products for customers  to me  it's a matter of personal vindication - i succeed at my job because i've decided i am providing for myself and providing a necessary srtvice  and sometimes that's enough to excuse the pain  it can be for you  too  if you choose  the power of positive thinking and all that jazz  you may not want to work at all and that's fine  we're all here wanting to make that happen  but having a grudge against your job isn't gonna make your bad job disappear  what can disappear is your negativity  you have that power  if you don't  see a shaman or a therapist or a pastor or a friend or whatever    you only live once  my friends  stick to your ideals  but do not let them cloud your skies too darkly  we can't choose to opt out of the system  but we can choose not to let the system affect  or infect  our bodies with negativity    that's all  i hope you have a pleasant evening ,bkfe4m

275,Just had my dreams pissed all over.,granted though my mother did have some valid points   she can't support me forever   told her i wanted to quit my job  got told off and that i needed to get a full time job or at least more hours   told her i wanted to live in a van  that i didn't agree with the full time working philosphy  that i didn't think i would ever own a house  could she see me having  350k  spare with any job i worked  think is you don't even get to keep your house to give to your kids in this system  it's counted as an asset against you so you get less government support  plus you have a house  you're stuck  want to leave  you need a house pet sitter  plus still got a mortgage and some utilities    amp x200b   sure  she probably see's this as a pipe dream from her lazy 29 year old  and granted i am 'lazy'  she thinks it ridiculous that a 29 year old would live in a van  i get this sentiment  i'd want a nice van i could cart myself and my cat in around  don't want to abandon him  he's my responsibility and i love him lt 3    and it would at least have to be paid off  i'd probably need odd jobs until i win the lottery  how desolate is the alternative though  get a house  date  have kids  granted they're adorable  dress like other people  act like other people  smile and be happy that you're employed  being super friendly with the boss so you're in their good books  oh yeah  i like them  let's let them keep their job  even in doing this  or attempting it  it's not cheap in australia  you'd want like  30k for a van  easily  80k  new  and still not 4x4   10k to get it 'off grid' and fitted out  then you still have to pay to run it  which would probably chew out the max  300 a week we'd get in welfare  which is often your weekly rent around here    amp x200b   realistically it's probably a pipe dream  i'd need the money  then i'd need upkeep petrol  i like how bob wells  of cheaprvliving  put's it though  you get a big house  all the utilities  you're trading freedom for comfort   granted i might like these some day   only way i could see doing it is having the money first somehow  then just doing it and saying see-ya  but by then somebody will be saying don't be stupid get a deposit on a house  then get the house and keep a job and pay  300  a week so you'll have it outright in 30 years  then you can sell it for a caravan and travel if you're still alive at likely 70 years so you can then get your full measly pension from the government  though i can see the point in a house  it's really just a way to park your money and have 'security' as well as a place to fill up with stuff  though i want a farm    amp x200b   seems whatever way we do it we're fucked ,bk2hdy

327,Work=Serve=slavery. Some thoughts.,i've been thinking on and off about the nature of work these days  specifically how you could probably change the notion of working  into serving  now serving to me seems that it wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing  we should serve our community  no one is an island  i don't think anyone needs to work full time with our population levels  but if you try to be a blacksmith and a doctor  you'll get a shitty blacksmith and a shitty doctor  so specializing makes sense to me    amp x200b   some people will just never be good at serving  some people that aren't the best  the most intelligent  or able physically mentally at serving might ironically have to take the little skill required jobs that let's them serve and assist like retail  administration  food service    amp x200b   the problem in our society as a culture today is that we've  i think  got this toxic culture of 'dog eat dog'  'everyone has to work' that leads to everyone being pissed off  stressed and lashing out to self-aggrandize themselves and act entitled the moment they feel they can and their reputation won't suffer  or it will and they don't care  when it doesn't have to be this way  the way we have the current system is the rich have much and poor have little  and instead of 'serving' we 'work'  we work under other people  government systems  faceless corporations to whom we sell out time and energy  tl dr esoterically  i think we're being fucked up  so that the rich remain powerful and we are all beholden to our god the dollar    amp x200b   i believe if we had a system in which people if not lovingly  then agreeably  served their communities we'd all be happier  now here's the caveat  and were we've gone wrong  we don't  say farm enough potatoes so that logically everyone wanting potatoes has them  though on the odd week you might miss out because we're running a little low for some reason  though normally there's enough that some small amount do go to rot but that's the cycle of life  now we have a system were by we have lot's of potatoes  but we also have so many vendors  we have more then we need as a community  we literally toss them in the bin rather then say give them away  so those potatoes don't lose their monetary value  because everyone's selling potato's  sell them to me cheaper  we literally poison those potatoes to that people can't salvage them  because people who get them for free won't pay for them  this is just one scenario of how we've gone wrong    amp x200b   then let's go along and say we've farmed enough potatoes to feed the community  we don't really want a horde of it going to waste so we don't farm to many  we might branch out some if so inclined to other fruits and vegetable as per the communities need  but if the community doesn't need them  why do any more work  we only serve really 5 hours a day but six days a week or so  this would be a decent system    amp x200b   i feel i could write an essay  but this is just one thought  i'm sure all you guys on here probably have similar thinking  oddly enough this is probably were some religions have things right  religions are very very good schemes in teaching and enforcing societal values  like valuing the things you have    amp x200b   tl dr  we're prompted to be a wasteful consumerist society that worships the almighty 'dollar'  we're forced to 'work' churning out crap while being deceived into valuing and buying crap  when we really need so very little and just better notions of what 'happy' and 'meaningful' lives are  religions can be good for indoctrinating these sorts of value systems  or really really not  nobody really needs to work  people should agreeably 'serve' the community and get paid adequately for it  if you have little or no way to serve  you should see get paid a comfortable wage that let's you live in society ,bkwse9
