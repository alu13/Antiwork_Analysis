0,View from Golgotha,"Y Axis sun...over my head, I look into the vista.

Millions and millions of teeth shining at me...

Happy ...

On antidepressants and anti perspirants....

In the distance....the red ocean...the ocean of student loans, ones sees little life rafts ... still clinging onto the hope... that the  dreamcoast is just a few miles away... just a little bit more...yeah....stay positive bro!

Ahhh...Positivity... the sweet Xyklon B of Gen X, Y and Z ....

Old farts playing golf....

Country clubs, rotting teeth.... adult diapers...

Old man takes a swing with his 6 Iron.


"" Maybe you should work hard young man... why... when I was your age... I was already on my way.... to...""

My mind doesn't register any ironies now...

I just see a rotten flesh stick talking to me.... selling me the same rotten fruit....

Old man... it ain't 1986 bro....

Maybe you should Read- Maxxx Bro and learn something about how fucked up the dream is today...

Old farts don't care.... 

Just a little more elbow grease son... spit and polish Boi.... atta boiii....


Every where I see from this viewpoint... I see a damn jail cell...

Any direction... North, west, east, queef, south.... everywhere....


A jail....

Two angry armed men with pistols and badges come to meet me....

"" You are being evicted for not paying monies ....""

"" Politically incorrect nasal breath...""

"" SJW inappropriate vegan juice...""

A prison industrial complex as far as the eye can see....

For the smallest of infractions... 6x9 for life.

Two beds, a shit hole with water sink and a embittered young man on the top bed, who might want to make sweet love to my rear end....

Everywhere you see.... a jail cell... a bill.... a call from collections... a police car siren.... handcuffs....

Work you must buddy!

""WORK !!!"" screams the sky.

That's the only way out son....just to keep your mouth above the water... to breathe...

"" Maybe its neurotransmitters Bakerz.... have you looked into psychotherapy.... Anti depressants... hmmmm....?!""

Bro.... you ain't ain't seein what I see from my  Y- Axis perspective ...

All I see is a trap....

An Illuminati trap, made by rich old farts in cloaks and masks...

Underneath the all seeing Eye...


Maybe I really do need colonic cleanse therapy... ....you know Toxins and stuff.... maybe it's the Toxins.... colon Toxins that make me see these things....that other don't see.

I heard black coffee enemas are good as well....

Once those Toxins flush away....

All my worries will go....

And with Zoloft, Lexapro and camomile tea....

ECT and aromatherapy....

I might see the light....

And smile....

I would like to smile.....

As the view from this Calgary is kinda bleak Bro!

Shit there is a crow sitting on my shoulder...

He trying to bite my ear....

Take it easy bro!

Fak mayn... this shit hurts...!


Fak crows mayn....!

Fak!

5,I'm starting my first job on Tuesday and the thought of it makes me want to curl up in to a ball and cry,"(Prelude) I've been very lucky to have the privilege of being in the position of not having to work until now. Being a student, my parents always told me that as long as I'm in school (which is a demon in and of itself) that I don't have to work. Well, I've been off since July and start school back in January and I've finally found a job that I start on Tuesday.

(Main text) I hate the idea of working a job I don't want to do because I have to ""do something"". ""Strapping up your boots and joining the rest of society"" is the one of the cringiest statements I've ever heard. Sure, nobody wants to work shitty jobs, yadda yadda yadda. But seeing the concept as fundamentally wrong and knowing that things such as UBI could change the fabric of society is heartbreaking.

The system has felt rigged ever since I can remember. Maybe seeking alternative schools of thought, reading about fundamentally superior societies and indulging in psychedelics have ruined me. I know I am awake, but at what cost?

9,"Question for r/antiwork members: Do you try to become close friends with co-workers, or stay detached and not communicate with them outside of a job?","I'm predicting that the answers are going to be split pretty evenly. Personally, I strongly disagree with the idea of being friends with co-workers (in this context, I define ""friends"" as people you regularly share personal details with, talk to on your own time, hang out with, etc.)
Work environments are very toxic, so there's no way I want anything coming from there to find its way into my life. Also, at this job I currently work at, I say almost nothing but see almost everything. And these things I constantly see strongly reinforce my anti-work ideals. 
Like, if I had a dollar for every time I saw somebody shit talk their ""work friend"" as if they were total strangers, then I would quit that job.

That's not to say it's utterly impossible to make a friend there, and if you do do that, then no disrespect to you. But, I do think it's very unlikely that you'll find true friends in such a nasty environment and that you'll be better off looking almost anywhere else.

12,Should I self-employ(?) in a lower-cost country to work less? Help? (long...),"Free time is extremely important to me, therefore I want to work as little as possible to live a quality life, and I **despise** the idea of working a shitty job for someone else even if it pays a lot! So I guess I am ""anti-work""*;* all I want in life is to be left alone to enjoy my hobbies, not caring about spending on anything all that unnecessary (eating out, cable TV, car, fancy smartphone etc.), really just a decent house, utilities/internet, computer and food.

&amp;#x200B;

My passions / main hobbies are programming (game dev) and 2D art/animation, plenty of experience in both through pushing my free time to the max when I was younger. People keep insisting I ""get a job"" doing one of those. But I know for sure the game development and ""*software engineering*"" industries are both absolute shitshows in their own right, and while I know less about the industry side of art/animation I can't imagine it being much better. Good pay doesn't matter to me if I have to waste my life on it.

&amp;#x200B;

As of right now, I am doing 2 things to make a bit of money: I earn a relatively small amount of money (for living, USA) per month off of commissions, and a Patreon. Combined they make me \~$800 per month (depends on how many commissions I do, so sometimes more), for drawing casually or commissions only 1-3 hours each day, sometimes &lt;1hr if I'm not feeling it. So, I'm hardly even working. But then again I only turned 18 just a few months ago, so I don't need to make enough to live on my own quite yet.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the second, in addition to the above, I started selling the games I develop. I released my first *commercial* game on Steam almost 5 months ago and I surprisingly*(???)* made almost $4.5k in sales so far, after only 7 months of development a few hours a day when I felt like it(nowhere near full time). Not much to live on, but consider the following:

&amp;#x200B;

patreon/comission drawing: \~$800 \* 12 = $9600

game development: \~$750 \* 12 = $9000

&amp;#x200B;

So, \*if things everything keeps going the way it is\*, continuing just making games and drawing stuff or whatever... I would make \*around\* 18.6k per year. Now, if I were to try and make a living with this in the USA, that would be complete and utter shit... but here's my idea: don't live in the USA. And I definitely don't mean anywhere in a 3rd world-y place(no offense) like India, Africa, China, middle east etc. but instead somewhere in Europe.

&amp;#x200B;

It looks like [Bulgaria is a good candidate](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=United+States&amp;country2=Bulgaria&amp;city1=Houston%2C+TX&amp;city2=Sofia), not a $10/day hellhole, but cheap enough and pretty decent if you have the right amount of money. Could cost even less outside of Sofia. I'm also currently quite a bit of money since I still live with my parents, so I'd have a significant boost at the beginning to make the move there. BUT, the real trick is that I will be making money as if I'm someone the USA, by selling to people living in the USA (who are willing to pay more for things than people in Bulgaria). So what would be a shitty living there, becomes the equivalent of a middle-class or upper middle-class quality of life here, without having to work a traditional job.

&amp;#x200B;

\----------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

However, I'm sure plenty of people have thought about something somewhat similar to this. Is there a problem? Because I have this really weird gut feeling that I'm missing something **EXTREMELY** major in my plan. Provided I don't fuck up and lose my patrons or all my games are forevermore the worst flops in history (In any case, even a few k less than $18,000 could be a very comfy life in Bulgaria), is this a viable idea? Like something I can actually do provided I'm willing to make the sacrifice of, well, living in Bulgaria.

13,8 ideas for people who want to abolish work right now,"I decided to expand one of my comments into a post. I hope people find it helpful.

1. Start your own movement to abolish wage slavery. As strange as this might seem, you don't need a hundreds of people to start a movement. 

2. Pick a day. A Monday morning, for instance, go with ten of your friends and block a busy intersection. You will block the intersection in order to prevent workers from getting to work that day to create surplus value. 

NOTE: You will almost certainly piss everyone off.  They are just trying to get to work and will be very angry you are standing in their way. You will almost certainly be arrested. Delay your arrest as long as you can in order to tie up traffic as long as possible. 

3 No one will understand why you did this. Explain it to them. It might help to bring leaflets explaining your action so that people have something to read while stuck in traffic. 

4. Next week pick another intersection. Rinse. Repeat. Continue until people figure out that wage slavery is as wrong as segregation was in the sixties. Continue until people figure out that wage slavery is as wrong as Apartheid was in the nineties. For some reason people don't think that it's immoral to threaten workers with starvation if they don't produce surplus value. You are going to change this. 

5. You don't need organizations. You don't need unions. You don't need self described revolutionaries. They will come as people join with your effort. Don't ask these useless people for directions. If anyone had directions to give, they would already be in the streets with you. 

6. Don't expect anyone to agree with you. Don't expect support. 

7. Do expect allies to condemn you and second guess you. You will be doing something they think can't be done, should not be attempted.

8. You will be on your own. The only way anyone ever gets anything done.

Stand up and continue the fight against angst, poverty, meaninglessness and above all the Y-Axis as I earn my 9.99 before tax for this hour of misery.

Hurting knees, swollen feet, aching back, sore neck... next customer please.... 14.78 please.

I hate the Y- Axis.


Everyday when I put on my shoes and leave the safety and comfort of the X - Axis ( my futon), I feel like an axial Christ... who carries his cross of personal debt, bills and insurance payments, everyday on my old Honda Accord, which I drive over the I-30 highway ( Via Dolorosa ) to the Calgary, which is my cashier job at Wail-Mart.

Fuck Manager Pilates....!

Everyday.... a cruxifixction.

Everyday...a struggle to keep a roof on my head and a mattress underneath my back, both lying across the Y-Axis.

I hate this Axis.

I want to sleep mayn...

I want to be an X -Axis Christ.... sleeping and listening to synthwave... I don't like standing up.

Science says that standing for long periods of time is as damaging as smoking two packs of cigarettes...

Ancient man slept in his cave all day long.

He never had to pay GEICO ... or go the Calgary to wage slave to afford his cave...

Wild animals bit his ass....


But all was good.


All is not good with me.

Fak this damn Y- Axis mayn....!


I wish I was an amoeba....

They would get pissed at me when my girlfriend and I went on weekend trips to a state over or something. Apparently we should only travel when we’re both retired. I met people that were retiring that had never left the state. Aside from heading over to the one south of us a couple of times.

63,Human Nature and the Internet [Some thoughts],"On the internet, people do all kinds of unpaid *work* for random strangers. On r/tipofmytongue the masters of google-fu will find you pretty much anything you don't quite remember. On r/translator they will help you translate anything to any language. On r/snackexchange people send each other candy from wherever they live. Wholesome stuff, as reddit would put it. 
 
(Just a few hours ago I helped translate an old German letter, and 3 other people chimed in and added what they know, corrected a few mistakes I made, and together we ""decoded"" the whole thing for someone we don't know.)
 
Or look at YouTube. In the first 4 or 5 years, you couldn't make any money off of youtube, and yet it was full of original content, some of it pretty entertaining. People also write for Blogs, make music, produce educational videos, write code and give honest feedback. Reddit contributors and Mods don't get paid, and yet thousands of communities thrive. The whole bittorrent community relies on anonymous cooperation. *You help me, and I'll help the next guy.*
 
Human nature is to help each other. We all want to use our talents and knowledge to help other humans, share our thoughts, contribute, occasionally show some love. The argument that people would do nothing all day without the money incentive is bizarre. Sure, we would do less, but I don't see anything wrong with that. Like 90% of the time ^(*CITATION NEEDED) lazyness is efficiency, the very thing capitalism claims to be.

64,accepting the necessity and coping with work and a something some of you might find useful.,"So i've been on welfarefor about two years now and I just want to say that no matter whether or you have a job or not, work is a part of your daily life And it's just something you have to to accept. Work is neccessary part of life. get over it. You have to work in your life, if even only a little a bit. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you think there is such a thing as life without work, you are mistaken, I can tell you from my experience of not being employed for two years that work is an integral aspect of daily life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even little things are work, getting up out of the bed is work, doing the dishes is work. Cooking your food is work. cleaning your house is work. maintaining your bicycle/car/motorbike/ is work. mowing the lawn is work. prepping the house for bushfire/hurricane/whatever is work. Shaving in the morning is work. Brushing your teeth is work. hell even going to the toilet to take a shit is work.

&amp;#x200B;

Work is natural, look at prehistoric man, having to hunt, craft shelter, make clothing and fire. or medieval peasants working in communities, or even just animals, often in a constant struggle just to survive by avoiding predators/catching prey.

&amp;#x200B;

NO matter what you do work will always exist in your life, the elimination of a job won't in and of itself make you happy. What you need, is a reason to live. a reason why you get up out of bed, do the dishes, cook your food.  shave and brush you teeth, taking pride in certain work like cleaning is alright but ultimately you need a reason to live. That's what makes the little amount of work you will have if you don't have a job seem like a breeze and will make you spend your freetime on what you truly care about if you do have a job.  Job or no Job, the most important thing to have is a reason to live.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said I get that a lot of you are more concerned about what you guys call wagetheft and believe in things like automisation being used to decrease the need for work and decreasing production of things be a worthy sacrifice for say a four day work week and I agree with all of that. If all it took was shops being open 9-5 four or three days a week to have a 3-4day working week that would be great, during my two years of being unemployed I did a factory job that was 40 hours a week, got paid 17 dollars an hour (australian) and it was a 7 am start, so I know what it's like to do those shitty jobs and I definitely think if the hours for them can be reduced or if they can even be fully automised that would be great. but my point is  that work in and of itself is a part of life that you just have to accept.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said I'd like to share what my future plan is as it may prove useful to some of you. My current plan is to get a job as a security guard (just waiting for my application to finish up) and save up some money to buy a cheap block of land, then move onto that cheap block of land (we're talking about 10,000 dollars more or less.) and commute from it, living on that block of land ( you'd obviously want to build a bungalow or I guess you could buy a second hand caravan.) 

then once you've saved up enough money buy the second block of land, (not something to expensive 50-70k most, usd that would probably be something like 45-60k). Then sell the first block of land and start building a permanent dwelling on it (I'm planning on building basically a tiny home but a bit bigger, sticking to simple construction principles and hiring tradies where necessary. Also planning on getting a barn for about 5k to have a space for to store vehicles, tools, and just a general work room for projects and stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously the dwelling will cost money (i'd say about 40-60k, maybe 70k) and will take a long time to complete. but once it's done i'm planning on setting it up with solar electricity and water, tank water, only thing I will pay for is sewrage fee. (might also keep connections to water grid too.) basically an off the grid smaller than average simplistically built house with a barn. (and connections to the grid just in case.)

76,The Joy of Leaving a Job,"I've never gotten an exhilarating high from taking a job. Since graduating from university I've only been able to find employment in customer service or sales positions completely unrelated to my major. At one point I got excited, but that feeling usually dissipated after a few days. My disdain for work always makes itself known in my lateness. I'll get up with more than enough time to get ready but I'll sit on my bed thinking and savoring the final moments before I have to leave for work, savoring my moments of freedom. This usually results in me being late to my job, because I hate my job. 

I wasn't always late to work. When I worked in a restaurant in high school I had no problem being on time. Same for college, but I was living at home and worked part time. 

Full time work in customer service pretty much destroys my mental health. I've only been in call center or sales positions. I end up hating the work of dealing with other people. I spent all my time in school studying, doing research, writing papers and so forth. I naturally assumed that I would find a career doing similar work. I figured worst case scenario I'd get a job as someone doing market research for a company or doing statistical analyses of our sales processes. Not what I'd truly want to do but something I could do and at least make 40 or 50 or 60k per year. 

Instead I've found nothing of the sort. I'm in my late twenties and have never been able to find a job paying more than $15 per hour. Currently making less than that. It drives me up the wall. 

None of my jobs have required skills that I did not possess by the time I was in 3rd or 4th grade. I wish I was joking. My parents put me through private schools and a private university and I feel their money has truly been wasted. At the very least, I wish I would've had at least one teacher or authority figure who would've impressed upon me that making money was the most important thing. 

It's fucked up. I feel like the boomer generation tried to fix this but failed. Many of them had ""great"" jobs in terms of money. They made tons of money but still weren't happy, so they encouraged millenials to ""follow your dreams"" instead of worrying about making a living. For me that meant studying politics and society at an intense level and trying to find and understand solutions to improve the human condition. I often feel my studies could be utilized within a company, not just in the larger scheme of society or politics, but it seems like this is futile. Everyone I know who followed their dreams has a shitty life (w exception of computer science ppl). Everyone I know who focused on business or finance is now living comfortably. I hate this so much. I feel more than capable to do a higher wage higher skilled job but it's just not possible at this time. 

The result ends in demoralization. Not only do I feel I won't get a good job, but I can't even focus or care about my shitty job. Half of my income goes to rent. Another third or more goes to bills. I'm left with like $200 a month to spend on non essentials. And at the end of the day I'm lucky. Because I know if I fail I can move back in w my parents to get on my feet. I know many people don't have that luxury. 

But for me, I've had the pleasure 3 times in my life of leaving a job. Twice I quit, once I was fired. I can honestly say that the days I've left my job have been the happiest in my life. Better than graduation from high school or college. Better than losing my virginity or falling in love. Better than, with few exceptions, peak moments of an amazing concert. When I leave a job without another lined up I feel truly free and at peace. My world once again has potential. I can think about the future.  Sure I'll have to get another job, but I can actually think about it.

I read earlier today on an r/dataisbeautiful post that the average job seeker has to apply to between 150 and 250 jobs before finding one. This has largely been my experience. Everyone says don't leave your job til you find something else, but where do you find the time to apply to so many jobs while you are working? I'm braindead after work. I am decently educated and spend my days in tech support telling people to unplug their routers or to press the settings button on their iPhone. That's it, it's frustrating work (because most people have extreme difficulty finding the power cable for their router and the settings icon on their iphone) but relatively easy at the end of the day.

77,Off-Grid Invitation,"If anyone else has become disillusioned with living in the capitalist world, I'd like to invite you to the off-grid project that me and a few other redditors are planning. Within a year we will establish an entirely self-sufficient and moneyless commune.

The moral and ethical foundation of our commune are as follows:

1. Antinatalism: We believe that imposing existence opon something non-existent is immoral and contrary to the freedom that anarchists stand for.

2. Collective ownership of the means of production: Private property is abolished but personal property remains.

3. Anarchism: Absolutely no hierarchy. The only freedoms we don't tolerate are the freedoms to opress or dominate others.

4. Zero discrimination: No matter what background you are from, you are always welcome. Regardless of your gender, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation etc

5. Non-agression principle: Do not harm anyone unless they harm you or another person.

6. No cultism or religious fanaticism: Personal beliefs are fine but do not impose them on others.

7. Causing minimal environmental damage and if possible try to adopt veganism. (This one is not essential though)

If you accept these 7 principles, you are more than welcome to join. Our numbers are still small but with your support we have the potential to grow into the anarcho-communist society so many dream about.

If you're interested, PM me for further details and discussion. If you do have further recommendations or objections to any of the 7 principles, I'd still be more than happy to discuss them.",False,9ktb6r,human942,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/9ktb6r/offgrid_invitation/,24,1

84,"Trying to answer ""What else would you do?""","Usually, when I share my views that people shouldn't be working like they do, I'll get the question ""If you didn't work all day, what else would you do?""  


When people ask this, they think they're helping me out.  Most people assume that work itself isn't the problem, but that I *personally* am just mismatched to what I'm currently doing. If I said ""I'd spend my days travelling"", they'll tell me to research travel jobs, find one that I like, get the prerequisites needed in terms of education and experience, and then do it. If I said ""I want to read more"", it would be something steering me towards a book-related job. And, again, this usually comes from good intentions. 

Here's something like what I'd say at first:

&gt;I ""haven't found the right job"" because there is no right job. As I see it, the system itself, the one that requires work, is deranged. First you pick a task. Then you make sure it's a task that will make a very rich person even richer. Then, do that task for 40+ hours a week, and accept that all other aspects of your existence will center around that task. In fact, you and your life will be dedicated to facilitating the task, not the other way around. If you choose not to, then you'll have no access to food, shelter and all social amenities. And supposedly this system is awesome because you (kind of slightly) have a choice of task.    
&gt;  
&gt;So, let's put aside that tiny freedom of choice. It's *everything else* I'm opposed to. I don't want to talk about the task because *everything else* looms so huge for me. I want a society where *everything else* has changed, but for the time being I'm stuck in this one. Why don't *you* want to change this as well??

Honest as it is, I've learned that answer comes across as pretty jarring, and kills the conversation.  It's like they asked me ""What's your favorite color?"" and I responded with ""Colors are a lie! Burn the system!"" 

So I started to wonder if there was/is some way to express myself while keeping the conversation going, actually answering their question, and having useful dialogue. I've made this much more generic than what I actually say nowadays, but this is the gist of it.

&gt;When I'd come back to work from long vacations, I'd feel great. The vacations gave me a chance to experience something else, and to remember there's life beyond whatever I'd been focusing on. For the first few days back, those memories were powerful enough that I *knew* there was a world outside of work. I *knew* that if I walked out the door and never came back, there was still a world there. It wouldn't be fun or easy getting by in that world without my job, but at least I knew it existed. For those few days, I remembered that I had that choice, and have always had that choice.   
&gt;  
&gt;Armed with that choice so prominent in my head, I would work for those first few days and *know* I was doing the task at hand because I *chose* to. My actions were deliberate. I didn't ""waste time"" at work because I would remember it was my own time to begin with. That feeling of self-determination, of not just understanding but *knowing* on a visceral level that I am in control of my own life, that's what I want. All the time. The actual job is less important to me.  
&gt;  
&gt;Unfortunately, I can't get that feeling continuously in the way work is set up in most of society. Again, it's not the ""going on vacation"" part that I crave, but the feeling of being refreshed regularly. Most jobs, no matter what industry, are against giving you a continuous feeling of being refreshed. Instead, they keep you focused on the task at hand, so much so that you forget there's anything else out there; so much so that you forget who *you* are outside of the job.   
Rather than living like that, I pursue other hobbies. Many for their own sake, but also because doing these things (for limited amounts of time) is enough to remind me that I exist outside work; that work is a task I choose to do and that if I let go of the task, I will still thrive. If I did any of those hobbies exclusively and turned it into conventional full-time work, it would defeat (possibly even pervert) the purpose.  
&gt;  
&gt;I've spent the last decade trying to balance conventional ""work"" with that sense of refreshed, relaxed, purposeful ""work"". It means I clock in much fewer hours than is typical, but I spend that extra time on myself, giving me that relaxed focus and purpose. It hasn't been easy, but, to me, it has been worthwhile. This is what I spend my time 'extra' time doing, and there's nothing else I'd rather do.

It's still totally honest, but keeps the conversation going, and it usually goes to something positive :)",False,9ltedn,IKeepForgetting,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/9ltedn/trying_to_answer_what_else_would_you_do/,8,1

91,[META] Frequently Asked Questions - Design choices - The future,"Earlier this year r/antiwork had a bit over 2000 subscribers, but we're growing fast! At this rate we'll hit 10k before the end of 2018. 

That's pretty cool; hi and welcome to all the new people! 

Thanks for the shoutout on r/nostupidquestions, I think that's where the majority of new subscribers came from.

  

**Questions**

With more and more people subscribing, the same old questions will pop up regularly. So I was thinking maybe it's time to use the wiki page, or at least put a link in the sidebar to a thread that answers frequently asked questions. My English isn't that great, so I hope you lovely bastards can help me out here. Some questions  that need ""official"" answers:  

* Why do you want to end work? Why ""antiwork""?
* But without work society can't function! / You guys are just lazy, right?
* Are you anarchists? / Are you communists?
* Why do you blame capitalism?
* I hate my job, what should I do?

There are threads where we individually commented on these questions, I just hope we can find the most useful and to-the-point answers and put them all in one place. Feel free to re-phrase the questions or add new ones. 

 

**Design choices**

I'm the guy who did the design on the ""old reddit"", I'm also responsible for the ""new reddit"" look of this sub. So if any of you have any ideas or wishes on what to add or change, just send me a PM. 

 Maybe it's just me, but one thing I'm not quite happy with is our banner. Creatives out there, if you feel like spending an hour or so designing a proper banner for this sub, please give it a shot. 

  

**The Future (just some thoughts...)**

 I thought maybe we could have a weekly stickied ""chat"" thread, were we can share and discuss thoughts that don't deserve a new thread. 

There's also the currently unsed user-flair option. Should we activate it? Or would it clutter the screen for no good reason?

One more thing. I hope this sub will never turn away from discussion, like LateStageCapitalism did. I personally don't want an antiwork safe space, I think we can handle the occasional disagreement.

To already be giving my life and time away to establishments that don't give a fuck and pay as minimum as they can?

I guess still people don't even understand that I don't care about money that much, either. I think that is also a part of my antiwork influences. I rarely ever want to buy anything besides the basic essentials like food and internet. The most extra thing I spend my money on is weed. So, I don't want to work to be rich.

And because I don't want a ""normal"" job, they don't help me at all and think I'm some weird extremo anarchist. Then they bring up that I will be poor. So, that's what matters? I'll be poor, but at least I won't be stressed, suicidal, anxious, and fucked up like every time I try to go to school or get a job.

122,Space for Right-Wing AntiWorkers?,"So I just found this sub and I noticed that it has a heavy left-wing and anarchist bent. I do understand this, and I am at least pleased that people here recognize communist societies often created pointless jobs in order to have complete employment and as a reason to make sure everyone got paid. 

That being said, I think many of the problems of our modern society, with it's bullshit jobs, is more than mere ""capitalism"". Or I guess another way to put it is that I don't think right wing thought and capitalism must necessarily be considered to be joined at the hip. In my opinion, capitalism is actually closer to communism than either of those philosophies are to a healthy state of being. A lot of things have brought me to this view over the years. One is the proto-fascist philosopher Julius Evola who once described capitalism and communism as placing primary emphasis on things, rather than on values. In other words I think the problem of work relates more to materialism specifically than it does capitalism in particular, though I think modern capitalism has many problems in and of itself. Here's the quote in particular that impacted me: 

&gt;Nothing is more evident than that modern capitalism is just as subversive as Marxism. The materialistic view of life on which both systems are based is identical; both of their ideals are qualitatively identical, including the premises connected to a world the center of which is constituted of technology, science, production, ‘productivity,’ and ‘consumption.’ And as long as we only talk about economic classes, profit, salaries, and production, and as long as we believe that real human progress is determined by a particular system of distribution of wealth and goods, and that, generally speaking, human progress is measured by the degree of wealth or indigence — then we are not even close to what is essential, even though new theories, beyond Marxism and capitalism, might be formulated.” – Julius Evola (Men Among the Ruins, p. 166)

I think the main reason I dislike work isn't that I dislike activity, it is that I feel I have only worked meaningless and pointless job. For example, I always enjoyed school thoroughly. Even when it was tough, I always felt like I was working towards something meaningful, I enjoyed learning new things and increasing my knowledge base. For me, the main sense of frustration is going to private schools, going to a good college, and then graduating and being unable to get a job that pays more than $13-15 per hour while these jobs (which say the prefer people with bachelor's degrees) do not really require any work that couldn't be done by someone with a 4th grade education. I legitimately wish I was kidding when I said that. I've been stuck in call center jobs and sales jobs since graduating, and while I may have picked a dumb degree, I was reassured by all of my professors that I'd definitely be able to get a good job and so forth. And this has emphatically not happened, there's absolutely no job I've done since graduating college that I would not have been physically and intellectually capable to do after high school, or even before graduating high school tbh. 

It's infuriating, but at the same time I don't completely hate work. I think that if I was able to be in a better job more aligned with my interests that I could excel. At one time I worked as a museum tour guide and although the pay was awful, I actually really enjoyed the job itself. I don't think I would hate work if I had the correct job, and I think a lot of other people feel the same way. I have friends who don't hate their jobs, and I have others who are like me and want to quit. The main issue seems to be money, my friends who make good money really don't seem to mind their jobs and some, like those in programming or finance, seem to derive pleasure from it. Many of them get long lunch breaks, the ability to work from home, etc. I think if I had a job like that, I wouldn't hate working every day during the week. 

I know this has become kind of a rant, I guess just curious what other people here think

125,"Just a random thought, but I just really wish money played a much smaller role in society...","I really do...I honestly feel like most of our plights related to jobs would almost all disappear if money didn't play such a large role. I'll be honest, my ideal society is a world where every adult is given a house, food, and every other basic necessity of life, and they'll only need money to buy luxuries; money would be seen as something ""extra"" and imo I think that's the right way to go. 

I know this seems highly unlikely, but there's nothing wrong with a little wishful thinking. Hopefully, one day things will be better, but in the meantime let's all just keep doing our thing and taking care of ourselves, both physically **and especially** mentally.
