0,"Well, I think I’m ready to say fuck it", call center job  though i am privileged to work from home as the last month  with quotas that put your job performance in the hands of others depending on if they comply with scheduling workers comp appointments  if i don t schedule x amount of people and work y cases i am penalized for lack of performance  kicker is that you can work a significant amount of cases and schedule less that a half of them  it s dependent of if you can reach the patient  if they are willing to schedule  and a bunch of other factors like state laws  not to mention the network loses connection so that interferes with performance  it s just shitty  in regards to my job  i feel like that guy from office space  i ve been working there as my first full time job for the last year and i feel like i m just dead inside because of it  i thought that it was the long commute wearing me down  it is actually fact that the job is a boring day after fucking day same pile of shitty work  so  i think i m just done  it s boring  not intellectually stimulating at all  i am stuck at a desk for 8hrs a day  the security i have is a regular  and decent  paycheck and health insurance  i am young  smart  and well-appearing human  i feel that i am resourceful enough to make money in other ways  my boyfriend advised i can always hop on his health insurance  we ve been together 6 years now and i m pretty sure the only reason we aren t engaged is due to that we have been getting out of debt for the last 2 years while also spending more than we should on little things here and there   anyway  i believe my bills are minimal enough that i could make due until november  all of my october bills are paid   i know i could call my creditors and let them know if i needed extension days for later in november for bills at the beginning of the month  i live in a nice middle-upper middle class area where being a nanny and grocery delivery service person is possible  i ve applied back w my old part time position as well due to that the work i had there was at least bearable  though low wage  idk  stand-by  i ll let you folks know how it goes ,d97c4v

5,I skipped two of my three classes today to combat stress yet I still feel extremely guilty,i have an especially brutal schedule on thursdays  two classes in the morning  one from 9 00-10 15am and the other from 10 30-11 45am  next  i have a gap from 11 45am-1 30pm  last class is out at 2 45pm  knowing that i couldn't cope with the first two  i made i deal with myself that i would wake up later and then go to the library and chill out  then only go to the last one  since i like it    i told my buddy i wouldn't be in class number two today and his response was  lol does it even matter you don't ever pay attention anyway  like yeah  dude  i don't because i don't know what the hell is going on in the class  it goes all right over my head  i think this exchange ruined the rest of my day  he just said the root cause of the problem is my not paying attention  it fucking isn't  i'm tired  exhausted  and dead   i'm tired of these schedules  i'm tired of the homework  i'm mad at the job i had to get to afford nice things i'd like for myself    why can't we ever rest  why can't i ever have peace  this is not a kind of life i can keep on living without losing my mind  i feel sorry for those of you forced to work full time  because that's ten times worse than my predicament ,d9stcs

7,Am I missing something in this Labour proposal for a 4 day work week? Throwing this out there.,crosspost  in this forbes article  a labour guy drops some interesting fine print in the labour party proposal for a 4 day work week  businesses are expected to increase productivity of labor first    as the article puts it    gt the implementation of mcdonnell s plan will depend on companies successfully automating processes and improving worker productivity   in other words  the labour party is promising that after workers have been rendered redundant by improvements in the productivity of labor  the party will allow a modest reduction of hours to four days    but no promise appears forthcoming on converting the increased productivity of the last 90 years into free time   do i have this right   read  this is what u k  business owners think of a four-day workweek  https www forbes com sites barnabylashbrooke 2019 09 27 this-is-what-uk-business-owners-think-of-four-day-work-weeks ,da1vzm
8,The process of calling in sick at my workplace,you need to go to the doctor the first day of being sick to get a sickness certificate  so if you are so sick that you can't leave the house it's an unexcused absence  at the doctors office you have to wait 2 hours till you can see a doctor  and while you're waiting you're catching all the germs from other sick people in the waiting room that also want their sickness certificate  sometimes i think if you're healthy enough to go through that ordeal you might as well show up to work and make everyone sick out of spite  because i've been at my workplace for less than three months  all sick days are unpaid    i am thankful that healthcare is free in my country  but because going to the doctor is free  all the boss scumbags are paranoid that someone might take a sick day without being sick ,d9if06
9,"Friday, day 5/5 , slow business and Bored",sitting here at my corporate sales job   watching my boss play on his phone while i take the most bullshit calls in existence  just no motivation  don t give a fuck about this shit anymore   if i didn t have bills i would be bouncing so fast    freest country in the world my ass ,da1nuh
10,I had to leave work 2 hours early because my chest was starting to hurt badly,when i told my boss  all he said was  are you here tomorrow   i said  yes   and then he said  let us know well ahead of time if you won't be able to make it  don't go bailing out 2 hours before your shift starts   i know employers and companies don't care about your health or wellbeing but he didn't have to make it so obvious lmao  what a great work culture we've created  where health problems are just an inconvenience  i don't get it  i haven't had to leave early until now  and i've always given notice way ahead of time for any shifts i won't be able to cover   just ranting  laying on my bed now and hoping that this pain goes away on its own because i can't afford to go to the hospital,dal3lu
11,Thought I'd finally found good work,but that really doesn't exist anymore  huh  been at a new job for roughly 3 months  it paid well for what it was  and i felt like i was getting paid fairly enough for what i was doing and i was actually satisfied about it  which i thought was surprising   of course  management changes just ruined all of that for me  they cut my wages but claimed i would get roughly the same amount due to tips  i definitely did not  new manager got mad at me for not coming in this friday when i said beforehand i was never available on fridays and even emailed her when the shift came up  she never answered me  they ended up cutting my days too  now i barely work  whenever i try to talk to the manager i just get brushed off  i think it's time to take my leave ,dagibo
12,My boss says mental breakdowns help you grow,they're a normal part of a job  so you just cry and move on      killmenow,d8pxbt
13,My boss thinks it's normal and expected to work +12 hours a day and I'm pissed,i am an hourly teacher and i have already told my boss if she schedules me to teach  it needs to be only two shifts a day  not the whole because it's too fucking tiring and i'm not a morning person  so basically everyday i work from 1 30pm to 9pm and now she wants me to cover for another coworker in the mornings too   when i told her  when am i gonna sleep and rest  she laughed and said  i teach everyday from 7 am till 9pm  why can't you  i'm so fucking pissed  if i had another job lined up  i wouldn't even bother going back ,d8p0w4
14,Can I Convince HR to Just Freaking Lay Me Off?,i honestly don't see how anyone unless they are just a social mega star could thrive in the rotten work situation that i'm in    i am in a small agency and our it department is just me and two other guys   the it director and the network admin   two years ago  they changed my job role and expected me to just know this network shit when my background is data analytics and software support   the admin began my new boss and this guy went to town uses his new found powers against me   he would get pissed if i asked him for help on what felt like a very simple thing to him and take it out on me by writing me up if i made one small mistake   even worse   i now have to submit an hour by hour log report showing that i am constantly busy   problem is the role has 90  downtime and they are like that's not our problem  figure out on your own how to contribute   i'm a very shy person so getting out among the people and forging my own path is terrifying   i feel i only have one card to play   convince hr that my job isn't needed and lay me off   the anxiety over not having a clear job role plus working under this asshole boss has me constantly having panic attacks at work and calling in sick more and more   the advice to just get another job doesn't cut it   i've tried for years to switch jobs   it's hard as hell to beat competition on a job interview these days ,d8wo6f
15,I am becoming increasingly depressed,last time i held a long term job  1 year  i felt what most everyone did  i was afraid of starting somewhere new and disappointed that i'd lose my free time and i wasn't exactly happy  but my displeasure plateaued after about three weeks  however  90 days into this new job and i feel as if i'm slipping deeper and deeper every single day and i can't stop it  every night becomes a little bit more excruciating and every morning i have to ask myself why i'm still bothering to wake up    i'm honestly not sure what to do  i'm at a loss  unfortunately  i need to leave the state asap for numerous personal reasons as well as a strong dislike for it in general  so i need at least another four months of steady income to make it to the marker where i can leave finally  while there is a definite end goal  february of 2020  i'm becoming increasingly concerned that i'm not going to make it there  the ultimate idea is to hop to alaska for a year or two then finally leave the country  but alaska needs to be the first step and i'm at the earliest of steps with barely anything in my savings  i'm not sure i can endure another five months of this if the downward trend keeps going  i suppose this is just a rant vent post but this community is the one that dragged me from the right to the left and i feel like you all understand very well ,d8ggy0
16,having a tough day. wrote this up on company time., slices    -----------------  the world is filled with beautiful things  why am i here at work   there are books to read  food to eat  places to explore  why am i here at work   there are people that need help  i need help  work doesn't help  why am i here   why   to get money  money  i like nice food and cool things  but i am chained to it  i can't escape it   cant i just care for my plants  read about cool things  and be with my wife and daughter   i want to study about plants  about fungi  about weather  about computers  about statistics   i want to ride my bicycle and learn and cook and help   and yet i am here  working  working for a machine that will spit me out when i am no longer considered useful   working in order to  enjoy  a small amount of time away from work   working in the hope that one day i won't need to work  that i can pursue my interests solely under time constraints and not financial ones   when will that day come  will it ever come  when will i be finished exchanging my life for money   this exchange is leeching strength from my body  mind  and soul  when will it end   i'm a coward because five days a week  i wake up and willingly trade away another slice of my life ,d8n989

18,I have hope, i have hope in the young generation  my generation  that they will get fed up and do something about it  or maybe do nothing about it   the bullshit education systems   bankers   politicians   housing crisis   minimum wages that can barely support one child  you get the point  they don't really have much to lose   if they can barely make ends meet do you really think they will care that much about modern conveniences like being able to stream 4k video  i hope they will be able to see the vastness of the planet earth and its natural resources that can be harnessed to meet the needs of everyone in their lifetime    when will enough ever be enough   isn't it time that humanity sat back and enjoyed the fruits of their labor    does the world truly need more engineers   the major reason there was  a lot of progress in technology during the world wars is that before that  most people were happy with having a roof over their head   food to eat and lots of free time and new technology wouldn't affect their day to day lives     if the young decided not to do the grunt work of society it would simply collapse without firing a single bullet   there is no other way  see hong kong protests  police would refuse to fight people seeking their freedom from bullshit laws etc ,d99hnn
19,The need to get a job both infuriates me and terrifies me.,maybe this post will be too venty  if so it can be deleted    i recently dropped out of college after a few talks with my dad  and he told me it would be better if i came home  and that college wasn't doing any good for me  i'm incredibly grateful that my dad is so kind  but on the day i came back  he told me about a job prospect he heard about  i just brushed it off at the time  but internally i felt terrified and almost shut down  i've had 3 jobs before  all of which were in fast food  so obviously they were awful  but that's given me a lasting impression and has made me absolutely terrified of any sort of job  i tell him that i feel this way  and he just doesn't get it  he tells me that he found having a job at my age was liberating  that it gave him purpose  i tell him i feel the opposite way  and he tries to argue with me  trying to convince me i somehow don't know what i'm feeling  i think he's doing his best  but it's like there's a barrier that prevents him from considering that i have a different opinion  i feel trapped and scared because i have to get a job in order to achieve my dreams  but i don't want to      i guess there's no real end message with this post  just me getting my thoughts out there ,d9aowh

21,"updating resume, cover letter",it makes me sick figuratively speaking  also my lower eyelid is literally twitching right now as i'm writing this  it all feels so fake  i hate it  technically i have zero work experience bc i'm finishing university right now and i didn't need to work until recently  so beside my studies and 1 summer job and 1 internship i can only list my abilities which is not much honestly  just the usual bullshit  bc i had been educated in art and art history  i know  i know  and now i'm just trying to get a shitty office job   btw these jobs usually list  no experience is required  so that shouldn't be a problem    but gosh i hate this  i looked up resume examples  keywords and only picked out the ones that are mostly true about me  b ut it still feels fake    bc it is fake honestly  yes i'm genuinely caring and empathetic person  but that's when i see someone cry  or there's someone that needs some support  they could be strangers and i would still care  hell i have approached a crying girl before asking her if she is alright even though i didn't know her  but i'm not caring or empathetic when it's an entitled customer who gets off on verbally abusing employees ,d9ke4a

39,What's the deal,i feel like i made a personal revelation about how the united states works   for a place like north korea  their slave owner decided to own everything in the country and separate themselves so they can keep control   but for the united states  they found that a distasteful way of owning people   the better way is to setup lots of financial traps for people to fall into   leave them uneducated then offer them a lifelong salvery debt agreement to pay for their education   the united states strategy by comparison is almost more devious because they get their own citizens to root for the enslavement of each other  to push the rest of people off the cliff of stability so their is more room for themselves   we think we are suppose to be mean and financially cutthroat just to survive   we are being molded into mean little slaves that knock the legs out from under each other until finally we gladly accept our place as a lesser race to the people in charge the banks and the rich ,dbc0ct

44,I'll never forget an experience I had about 5 or 6 years ago,i was with a good friend of mine at the time and some of his friends  they were all in university  talking about their experience in university and how it might relate to  real world  workforce experience    back then  i was a student too  but a struggling one  i was to university on and off again  lacking any real motivation to see many of my classes to their conclusion  my mind was awash with uncertainty that graduating and getting the opportunity to get a cushy  career  might not be the end all fulfilling experience that i was expected to believe  in the conversation  one of the guys said this    if you think school is bad  just wait until you're actually start working   everyone there seemed to dishearteningly nod their heads in agreement  inferring  yes  that does suck  but no one in the group  even for a moment  questioned how absurd it was to spend the huge investment of time  money  and effort to graduate college or university only to set yourself up with a position that's even more miserable than the one you left    the conversation quickly moved elsewhere while i sat in thought for a few moments longer  realizing my fears had more validity than i thought   we're all so used to the idea of the 9-5 work week  slaving away your whole life at an incredibly dull and unrewarding job for a modest sum of money that we never question it  we're all so ready to unquestionably believe that this paradigm forced into us is the only meaningful and honest way to life a rewarding life   i know compared to some of the posts on here this one sounds pretty mundane  but even this small experience of mine has had a big impact on my life  since then i've tried to distance myself as much as i possibly can from that kind of thinking while focusing much more on understanding who i truly am  and the parts of myself and my life that genuinely fulfill me  even if i'm still a million miles away from the person i would like to be  i finally feel like i know who i am and what i want out of life ,d8so3e

58,I worked in the Oilfield the past few years it was a nightmare.,right after i graduated high school my dad got me a job in the oilfield  i didn t know what i wanted to be when i grew up and during my high school career and my parents always implied that me going to college is a long shot since they couldn t afford it at the time so i never focused on my grades    summer of 2016 my dad got me a job as an oilfield truck driver for some company i never wanna see again  40  hours a week  24 hour call including weekends  working with with people who smoked cigarettes every 15 minutes  i d come home smelling like cigarettes  oil  covered in cement dust  it was the worst  i hurt my back  my tooth chipped because of the bad diet i had on the road  burnt my arm and my left side of my torso with acid  and cut the skin of my jaw open with a grinder when i was helping a welder  and all this was for  13 50 to  14 50 an hour  to top it off the although these people were nice but the constant bullying because i was soft and mild racism made it even more miserable i was not happy and was basically going insane just force laughing at jokes and pretending to listen to conversations since i couldn t ignore these people and only to go home to do it all over again   i quit that job only to go to another oil field job as a pulling unit hand this summer of 2019   16 an hour  guaranteed weekends and no 24 hour call but it was way worse  my first week i had heat exhaustion  my body was sore and my hand joints were crippled the whole summer  i had to share a motel room with my coworker bcuz we had to work 3 1 2 hours away from home  we averaged 50-60hours a week one time we got 42 hours in 3 days   don t even get a proper lunch break and when we were done i still had to eat dinner with them and head back to the motel  the weekend was never long enough to recover  i had to see these people every minute of the day and i hated it   after my first year in the oilfield i decided to go to college in 2017 but even with the money i made that one year and a summer of 2018 i couldn t afford my third semester of 2018  the summer job i had this year was supposed put me back in school but after all that i was still several thousands of dollars off   i figured out that it didn t matter how hard i worked in that amount of time it wasn t enough to pay for school  i can t stress enough how miserable i was and how many times i ve cried this summer and the past couple years i worked with the other company  seeing my savings disappear and having every check go towards to in-state tuition  i just didn t want to live anymore  at least the way that i did then   my parents ended up owning an embroidery and we ve been living in a nice area a little outside of town for about a year now they saw and understand my misery as well as my dad working in pipeline and oilfield for almost 15 years  but they re still pressuring me make something of myself  currently i ve been unemployed for about a month  looking  for a job since i couldn t go back to school but other than the debt i still hold i never felt so relieved  i m gonna try to look for work but i m definitely getting a part time job or an easy low paying job  capitalism just isn t worth killing myself for an education or anything at least the way that i had to do it    i understand i ve made my mistakes during high school but seeing the uncertainty of my future along with not knowing what i wanted to be i didn t have any incentive to thrive knowing well that i was taking advanced classes and could ve been top ten percent  i wanna study something i like but the suffering it took just to get there and as well as it not being enough to pay for my tuition or even my to support myself i d rather take this time to act at a slower pace   p s  sorry if this was long but i just wanted to be heard  i hope you guys understand  ,d9svis
59,“But what would you do all day?”,whenever you say you hate working and wouldn t if you didn t have to  it never fails  someone says this  i find it incredibly sad that they couldn t possibly fill up their own time and need a boss to give them tasks    i ran into this when i was 15 and in school  they called my parents and me into a meeting because i seemed depressed and obviously hated being in school  my grades were fine  i just obviously hated every moment being there and was always angry  they wanted to get down to the reason why  i explained there was no one reason and nothing they could do to help me  i just hated school and that was that  then my principal asked what i d do all day if i didn t go to school  are you fucking kidding me ,dbfalo

63,Boss told us to work even harder 'for the sake of the company'. I am so FED UP.,i thought i'd share with you here my work story because you'd understand   about a year ago  i accepted job that was offered to me in a startup  looked quite great at the beginning  great people  the boss seemed nice and it was really close to where i lived   it is turning to hell  i love my coworkers and they've became good friends and they are the only reason motivating me to go to work every morning    the boss is an absolute nightmare to work with  he seems friendly but he's horrible in the workplace  everything a boss shouldn't do work related  he'd do it  slowly  i started getting more and more stressed because of it   recently  the startup is going through some big financial problems  our salary is late almost every month  yey the stress for the bills  last week  he told us in a general meeting that he doesn't know when this month's salary will be paid  we knew already dude  it's been going on for months  and that  he was asking us to work even harder  to try and close some deals   hell no  i haven't been sleeping correctly for months and the last two weeks were a nightmare because i am trying to support my family financially so i am not doing additionnal hours  not paid  because we're a startup  everyone knows we all love to work extra  i am already working the strict minimum so i can still enjoy evenings work-stress-free   honestly  i am on the verge of taking all of this to the court  i can but i don't want to do it as it means i am 'taking away' my coworkers salary for months    i booked a holiday in december and that helps me so much during the day just thinking about it   i just want for the company to close because that means i'm sure i'm gonna get my salary  from the government  for few months without even being obliged to work  i live in france  it's normal to get this   sorry for the rant  it needed to be out and i know you'd understand me ,db0cll

71,I actually thought my manager gave a shit,i have a pretty good relationship with my manager  i go to lunch with him and a few others once a week and i thought he seemed semi-interested in my life  but now i feel like he just sees me as another expendable wage slave   i'm essentially a one man department  it  and i recently had a medical issue which prevents me from driving for up to 6 months and as such will probably need to work some remote days  i let my manager know about this yesterday and his first question wasn't anything like 'how are you feeling now' or 'is there anything i can do to help out' but simply  'how soon do you think you can drive to work again  are you sure it will be that long '  his only questions were about how soon i could get back into the office and if there was some way i could convince the dmv to let me drive asap  mind you  more than half my work can be done from home   i felt so taken aback by it  it was an awkward thing to confess to my boss and for his focus to so immediately be on my physical attendance at work felt weird  the whole experience just made me reflect on other managers i've had and how i feel like none of them would have given much of a shit if i fell off a cliff or something  i dunno  i'm going to be allowed some remote work days temporarily so maybe i shouldn't complain but the whole thing just left a weird taste in my mouth ,d8pcf6
72,First week at a new job and i’m already going cray,long post  i m a frontend web developer with almost four years of working experience and a bachelor s degree in computer science  a week ago i joined a company which seemed like a good option for professional growth and a source of a pretty good income  i was really enjoying my first days working there because the office is really nice  has a shower  massage chair  lots of other cool stuff  i was provided with a very powerful pc and two wide screens  when i asked if they have any wired headphones they don t need that i could use to connect to my pc  i only have wireless headphones that i use with my phone  a guy came up to my desk a couple hours later and just gave me a box with brand new sennheiser headphones  i wasn t expecting anything like this at all  was ready to buy some headphones for work with my own money and thought i d be lucky if they would find some old headphones they don t need that i could use  i think it s worth to mention that i live in russia  and i guess all this stuff is pretty standard for europeans and americans  but i ve never worked in such good conditions before   this post is mostly oriented on people who work with something it related and can understand what i m talking about  i ve encountered some problems during my first days here and i d like to know should i blame myself for these issues and be responsible for them or it s the company s fault   a little info about the company  it s basically a dating website which was created in 2008  had some success in the beginning but wasn t really successful overall  still  they have pretty large user base which is paying for being promoted in some way expecting any attention to their personas  the site looks like it was never updated and it objectively sucks by all standards  but the company still gets a decent income generated on this site  so it continues to exist  realizing that the main site really sucks they have created different startups  side projects  which would help them create additional income on a modern market   the main reason i m telling that the company is pretty old is because many people have been working there since the beginning and i guess they are really comfortable doing the same things while getting paid   so  the problems i encountered  1  the project i had to develop had a design made in adobe illustrator  which was pretty strange since almost all designers use sketch nowadays  or at least a photoshop  i ve only seen icons that were made in illustrator and in such situations i just converted them to svg and had no problems with using the icon in a project   but here i was given a huge file made in illustrator that contained designs for the whole project   i ve tried several options for working with this type of file like avocode  figma which make it really easy for the developer to get all the static files  css rules and everything else a developer might need  i have tried many options like adobe xd  avocode  figma  zeplin  but they all had some serious issues with working with my design file  from crashes to wrong colors  that made them unusable for the current project  of course it took relatively big amount of time testing each option  trying to configure it for editing ai files and looking for possible reasons of some errors i encountered while using these tools   after that  i realize that the manager don't really care that i've never worked with a site design which was made entirely in illustrator and i had to do the task as fast as i can because managers only looked on the amount of tasks i made and the amount of time i spent to do them  and in my case i spent a lot of time simply trying to figure out the most comfortable way of working with ai mockup as a web developer then i decided to ask my manager about installing illustrator on my pc  he gave me a slack username of an employee who is dealing with this  i immediately wrote to him and asked to install illustrator asap since i can't work without illustrator on my pc  he was online and i thougth it'd be  rude to write many times  then i called him and waited for a pretty long time  he didn't answer then i asked about the location of his office desk  but he wasn't there on the next day the first thing i did is i went to his desk and finally found him  i told him that i can't start working because i need adobe illustrator installed  my manager is noticeably not happy about the whole situation and i need to start working as soon as possible  he asked my about the manager's opinion and does he think that i really need illustrator  i tell him that we discussed it many times  and he's perfectly fine with this did anyone come up to me for help that morning  no one  they started installing the program only at about 5-6 pm  turned out that guy didn't believe me about the manager being okay with me using illustrator  but still  he decided to contact him directly  to confirm that i really need this program  and  by the way  we are not allowed to use cracked software so the only way i could get this program was only through contacting him  because he activated the product only then i finally get illustrator installed  i don't know how many hours exactly passed  but i think i was waiting him and doing nothing for about 8 hours   2  second problem came up when it turned out that no one in the whole development department uses visual studio code  the most popular and objectively great program  which is lightning fast and is absolutely free  i think that most devs use it  everyone in my department was using phpstorm  i was really surprised because i was almost sure that the majority of developers uses vscode i have nothing against phpstorm  it's a very powerful tool  but it's old  slow and costs some money it wasn't a problem for me  because i didn't really care what other people use here  i only wanted to use the tool i've been using 1 5 or more years and i have lots of different plugins  key combos that help me write code fast and easy all developers sync their code with the remote server  usually after every save command i easily found a plugin by microsoft that was able to do lots of stuff  it was a plugin specifically made for remote development   after the installation  i try to set the synchronization between me and the server  i was given basic server info  username  password and personal folder  but even using all the info i was given i couldn't connect to the server and the error log was pretty vague  it was hard to tell if it's something wrong with my client or the project serveri was trying to do everything by myself  reading all the documentation but then i thought that i'm a frontend developer  i can write some backend code or do some easy server-related text  but it's out of the scope of my professionbut then i remembered that we have a lead technician  who has been working here for a long time  and he knows everything about our server and it would take 10-20 minutes of his time or maybe less to estable connection and synchronization on my vscode  i ask him to come up to my desk  and guess what i hear when he comes to me   what's that on your screen  vscode  remember   there are no good products that have no price  also  who made this thing  microsoft  ha-ha-ha  what a piece of shit  no one here uses this crap  and then he walks away  i'm destroyed by his ignorance  he really said that all open source is crap and that's a fact  and his unprofessional behavior  it was the first time we met  he knows i'm a new guy here and i don't really care what's his opinion about vscode  i love it  i've been using it for almost couple years and it's the most popular tool for writing code  way more popular than phpstorm  i think that's a good enough reason not to say these things  they're rude and really stupid  he believes that all open source projects are crap simply because nothing good can be free   i'm still stuck trying to connect to the server  but now i also understand that this guy probably considers my favorite code editor as pure crap and most probably he won't spend his time helping me to configure this awful piece of crap   anyway  he's still the only lead technician  and he's the most competent server-wise  i try to forget this crazy incident and ask him for help again   i don't remember the specific questions i asked  but he gave me the minimum info through slack  only after i asked him to help me crazy amount of times  he finally sits by my computer and tries to make a connection  he configured the connection and synchronization and spent about 15 minutes of it   on the next day the manager asks me to talk with him in a conference room   we go there  and he says that i'm trying to blame everyone but myself  when it's me who is actually accountable for all the troubles i experienced  he says that the lead technician is a great guy  and he doubts that he declined to help me   he really didn't decline but his motivation was extremely low  then he says that i'm the only special cornflakes with an editor nobody here uses and it's completely my duty to configurable the connection to the server and tech lead only has to give me the most basic server info  and nothing else  he doesn't owe me shit and he can decline any requests that are connected with my shitty editor  i must express gratitude for his help  then i say that it's a bit strange that the tech lead refuses to help with the configuration  simply because for him it would be very easy and will take up to 20 minutes  i spent about two days configuring everything by myself  not realising what half of the stuff i do does  as i do not support servers and know noting about them  i say that maybe it would be a good idea to ask the tech lead to configure server settings when someone new joins the team  it would be easy for the both sides  the manager tells me that i'm wrong and the tech lead shouldn't waste his time configuring some crazy editors they know nothing about and the developer is completely responsible for all configuration  technicians have all the rights to ignore me   i'm pretty amazed by this  because it seems to me that it's very clear and logical to ask a tech lead to set the configuration and spend 15-20 minutes rather than say that  nobody owes you shit  and in the end i spend days doing server-related things  he says that i'm the only reason that i didn't complete any tasks yet  i'm the only one to blame  and he doesn't care what kind of troubles i have  he is only interested in two things   how fast can i generate income for the company and how much income i generate at all   it feels to me that one of us is insane  and i don't know who it is  maybe i'm really not getting the point and i should shut up and deal with my shit by myself  not interrupting everyone  maybe it's normal to come up to the new employee and tell him that his favorite editor sucks and it's so shitty that nobody else is using it here  i have no desire to learn how to configure this crap   i think that the company should allow and be absolutely fine with the fact that everyone has his own preferences  favorite editors and these choices should be respected  a technical lead swearing at me for using the most popular editor is a complete fail and reveals many facts about the company  he should read the documentation for the chosen drug also  i believe that the manager have to think and count all the factors of the reality  not simply saying that  you still didn't generate any money for us and this means that you suck   the manager is also obsessed with deadlines and when telling me the deadline for my latest task he also casually informed me that the office works 24 7  in the end  i ended up spending extra 5-6 hours at work and left the office at 1 am   and  of course these extra hours i were working are completely unpaid and not listed anywhere    and they don't even consider paying me for these hours  i'm sure that if i'd ask about the money they owe me for these 6 hours  they would be very surprised that i even dare to ask about this and i'm sure i wouldn't receive anything   what should i do  listen to the manager and be a good slave   or i should run from this hell   i m sorry for such a long post rant  and again  i m from russia  so excuse me if something is hard to understand,d8xoln
73,Had a job interview today,today i had a job interview for a production manager position  at a medium size company  i was first contacted by a headhunter that got me the interview with the company looking to hire a new person    i did my due diligence  researched the company  their products  clients  etc  practiced my speech  ironed my shirt and pants  cut my hair  polish my shoes  i go there and everything seems normal  nothing unusual  i meet the hr person and the person i would be reporting to  he asks me the typical  recycled and rehearsed boring questions  and i answer them promptly  everything is going well  until the  do you have any questions for us  part  i asked how much time is spent on the floor and how much time is spent in the office on an average day  to which the person replies  8 hrs on the floor  2 hrs in the office  to which i reply  so your average day here is a 10 hour shift right  the person replies with a  yes  and saturdays are not unusual too  so i  professionally say  well  this type of position sure demands a lot of overtime  which i believe is compensated accordingly right  and the person replies with a  no  you earn a yearly salary so there is no overtime compensation    so  instead of me getting a better deal compared to my current job  i was actually getting probably something like 60 hours a week which at the end would be way less per hour    i stressed that if they wanted to continue the hiring process  i would need a written contract stating that overtime will be compensated accordingly  i shook their hands and left   this is the type of thing that makes me lose faith in work  good luck to whoever takes the job and gets exploited and their soul sucked out of them ,d993yu

78,Fuck positive psychology and self help authors, corporatism  aided by positive psychology  relies on several effective coercive persuasion techniques  similar to those often employed by cults  to meld workers into a  happy  collective  it sanctions interpersonal and psychological attacks and lavish praise to destabilize an individual s sense of self and promote compliance  it uses the coercive pressure of organized peer groups  it applies interpersonal pressure  including attacks on individuality and criticism as a form of negativity  to ensure conformity  it manipulates and controls the totality of the person s social environment to stabilize modified behaviour    chris hedges   empire of illusion  the end of literacy and the triumph of spectacle ,d903i9

85,"Working harder, getting paid less",i m a month away from finishing a contract at a seasonal resort in the canadian rocky mountains  for most of the season  i ve been working as a front desk agent with regular hours  now that the season s coming to an end  i ve had to work 2 housekeeping shifts a week    the thing that annoys me most about housekeeping  and other jobs that pay you hourly rates  is that the harder  smarter and faster you work  the less you get paid as you finish the job faster and clock off earlier    the people i work with don t see it as an incentive to work at a reasonable pace to get your hours up on quiet days  another thing that pisses me off is that these shorter days really dig into the seasonal bonus  based on up to  1 hour  which could be less due to performance    in conclusion  after 18 months on a post-university  working holiday  i hate this industry ,d96x54

87,Thinking of quitting after 3 weeks in new job,r neet  thinking of quitting after 3 weeks in job  had the worst day ever  u alexasissy  well its not even 3 full weeks yet   let me preface by saying i do have plenty of experience in retail jobs like this  and im not looking to go back to being neet until ive worked for a good 6 months and saved several thousand dollars up   so today i was 2 minutes late to work  literally 2 minutes due to abnormal traffic and my boss made an issue about it  had an angry look on her face etc  strike 1  then  i dont actually know what my boss did all day because from where i was standing i did basically everything  every task  serving all customers etc   the part time girl arrived in the afternoon in a bad mood and was basically rude to me the whole time  i had to recieve a delivery and they interrupted me about 10x to do other tasks for them  they seemed to spend the afternoon chatting and whispering   i literally did not stop all day  i was doing tasks or serving every second of the day  non stop   come end of day it was 5 to and the part timer was fiddling on the computer so i said its time to close  the whole close down process takes forever as they have a million redundant processes and systems  and i had to write so many notes because you need to write a note if you sneeze in this store  got out at 20 past  me being 2 minutes late is unacceptable but leaving 20 minutes late is fine   i missed the 5 20 bus and had to wait 45 minutes for the next one while the part timer has a car so isnt as big an issue leaving later   like  i can haul myself into work just fine  but i just felt so disrespected today  not happy at all  this is just a retail job at tge end of the day  it pays the same as other retail jobs ive done which are nowhere near as stressful   also keep in mind im on the good old  90 day trial  which means they can end my employment on 2 weeks notice at any time  now because its not long until xmas i doubt they would so that but i feel far from guarenteed in my position   maybe im overreacting but i just dont think all of this is worth it  im not happy at all ,d8jeit

99,So I talked to a life coach...,i had a free hour-long consult with a life coach last night  and thought i'd share the main takeaway she gave me about my frustrating job situation  i have been talking about going solo as a consultant with what i do  but for other life reasons  am committed to my current job for at least another year   expensive benefits and guaranteed income i need for a time    her advice to me was that i needed to understand that my job isn't negative  situations are neutral  and it's what we think about them and how we react to them that is positive or negative  so her suggestion was to work on rewiring my thought patterns so that my feelings about my job were more neutral than negative  and then devote that emotional energy i'd be saving on building my own business and solidifying my skills so i could do the healthy thing and eventually break free of this cycle   this is not a new concept to me  and is rooted in cognitive behavioral theory  i have gone through periods where i have actively tried to find gratitude for my job  and focus on the positives  just to make my time more bearable  it always lasts a week or two until my company does yet another asinine or offensive thing  and then all the negativity comes crashing back in  she says she knows the tools to help me make that a lasting change  but honestly  at her going rate  i just can't afford to take a chance on whether that is true or not  and also  it doesn't feel right for me to pretend the emperor is fully dressed  when he has no clothes  nothing changes for the better if everyone numbs themselves to reality  but otoh  nothing really ever changes in corporate america  so maybe that's just a non-starter   so if anyone has any suggestions about how to more pleasantly bide your time somewhere  or build a side gig that you want to turn into your only gig  i'd love to hear them  book recommendations especially  i gotta get off the hamster wheel of mediocrity that is corporate life ,d8mjbx

115,"I'm giving up, don't know what to do.",hi  i'm a 21 years old developer    unfortunately i had to quit school when i was 15  and i started working for many companies as a web developer      i rarely got a job for more than 1 years  just because i used to get bored very quickly and got to change job  and sometimes even technology skills      on february of this year i became a freelance  and luckily i found one big company that sometimes assigns me tasks  bug fix etc  to do  so i can earn some money  but it's not enough for me      i lived my whole life with a dream  building something mine online  no matter what it is  a casino  a game  a popular software  i just wanted to start earning passive income this way  and i kinda did it when i launched a btc faucet back in 2017 that got 67k users  unfortunately i realized that's not a sustainable business and i had to close the website after a year      i feel like i'm walking in circles  and now i'm back to that point where i need a job and money  but at the same time i don't want to say bye bye to my free time  to my daily not-stressing routine       everytime i think about working in a company i get anxiety  i'm just starting hating everything about it    i don't know what to do next  every developer i see has a full time job and he's ok with that  but i'm not  last night i googled everywhere to find a community of developers who don't have a job  lol  i don't know why  i kinda what to see people without a job earning money by projects etc  and i failed to find it  maybe because everything i want is fucking utopia      i'm sorry for the outburst  also this is my first post in this reddit community  hope you will enjoy my company here     also sorry for the english  i'm not very good at writing  i'm uneducated ,day2zg

118,Applied for disability the other day,so the long and the short of it is i was in the workforce for about 10 years  during that time i managed to develop an issue with drink  severe anxiety  and major depression  i kept telling myself to man up and keep pushing on despite the abusive shitty work environment and i kept going back to due to golden handcuffs good pay  free benefits  i kept telling myself i was the problem and i just needed to get better  constantly pushing while society and everything around me kept pushing the idea of  harder  faster  better  stronger   when i moved out of my parents house i used to be able to talk to anyone  had hundreds of aquaintances  many friends  many ambitions  the whole lot  by the time i realized i had developed all these problems i had lost all the friends i made by my own doing thanks to putting work and advancement first and this idea i had in my mind about being better thanks largely in part to my parents and upbringing    a few years ago i decided to move back to my parents but by that point i was completely far gone  i was struggling with total sobriety  replaced alcohol with weed  the anti depressants i was taking in my opinion made me worse  and overall completely lost my control over life  i sold my condo  my cars  and just about everything i had and was still left over with about 20k in debt  at this point the stress was crushing  my parents and brother kept telling me the only way to get better is to get a job and i was coming completely undone because i had been ran so ragged trying to  make it  and  get better    that's when i had a total mental break  i was smoking weed daily at that point  cut my anti depressant cold turkey  and out of the blue one day i started believing and doing some crazy shit  without getting into too much detail  i ended up arrested for felony trespassing because i went into someone's truck thinking it was my own  after being released from jail i had a couple of nice stays in the mental hospital which only made things worse and that's when i got diagnosed as bipolar    it wasn't until this point that my parents realized i needed help and were finally willing to somewhat let me back in  nowadays i'm almost 30  on probation to get the felony off my record  back on anti depressants  and now have a mood stabilizer added to the mix  i have no more emotion other than the occasional anger  no more ambition to do anything  no more willingness to find a partner  and after lurking reddit and seeing the state of the working world it's clear things are only getting worse   my family and my psychiatrist are convinced i'm bipolar and the only treatment is these meds  after my history there's no way in hell i think i'd be able to find another conventional career  and i have no where else to go  so i'm claiming bankruptcy for the 20k  i'm already on medicaid  and now hopefully i will be granted disability  i don't have the power to stand up for myself anymore and i've completely been backed into a corner    nowadays life ain't so bad  i've got a roof  bed  and food  i play video games  drink coffee   enjoy my last vice cigarettes  and ride my motorcycle daily as my therapy  i still have dark thoughts most days and what i see online mostly just reinforces them but i get by  i stay sober 2years now  and don't fear any of the stuff i used to that gave me anxiety  bad credit  dont care  can't afford a house on a single income anyway  dont care about cars anymore like i used to  health insurance  dont care  hoping to get cancer by 40  work history and how good i look on paper  i blew that up  with any digging into my medical history i will never get a job  partner  had plenty of those  never panned out  wont get one with my current status and the one good bad thing the meds do is kill my sex drive    so i guess the point of this post is this  if you feel you need to keep pushing  deep down you can't stand life the way you're living it  don't do what i did and damage yourself beyond repair  get out while you can  if you can and don't ignore your inner voice  had i done that i don't think i would be where i am today  they sell you this idea that something is wrong with you and you are imbalanced when in reality if there truly is an imbalance its because of the way we are living not because there is something physically mentally wrong with us  also be careful who you talk to and what you say  in my desperation i tried to look to doctors and police for help and that only sunk me deeper both spiritually and financially  be careful who you trust    also i felt like putting these thoughts out there just for someone else to see as i spend most days in solitude and i am not in a position to speak to my family without them jamming their opinions and advice down my throat  right now i am just doing what i need to in order to have my basic needs met because that's all i can do    i know i'll never be who i used to be thanks to the wonderful experiences i had  and there's tons more i could go on about  but i'm hoping someone out there can read this and it will be a catalyst for some self preserving action  don't let your the mold they want you to fill destroy you like it did me  thanks for reading ,dbksea
119,Employers ask about references to make sure you remain a slave,sorry for my poor english  i'm french  one of my friends lives in the us and  basically he told me that when you're looking for a job  your future employer usually asks for 2-3 references from past employment  i was shocked  is it the gestapo  what if your manager hated you  i guess you guys need to be very submissive to make sure that you get good references in case you want to quit  what a joke of a system  past employers can say whatever the hell they want    we don't have that requirement in the french system  employers don't ask any references  they just ask for a copy of your diplomas to make sure that you're qualified  although we're still wage slaves with a high unemployment rate  at least we can tell our employers to go f  themselves when we quit  that's what i did 3 years ago  it was so funny  i also locked up my manager in her office at lunch time and threw the keys in the garbage bin  she was so abusive with her staff  she got what she deserved  she tried to involve the police  they couldn't care less since there was no physical damages lol   my current employer doesn't know about it and will never know ,dbj4y9

126,The Caste System,what do y all think about the caste system   the idea is most well-known from its indian variation  but it is attested to in the following sources     hinduism  mentioned above    iran  zoroastrian myths about jam id  the avesta  and it is an idea attributed to some sasanian kings    plato   medieval arab jewish philosophy  alfarabi  avicenna  and maimonides  but particularly alfarabi and maimonides    islam  see  hierarchy and egalitarianism in islamic thought  by louise marlow    traditionalism  particularly evola  but gu non  schuon  and coomaraswamy  all paid lip-service to it   it seems pretty universal  one striking thing about medieval mythology  particularly its european variant  is the consistency of ideas across cultures  for example  the french  the english  and the irish all possess similar themes when it comes to their knightly or aristocratic mythologies   good resources on indian caste system   dras in ancient india  by ram sharan sharma  and  caste and religion in ancient india  by jayantanuja bandyopadhyaya   it seems like there was a natural tension between those predisposed to  and capable of nothing more than  productive labor  often called  dras  and the  ruling class  characterized by chivalry on the one hand  the  warrior  or ascetic knowledge  the  priest  or sometimes both  combined   our modern labor system is tellingly not the product of any one individual or group of people engineering it  it seems like the world at large simply lazily allowed the situation to progress this far  without anyone trying to exercise any agency to stop it  if you think about it  a large group of people letting whatever happens  happen  is actually the very definition of chaos   i guess my question is  how do we reinstate the caste system  a system characterized by such a hierarchical dimension  and subsequent confinement of individuals to their natures and roles  is what alfarabi called the virtuous city  see antony black s  the history of islamic political thought   without controlling the masses  by arbitrarily allowing people to accumulate wealth and start businesses  especially people who are not qualified for leadership or commerce  i e  the  vai ya  without controlling women  separate topic  but somewhat related  by letting who myatt called the magian and homo hubris  or who some people call  normies  completely dominate the cultural sphere  and its accompanying confused philosophy  by allowing democracy to exist as a form of government  by relegating all questions to indeterminacy via postmodernism  all we do is allow chaos to rule   certain people have certain natures and temperaments  other people have certain exaltations  and still others have deficiencies  these realities cannot be erased  as their variancy is natural and therefore part of nature  to ignore them is to abolish what is natural  and to usher in what is unnatural  not everyone is an  employee  and dra  by nature  but our society force-fits people into that role   religion should inform public life  people should not drink or have extramarital sex  but secularism and scientism undermine the ability of religion to control people  the very fact that people vocally disagree about so many cultural and social issues  already means that  someone   somewhere  is wrong  people are not unified in their beliefs and aims  there is therefore conflict   how do we once again institute these traditional laws into society  in a practical and forceful manner   how do we arrest the creeping tide of time  and prevent impersonal slavery  wanton lust  shallow philosophy  pseudo - spirituality   characterized  perforce  by western buddhism  abject lust   and general ignorance  from wreaking havoc on the world   corrupt regimes in africa commit genocide and starve people  young men in america voluntarily shoot strangers and casual acquaintances  and then themselves  women  as a political and cultural monolith  have more power than ever before  and contraception  normalized extramarital sex  dating  hookups  instagram  and so on  and the push for abortion  only seek to enforce this  men are now more variegated  more atheistic  humanistic  skeptical  and intellectually lazy  than ever before  people crave wealth  or they crave power  or they crave fame  and subject to rulership by their desires  the whole of society is then ruled by people  ruled by impersonal forces  this manifests as an impersonal sense of slavery  subjecting everyone unnecessarily to its non-discriminative tide   how do we stop this   armed rebellion   quitting work en masse   rhetoric   thinking through history  i am reminded that there are very few cases of things changing for the better  without forceful and sudden revolution  in fact  history is very bloody  the world  at the moment  incomplete  cannot be without conflict  therefore the apparent lack of conflict in certain sectors of the world  is just that  an appearance   wasn t the u s a  founded on a revolution  when has anything ever changed for the better without forceful and sudden revolution   or is there another way   i feel that rhetoric will only be  judo-ed  by the collective ego of most people  changing the status quo is difficult  without changing the status quo   let me know your thoughts   i know  and care very little  about any kind of political philosophy from the time of the renaissance  or the enlightenment  my concern is mainly reinstating the caste system  from the first principles put forth by thinkers like alfarabi and maimonides  and secondarily  plato  i do recognize that the entire system was encapsulated and manifested within the summary epic  the  mah bh rata  and subsequently elucidated in the pur as   let us turn back time ,d8y11i

132,"Would you still be ""anti-work"" under my buddy's circumstances?",just had a good discussion with one of my friends from college about working  we were college roommates which we would consider some of the best years of life  mostly because of the free time  we both became significantly better at guitar and all of other hobbies  time with friends and family  etc    i asked him about his current situation and he expressed his distaste with work because his free time is still limited  but i feel like i wouldn't mind working 40hrs in his current position    he is a coder and works completely from home  so right there he is already saving a ton of time that would otherwise be wasted on commuting  he actually doesn't even have a car so he saves a lot on gas  insurance  car payment etc  he also is allowed to work his hours whenever he wants  as long as his tasks get one  and the kicker is since he works from home and has that freedom  he constantly travels and is currently living 10 minutes from a beach in hawaii making 65k from his computer   still  he insists 40hrs week is too much and despite his blessings feels like a slave and not living a true life  i personally would kill to be in his position  i am curious of everyone else's thoughts here ,d5onzl

135,Has the veil been lifted? Or am I just paranoid?,after working in retail it seems like i've seen the behind the scenes  what's behind the curtain and how workers feel  i almost feel like everyone i see in any store is faking their enthusiasm which is horrible to think about and is why companies ask people to act cheery but if it's not real then it breaks the illusion  i don't like thinking that people are acting just for my sake  i see youtube videos on the homepage about people going and doing crazy stuff and in concept it sounds fun but from a worker's point of view it sounds really annoying  but they're probably thinking  this dude is making a big deal out of this  i know there are people out there who really do enjoy their jobs but regular stuff  especially retail and probably the food industry  just seems to suck as a whole    it's not like i think people need to be genuinely happy at work  quite the opposite  they should be able to show their real emotions ,d6m02w

Putting my notice in within the next few days with no backup.",so  i work two jobs  but my main job is working one-on-one as a school aide with a special needs little boy  all day  every school day  i m employed by a company who sends us to individual clients  so while i m technically employed by an agency  it s really the families who personally  hire  me   i ve been working with this little boy since the beginning of this year  i care about him  but he s very tough  and this particular  rich  family is very neurotic  bordering on abusive  they like me  but it s a miracle they do  they freak out constantly about very minor things  and they don t follow any of the advice that s given to them by my supervisors  mostly things to the tune of   have you considered trying  method item here  to make your son less unhappy  they basically don t think he really needs additional help  but the school won t allow him to attend without me  and his challenges will just disappear with age  also  it s not really good to have a single aide on a full-time case like this  mostly concerning burnout for the aide  which i absolutely have at this point  i m miserable with anxiety at work every day  and adjustment issues for the child    but because this case is so big   for my boss  and the family has hated every other aide before me and won t tolerate trying new ones  my boss has accommodated their request that i be the only one to work with their son  this wouldn t be so bad if not for the fact i have no other clients  before this case  i used to have several i saw on alternating days  this basically means if this family cancels  for whatever reason  i get nothing  usually  however  the damage is minor  i ll lose a day  8 hours  of work if the kid is sick  i can usually just scrape by  but what happened last week was something else   so basically  the family decides  out of fucking nowhere  to take a  vacation  for a fucking month  taking my client with them  zero warning whatsoever  the mom actually lied to me and said they'd be back this past monday   they didn t even tell my office this  by the way  so for the past week and a half  i ve had no hours  and until they return in early october  i ll be getting about 9 hours a week if i m lucky  my office is  currently trying to find me some hours  with other clients  my boss doesn t care at all how much this has screwed me financially  40 hours of weekly work down the drain for a month  note  i only work my other job for 4 hours a week  so that won t help me much   i ve put up with so much bullshit at this job on this case because i really cared about my client  but this is the final straw  i m planning to put in my two weeks within the next few days  with no new offer  before the family gets back because i just can t take this anymore  the pay at this job is terrible as it is but in situations like this  i m up the river without a paddle  what s worse is i ve really bent over backwards for this family  even changing my availability to accommodate them and their son  taking their calls complaints well after work hours  etc   i m just looking for advice  at this point  on how to draft my two weeks effectively  i put in my two weeks once before  about a year ago  and my boss begged me 4  yes  4  times not to go  offering the raise she denied me for a year and a half  and even had my supervisors emotionally guilt trip me into staying  the kids love you and need you  naturalrattle  please try to find a way to stay with us  they know i have a soft spot for the kids  but i can't do it anymore  i m trying to avoid all that noise and just have a clean break while i still can and gtfo  for good this time  thanks guys ,d6kvxg

143,forcing fake happiness on employees (especially in non client/customer oriented jobs),why can't employers be normal   be realistic  why don't they understand that most people won't love their jobs  that most people work in these jobs to pay bills   why can't they accept that    why do they have to force you to be fake happy all the damn time  why do i have to pretend that yes i love to be treated like shit by customers  or that yes i love to slave away in whatever jobs     they must know  we are all lying through our teeth during interviews or during work  is this about  if we can convince them with this fake happiness then we will also convince clients and customers  but what about jobs that don't require direct contact with clients customers  not even on the phone    even though i can see why one reason for forcing fake happiness on employees could work in a customer  client oriented job  there are other jobs that are not like that and therefore this forced happiness is nonsense ,d5y78s

151,This past year I realized I'm just a cog in the machine.,hi ya'll  i'm glad i found this subreddit   up until this year i didn't mind working a 40 hour work week  i was grateful to have a job in my field  mental health  i'm also in school studying to be a counselor  it's been my dream to help people   then i hit the fieldwork portion  i knew it was going to be hard  this past spring i had practicum  first i had to find a site that even did evenings and weekends  in my search  i realized that most places weren't catered to the full time working adult     no sorry  we don't do evenings and weekends    i am one of the few people in my cohort who still works  and who works full time  i was surprised to learn how many of peers were able to get by on part time work or not working at all    they relied on family  or are married so have a spouse to financially depend on  i have no family in the state  and am not married  so i pay rent and other expenses on my own  admittedly  i became jealous of my peers who discussed not working and being able to dedicate their time to fieldwork  i got surprised looks when i disclosed i was still working full time on top of fieldwork  i feel i am in the minority    so began the long days  go work an 8 hour day starting at 7 a m   9 if you include my break  get off work  go to my site  and do that until 7-8 at night   mix in classes and homework and i soon began to feel myself breaking down   i enjoyed my professor who taught my practicum course  but at the end she gave me feedback about how i seemed not to take much risk and was tired due to working still    it's not like i have a choice  i have been told   well  take out some loans to live on  i already have so much in student loan debt  why would i want to take out more loans  i refuse  plus  i need health insurance  and my company has the best health insurance i've ever had  plans from the health care marketplace are basically unusable with high deductibles  my current health insurance doesn't even have a deductible    i made it through practicum  100 hours of fieldwork  now i'm in the middle of internship  600 fieldwork hours i need by next may to graduate   before i started internship  i talked to my job about flexing my schedule so i wouldn't be so overwhelmed  i was worried about my mental health working 50-60 weeks with only one day off a week    i was denied  told by a supervisor they couldn't change my schedule because of what my job entails  i then began to look for other jobs more accommodating  but nothing came out of it  i even applied internally within the company  and got rejected from every position  it's not that i'm a bad work  quite the opposite  i've kept the program together when my coworker at the time went out on medical leave for 3 months  i was the only staff person there  my company even refused to hire a temp to help me    imagine being with 10  clients 5 hours a day  i couldn't take breaks because i have no one to relieve me  and i was expected to be there   but i did it  so imagine my feeling of betrayal being told that after all i've done  they couldn't work with my schedule  and it's not exclusively a company thing  as i know a couple of other people in my company who are also in master's programs doing internships  and who were allowed a flexed schedule   i was pissed   so i knew i had no choice but to work 50  weeks  getting off of work to go to my internship  and then going in on saturdays  not getting off until 8 p m  or later  so in a blink of an eye  here's sunday  i feel like i didn't even have time to relax  or if i start to  it's sunday night  then i do it all over again   then i think about the fact it's unpaid  it's hard to find a paid internship for a counselor  and the fact i'm sinking all these hours to not be paid bothers me  i enjoy my internship and my clients  but after a 13 hour day  i feel like i need something to make up for it  the money doesn't go to me  but my supervisor   but it really hit me in june that i'm just a worker   in june i was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis    fuck me right   this changed a lot  as soon as i told my job about what was happening  i felt how i was viewed changed   i live in america  so we have the american disability act  there are rights that should protect me from being let go based on my condition   stress management is really pushed in having multiple sclerosis  too much stress could cause a flare up  with this in mind  i decided to bring up the flexed scheduling again  because i thought it may be taken more seriously  in american  physical health always seems to matter more than mental health unfortunately   but i got told i may have to find a new position instead    after all my work and dedication  it didn't matter  it's not like i can't do any parts of my job i did before  i'm fortunate enough to not have symptoms   that's when i knew   i was just a worker   i could be replaced   i got my fmla paperwork underway  to protect myself in case i needed time off for my health    in the midst of this  i was told that client care comes first  and that the company is the one paying for my health insurance  lt which is paying for my treatment gt  pretty much  i still needed to be at work  no matter what   i cried for days  knowing this is my new reality  fear of discrimination from future employers  knowing that i am a slave to work because i need health insurance to pay for my treatment  so i can prevent my ms from becoming worse   people in the ms subreddit talk about being fatigued and struggling to work  but doing so to have that health insurance so they can keep going  what a fucked society we live in   so here i am  trucking along with my 14 hour days with my chronic illness   i wish i was as lucky as my peers who don't have to work  if i even had one extra day off  that would do wonders   i know the internship part is temporary  i have until may next year  but the ms is not  that's something that's going to impact my job security the rest of my life   i eventually do want my own private practice  to be my own boss and set my own schedule sounds amazing  the only con is the health insurance   butt after this job  i don't plan on disclosing my ms unless my condition deteriorates  i don't want that risk  i realize companies don't care  they want you fit  young  and healthy  i realize now the struggle of people with chronic illness in the workforce  it's bullshit    until i have my own business  i'm just a cog in the machine ,d7v3sa

159,Fake money at work,tldr at bottom  just some background  i've been at my current job for nearly 2 months and i hate it but i've found another job so last week i called my manager and said i was leaving  i've been spied on and had a lot of criticism so i don't think anyone there likes me  last night was my first shift back since i said i was leaving  my manager said   can you tell me about the incident with the fake 20 pound note  i had no idea what she was talking about so i said i didn't know about it and she asked if i checked the notes to see if they were fake and i said i checked some of them  when i took my till off last night all the 20 pounds from my till were in a tube in a safe so i don't know how they would've found a fake 20 note  i have to pay the money back which is annoying but i was thinking i'd do it  the manager said the other person working with me could pay 10 pounds towards it but since they don't like me i don't think they will  i was on the other person's till at one point so i'm wondering if it was their fake 20 and they said i was on their till  also the manager was on the till before me so it could be their fake 20 and not mine  my dad was saying the manager could be lying so that they can get money off me  should i just pay the money  or should i refuse to pay until they can prove it was me who had the fake 20   tldr  my manager said there was a fake 20 found while i was working and wants me to pay it back  no one at my job likes me so i'm wondering if i should just pay the money or wait until they have proof that the fake 20 came from me ,d7im1h

232,"This has been the best time of my life, and I don't want it to end.",all my life  i have always had so much to do and so many places to be  i was an extreme overachiever in high school and graduated as valedictorian  but i still used to fake sick two or three times a month because i felt like i just couldn't take another day  i graduated from a top college with a 3 8 gpa  i got a scholarship and financial aid and faced zero debt  but i still broke down crying from anxiety at least once a week  every paper i had to write and every test i had to study for was torture  i just kept thinking that if i just pushed past that hump  it would end  but it never seemed to end  even summer vacation was ruined because not doing anything with my summers would  look bad  on my resume or grad school application   i panicked in my final semester because i was sure it would be impossible for me to get a job  nevertheless  i managed to snag a cushy  well-paying office job right out of school  we had a fully stocked office fridge  they brought in panera on monday mornings  we had pizza parties and theme weeks and played video games during lunch  i was almost never required to stay past normal hours  the office was a five minute commute that didn't even require me to take the freeway  it was supposed to be over  that was supposed to be the goal  but it never ends  instead  i went in five days a week for two years  staring at a screen  pouring my prime hours of my prime years into shit i could not care less about  i would sit in front of my computer for hours procrastinating  constantly looking over my shoulder  hoping nobody would notice i wasn't working  wracked with guilt  i made all my deadlines  but i constantly felt like a fraud because so much more of my effort went into just getting through the day  i took up smoking just to get out of the building  i went into the lounge and cried into the throw pillows  the hours between leaving the office and bedtime  everything i did was eclipsed by the knowledge that i had to do it all over again the next day   so i played it smart  i lived with my parents  put away almost all of my income  and amassed a nest egg that most of my friends could only dream of  i was a millennial with a net worth  that was supposed to be it  the goal  the end  but every day felt like walking through honey  or tar  even though i was making money  i was also wasting money  i was spending a lot on food because i was too tired to cook  and i felt like i would go crazy if i didn't get out of the office at lunch  i was spending on a gym membership because i was too tired to go hiking regularly  i was spending money on vacations because i needed escape  and my whole hometown felt like a prison  it never ends   after three years  i knew i couldn't do it any more  i had saved money  and there was no point if i didn't use it to escape  so i moved to a rural area and took my  dream job  at a non-profit  taking care of rescue animals  it was low-paying  but the area was much more affordable  and i was doing what i wanted to do  despite the low pay  i lived frugally enough to save a modest amount without even touching my prior savings  for a while  it was great  then the bureaucrats struck  with budget cutting  short-staffing  and a widening range of duties  we were being asked to do more every day without any increase in pay  we were treated by management with a disrespect that bordered on disdain  the animals suffered  we suffered  eventually  a little over two years after i started  i threw in the towel  that was two months ago   i decided to take a real break  although i have been making small moves toward becoming a freelancer  i have largely been taking it easy  i have been spending time with my pets  reading in my hammock  gardening  playing the guitar  doing art  going hiking  cooking  baking  housework  minor repairs  that i have been meaning to do for ages  and doing all manner of other things that require little money or even leaving my neighborhood  i eat fresh baked bread every morning with herbs i grew myself  i finally cleared out my garage so i can use it as an art space  i don't feel the need to run off to japan or germany or any of the other places i used to vacation because i needed to be as far away as possible from my job for a few weeks  i am probably the happiest i have ever been in my life  at least since i was a little kid   but the future keeps pressing on me  i have enough savings that i could pull this life off for a while - a year at least  probably a good amount more if i really keep my expenses low  my rent here is super reasonable  and even if i am in the middle of nowhere  i don't feel the need to escape as much as i used to  what used to be the prison i retired to to cry in between stretches of wage slavery is now my little modest corner of heaven  but i keep worrying about how long it can go on  i'm haunted by the thought of eventually running out of money and having to go back to the rat race  i've been looking into wwoofing  homesteading  joining a commune of some kind  i am not afraid of hard work  and i would be willing to work much harder even than i have in the past if i were not so alienated from my labor and the beneficiaries of it  after years of living like sisyphus  always trying to pretend the boulder won't come rolling back down on me  i finally know what i want out of life  i am finally learning that there is nothing wrong with it and nothing to be ashamed of  now  i just have to pursue it  i can't let up  i can't chicken out  i can't ever go back  there is no way i can go back now that i know what i'm missing ,d62wyf

262,Saving up for a down payment on a house so I can mostly leave the system,looking at cheap mobile homes and small houses in my area  i turn 19 next month  no credit and still living at home with parents  found a decent mobile home with a small plot of land for  67 500  a couple cheap condos for  65 000  and a couple cheap houses in the  75- 90k range  with a 20  down payment i'd need between  13 000 and  18 000 for the prices i mentioned           i currently have  7 250 in the bank due to my saving habits and no current bills except for gas and car insurance  i have a shit job that i've been at for 2 months with a 53 minute commute one-way but it pays  12 hr vs   7 25 being legal minimum wage   9 50 hr being local economy  i figure i can probably save up for the  67 500 down payment in roughly 5-6 months    whatever closing costs  i'd want to save up for a little bit after too to have more of a cushion  after that  my mortgage payment  property taxes  and home insurance would be roughly  304  according to zillow  add electricity  water  sewage  garbage  food  internet  etc  and maybe it'll be an extra  500- 600 a month  after i pay the mobile home off  all i have is  19 month  228 year  for property taxes  as long as i pay that  i have a house    the other bills that if i get fired or take some financial hit  i could hold off on a bit           i think it's a decent plan  once it's paid off  i'd only need a minimum amount of money and could live somewhat free  i can tell you i'm serious when i say i don't wanna work the rest of my life or work to live paycheck to paycheck  work will just subsidize my bills and i'll hopefully be much more free      of course all financials are speculative  could be more  could be less  i'd hope i could get a nice first time buyers loan or some help from usda  though i heard they don't do mobile homes  this is my dream to not have to work myself to death  there's not a big point to this post but i wanted to share my steps i'm taking to leave the work life ,d231rv

266,I've only worked one day at my new job and I'm already miserable (vent/seeking advice),i was fired from my last job at a jewelry store about 3 months ago  the week of my birthday  for being  too awkward  and i was honestly quite devastated as i really liked working there  i thought i'd get really depressed and suicidal after a couple of weeks of job hunting unemployment like i usually do  but these past few months have turned out to be some of the best in my life  i've been learning about homesteading and gardening  and making plans with my boyfriend to get a small house and large plot of land so that we can eventually live off the land  we've managed to grow cucumbers  green onions  potatoes  garlic  and even an eggplant on our apartments like porch  and that filled me with a different kind of joy and hope  like maybe i could really get this going and spend the rest of my life gardening for a living  i was the happiest i've ever been in my life  i think   i finally managed to find a job  which i was somewhat excited about because we could finally start saving money for a home  my first day was yesterday  and even though it went smoothly and i like my coworkers  i cant help but feel nauseated at what i'm doing  i'm working for a business founded by a certain uncle sam  and i hate myself for it  i cried for the first time in a long time yesterday night  and today i feel like i cant bring myself to even get out of bed  its like several years of progress with my depression were reversed in an instant    i suppose what i want to know is if anyone has any tips for staying positive not horribly depressed while working so that my boyfriend and i can actually achieve something that we want in life ,d393sd

276,labor struggle sessions,next monday in our local bar we're going to try a new program dubbed  labor struggle sessions  where we are inviting people to talk about their work and general conditions   the idea came about because there's two distinct social grouppings that develop around adulthood   1  standard friendships where work is mentioned mostly in passing  2  work relationships where most of socializing is centered around the subject of work or how the collage or boss is an asshole etc   so by taking some ideas from we are plan c  c is for consciousness raising  https www weareplanc org blog c-is-for-consciousness-raising    we're trying to mix this together  to kind of get people to reflect on the conditions in a more critical and hopefully more productive way   now of course there's a standard set of questions that come up  such as  is there a union and is it doing anything  and i think there's a lot of stuff to be uncovered in people's conscious and unconscious coping activities   but if anybody of you has experience in doing things like this  please share  we're welcoming all input and ideas  and my biggest fear in the mid-long term is that consciousness raising can simply end up being a hugbox rather than the basis of any meaningful organization   also will report in later if anybody's curious or would want to start their own version at home   we in mainland eu ,d3ofvl

285,Work Sets You Free,how many people do you think would agree with that statement  without knowing its origin  i imagine a lot   it's no coincidence to me though that this phrase was the mantra presented at the entrance of nazi concentration camps  while what we go through day to day are in no way on the same level as the horrors faced in those camps  i think the connection is pretty evident   slaves  toiling away for their masters in a desperate bid for survival  all while   arbeit macht frei  hangs over their head    just like in our society  where we are expected to dedicate our lives to labor and  careers  we live in a culture that clearly believes in that phrase  with leaders and masters who would pretentiously spout it every time one of their slaves complain   i don't know what to completely make of it but it's  always been ironic to me that this phrase was at the entrance of many concentration camps  and it is one that many people would buy into  it's a sick allegory come to life ,d1v7mj

306,What do you guys do for work?,i'm currently living the anti-work life for the past 4 months and have mixed feelings about it  most experiences you guys describe is exactly what i've been through at previous jobs and how i feel about our country's capitalist system  making 8  9  12  15  per hour is wage slavery  you're just working to live   even with a bachelors  unfortunately i majored in legal studies and not cs or finance  finding a decent job with with good pay has been a struggle for the last 3 years  i avoid the mlm scam job interviews which are abundant in my area and strike out at the typical 45k per year logistic healthcare recruiting sales jobs anything that's has a decent pay and seems like a good career path  i'm hopeless job hunting for jobs i'd be miserable doing in the first place but at least i'd feel i'm doing the right thing and got my parents off my back   so i'd like to know what's your situation been like  what keeps you going  what's your plan ,d3hbnm
307,Had a real depressing moment when my thoughts lingered too long on the reality of my hourly rate,sure  my fortnightly pay is nothing to write home about  but for some reason breaking it down into the hours and realising  this is what an hour of my time is apparently worth  is just so dehumanising  time is our most precious and finite resource and that's the pittance i receive in exchange  not to mention i don't get paid anything  in fact it costs me money  for the hour it takes me to get to work and the hour  it takes me to get home  nor do i get paid for my half hour lunch break  during which i am still in my uniform  on company property and literally just stuffing food in my face so i can go on working  like a robot refuelling   most people would never go do an hour of freelance work for the hourly rate their full time  job pays them  because deep down we know our time is worth more than that  it's even worse to think that what it all adds up to  at least for me  isn't even enough to get by on  the supposed  security  of buying into this shit is only as secure as you'd expect a trap to be ,d2xinw

310,"Alternatives to ""work""",hello everyone   i am so glad i came across this subreddit   i have spent my life thus far despising the modern-day concept of  work  why  you ask   my father spent his entire life working for a billionaire who did not know what to do with his money so he hired my father along with a couple of other individuals to set up and run a business for him    my father started in a small dingy office with four other colleagues over 40 years ago  he retired about 2 years ago at the age of 70  after slaving away for years and successfully creating an empire out his employer's liquid cash and assets   and what does my father have to show for it  some savings from gathering whatever amount he could from his monthly income  after the expenses of living alone abroad  and an  end of service award  i e  some bonus cash  for spending the bulk of his life living far away in a different country from his family  i barely knew my father growing up  and he comes back into my life  a frail  old man suffering post-stroke symptoms after an ischemic stroke caused by heart arrythmia which had remained unnoticed because who cares if an employee ends up in the hospital for  heart problems  multiple times over the years as long as he makes it back to work  right  and no need to check if his family knows of his condition or whether the employee himself is taking care of his health on his own - or whether he is even capable of it   so how could this scenario have played out differently  how could my father's employer have structured his business  being in a position of power authority and having the resources to do so   1  grant a share of the profits of the business to my father  whether in cash or in shares that my father could hold and sell as he desired needed  imho  that would ensure that the success of the business would define my father's  salary  or compensation for his time and effort rather than an arbitrary decision from his employer  it would also motivate my father to work harder   2  pay my father on a contractual basis  for every project in the setting up and running of the business  negotiate with my father on the price he sets on his skills applied and time given to the project  pay him at the end of the project instead of monthly  prevent abuse from either side  no trying to milk each other for their full worth without compensating accordingly   thoughts   tl dr  either give your employees a share in the profits of the business  instead of a monthly salary  or work on a project to project basis  paying the contractual employee on completion  prevent abuse by both the employer  setting unnecessary tasks not related to project or skillset of employee  and the employee  sleeping on the job   look busy  do nothing  etc ,d46ovw

313,Should I work in retail or in a warehouse?,for some background i'm 20 years old and i've been unemployed since last year  my parents are forcing me to join the work force again full time and i'm in the process of applying for different jobs  i have some experience working in retail    i'm trying to figure out which type of job would be best for me  i've narrowed it down to either going back to retail or working in a warehouse  the only benefit of retail  but it's a big one  is that it's an easier job both physically and mentally  if i'm working somewhere for 8hrs a day i still want to be capable of doing activities outside of work without being exhausted all the time  the benefits of a warehouse job would be     better pay by a few dollars   better hours  evenings and weekends off    won't have to deal with customers  i'm pretty torn on which type of job i should keep applying for  i've heard working in a warehouse is fast paced and tiring work compared to retail so i would like some advice ,d3trkx

Now what?,so in a fit of rage with my employers antics as well as bad mental health i just quit my job cold turkey  i dunno if i can use this term in this instance   it was towards the start of june    i slept like a baby for 3 months  watched all the shows in the world  went on 2 holidays  ate  relaxed    basically blew all my money aside from a little in savings that i m not really wanting to touch  ie save for a rainy day  ironically isn t this the rainy day    now i m broke and really really do not want to go back to work   worst case scenario i won t end up homeless as i live with my parents    just not wanting to tarnish my credit as i ve been good with bills for the past 6 years    i also do not want to work i really don t want to   the idea of waking up at 6am to slave away for someone else makes me viciously upset,d442h4

366,A constant struggle,i am a 26 male currently living with my father  i have multiple anxiety disorders  ocd  social anxiety  anyways  i dropped out of college because it was a little bit too sociopathic for me to handle so i started working at domino's as a driver because those capitalist pigs force you to suffer one way or the other  recently i quit domino's because of multiple reasons  one  i get no benefits  no lunch breaks  no car insurance  health insurance  vacation days  fucking nothing  we were also severely understaffed which lead to me often having to hand people 2 hour old food which was humiliating and demoralizing    the manager was also a childish egomaniac  just some examples  i was discussing my schedule with him one day and he says in the midst of the conversation   ultimately  i decide when and how much you work per week  or telling me to fuck off when i made a lighthearted joke  he is also delusional  to attempt to solve the understaffed store problem  he offered fucking 40 dollar gift cards to people as a reward for getting people to join the store  they also had to be working for 3 months straight and they could not be previous employees  i simply told him this would not work and that the owners of the store should just pay their employees more and offer benefits instead of paying the bare minimum to attract more people to come work with us  he then goes to list off cowardly  right wing talking points as to why we should not be getting paid more such as  if everyone got paid more  everything would be more expensive and people should just work harder   he was also lazy  i would often come in to help open the store  this included prepping the food  which took a long time as i was also a driver and had to take deliveries  i worked at this store before and all the other prior managers either did the prep on their own or we did it together  this guy was different  he would just sit in the office on his phone not helping at all while i had to do all of it  of course i could not finish it all most of the time and had to spend an extra hour or two after my shift was over to finish all of it  the temperature in the store was pretty much at a constant 85-90 degree temperature which only added to the emotional tension  there was also little things  like this    https www reddit com r aboringdystopia comments 9chmwh please do not feed the employees https www reddit com r aboringdystopia comments 9chmwh please do not feed the employees   - which is in every store  it only added to the dehumanizing nature of this corporate shit hole    so i quit and now i am enjoying freedom temporarily  but i just feel like all of this is just a constant struggle for me  i just can't fit in and accept the status quo  i just fucking can't  there is a part of me that refuses to let capitalist pigs imprison my existence and it makes surviving in this world all the more difficult  i do things to help me though  like meditating for and hour to 90 minutes every day  tripping on high doses of lsd and mushrooms  lucid dreaming  audio books with walks in nature  classic wow  hanging out with my hippie friend  etc  i have a lot that i am interested in that makes me feel fulfilled but a millionaire billionaire can't profit off of it  so i'm unable to devote my time to these things  obviously i am going to have to do something eventually but i don't know what yet  i am good with computers  maybe i'll learn to program or edit videos or something idk lol    anyways sorry for the long post i just feel like i need some external validation from my fellow leftists  thank you for reading  ,d2s3cr

382,My transformation after months of reading this sub,hey all   so i've always had a hard time holding down jobs  i've always thought i was  well  a workshy loser who can't copy with the modern world  it only takes me so long before i stop working at the pace required by management  or answer back to a manager and piss them off   so i stumbled across this sub and found people who are like me  honestly it's been fucking amazing    so i started reading the sidebar texts and find myself agreeing with most of what i'm reading  and now i'm starting to wonder - holy fuck am i an anarchist  have i been one for years and not realized it   is this why i can't thrive in the corporate system  i know there is something deep inside me that reacts immediately and sometimes intensely to tyranny    now i'm starting to think that maybe i'm just suffering the bad luck of being born into the wrong system at the wrong time   anyway  thanks guys for this  it's an amazing place on the internet ,d3y3aw

387,Why are so many people content with the 40 hour work week?,i just found this subreddit and i'm so happy to have come across a place that shares my feelings about work  since graduating high school i've worked minimum wage jobs because i had no interest in spending any more time in school  even with a degree i would still end up being somewhere i don't want to be for 40hrs a week so what's the point  just to make more money  there's no guarantee even if i do go back to school    i've left multiple jobs because i couldn't handle the full time schedule of 5 8's  five eight hour days  i live at home and my parents expect me to either work or be in school full time and either way i suffer  along with not having enough free time when i'm working i also can't get over the feeling of my life vanishing in front of me as i work my ass off  it's like i'm trapped with no option but to tread water and try not to drown in my own thoughts   what's even more baffling is it seems like everyone is completely fine with how things are  almost no one is proposing a shorter work week or even talking about the value of time outside work  everyone i know criticizes me for my issues with the standard work week   it's like capitalism has created a society that believes work comes above all else  in the end what's the point ,d1zx3f

393,About to lose a job offer because previous employers aren’t responding to reference requests...,i m not even trying to gain personal references here  all they need are standard references to confirm what i ve been doing for the past three years  after dropping out of uni  all i ve done is short-term work  so trying to gain references from the university itself  along with the employers i had afterwards is proving to be very difficult    it s honestly ridiculous  and the first time i ve been asked to do this  usually they just want one academic employment reference  and a personal one    i requested a proof of student status from the university which was meant to arrive via email within 5 working days  it s been well over a week now  i ve now requested it via post    i called hr for one of retailers i worked for  three different stores over the past 3 years  but was unable to request a generic reference for 2 out of the 3 times due to not knowing the previous employee numbers   previous boss for another employer no longer works at the company anymore  and i ve been unsuccessful in contacting hr to gain a reference    the only reference i ve been able to gain so far is for another retailer that has an automated online system which generates a generic reference once you provide your name and national insurance number  didn t even need an employee number    i don t even think i want this fucking job anymore  it s for a stupid  low-paying apprenticeship which probably isn t even worth all this stress  i rejected an offer for a higher paying retail job for this  i would ve been working there for the past two weeks had i accepted  and i really need the money   i thought the apprenticeship would be a good opportunity to do some academic work again whilst earning money  and would look great on my personal statement when i go back to university in the future  it s in business administration  which sounds about as stimulating as watching paint dry plus i hate office work and how stagnant it can feel but it involves liaising with hospital workers  occupational therapists and nurses which  i guess  loosely relates to my future plans to work in healthcare    i m broke af and have debts to pay  so i applied for a couple retailers last week  two i previously worked for  and have have managed to secure an interview for both  again  both of which pay much more than the apprenticeship    i know the apprenticeship is a decent opportunity  but fuck  i m tired of struggling  i need money for an adhd assessment  after which i d like to have driving lessons again  pay off my debts  raise my first year tuition fee for uni  save for a future holiday  etc  i m kinda tired of retail  but the department stores i ve applied for do pay more  and i d have the option to do overtime to make more money in a shorter amount of time    they ideally want me to start the apprenticeship on 16th but i highly doubt i m gonna gain any more references than what i have right now  they won t take me on unless they gain all my employment history from the past three years  so looks like that offer s down the drain   sorry for the rant guys  just needed to blow some steam,d1a9k7

395,Stupid manager,i've talked about my manager to my parents and they say she's a bad manager  she criticises me but it seems more like an attack on me personally  a month ago i had to tell her 4 times that i was going on holiday before she changed my shifts cause she kept forgetting  she puts me on at night on my own to close up the shop and it's my first job and i've been there a month  i'm worried that some man could attack or rape me cause i'm a young woman and i'd be alone and vulnerable  also i could fall and become unconscious and no one would be able to help because they wouldn't know and customers wouldn't be able to get into the store to help cause there's a lock on the door  and i'm worried about someone robbing the place or trying to get in when we're closed because customers have got into the shop twice when we've been closed  i'm not allowed a friend or family member in the store to keep me company and help me feel safe cause they have rules against it  she could easily put me on during the day or on days when there's two people on but she gives the shit shifts to the new trainees  she's also got my coworkers to soy on me which i think creates a very bad environment and i know i can't trust them  i only like two of the people i work with and one of them is leaving soon   then today my manager was telling me to pack out the fridge and she gave me the heavy stuff to do when i told her a few weeks ago i find it difficult to lift  i've been at work 3 nights in a row and today i had an 8 hour shift on my feet nearly the whole time  she asked what my plans for the weekend are and i was thinking you actual bitch  you took up my weekend with work  i'm too exhausted to even do anything on sunday and my whole saturday was taken up by work  i really hate my manager and i can't wait to get another job ,d13axz

416,The fuck is up with all these questions on a PART TIME job application?,i recently quit my full time job that i hated to go to college full time and have been looking for a part time job almost everyday for the last month  currently filling out an application to work at a convince drug store and i have answered the same 5 questions more than 3 times each  literally  and now they want to know the address of where my highest education received was at and all my previous jobs  which all of these are answered on my resume that i uploaded at the very beginning of the application  now i'm finally about to finish the damn thing and now i have to have a mandatory phone number and name of a previous supervisor  does this shit sound absolutely insane to anyone else  not to mention the job is calling for 10-20 hours a week ,czccmm
417,R&amp;D paranoia, i work in tech r amp d  yesterday was the first day at a new project as my old one was over  two coworkers have warned me about the bullshit factor in this one  the first meeting was awkward as fuck  the project is a 3 year one and our job tech wise is to integrate the work of our partners and generally to manage them  the project is running for 6 months now and the first review is coming        so the project manager want us to do a demo for the review  he also said that  our demo has to be the best because we are the coordinator  and continued  probably the director himself will do the demo so it has to be good  since i was the new guy i raised my arm and i asked  since we are the  integrators  we have to wait for our partners to finish and it is too soon  also our work and demo is gonna be combining the work of our partners so how exactly can we differentiate from them   actually if we did a demo it is like completing 50  of the project and its the fucking first 6 months out of  3 years     amp x200b   so the project manager had the brilliant idea to not wait for the actual project components from the partners but ask from them some previous iterations of their work that are suboptimal for our project and initial design  in order to integrate them and make a demo  and for some components that there are no previous iterations we would just go and buy off the shelf components that are similar and integrate them  so we are gonna make something that is not even close to the goals of the project just to showcase something   this is literally a whole new project which has to be done in 2 months  of course its gonna be a sloppy prototype that just has to survive the demo  but i see no point at all at any of this    managers are terrorizing everyone here about the reviews but my experience from the reviews is totally different  if you talk sense to the reviewers they are cool  in my second review i was told off for revealing some vulnerabilities of my designs  every design has them  however the reviewers were happy to discuss them and that didn't even hurt our rating  why so much bullshiting  isnt everyone sick of themselves ,czi2bi

420,Moving from the biggest nightmare of a job to one that feels fulfilling and allows me to maintain my mental as well as financial health.,i dont really have anyone else to talk to about this  but thought this sub might find it interesting   i'll start with the hell-job  for the last few months  since i graduated college  i've been working a job that i can only describe as absolutely horrendous  i've always been willing to go in and put in the grind and deal with the dehumanization that is inherent in that  but this was something else    it was at a medical lab where samples go for processing  and the entire thing was draining  firstly  it was third shift  it wouldnt be so bad  i always want to get things done more at night and it fit what my sleep schedule already was  except for the fact that the overtime was unacceptable  mandatory  and insane  i was told when i was being hired that there might be some overtime  like 1 or 2 hours every few days  that's a joke  70 hour weeks were common and there were 16 hour shifts where  because of my commute  it was impossible to get more than 4ish hours of sleep even if i had good sleeping habits  already its fucked up  but add in the fact that it's a night shift and it becomes untenable for anyone  everyone working there suffered immensely because of this and that was just expected  in addition to being made to feel lazy if they had to leave early or anything  imagine feeling lazy while working this   because of the aforementioned commute  i told them that i would leave at a certain time every day  still several hours after my shift was supposed to end  and my immediate bosses  who were also basically just cogs and had no say but were thankfully friendly  allowed me to  the next day  after enjoying one shift that was only 11 hours  i was told i had to come in two hours early to offset my leaving early  having no other options  i basically had to say yes  so every single day was a 13 hour day with 2 hours total in commute  and that was monday through friday with half of saturdays being the same  i dont like to complain or pull the 'do you know how hard it isn't card  but imagine working almost 80 hours on overnights in a week   and i thought this was bad  until i got my first full paycheck  they told me before i was hired  at least 10 times  that i was going to be making a specific amount of money per hour  with overtime being time and a half  because it was on a nightshift  there was differential  and so when i received my job offer it was represented as a base pay in combination with a percent  i figured  because they had been nice to me and i thought they wouldn't be as blatantly greedy and awful as they were  that the total amount after the differential would be what i was supposed to be making  turns out no  i was making a full dollar less than they claimed i would be  asking around  pretty much everyone was lied to and paid between 50 cents and a dollar less per hour than they claimed wed be making  this from a medical lab where i processed 100 samples an hour  spilling god damn blood and urine on myself constantly  each netting them hundreds of dollars for the company while we were making 15 or so an hour  or about 15 cents per sample   when i realized that  i started looking for other jobs more seriously  as much as i'd love to be able to not work  or work very minimally  as our society would easily be able to maintain at this point  i had to  then i got lucky  my friend had an opening at her job   i've already rambled quite a bit so i'll be brief  but it's like night and day  for the last two weeks i've felt respected and important  doing work that is demonstrably useful for people  i'm making more per hour and only working 35 hours a week  on top of that  so much of the job has downtime where i'm not only permitted but encouraged to work on my own projects  or read books  or do whatever i'd like while maintaining my other responsibilities  i feel like this is a dream that will be yanked out from under me  because this is the kind of job i didnt think could exist under the lecherous system we have now  but the kind of job that should exist for everyone  with maybe even less than 35 hours but i digress  its been such a breath of fresh air to be able to work a fulfilling job that allows me to survive  but also makes me so angry that this is such a rarity and that the vast majority of people are shoved into these dead-end  cruel job where they are being fully exploited by greedy bosses and corporations   tl dr  went from the worst job i could imagine to the kind of job that should be more commonplace in the world but is instead an extreme rarity ,cza41i

451,This thing happened at a job I had years ago and it made me so angry...,i had my first  and last  office job pushing paper when i was about 20  it was as horrible as you would expect- long hours  crippling workloads  catty coworkers  inept management  nonsensical policies    i had been managing fairly well for about 5 months  i was past my training phase  sort of   i asked my manager to explain how to do a certain task a second time and she absolutely lost it  saying i couldn't just keep asking her how to do stuff and essentially to get my shit together  never asked again   anyway  the big boss called me into his office via email and i nervously went  i'm very sensitive and felt my palms sweating and mouth drying even as i stood up from my desk  i went in and sat down and was treated to a lecture about my productivity  how it had decreased in the past month and how i needed to pick it back up  he wasn't sympathetic at all  very condescending and angry  i was honestly baffled as they had posted the productivity levels publically and i was 2nd  out of 5  i was too anxious to say anything other than  okay  but got angry about it after i had time to think   my numbers were  double  those of the two super catty middle aged teenagers that had been there for years before me  but i was the only one reprimanded because my numbers had decreased from what they were  they decreased because i got comfortable  i had been working at an unsustainable pace and slowed down so i wouldn't get super sick    i  did  end up having a nervous break down by the end of the year and quit without notice    i used to think there was something wrong with me  that i had never grown up developed properly to be able to handle a  normal  job like this  i'm only just starting to realize it's the culture that's sick  not me     amp nbsp    fun final story about idiotic policies  three months into working here  management banned the use of headphones with music while working  even if you only had one headphone in so you could easily be talked to  but   don't worry  you were permitted to listen to the radio out of the horrendous crackly speakers on your 20 year old speaker phone  queue 20 cubicles listening to christmas music on blast out of the world's shittiest speakers  i wanted to die  probably also affected my productivity ,cze8l7

459,We have no idea how much power we have,i had an exchange with a redditor in the r antiwork subreddit who felt any attempt to impose a reduction of hours on the capitalists and the state would backfire  causing greater economic damage to the workers than the capitalists  the redditor summarized their thinking this way    gt any withdrawl of labor significant enough to 'cripple' profits would seem to my  admittedly amateur  eye  to almost by definition  hurt wages  its like the regressive tax thing  that day of lost wages means much more to the worker than it does to the capitailist  and the capitialist is getting some return by saving on labor costs  and meanwhile  workers still need to be purchasing necessities so  just like with ubi  capitialists profit there too   the workers  when they cease work for a day  lose a day's wage  while the capitalists see a reduction in their labor costs  at the same time the workers still have to eat and must purchase necessities  on which the capitalists profit    since the workers must eat in any case  and since the capitalists will make a profit on the commodities they buy  what excuse do we have to oppose a non-wage income like ubi     gt anyway  it feels obvious to me  although i guess it is not  that it would be much easier for workers  to withhold labor via a strike or via a reduction of work hours if workers had some income that wasnt derived from wages  the goal of shortening the work week does not appear to be at odds with a basic income  in fact  they seem complementary   personally  i think the answer is obvious  it rests on the fact that the working class produces  perhaps  ten times as much value as it consumes  by reducing its labor by one day  the impact of this reduction is felt ten times more by the capitalists than the workers    to understand what this means  you have to realize that a withdrawal of one day's labor a week  -- not even a complete strike  a partial work stoppage -- amounts to a fall of gdp equal to that last seen during the great depression  a 20  collapse in economic output    no capitalist economy can withstand the loss of one day's labor by a committed determined working class  it is their nightmare scenario  it requires no army  no parties  no protests  it just requires people who hate work and want to abolish it    it is also the direct path to communism ,czmlqy

463,My religion doesn't permit me to lie. How can I get a job?,i'm very religious and one of my beliefs is that once you're aware of a sin  you can't choose to do it  ever   one sin is lying  dishonesty   if i were to do it knowing it is a sin  i am defying god   so how can i succeed in an interview   most questions are designed to test your enthusiasm and  how high you'll jump   recently i had an interview for a very low tier job  pushing carts at costco   i just need some part time work to pay the few bills that i have   i was asked  so why do you want to work here   obviously i don't  so i responded by saying i was actually only there out of necessity   they then looked surprised and asked  so why did you apply to us specifically  and i kind of laughed and explained how when you're applying for jobs you don't really focus much on the details   i told them i was applying to over ten jobs a day and had to actually do some research to find out what job this even was before coming to the interview     i didn't get the job   i'm not allowed to even pretend to be enthusiastic or lie in any way  so how do they expect me to succeed in a system that requires a certain level of dishonesty ,d0jcda

471,I quit my job and was offered a promotion to stay.,i'm in a pretty tough situation here  i quit my miserable office job but was then offered a different   relatively  better position in another division of the company  i have reason to believe it would be significantly more bearable than my current position due to different management  less boring work  etc   the problem is - i deliberately planned on quitting and having an employment gap that i can use to record an album  i'm on my parents' health insurance for a limited amount of time and have tons of savings   no debt  so this is the only time i can realistically do this   on the other hand  it's a  good  position for an office job  it would teach me a great deal of  valuable  experience in the world of corporate slavery  and open doors in the future  it's in a field that's relatively less boring than what i was previously doing  on top of that  we're potentially going into a recession so that places even more pressure on me  part of me wants to bitch out and just take the job   but if i do that  i know i will never forgive myself  i will never have this unique privilege to work on my music full-time  no debt  savings  live with my parents  and on their health insurance  i've learned that with a full-time job  it's literally impossible to professionally record music  minimal free time  and during that little free time  my soul is always sucked dry to the point where i can't get any passionate recording done   i have a feeling many of you lovely people will say turn it down  and do what you're passionate about  but i'm curious to see whether any of you have other suggestions ,cyte5f

480,Whatever happened to the shorter working day? Why did the struggle for a shorter working day stop at 8 hours?,shorter working days seemed to have been a consistent trade union  labor  and socialist demand in the 19th and early 20th century  from 12 hours  to 10 hours  to 8 hours  i've seen old timey posters and propaganda arguing for 6 hours and even 4 hours   what happened to these  with our high efficiency in technology and output to the point of more and more jobs being automated  it seems shorter work hours should have been possible decades ago  why did the struggle for shorter stop at 8 hours and when did the idea for 6 and 4 hour work day fade from the realm of possibility   whatever happened to the maximization of leisure and freedom from work ,czfbn4
481,My job is a pit of stress that’s holding me back and going nowhere but I can’t work up the motivation to quit. [Long Vent],i work in the parts department of a car dealership  i got the job because i was one of the few lucky people who had family connections to the manager  and i was in the right place at the right time  previous guy had been slacking off real bad and let everything go to shit  i had volunteered at annual inventories with the company for years so they knew i was good at the work  and i needed a job  it all lined up beautifully  i always wanted an inventory job because i have a knack for organization  and thats what i was told i would be doing - checking the shelves  running reports to make sure everything is in order  arranging the occasional retail display  my manager has been a family friend for years so we all saw him as a good guy and very trustworthy  it looked like it was going to work out great  and it did  and i was very happy with it  for a few months   i ve been here over a year now though  and everything has changed so quickly  it fucking sucks  everything has gone downhill rapidly and i want to blow my brains out coming in here every day and smelling the same fucking brain-melting concoction of gasoline  motor oil  tire rubber  and stale coffee  seeing the same dull gray stained cement floors with trash all over them because my coworkers are too lazy to take the 5 steps to the trash bins for their toothpicks and candy wrappers  having to handle the same damn oil and coolant-slathered parts all day long and get it in my hair and on my clothes that i can t afford to replace because i m stupid short and khakis in a 6 petite don t seem to fucking exist for under  70 a pair  having to grin and bear it through the same dull  monotonous small-talk conversations  and worst of all  i have nothing to show for it  i believe that it s unfair and completely evil that people are forced to work like drones doing unnatural  artificial tasks for decades on end in order to earn the right and the means to exist  like everyone else on this sub believes - but i have been raised being constantly beat over the head with the philosophy that if i have to work  i m going to do the best damn job that i can  because even if it sucks and you hate it and don t agree with work as a societal construct  you have to live with it whether you like it or not and biting the bullet and busting your ass is how you move up and make it in life  but that s not true and i learned it the hard way  i have been busting my ass since day 1 and if anything i have been demoted    like previously mentioned i was told that i was going to be working inventory  and i did for the first few months  i helped out with other jobs occasionally but i was told a new guy would be hired to take care of warranty  which is like a sub-department of parts  is seen as the absolute pits of every parts and service store  and is what i was helping the most with because there was no one else back here to do it  the guy gets hired though and he s instead been designated a position as our shipper receiver nick s assistant lost puppy  he is bar-none the most pathetic human being i have ever personally met in my entire life  but i could go on an on about that and i ll just tell you that my nickname for him is virgin chihuahua because he looks like a fucking human chihuahua with his giant buggy eyes  little scrawny body  and anxious energy that he constantly radiates like a chernobyl reactor and he may as well have  virgin  tattooed on his forehead in big bold letters and neon glow-in-the-dark ink because he is in his mid-20 s but still has the brain of a 13 year old boy  he is extremely lazy and wanders around tapping away at his phone or making extremely awkward and forced banter with everyone else when he isn t following nick around and holding his dick for him because nick s been here 30  years and rarely needs any real help  and he used to flirt with me until i chewed his ass out to my manager after he made a comment regarding me and my boyfriend s sex life that made me want to peel all of my skin off  he takes credit for everything me and the only other person in this department worth anything more than dog shit both break our backs to do because no one else wants to  and he is always whining that he deserves a raise  my manager fucking babies him to the point where i wonder if something is going on like bribery or under-the-table favors or if my manager has really just stopped caring that much  either way  chihuahua had 2 days of basic warranty training then fucked off to never set foot back here again unless he wants to commandeer my phone charger or demand i share my weekend plans in excruciating detail so all of it has been dumped on me  and it is fucking impossible to keep up with    we get massive amounts of shit in every day and a lot of it is physically massive  but the warranty room is a glorified broom closet about the size of your average guest bedroom so i have to go after nick and chihuahua with a cattle prod to get them to use the forklift and help bring the stuff out to the storage container on the other side of our huge and very poorly-designed parking lot  and the thing is a giant convection oven all day long because i live in the south and it is sitting in direct sun on hot pavement  they don t do it half the time though  even though it takes 5 to 10 minutes at most to set everything up on a pallet and drive it over  and they always come up with excuses that my manager waves off  so i resolved to taking the stuff out myself in multiple trips with shopping carts  i can t leave this stuff lying around because it either sits in my way in the warranty room or gets in everyone else s way sitting out in the narrow hallway  however  i recently actually almost passed out from heat stroke trying to get things out there because there was so much that day  i came back inside through my manager s office red as a fire truck and panting like a dog  and what did he do  did he get me some water  or ask me to sit down and rest before going back out with someone else to help  did he scold nick and chihuahua for slacking off and making excuses  no  he scolded me like a child for  coming in looking like that  and established a fucking curfew for when i am allowed out in the storage container  i can only go out there for two hours in the mornings  which makes for only two days out of the week since i usually work afternoon shifts due to a medical condition that interferes with my sleep  i wish i could post a picture of my view right now from my desk - so much has built up that you can barely walk through the hallway and i can only roll my chair about half a foot in either direction before hitting a box   and i only get paid  10 an hour for all of this shit  glassdoor says i should be making  15   last month  i sat down with my manager and tried to discuss all my concerns regarding my workload and chihuahua and everything else that has been bothering me this past year  the company gets even more into brainwashing you than others and orientation composed of watching over 20 videos  each 10  minutes long  of the hr director touting how much they value hard work  and if you have a concern bring it up to your manager and  we will make it right  and all the typical corporate rah-rah circlejerking type shit  so i foolishly trusted the system and hoped that my manager would understand and make things right like i had been promised would be the case when i started  he listened to me intently as i spoke  but what he said in response really hurt me on a personal level  paraphrased  he said   you re too much of a perfectionist  you work too hard  you act like i m a slave driver  no one is putting this pressure on you but yourself    i gave up my perfectionism long ago  i just want to do my job and earn my money without spending every second of it wanting to tear my hair out  i come in here and as soon as i enter the building i feel so hopeless  with each day i m quicker to anger  quicker to crying  quicker to wondering if i should go lay down on the train tracks to get away from it  i want to quit  but people are always telling me that i have it so good and that i m so lucky to have this job to the point where i ve become petrified at the idea of turning in that resignation letter  what if i can t find someplace that is as accommodating of my medical condition  what if the people at a new job are somehow even worse than chihuahua  what if the schedule they give me is drastically different and prevents me from being able to see my boyfriend every weekend like i can now  what if i quit and can t find a new job at all and i have to humiliate myself crawling back to this pit  every time i go through this motions of weighing the pros and cons i feel like such a sissy for finding the job so difficult and stressful because there are people who would likely kill to have what i have  but i m still so miserable and i don t know what to do   i could just use some support  and some encouragement  i need to hear that i m not crazy and ungrateful for being miserable here  and that i need to quit  i just need to quit and find something else but i m so scared to take that leap  i need someone to push me   thanks for reading  and sorry for the wall of text ,czm025

485,Working for a local restaurant was the worst.,i worked at a local restaurant up until today  a small  family-owned restaurant  i got the job as a host and wanted to train to be a server  well  that never happened   no room for growth and the owners were really bad about paying us  i only got paid  7 25 an hour and we didn't get any tip share  they said we could use the tips from to-go orders only  but we rarely got to-go orders  and they actually lied about us getting those tips because we never got them  they'd conveniently forget and would just take them for themselves    also  they kept saying they'd let me be a server  but they didn't  the servers they had were family friends of theirs and also their 2 sons  so i just kept being promised but got stuck as a host making minimum wage and not enough hours   had to quit  not worth it  and now i have no idea what i'm going to do for work  i'm so burnt out on retail food service jobs  thankfully i don't have to worry about rent right now because i live with my family have good support  and i start college next year but damn    it's exhausting ,d04cbb

488,I am in position where i can have easy working hours but for crappy wage,with stem degree i became a high school teacher  due to certain and very specific mental issues i wasnt sure if i could pull it off but it seems i can function  this means i can probably have a job with shitty pay but still not a minimum wage in my country  its really poor money for the west standards but in my third world hole its a little above average  with little hours and stress which is amazing  i live with parents so i dont have much expenses  before this i had  been testing waters in a stem field and job was mega stressful and demanding in all kind of aspects  i would rather be a modest peasant  than work something soul crushing for the extra money and status and whatever  i am lucky to have this opportunity at all and if i decide to hop back into slavery machine and test waters its my own fault for beeing greedy  only ambitions and desires would fuel the greedinness and have me jump outside this comfy zone ,d07w0f
489,"How are we supposed to change the world when a small group is ""leading"" the others...",when the number of people and the reliability of them are becoming less and less  money is a neutral resource being controlled by the  1  for their own selfish endeavors while simultaneously having to give just enough of what people need so that they can survive all to repeat the process of having to do others work just to get the scraps of your  boss  or leader or  owner   i'm not saying that money needs to go entirely but we need to fix the system in a way that is for the majority fair and isn't putting people in a system that is based on  power levels  through money but through equality and better communication  i want to see a world where my descendants can all work together and do what they want with out having to worry about whether or not they are accepted enough or able to be apart of  society  because of there  lack of funds  or because they don't have a job  instead of being an independent culture being driven by the unseen voices and following what is deemed as right we need to unite and be one  but how do we do that  psychedelics are one big answer to the puzzle since they open us up in ways that others can't but with the laws and control over them and the fact that many people can have a hard time with the experience or are busy with jobs and trying to survive  we need other ways of improving as a whole and not helping to make the  1  better off while they make us suck on their toes for the sweet nectar of life through money and material possessions to keep us occupied and distracted waiting to go to  work  the next day  i won't be another cog in a system that wants me to perform in a better and better way without letting me the time and resources to be able to improve    sorry if its a little confusing and long but if you see this please ask questions  spread the message  and join me in the revolution to improve the future   seriously though help  i can't see a fulfilling life if all i'm doing is worrying about money in some way or another and i hope you agree with me   i also see money as a lifeline but the lifeline has been altered in way that makes me a pawn for a king that doesn't care about me  without the lifeline i feel as if i am dead already   i got a lot to get out yet no one to get it out to so i put it here in hopes that others will follow somehow   thank you ,d07oso
490,Hunters/Gatherers had a higher quality of life than the Modern World,what they did on a day to day basis would never be considered  work  it was something they had to do and benefited them directly  and it was a matter of life and death  they didn't complain about the hours and if they got the job done early  they were finished for they day or more than that  stress was created by the difficulty of the job  not the politics around it    contrast that to the modern  job  most of the time  it only benefits the owner  it doesn't have to be done  it doesn't matter if you get your work done within 5 minutes or 5 hours  you still have to stay for the entire shift  most of stress is the generated by the people around you  not the job itself   does anyone else agree  where did it all go wrong ,d075z4
491,"The definitive solution to fucking end work forever. Listen please, this is SERIOUS shit.",wanting the end of work is a noble cause  since working causes a lot of pain  distress  suffering and humiliation   if we really want to solve this problem  we need to look at the root of its cause  surprisingly  the evil is not capitalism  billionaires or corrupted governments  even though they are also part of the issue    the real evil has always been in front of our eyes  and it is  human nature   humans beings are  needy creatures  by default  we feel hunger naturally  while satisfying this urge requires our  effort  we have to  strive  in order to survive    the fact that we feel hunger and others neccesitties every day is  to me  overwhelming  it's the way we are    what can we do  for me  the solution is  stop reproducing    reproduction is the cause of all human problems   think about it  we were all brought into existence without our consent  we are force to deal with a situation we didn't agree to have in the first place    we do not break any moral rule by not reproducing  however  we can cause a lot of unnecessary suffering by having babies  creating necessities that didn't need to exist in the first place    sadly  i have no the solution to end work during our lifetimes  but this is the solution to end work  in less than 100 years    forever   thoughts ,d07ee7

495,Are most of the people here men or women?,i find it interesting that anyone who isn't a drug addict would want to abolish work   honestly  what would you do with your life   produce more children to consume more   endless consumption without really paying the price  work   work limits our ability to consume   if we don't have work  population growth will explode out of control   there are still places where people starve to death and we are talking about creating a system based on endless consumption   so my questions are two   how many of you are men and do you still live with your parents   because i would understand  if so   or maybe if you're past retirement age but still working   but if you're a working age male  why would you want to end all work ,d0atiu
