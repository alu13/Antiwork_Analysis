3,Fresh to the job scene,im currently looking for my first job because of family obligations for most of my teen life i wasnt able to get a job because i had to be at home taking care of my siblings and maintaining the house but now theyve gotten older and can look after themselves so that allows me to get a job and wow i am not a excited at all i do not want to get a job at all i love working and being active but the thought of getting paid almost nothing at some crappy job sounds scary and horrible thats not living man   to end this off with a question is it really possibly to make money off the things you love the internet is a great place to start career but it seems like such an uphill battle fighting for attention and all that,k3vzqb

5,Being excited to get a new job seems awfully sad when you think about it.,my friend got a new job recently we all were invited to dinner to celebrate i thought the entire time what are we celebrating  having a job is something i need to live i spend hours of my day commuting doing boring things i dont enjoy tasks for other people i get home when its dark and have just enough time to get some food and think about going to work the next day   my typical day right now is getting up early in the cold showering to wake up doing the mundane morning routine then taking the commute to work i get into the office blinded by the fluorescent lights i get some coffee and spend the first half of my day talking to people i dont really want to be spending my time with the rest of the day is about spending all my energy on things for other people while checking how long is left before i get to go home  then we get old and retire except now i have all that free time to enjoy but without the youthful energy i once had to enjoy it that energy was spent working   its all terribly depressing when you sit down and think about it but i need that job to live and ps i hate when people tell me do the job you love and youll never spend a day in your life working again because unless you can find me a job which allows me to lounge around some days cuddle with my cat watch some shows and have some light exercise then perhaps head outside try new hobbies and travel then sadly that job doesnt exist,k3mhc7
6,Teaching High Schoolers,im a high school teacher online and spend about half my day with seniors we have one 30 minute class with about 15 kids where the whole point is for me to checkin with them and make sure theyre set up to graduate being keenly aware of the state of things its really hard to be optimistic with them about the future i know several of them will certainly go off and thrive doing something they love but the rest are sure to be eaten up by the systems that be that frightful hobgoblin will burn their world and enslave them to help burn it they for the most part are aware of this as well i think its a misconception that young people are hopeful young people need power to enact change   in the words of greta thunberg at the age of sixteen   weve had 30 years of peptalking and selling positive ideas and im sorry but it doesnt work because if it would have the emissions would have gone down by now they havent and yes we do need hope of course we do but the one thing we need more than hope is action once we start to act hope is everywhere  i am often at a loss  i usually just encourage them to dismantle systems of oppression and make art,k33lb0
7,Why are people worried about robots stealing their jobs?,this is purely hipothetical if robots are ever able to take over all or most of our jobs why would that be a bad thing what would happen then shouldnt everybody be free if that happens i know it wont because capitalism and the rich have to make money somehow but damn there would really be no need for people to work then but im sure they still would our society is sad,k30bmi
8,Post Covid Work Culture/Stress for entry Level Associates (INDIA),as you all know economy has been pretty rough since lockdown with many losing their jobs along with their life savings this question is for those who were still left with their jobs but were working at an entry level for various companies in bangalore how has been the work from home experience post lock down also if you guys were called to work from office again post your experiences here  how has the management been treating you were they behaving same like before pre covid era or were they resorting to threatening measures to get the work done have you guys been working more or put under more stress than before also i would like to know some of the positive outcomes that work culture has bought for few people here post lockdown the last point i want to know from the workforce here is that do you think hr ever really listens to your concerns or problems or they are just there to secretly take side with operations management leaders please note  this post is not for the senior level management people including team leaders because i know there is always a confirmation bias that would come out from this level of management and i am not blaming them its inherited human nature to always prove their point of view that they are right i am sure the upper level management is dealing with their own set of challenges but trust me no one can deny the fact that the real productive work which gives an organization value and brings in the profit is being done by the ones who are at bottom of the organization level i am talking about junior level associates analysts programmersmis executives etc who actually sits for 1016 hours a day and gives out the real productivity i would love to hear their point of view thats all,k3c530

12,I just had one of the most depresing talks of my life,im spending the day at my parents house and my mother came to me to ask me how i was doing at college we dont talk much about studies but i almost always try to be sincere with her so i told her that i was getting super stressed out because of all the assignments from college something thats getting worse because i hate my career more every day that passes she then told me that this is what life is and how my sister comes home super stressed from work most days and even crying a few times from the preasure his boss puts on her she then put herself as example of the same as my sister and lastly told me how my father the only one that enjoys is work in the family has ridiculously long work hours that force him to work in weekends and stay till late most nights she was going for the life is hard but u have to live it approach but has only managed to leave me desolated   i guess that if i had any hope in my future it may have helped me to get motivated but what i didnt tell her is that lately the stress is becoming depression as i see my future darker every day right now i just want to walk away from this place until my legs collapse but i cant because im a prisioner of my own life a life thats only going to get worse when i end college  pd english is not my first language sorry for any mistake,k3ajic
13,"My dream is to live free. I idolize buddha who found pure bliss while wandering and being “homeless”. It proves that wealth is a concept, that contentment is an idea. Why do we buy into the concept that it takes so much time to get by?",in my mind i envision a root cellar stocked with canned goods a bunch of chickens and rabbits outside living for use as food and a log cabin in the woods  to me the freedom to work hard to build my life of value is true wealth our society us diseased a person doesnt even have the right to carve out a life of value they are expected to pay into a system they had no choice in joining this is slavery or if its not set me free on un owned land and turn me loose,k354qm

16,Things I like and dislike about this sub,after getting downvoted heavily for making a fair point imo i wanted to wrap up what i think is good and bad about this sub  what i agree with  i initially came here because i have one of those boring office jobs that will tire you out till your brain gets drained completely i know there are worse jobs out there and i know how hard it is for many to make ends meet at the end of the month i do not have that problem and therefore am privileged   nevertheless i have every right to hate my job hate company culture and corporate bullshit i despise many aspects of capitalism and am deeply worried about how money accumulates and how 1 of the population owns 50 of the moneylandinfluence and so on this is deeply flawed and it gets worse every day this is why i joined rantiwork and this is what i agree with if a company makes a surplus people should benefit from it not everyone contributed in the same way so it shouldnt be divided by the number of people but still there are limits to how much a person can actually contribute and therefore earn and right now this balance is just ridiculous we shouldnt let neoliberalism dictate how wealth is distributed and make sure that chances are fair for everyone  what i disagree with  many people in this sub seem to oversimplify that just by distributing existing wealth taking it from the rich everyone can do whatever they want and follow their dreams even if you took all the billionaires money it wouldnt allow everyone to do their hobbies full time this is just not how economy works you want to be an artist and have society pay for your basic needs so be it but then everyone should be able to do so all our blue collar workers included this will dramatically increase the prices for those services and taking out your trash building your street growing your food and so on will be much more expensive because if given the chance most people would rather do anything else or at least not do their job for 40h a week   some of you might say that we just need to automatize jobs but there are limits to that too in the us there is 1 of the gdp coming from agriculture 20 industrial and 79 is the service industry you just cant automatize all of that and to be honest i dont see that coming anytime soon  we could all have more time to spare for the things we love but that doesnt come with having the newest gadgets a big car your own property and so on you cant have it all at once because eventually someone will have to produce it for you we are all dependent of contributing our part to have wealth as a society unless we agree on lowering our standards we will not be able to all do whatever we want all day i am not talking about living in the woods but still you would have to give up a decent amount of wealth in order to do so as a society and as far as i can tell the vast majority is not willing to even sacrifice the tiniest bit of their wealth so this is just not a realistic scenario  i would really wish for this thread to end in a constructive discussion but i guess that people will downvote the sit out of this thread,k3zj84

25,"As a European, the US is the last place I'd want to live",im from the uk and live in france now the us is a seriously broken society just the stories i hear about overworking and the pure cost of things over there genuinely shocks me if you guys are sick of working i really think the best option is to just leave the states  in the uk things arent quite as good as in france but the healthcare is completely free i can turn up at a hospital with just myself and be treated  in france the govt just seems to hand out money there are a few organisations which just give you money to help with rent and stuff if you can show you need it  you rarely do though two people can live comfortably for 1500 in most cities outside of paris some cities rents can be as low as 400 i lived in nantes and paid that for a small apartment  i get the impression that over there you guys need thousands just to survive and are constantly living in fear of a financial emergency i can think of 50 countries id live in before the us  maybe my opinion is inaccurate but this is what i see looking from the outside wonder if you guys agree and have ever considered ditching the us,k36u8e

31,24 and Disabled,im somewhat of a lurker on this sub i recently got my first fulltime job in october 2019 it was actually americorps service in an office but ive been working from home since march that term ended in august 2020 but then i signed on to do another 300 hours for the same org down to half time im so fucking sick of it to be honest it was okay earlier on but now i have no excitement for it fortunately i should be done the second week of january 2021   thats a little intro so like i said in the title im 24 and disabled the conundrum im in is that i could choose to never work again because i receive social security but that means living in poverty the rest of my life im not too excited about working but i want to do something to improve the world i could try working for myself again on green buildings so i set my own hours and shit thats probably what im going to do honestly office jobs fucking suck  anyway what do you all do for work or are some able to not work too,k3pt28
32,It ain't over till the boss man sings.,exactly two weeks ago i put in my notice i work with children with disabilities and quitting meant they would have to find someone else to take my cases they told me they would make a fading plan and once my cases were faded we could amicably split fine   they have done nothing in fact no one has even talked to me since the day i put in my resignation i have another job now i am literally employed somewhere else but my previous employer hasnt faded me off my cases they know the guilt providers feel when we leave our clients with no services they want me to feel like i am abandoning my cases when it is really the higher ups who have made no plans for continuity of care   today i was sick i am salaried and even though i can make up my work during the rest of the week they told me i needed to use pto fine i dont care i submitted the request denied the same manager responded telling me that because i resigned i cant use pto if i resigned why am i still here they docked me for today   this feels like an abusive relationship i left but they wont let me leave they have ignored my fading plan but they sure as hell didnt ignore me asking to make up my work later in the week   my work   no it isnt my work its theirs just because you cant find a replacement doesnt mean i didnt quit i am trying to compose a professional email telling them i am done waiting why is it so hard to think of the words to say they have stepped all over me for the past year and after i finally got the courage to quit here i am still working here   can you please leave me alone i dont work here anymore,k4371n
33,So I asked my manager for resignation from my crappy toxic job,im a new member and i saw a lot of posts about people sharing their experiences so i decided to share a bit of mine too  i work as a software developer for a local company i started as an intern and became a fulltime employee since my intern times i was already the main maintainer of the companys most important system they just threw loads of work on me and forced me to work overtime even this being literally illegal for interns  in those 2 years working for this company i had lots of mental breakdowns and overwhelming sensation of dread and hopelessness worked my bones off for a salary below the average for it professionals where i live having to deal with a chaotic work place with toxic people and incompetent superiors that one time they forced us to work 8 am to 11 pm from mondays to sundays for 3 weeks because they thought it was a good idea to start an enterpriselevel project 3 weeks before the deadline  i snapped this weekend and decided to quit now i still have to work the next 2 weeks because the law protect the company forbidding me from quitting whenever i desire to without previous warnings but im already a lot better and brighter than before my gastritis and anxiety are under control im not so stressed anymore and im even a bit energetic this is so weird im not energetic in years  my boomer parents are already bothering me they are shocked saying im complete pussy for quitting an idiot for choosing being unemployed in times like that and i need to find another job right now without even letting me have time to recover from trauma and chronic stress ps i dont even live with my parents in years  anyway im also worried about the future i dont know if im going to find a job anytime soon but its liberating at the same time i hope i can get some rest after all of this  i hope none of you ever have some experience like that no one deserves it  thanks for reading i had to let it out of my chest have a great day,k499fr

54,Gave notice to quit my job but man I just cannot do it anymore,i started a new job earlier this month as a cashier at a department store i wasnt happy about it because i just finished my bachelors degree in the summer and wanted a job in my field but the job market is obviously not the best right now so i had to apply for retail stuff which ive been doing since high school and i absolutely despise it and was so happy to be done but i took this cashier job because i figured itll be easy and familiar and i needed some money   i absolutely hate it though and i didnt realize how much worse its all gotten with covid and my new workplace doesnt take anyones temp when you come into work coworkers have all been talking about going to the bars every night and a bunch of them already had the virus plus all the customers who cant wear their masks properly and come through my line coughing i cant do it anymore lmao my notice was to leave next friday but i just wanna stop showing up i mean they already know im quitting so whats a few days early right its not gonna be a problem really because im going to law school next year so i doubt ditching a cashier job is gonna come back to bite me in the legal profession,k301s7
55,Need Advice.,first a bit of backstory i work in a nursing home kitchen as the kitchen manager we have gone this whole time without an covid cases we get tested 3 times a week all of a sudden we have a major outbreak going on another thing to know is i am the best worker which i hate i am the one that does all the little things that everyone forget the one who picks up everyones slack the one who get used and abused within the last few months i have been the one to pick up most if no all open shifts we had one out that had a baby people on vacation and so on the last few weeks i had been like 3 peoples amount of work into one shift what doesnt really count for anything but a very exhausted employee  there was a shift opened on sunday decided on friday not to take it this morning i wake up to text so and so got sent home possible covid and they are still short for the evening shift going to have to deal with the aftermath tomorrow at this point i want to get covid just to self quarantine i can without contracting but my anxiety has been so high to even consider asking to do that instead i just dont know what to do any suggestions,k3eqwd

57,automated bartender,my former roommate is a chef and a few years ago he took me to a trade show that i saw an automated bartender now if all our needs were met you would only need somebody to load the machine and program it depending on how busy the bar is it may be an hour worth of work a month to load the machine and programming only needs to be done once the machines have an id reader to ensure the person is over 21 and a credit card reader with a tap and pay so the person can pay for their drinks its an absolutely great machine to install if all our basic needs were met i can honestly see this being installed over the next 10 years in most locations a machine like this is a big reason why we eventually need to adapt some sort of basic income the rules that were in place for our grandparents need to change for modern society,k39y5w

62,"Has anybody here moved from an IT career (software dev/data science) to the trades (plumbing, electrician etc) in their 30's?",full disclosure i did post this question also over on httpswwwredditcomraskmenover30commentsk450xqanybodymovedfromsoftwaredevdatasciencetohttpswwwredditcomraskmenover30commentsk450xqanybodymovedfromsoftwaredevdatascienceto i believe its consistent with the rules of rantiwork to post it here also i wanted to get the opinions of people here      key  ds  data scientistdata science   sd  software developersoftware development     currently employed as a data scientist ds in the uk but really starting to burn out ive always been a life long learner but the rate at which the field is changing is quite inhuman  its hard to explain if youre not in the field still basically the completion is enormous read global competition and the field is quite saturated and ive noticed anecdotally that employer demands are increasing and wages are stagnating people are even starting to point this out httpstowardsdatasciencecomridiculousrequirementsfromdatascientistjobadsd84fa716af73httpstowardsdatasciencecomridiculousrequirementsfromdatascientistjobadsd84fa716af73 to do well in your career you really need to be in london or another expensive tech hub i know one can now work remotely but it is really not as fun as its sounds and companies offering remote working opens themselves up to more candidates and more competition for you frankly i dont think it will be long until data scientists are ten a penny i dont really think i want to keep having to stay up to date i feel like the returns are ever diminishing i certainly cant see my self doing this in 5 years  i keep thinking about getting into the trades my reasoning is as follows  ampx200b   i know that things change in the trades electricians have to keep up with new legislation for example but not at the rate they do in ds i dont think you can truly feel like a master in data science or software development a software devs skillset can quickly become obsolete youre basically continuously competing with fresh blood because the tool stack has shifted and your experience with an outdated technology counts for nothing an electrician on the other hand has skills for life not only is one constantly having to learn but one also has to constantly ensure that they are not working themselves into a corner ie you constantly have to hedge your bets with the topics you choose to focus on  many of the trades have a barrier to entry you need to be licenced whereas anybody can call themselves a data scientist or even a software dev you cant call yourself an electriciangas engineer  dssd can easily be outsourced its harder to outsource the trades  dssd is increasingly becoming automated again you have to keep up with the latest tools all the while adapting to aspects of your job being automated in fact its kind of your job to automate stuff and eventually put yourself and other out of work i dont see electricians etc becoming automated any time soon  dssd if not working remotely need to live in expensive tech hubs london oxford cambridge those with a skilled trade are in need everywhere  many dssd employers expect you to have passion this is especially true on the ds side i dont see this kind of cult culture in the trades people seem so much more down to earth in the trades but maybe i just havent looked hard enough as tech workers we seem to have to wear this mask and be super excited about synergies and growth hacking nobody expects a plumber do plumbing as a hobby in the ds world there is a culture that expects you to live and breath data science and technology  the ds hype train there is so much hype out there that setting realistic goals puts you in the dog house ive lost count of the number of times a nontechnical manager has told me to do something i explain that its not actually possible im an expert in my field and ive been told just to get it done it turns out they skimmed a medium article got the wrong idea and made promises to important people without first consulting anybody who knows whats they are doing instead of owning up to their mistake they double down declare it doable and try to make out that you arent good enough at your job  i feel like dssd careers are a race to the bottom ds and sd literally give code away for free httpsgithubcomhttpsgithubcom and companies in need of data science solutions offer prize money instead of hiring a team to complete the work httpswwwkagglecomhttpswwwkagglecom these companies get thousands of solutions for putting 10k prize money down again i dont see this occurring in the trades nobody expects to be able to put 1k down for a new bathroom have 200 plumbers all submit their bathroom pay only the winning plumber and keep the other 199 bathrooms  relates to the previous point you can strike out on your own as a plumber you can start your own business not easy but doable as a data scientist its more difficult when everybody gives their code way for free on github  in the trades you can work on the side in the it world most contracts forbid moonlighting and you sign over all your ipcopyright rights to the employer they basically own you  all in all i dont think a dssd career is all its cracked up to be i know the trades have their own sets of issues your body goes etc its long hard work but i feel like it doesnt suffer from the above issues      so with this in mind has anyone changed fields is the grass really greener or am i being naive i dont want to romanticise the trades or suggest for one moment that they are easy so forgive me but i do feel they offer opportunities to somebody with sound work ethic am i thinking about this wrong   im becoming quite jaded and burnout and reevaluating options but no idea what my next move should be my current career path is giving me a lot of anxiety tackling big openend data science projects with uncertain outcomes doing the work of 23 people mangers with no understand of the work calling the shots the intense competition nipping at my heels i know one could argue that all work is uncertain but in the data science world that statement is on another level one often doesnt know if what they are attempting to do is even possible,k48ws3

64,Why do so many poor and low-income people HATE socialism?,you really cant even discuss finances or poverty with a socialist angle without people absolutely losing their shit over this spooky word known as socialism reddit seems to be full of reactionaries too  capitalism must be one hell of a brainwashing tool because you cant convince the majority of these people otherwise so many people think the simple solution is to go 50100k dollars in debt in hopes of getting a good paying job go to walmart or mcdonalds and ask the workers if they have a college degree the answers will shock you  the more simpler boomer reaction is just get a better job i really want to start punching people when they come up with these idiotic catchphrases seriously if you made a boomer doll with a pullstring this would be a phrase they would say   now im not antiboomer my dad is one and he understands the situation at hand but there are soooo many boomers who think the entire world operates the way it did during the 60s and 70s seriously their entire view of society politics and economy has pretty much remain unchanged some 50 years later   the reason get a better job pisses me off so much because not only is it a stupid and overused argument the math is flawed its really no different than walking up to an elderly person with a cane and shouting get a better body hey i might have to use that sometime some old fart tells me this   if you look at the data its pretty simple to see there arent enough good paying jobs for everyone to have one if you count a good paying job as at least 20 per hour then only 38 of americans have one this means 62 of the entire workforce cannot posses a better paying job not only that but then who would flip the burgers mop the floors ring people up wipe old peoples butts etc   on top of that so many people my age still vote republican when they only do everything they can to screw poor and lowincome people over  i got really excited when sanders ran hell i even got to meet him in person he wasnt even that socialist yet a lot of people still hated him  i dont get it so many people whine and bitch that they are poor but they wont do anything to fix it they wont vote socialist or democrat they wont protest or suggest revolution either a lot of them are just temporarily embarrassed millionaires as well,k3ov4e

91,Confused about the purpose of this sub and had some question,disclaimer i dont mean any negative intent just want to understand your perspective  hi im not completely sure what this sub is about and was curious about it so i thought id ask i dont understand what ending work means i understand better working conditions higher wages and proposals like ubi but im lost on this one   1 dont we need occupations like doctors to take care of people and engineers to innovate and solve new problems dont we have to pay these people to do these things  2 even if a full blown ubi was implemented isnt the idea that it would be funded by taxes if no one had to work and most people chose not to how could we even fund ubi  3 in an antiwork society are people still allowed to work for someone and make wages if they want to  4 if no one works then how does society decided who gets limitedluxury resources like gold,k2soh9

100,[UK] How do you cope?,this is more of rantvent than a chance to fix it  ive strugled with mental health issues for what feels like most of my life depression and anxiety etc but what i feel now is completely different  ive done all the expected stuff in my life school college degree all the things that are supposed to prepare you to work to be successful and  to be happy yet it doesnt i dont want to work i dont want to be successful and i aint happy  i work at bland contact centre job in the uk i have my own car i have my own hobbies i still live with parents  and savings but its not making me happy   i want to own my own house  practically impossible without handing 40 hours a week of my life over to a menial job that provides no benefit other than to line the pockets of my already wealthy boss for the next 3p years of my life  i want a better job  i was told that if you go to university get some relevant experience you can do whatever you want earn lots of money and be happy but its not true all the jobs are the same bullshit jobs with a different brand and managers all with the same outcome a rich boss unfulfilled me these jobs have abitrary requirements looking for a positive person who can operate random company software  even if you get one of these jobs that anyone in the world can do because they are easy and the company chooses employes based on who they can exploit more not because you are more qualified or intelligent you will not be fulfilled because they are pointless jobs that  have one purpose  more money for the rich at the expense of the working class there is no dream job because i do not dream of working   like is this it is the purpose of my life predetermined and should i just resign to working a mundane job in order to just exist   questions how do you cope with people who dont even realise they are being exploited  how do you cope with people who refuse to educate themselves to learn of others sufferings and injustices do you know people in real life who share your perspective about antiwork how do you cope with working with people who are bootlickers   most of my friends are similar in this perspective but when at work it seems no one cares about the fact they are wasting their lives to get someone else rich  im not even asking for alot what i desire is to be able to be fulfilled to learn to educate to grow and be happy to be a productive and beneficial member to our societyi want a house not a big one filled with random products we have been told to buy not a waste of resourcesi dont expect a private jet i dont expect constant free clothes or food i just want to wake up in the morning with no dread about 8 hours of my day more when not working from home being wasted for the rest of my life i want to wake up knowing today i can do what i want and what is required for my fellow community  we are not supposed to live like this,k3etvp

120,"""Minimum"" Wage",so im only 25 i have a question for any folks here with more life experience  were there always this many minimum wage jobs ive been scrolling through indeed this afternoon and it seems like every single job is at minimum or like 25 cents above not just grocery stores amp fast food but supposedly important jobs like healthcare city government social services a lot of these jobs require years of experience so theyre not totally entry level what is going on   have human services always been this devalued i dont think people who are against raising the minimum wage know that so many people are making minimum wage and important people the folks taking care of your retired parents are likely making minimum wage    i live in oregon and in 2022 we will finally have a minimum wage of 1350  which was known to be not enough already years ago when the fight for 15 was a big thing are people just screwed unless theyre salaried is this supposed to be a work your way up incentive its so very very hard to justify giving all my time and effort for 12 measly dollars its kind of embarrassing honestly they want us to beg and scrape for12 dollars maybe 10 dollars after taxes amp healthcare its dehumanizing also i was raised in missouri which still has federal minimum 725 omfg  why would i give my all to my work if that work doesnt give its all back the employment contract is supposed to benefit all parties involved   anyways this was mostly a rant about the use of the minimum wage to normalize lowpaying higheffort jobs and also would love to hear anyones insights into how it worked before the 2000s has it always been this way and im just having an especially bad day,k47ekx
121,The only true way that work will abolished,the only way that the social and economical construct of humanity will change is imo through automation the thing a lot of people fear the most might actually be the key as ai gets advance enough to figure out cures to diseases and a formulasolution that can solve world hungerthen that would eliminate part of the need for humans to work you could also program airobots to build a community that people can live in with materials that dont hurt the environment its already been done a thousand times through multiple projects with limited funding and is progressing slowlybut humanity doesnt want to embrace it you already use computerscellphones cars and all the technology around you and never gave it much thought as to how much it helps you cope with the challenges of lifebut when it comes to saving you from cancer or a traumatic injuryyou wouldnt trust a machine to administer care or medicine why   this is where the future is headed its going to happen its inevitable people are always quick to assume the machines will take the jobs that is the whole point the only job humans need is the ones assign to yourself to accomplish something you want to accomplish not working for some corrupt ceo paying you pennies to be exploited for 40 hours a week why do you work for foodshelter and pay your bills like electricity etc if that is already taken care of by technology then what would there be left for you to do besides spend time doing things you enjoy working should be a choice not a necessity that idea would be so foreign to majority of people it would leave them dumbfounded  people are too in love with money and its monopoly ex oil industrymeat processingfossil energyindustrial agriculture etc and dont want to embrace a lifestyle changeso my thought is if we dont allow the assistance of ai to accelerate our learning and machines to cover many labor intensive tasks then we wont be able to reach the point where we have the option to merge with the two that is the only solution because evolution wont be fast enough to survive the coming world events or space itself and that will be the end of humanity sooner than people care to think,k4d8j1

143,Am I a contradiction?,so i need help figuring this one out i hate working i always have i always will however and i need to speak frankly here otherwise i cant get to where i want to go with this i work to a much higher standard than the majority of those around me and it has been this way in all the office jobs ive had when i have work to do i cant help but go in as much as i loathe it im an editor btw it might be the companies that ive worked for but some of the shit ive seen passed off as acceptable would be hard for some people to believe id say that some colleagues were stealing a living but then that phrase goes against what i believe in and isnt it also what they should be doing completely blagging it theyre winning if theyre managing to do the bare minimum and still get paid pretty fucking well for it arent they the ultimate antiworkers in that sense except theyre not they are the people who keep this game running so now i have to partake in the bullshit system that they help maintain whilst also toiling over the degrading and i mean degrading bullshit or work that they fling in my direction i think of some people i know who are struggling unemployed or hating their jobs with an unholy passion who could do what these fuckers do with their eyes closed and it infuriates me all these people do is sit in meetings bloviating and tossing each other off complete unaware of their own uselessness   maybe this is why theyre so in love with work office life and all that bullshit because they dont break a sweat doing it they can get paid for doing fuck all and its an unlucky few who have to clean up their shit jokes on me right   and maybe this is why i hate work because the whole ordeal is wiping the arses of fucking idiots,k17xv6
144,Finally quit my toxic job!!!,so the day after my performance review with my toxic manager i received a job offer   in that performance review i was told my bonus was being deducted because i had been disrespectful and the crazy bitch wanted to add tone to my career objectives this is after she had already added patience and empathy to my career goals previously   after i gave notice i wrote a long email to the head of hr and the global head of my department giving them details of toxic managers abuse of power and unfair evaluation of employee personality traits instead of work as expected hr has been useless but it still felt good sending that email   im serving my one month notice now   toxic manager tried to call me on the phone and left me a text message i proceeded to block her lol   i told hr i want crazy bitch to cease all communication with me because she has caused me a lot of mental distress and i have been a victim of retaliation for innocuous things i said during my 1 on 1 meetings with crazy bitch    crazy bitch has been speculating to my team mates that i must have quit because she promoted my peer to be my supervisor and i am bitter about it this is complete nonsense because this peersupervisor is a really good friend of mine    crazy bitch then says she doesnt believe i have found a job    crazy bitch further speculated i must have started to look for a job after a team exercise she did where she told me i needed to have more empathy which resulted in me crying seems like she cant make up her mind she thinks ive been job hunting for months but also does not believe i have found a job    crazy bitch told new supervisor i am negative disruptive and unprofessional but my stakeholders told me they are sad i am leaving and some even wrote me recommendations on linkedin   its just so fun to watch this control freak unravelling her whole identity seems to revolve around her career and her success she loves to say our team is a family and we are super close look what happens when you upset your family   ampx200b  thankfully we are still working from home now ill be here with my netflix and popcorn while i serve out the rest of my notice period,k17lzv

156,*Rant* My employer cares more about productivity than public or employee safety.,tldr my boss might have covid and is still working and her boss doesnt give a shit about covid regulations and public safety and now im scared i might be sick i want to report them but i have no clue how to even do that or if i can   as if i didnt have a few dozen reasons that i hate my job i am not so angered with my job that i really want to get this out there   when i first started this job we immediately had to quarantine for two weeks because an employee had a family member with covid we all got tested then went back to work after 14 days with pay it was nice actually for context thatll matter later we work in a small office that comes face to face with the public there are less than 6 employees at a small retail loan office   fast forward a few months my boyfriends mother was diagnosed with covid we had just seen her 5 days prior and he had seen her less than 48 hours ago at the time i told my manager and she jokingly said lets pretend you didnt say that because if we get quarantined again they arent gonna pay us this time i was very concerned to say the least   then about 2 weeks went by and now my manager is sick as a dog she has all the symptoms of covid she still showed up to work just to let us know shes going to get tested for covid because she thinks she has it she got tested and then let the district manager know this and he said you should probably go home if you dont feel good because if you get anyone sick with covid they could sue us   not you should go home because youre not feeling well and need to rest  not you should go home because youre endangering your employees and the public  his only concern is them getting sued priorities right   so she stays at work all day and then takes the next day off because she literally cant get out of bed then she came right back today because her very concerned boss has literally nagged her constantly at home through texts about numbers and productivity and is threatening her job if she doesnt push us to do more loans and collect on more accounts so its clear his concern for her working while sick is bs because hes scaring her into working while sick because its month end so she was at work all day in this tiny office not social distancing or wearing a face mask she even texted him and said she isnt feeling good at all but its up to him if she goes home or not he only said okay he didnt even answer her question so she stayed all day today again then he harped on us all about productivity clearly giving no shits that shes at work possibly with covid which then inspired her to hold a private meeting with me about my productivity in an even smaller room 3 feet away from me with her germs going everywhere again she possibly has covid but still hasnt gotten any results yet   now im sitting here feeling randomly lightheaded and my throat has been bothering me all day i am choosing to believe its just due to stress lack of sleep and anxiety but now im worried i have covid because of these shitty greedy sociopathic corporate  leaches i dont know if i can report them or what i just am so sick on this place and i dont even want to go back friday,k16mu7
157,Thoughts about mental health treatment,does every discussion about mental health seem so fake to everyone else also this might not 100 the right sub but i feel you guys might understand  im fairly certain i have adhd but i feel like i could never bring up the true root of my anxiety around working until i die because no one will understand or any other radical thought therapy seems like a load of bs that is only designed to keep us productive   i have anxiety about working only to spend my precious money on drugs that make me able to keep working i shouldnt have to manipulate my brain and the way i am to survive in this society i should be valued and accepted for what i am but alas thats not the case its so messed up that i need to trick my brain into doing things it doesnt want to do anyway  but on the other hand i want to believe that it could be helpful for living a less anxious life im stuck in the hellhole so i might as well make it easier for myself by getting treatment until i finally am able to die in peace so here i sit unsure if i would be okay with receiving  a prescription or not i think i am going to at least make one appointment so i can get an official diagnosis tho   thoughts,k2ezba

Not lazy just don’t want to do meaningless shit for someone who wouldn’t care if I dropped dead the next day,i graduated college two years ago and furthered my education through two years of continuing studies for another bachelors degree in nutrition i graduated and was fortunate enough to get accepted to a competitive internship across country and moved i loved the thought of finally being somewhere brand new and having that independence and freedom of starting fresh but i absolutely hated the idea of conforming to a box i knew it in my head i didnt like the program but carried on anyway because thats what weve been conditioned to believe right get a degree slave away at a 95 job get married buy a house have kids and continuing slaving away for the next 40 years until you have the next exciting thing to look forward toretirement i was afraid of disappointing the people around me but i knew deep down my life is mine and only mine and i couldnt justify spending a minute doing something i couldnt bare just so i could please the people around me by participating in the ratrace of our capitalist society i want the freedom to work wherever i want doing things i love and have ample time to pursue my interests and travel   anyway i ended up withdrawing from the program because my head and heart both just werent in it i immediately got a job in the nonprofit sector and had zero drive or passion for it it wasnt a typical corporate job but there was no meaning to it and i hated being disrespected and talked down to like i had no worth so i trusted my gut and left right now for income i am a freelancer taking care of peoples dogs i started about a month ago and have made 700 which is decent for starters but not remotely enough for survival im very content watching dogs for money as it brings me a lot of joy and is my primary form of therapy and encourages me to get some exercise in when i have a dog under my care   i also have a lot of interest in creative work particularly in digital media im currently helping a friend launch her business by helping her design templates for social media use that matches her aesthetic and branding she does not have any clients at the moment since she has not launched yet so i told her id be happy to help her without any monetary compensation right now since itll help me build a portfolio i love this type of work but i also need more income but do not want to make the same mistakes of jumping into a job solely for the money i want to continue freelancing but feel stuckunqualified and i know the market is saturated im not looking to make 6 figures a year but simply just enough to be comfortable and then some any advice for me here on next steps id love to hear your story if you started from the bottom freelancing and now do it for a fulltime income,k0zy3q

212,[RANT] Supervisor and higher-management gets paid at least double for less work and being able to boss around?, i remember my first day where i got almost fired twice   some supervisor made only me do the literal heavylifting for things that were also at a high place where i could barely reach filled with items of varying sizes some which fell on me she made me do it for like ten aisles alone i started on one aisle and and then a coworker called me to two other aisles to work on after i worked on those i returned still having some of my energy left after all those heavylifting to the initial aisle and the supervisor thought i hadnt budged from there and called me slow and speed up dude in her accent i can understand questioning me to check why i was slow i wasnt but   i thought if you were getting paid better especially being at a higherlevel with less work you would be acting more professional but no guess you just want to stroke your ego  later i finished all my assignments and was given an easier task after i went to get other resources i noticed my workstation was hijacked by others who have been working there for years they also used up all the things i was using since it was still my first day i didnt know where to look for it and i went back to the usual place hoping someone filled it up again  though it was still empty suddenly the manager sees me ask why i am doing nothing although it was only 1 minute i stepped away from my work after it got hijacked to look for new work i saw his face getting angry thinking that i wasnt slaving at all more misunderstanding which made me even angrier having this similar thing happen to me on the same first day on i kept a stern face told him what i was doing and he backed off somewhat    was this a victory no in the end i was still a slave wasting my time only minimum wage compensation doing more and dangerous work than my bosses for my bosses to earn their pity and and be chewed upon by their misunderstanding   i mentioned they also want to stroke their egos well this way your ego will also be getting bigger along with the number of your enemies i thought they enjoyed their wonderful career and life so why do they make more enemies  oh maybe they just have a deathwish,k1lcxk

214,Exploitation of new employees.,i wanted to share a story of a day of work which just ended and at the same time make a point  today our boss was out for most of the day so my colleague whos been working there for 4 years decides she does not want to cook i work at an italian restaurant so cooking is our job she went and made unimportant and kind of useless things the whole day cleaning every corner and etc while prepkitchen work is something all experienced employees do everyday inbetween rush hours for an hour or two everyday she pretended to be there most of the day im not dumb i know what has to be done there and how long it takes i also was in a terrible condition my stomach hurt and i was super nauseous and since food and cooking makes lots of smells onions bacon etc my day was super hard which i mentioned from the very start of the shift she didnt care though shed show up in moments of rush where i couldnt do everything alone mind you she didnt come in to help me somebody would call her in that happened maybe twice shed come in start making some orders and when shed notice im done with mine she would just say here ive started two of those finish them and move on so id finish hers and go on alone   my last straw was when the shift manager asked me to clean the fridge where drinks are stored and while i was doing it she was back and standing by the pan and then shift manager brought her a couple of orders so she just turned around and left screaming get them done i pretended to not hear her and so she came back and just told me  can you make those im sick of cooking though she barely cooked today  she had most of the stack of takeaway food boxes pretty much all while i on the other hand was almost halfway through my second full stack while i was cooking she didnt even bother to pretend to work  she just stood there supporting her head with elbows on the table and was talking to the shift manager later when shift manager went for a break she would just yell out orders and wait until i make them because i was in a hurry i fucked up two orders because i forgot to read the comments she gave me shit for this and also for making a bit of a mess in her side of the refridgerator where our ingredients are stored which is usual when you are you know working especially since i was doing it all alone she made me clean it all up while she sat by the table with her phone waiting for orders to come it was really nice when she was telling me amounts and names of dishes and watching me hurry while just sitting i feel exhausted since i had nausea and terrible stomach pains and was working alone all day even through most of the rushes which is not a new experience that happens a lot not only when youre new but if you are also young especially  most working environments are toxic like that and they suck how is one supposed to be happy after being stressed out after having to do all the work on time and without mistakes all day its exhausting both physically and mentally,k1i6h0

216,"You live under a system of servitude, which is why ""freedom"" propaganda is so prevalent",ive probably made a post like this in the past but i dont care because this is important the word freedom and the word servitude both have definitions when i was a teenager i truly wish an adult looked me in the eyes and explained this simple truth to me so as an adult im going to explain it to whoever is reading this   the definition of servitudehttpswwwmerriamwebstercomdictionaryfreedom is a condition in which one lacks liberty especially to determine ones course of action or way of life  the definition of freedomhttpswwwmerriamwebstercomdictionaryfreedom is the absence of necessity coercion or constraint in choice or action  every human you have ever met lives under capitalism and you will be taking part in it or else this by definition means you are under a system of servitude the opposite of a system of freedom or free choice   im not making an argument im simply explaining to you that words mean things they have definitions you dont have to like it you dont have to agree because again its not an argument like i said i wish as a teenager a adult told me the truth but that never happened it would have helped me a lot to know that at least someone has a grasp of what is going on and was able to explain it in such a simple way  instead of the truth i was like so many of us lied to by economic propaganda and the victims of that propaganda i was never sat down and told that no i dont live in a free country and i most likely will not in my lifetime and i really really wish someone would have told me that i hate the fact that i had to learn that as an adult   if someone tells you they live in a free country they are accidentally lying to you youre not special your country is not special it is no more or less free than anywhere else you live under the same system of economic servitude as north koreans if someone tries to convince you that you live in a free country i would not take life advice from them im not saying treat them poorly they are victims of propaganda and you should feel bad for them and try to educate them in an attempt to break the spell   dont let lies win dont let propaganda win tell the truth tell your kids the truth tell as many people young and old as you can the truth i know its uncomfortable to accept this fact but its very important that as many people know the truth as possible otherwise the world will continue the way it is and if you care about humanity you know we cant allow that,k2k1be

246,A rant re: bullshit jobs,my job is essentially pointless i analyse digital trade for a big fast fashion retailer right now its black friday so i feel especially guilty about all the needless consumerism but even when its not a big promo event like now it takes me an hour and a half tops to do everything i need to do im very happy i can work from home since corona so i can actually do things i enjoy doing with my day however i am dreading going back to the office from 96 95 on a friday as an early finish  wtf and staring at a screen doing nothing for 6 hours my boss will sometimes make up things for me to do just so we can fill the time eg new trackers that we need that arent really tracking anything new at all sometimes my boss will ask me to take a screenshot of sales for her so she can add it into an email or my favourite pointless task is when my boss asks me to add in links literally just copying and pasting urls of products into a google sheet when it would taken her 2 mins to do it herself   it just seems insane to me how vastly accepted this is i feel crazy sometimes because i cant believe how backward everything is and how little it seems i can do to change it it was even crazier when i realised that not everyone thinks like this deep down either we say thank god its friday like its normal to hate 5 out of 7 days of the week the human experience could have been amazing but i am literally sitting at a desk analysing how i can get people to buy more mass produced clothing which not only were made unethically but directly contributes to the climate crisis fast fashion and my ceo getting richer and richer whilst i make barely enough to live on   honestly i get very depressed thinking that this is the rest of my life although i am lucky enough to have some savings which im hoping to grow so i can one day just go back to nature get a much more chilled job that isnt helping to kill the planet and never have to look at google sheets ever again,k2052y

262,Perspective from a Manager.,i worked at a company for 12 years from parttime to salaried department manager not that the pay was very great i have since left but it gave me a different perspective on managing people for most of those years i worked under a manager and asking for time off was always like trying to grind diamonds with playdoh and wed be given groans and i dont know blah blah blah or had to make it up somewhere else cause they were doing us a solid by letting us have time off as parttime employees mind you even if we were working 40hrs a week  so when it came my time to sit in the chair i found out being a manager was laughably easy retail mind you nothing is that important in retail i told my employees never to worry about asking for time off you are part time you dont get paid vacation time you are telling me when and when you cannot work no questions asked i asked if anyone had preferred regular work weeks or special needs like i need to be home by whenever for kids or school or whatever and made a set weekly schedule for everyone so they could count on consistency of what to expect instead of our previous shooting fish in a barrel toss up of what was coming schedule i asked everyone to give me as much notice on dayoff requests as possible and accomidated even if it was last minute i asked before putting someone else in their place to cover that shift and if no one couldwould tough beans we were a little short that day again retail never that important i always encouraged younger employees who would talk about leaving to go back to school or train for a better job i had realistic expectations of their motivation for making a company money was which is none but just expected them to do their jobs not stress themselves out about it i ended up having the best functioning department in the whole store within a few months of treating my employees like people with lives outside of work and who were only here cause they need  it wasnt fucking hard if i had the authority to give out raises to everyone would get them  i dont really know what the takeaway here is maybe just that you are not asking for time off you are telling your employer when and when you cannot work it is not your job to stress nor your responsibility to put your mentalphysical health on the line for any job you managerboss whatever may be stressed about things but their job is usually just as unimportant as yours and they dont need to be stressed the world keeps turning never stress about work its your life first and foremost,k2p9wn

286,Might lose job for the very reason I got one in the first place,i work because i dont want to be stuck financially dependent on my strict parents and be their property see my post history i could easily work for their company and inherit it but the point of me working for another company is so that i dont have anything to do with them its also in a field im not very interested in    and while im one of the lucky few that gets to work from home they sent us our desktops from our offices instead of giving us laptops or letting us use our laptops now the company i work for isnt smallscale so its not like it would hurt their budget badly  in fact its one of the biggest corporations in the us and no im not paid big bucks   i even asked my manager if i could trade for a laptop instead and she said that the company isnt providing any loaner laptops at the moment oh to make things even worse the computers have to be connected to a fucking router  for the companys vpn access which the company doesnt provide  14hr isnt worth this hassle at all  im still going trying to make it work and have even bought a router but im considering giving up on it if i dont manage to connect and go the selfemployed route less barriers to entry and better pay,jzpgue
287,Is it wrong or bad parenting to try to show your child that a career and money is NOT the be all end all of a happy life?,i always post nonsense on here about hating work but on a more serious noteis it wrong to suggest to your kid as they grow up to pursue different ideas and maybe that an alternate lifestyle than the accepted norm is ok ive been thinking real hard and talking to different people and it seems like it might be feasible to build a modest home on an island and then like an air bnb on the property and live off the rental money and thats it just be gone from this daily bs and check out from this nonsense is it wrong as a parent to take your kid away from from this nonsense how much do you tell them about the bull shit that is reality,jzk5tf
288,Rant about work and depression.,i hate waking up being so tired i dont have time to do anything but do the bare minimum to get ready for work im bored and tired all throughout the day and it drains my creativity and energy i have to work full time to earn like 600 ish every two weeks and its bullshit i wish i earned more money or worked less hours while earning the same amount it feels like im wasting my life doing this job i feel like a zombie i wish i was born into a middle class family so i couldve had my situation sorted out sometimes i wish i wasnt alive because the only release from the reality of being a poor wage slave is when im asleep then i have to get up and repeat the process of doing a job thats soul crushing i hate having a boss i hate capitalism for destroying the earth i hate that the world is based on greed and riches i hate that i have to work like 40 hours a week and get paid a wage that doesnt give me enough to live on my own or own a cool car or anything like that i guess its what i get for being a 20 year old with no connections fuck i hate this country fuck i hate this situation,jz53nn
289,The society we live in.,anybody else find it unbelievably sad that we judge people by what they do for a livingthe money they take home i was hanging out with some friends the other night and i swear at least 90 of our conversation was talking about money and jobs and such i work retail at the moment in my early 20s and it really pissed me off when one of my friends  who by the way is very very conservative was saying how if you are still working retail past 40 you are a failure this alone really pissed me off because i have coworkers over that age who are some of the most nice people i have ever met and just because they dont make hundreds of thousands of dollars does not make them a failure my friend and i then got in a slight argument over if jeff bezos is immoral or not i think jeff is a dick who hordes wealth my friend says he has a right to make that much money  funny when people making like 20k a year still defend people making billions i dont want to go into anymore of this guess i just needed to rant how i really hate the society im living in this materialistic world where you are judged on the amount of paper you make or the silly job title you hold i am really thankful at least the mega rich will die just like me our graves will be the same size  and if they get a bigger grave they will be dead and in the void and will not care rant over,jz7ukv

330,Examples of living without ‘work’,   i read this excerpt a while before i found this subreddit and i finally found it so i could post it here  in the european squatters movement some cities have had or continue to have so many squatted social centers and houses that they constitute a shadow society in barcelona for example as recently as 2008 there were over forty occupied social centers and at least two hundred squatted houses the collectives of people who inhabit these squats generally use consensus and group assemblies and most are explicitly anarchist or intentionally antiauthoritarian to a large extent work and exchange have been abolished from these peoples lives whose networks run into the thousands many do not have waged jobs or they work only seasonally or sporadically as they do not need to pay rent for example the author of this book who has lived within this network for two years has survived for much of that time on less than one euro a day moreover the great amount of activity they carry out within the autonomous movement is completely unwaged but they do not need wages they work for themselves they occupy abandoned buildings left to rot by speculators as a protest against gentrification and as anticapitalist direct action to provide themselves with housing teaching themselves the skills they need along the way they fix up their new houses cleaning patching roofs installing windows toilets showers light kitchens and anything else they need they often pirate electricity water and internet and much of their food comes from dumpsterdiving stealing and squatted gardens  in the total absence of wages or managers they carry on a great deal of work but at their own pace and logic the logic is one of mutual aid  i know dumpster diving and squatting probably isnt most peoples ideal vision of their life but i also dont think working your life away at a meaningless job is most peoples ideal vision either   this is from anarchy works by peter gelderloos linkhttpstheanarchistlibraryorglibrarypetergelderloosanarchyworkstoc22  there are lots of examples of stateless societies and people functioning outside of our definition of work today its super long but really in depth it covers tons of topics and questions like without wages what is the incentive to work dont people need bosses and experts and lots of information on how decisions are made in equitable societies and how disputes are solved here are a few more excerpts from what ive read  some worry that if we abolish capitalism and wagelabor no one will work anymore it is true that work as it exists now for most people would cease to exist but work that is socially useful offers a number of incentives besides the paycheck if anything getting paid to do something makes it less enjoyable the alienation of labor that is a part of capitalism destroys natural incentives to work such as the pleasure of acting freely and the satisfaction of a job well done when work puts us in a position of inferiority  to the boss who oversees us and the wealthy people who own our workplace  and we do not have decisionmaking power in our job but must mindlessly follow orders it can become excruciatingly odious and mindnumbing we also lose our natural incentive to work when we are not doing something that is useful for our communities of the few workers today who are lucky enough to actually produce something they can see they are nearly all making something that is profitable to their employers but completely meaningless to them personally the fordist or assembly line structuring of labor turns people into machines instead of cultivating skills workers can be proud of it proves more costeffective to give each person a single repetitive task and put him or her on an assembly line no wonder so many workers sabotage or steal from their workplaces or show up with an automatic weapon and go postal  indigenous societies with less division of labor had no problem doing without wages because the primary economic activities  producing food housing clothing tools  are all easily connected to common needs in such circumstances work is a necessary social activity and an apparent obligation from every member of the community who is able and because it takes place in a flexible personal setting work can be adapted to every individuals capabilities and there is nothing to keep people from transforming work into play fixing up your house hunting wandering in the woods identifying plants and animals knitting cooking a feast  arent these the things that bored middleclass people do in their leisure hours to forget their loathsome jobs for a moment,jzw3aq

365,Why do we seem to want to believe that the art world is a meritocracy?,addition to title  when nothing under capitalism is a meritocracy  so ive been studying and making art for the last 6 years and beyond and something ive had to grapple with is the idea of the selfmade artistic genius success i used to believe this too but ive had to find out that this is magical thinking however i keep seeing neoliberal logic around the topic of success in the wider field of artistic world which to all of those who work in it is infamous for being harshly precarious and instable as a source of income and as having below livable wages for all those who seek to work in it without already having the backing of rich sponsors read most often rich parents  those of us who are the 95 of art students who go on to make a living outside of the field are called bitter when we bring this up and told that maybe we werent good enough artists when that is not what eg the fine arts market is about at all  the fine arts market sells status objects that gain value by being charged with symbolic capital read references to other greats of the art world philosophy or politics that are currently in for rich people to pose with to uphold a facade of charitability and responsibility many arts collections are also investments as art gains value over time rather than losing it singular artists sponsorships like bets placed on racehorses in the hopes of an even greater win down the line and artistic project funding by banks etc motivated by the incentive to launder money while appearing cultured social and modern  that is the plain truth of the field even if you try to stay out of the institutional scene youll find that it is a schmoozefest who knows who who has a good reputation already what is in who can perform whats hip most convincingly who can market themselves more aggressively as the ones who know   i wonder if the denial of these circumstances is somewhat of a selfprotective mechanism of denial and deflection  la if i made it or my friend did and we are both competent people the industry must be fair because how else would we have made it and that denial must be intensified and multiplied in accordance with the cognitive dissonance caused by knowing ourselves to be good artists and responsible people and knowing at the same time that we are not valued for that but rather for what we can create in terms of symbols of wealth and status how much we can kiss ass and how we can justify hierarchies by doing the markets bidding and making luxury items out of dire struggles  pardon my language but i am pissed off   we are quintessential flunkies parttime ducttapers and boxtickers to use david graebers categorization we exist to cool the faces of rich with beautiful fans and to entertain with a multitude of tricks up our sleeves and if we dont do that were considered worthless under capitalism  maybe i am bitter but i would rather be authentically angry at how i can do almost nothing of artistic consequence in my position without it being subsumed under neoliberalism i am in an institution that lives off my unpaid work i am not the consumer here i am the product and the producer at once maybe my art is shit but that doesnt explain why people with equal skill have more opportunities to present and get paid for their work why they have connections even before getting into university why they have the money to pay for good supplies why they have the time to dedicate themselves entirely to their artistic careers why they can wear designer clothes and spend their evenings at events networking why they are the 5 that make it after uni and the rest of us are nonstarters   let me repeat that  less than 5 of fine art students go on to find paying work and a career in the field  maybe its different in other areas but i have a hunch that its not by much those 5 tend to be names you already know or who have one relative or another already in the arts and culture scene  its a selfreferential selfmaintaining elitist network why pretend that it isnt when hardly anything under capitalism is about ability and so much about what standing you started with ill leave it up to you to answer that for yourself,k05xua

373,Reparations: Could it set precipice for descendents of wage slaves in the future?,i had a question pop in my mind this morning upon waking from my peaceful slumber about reparations in the distant future  i consideredpondered this  once reparations are made to the descendants of chattel slaves could that set precipice for reparations for descendents of capitalistneoliberal wage slaves    i know that there is a highly discernable difference between wage slavery and chattel slavery  im not advocating wage slaves deserving reparations anytime soon and especially not until the descendants of chattel slaves receive the reparations theyve been requesting    an undebatable fact though is that todays working class have less rights than serfspeasants and that was the catalyst for this thought process  what is the chance that establishment hasnt delivered reparations for descendents of chattel slaves because they fear it might set precipice for other reparations in the future,jzmyqp

378,We should use PIRACY to our advantage 🏴‍☠️,piracy is a form of digital anarchy   i know some people think its selfish because it hurts creators but in reality piracy does nowhere near as much harm as denying less fortunate people access to educational material and potential happiness does we absolutely should use piracy as a way to fight the system not only because it can work but because its something that cannot be stopped its in our control there is literally nothing they can do about it other than trying to convince people its wrong   they know they cant stop it so they lie and try to convince people that copying and stealing are the same thing the truth is that unlike stealing when you copy something the original stays exactly as it was words have definitions even if capitalists would prefer we ignore them trying to change or ignore the definitions of words to preserve an outdated economic system is both stupid and dystopian as fuck   i believe we should work together to show as many people as possible that our society doesnt need subscription based companies like netflix hulu disney hbogo amazon prime and others not only would this help in the fight for digital digital freedom but it could also help people realize that much of our current systems infrastructure is a lie that could be done away with absolutely no downsides   think of all the companies that just like netflix are really only glorified middle men take a company like walmart what service do they offer other than essentially storing and putting price tags on items society can grow produce and distribute everything walmart sells without the need for walmart this is true for every store we can manage all the important aspects of production distribution and storage without these giant companies existing selling isnt a requirement of nature it doesnt add anything beneficial to our society another example is landlords what purpose do they serve owning isnt a service we can build and distribute homes without them there are countless examples just like this   companies like netflix are lying out their teeth when they claim that theyre providing a service literally every single thing on every single streaming platform is available for free to any person with a internet connection anyone can plug a hdmi cord into their tv from their computer and stream download or torrent the content themselves we dont need to pay for a streaming service in order to do this in fact not only is all the content already available for free but youll have access to a much bigger library of content than all those services combined in reality those services are doing nothing more than limiting what technology is already capable of by splitting all the content onto different platforms that makes them by definition media limiting services why the hell should anyone pay just to let a company limit the capability of technology how is that a service   humanity has the capability to store every movie book song digital class and more in one centralized location every single person in the world could have direct access to literally everything that has ever been made digital for free capitalism however cant keep up so in order to protect itself everything is placed behind unnecessary paywalls stopping technology in its tracks and preventing millions of people from sharing learning and being happy   how about fuck you capitalism   we should want as many humans with the ability to educate themselves as possible its not just about fun stuff like movies its also about educational material which is even more important in my eyes can you imagine how many humans in the world would have chosen to learn something but couldnt afford a book digital class or tool needed to do so i guarantee you its a lot of people especially in lower income parts of the world i believe that preventing technology from being used to its full potential is much more detrimental to the well being of humanity than most people realize   dont let these companies limit what our species is capable of to protect their outdated economic system like i said this is something that they cant do anything about and we should take full advantage of that they cant stop us from sharing they cant stop us from using the internet for good i really believe it would help push our world to change if enough people have their eyes opened to what is already possible   if you agree and you want to learn to pirate or help others learn theres a sub linked on my profile that you may find useful im more than willing to help anyone in terms of learning about piracy or finding what you need so please dont be shy we also have a discord with many people who are much smarter than me who are willing to answer any questions too   to be very clear i get nothing by people joining our sub or discord i dont care at all about views making myself look good or anything weird like that im not trying to promote this for any reason other than to help i just want every person to have direct access to what the internet has to offer so they can in turn offer the same to others i want our species to be as smart well connected and taken care of as possible that honestly is my only goal if you have any ideas on how we can help more people and spread this information outside of reddit please let me know we cant let antipiracy coalitions like acehttpswwwalliance4creativitycom convince people that sharing is immoral i consider them criminals to humanity and we need to stand our ground together   pirates are preserving the digital history of humanity and sharing that with everyone they are the good guys they are on the side of humanity unlike giant companies who claim to be offering services that in reality people can offer themselves all they care about is money and protecting an archaic economic system they are making the world a less intelligent and less happy place stop letting them screw over technology the internet and our species as a whole show them that we really dont need them   tldr  learn to pirate teach others to pirate help spread knowledge and happiness to as many people as possible stop letting companies pretend theyre offering services when we can do it without them,jzclsu
379,"There Is No Profit In Peace, Only In Conflict",capitalism is fundamentally based on making as much profit as possible this means two things  peace can never happen under capitalism  workers can never be paid the full value of their work under capitalism because the surplus value always goes to the owners as profit  so if you want peace and workers to be paid the full value of their work then you must abolish capitalism  the alternative is what we have now to always live in a world with conflict amp to always be undervalued,jzn881

401,"No Future for the Workplace, by Bob Black",essay by bob black published in 2015  sourcehttpsarchiveorgdetailsinsteadofworkpagen91mode2up  buy the bookhttpslittleblackcartcomindexphpdispatchproductsviewampproductid529   no future for the workplace  the best future for the workplace as for the battlefield is no future at all with belated notice taken of a crisis in the workplace the consultants surge forth with faddish reforms whose common denominator is that they excite little interest in the workplace itself done to  not won by  the workers their tinkerings are very much business as usual for business as usual they may raise productivity temporarily till the novelty wears  off but fiddling with the who what when and where of work doesnt touch the source of the malaise why work  changing the place of work to the home is like moving from albania to somalia in search of a better life flextime is as the microsoft office joke goes for professionals who can work any sixty hours a week they want to it is not for the service sector where the greatest numbers toil it will not do for fry cooks to flex their time at the lunch hour nor bus drivers at rush hour job enrichment is part pep rally part painkiller   uplift and aspirin even workers control which most north american managers find unthinkable is only selfmanaged servitude like letting prisoners elect their own guards  for western employers glasnost and perestroika  how soon we forgot those unforgettable words  are too little and too late measures that would have been applauded by 19th and 20th century socialist and anarchist militants   indeed it was from them that the consultants cribbed them  at best now meet with sullen indifference and at worst are taken as signs of weakness especially for north american bosses  relatively backward in their management style as in most other ways concessions would only arouse expectations they cannot fulfill and still remain in charge  the democracy movements worldwide have swept aside the small fry the only enemy is the common enemy the workplace is the last bastion of authoritarian coercion disenchantment with work runs as deeply here as did disenchantment with communism in eastern europe indeed many were not all that enchanted  with either of them in the first place why did they submit why do we because as individuals we have no choice   there is far more evidence of a revolt against work than there had been of a revolt against communism were it otherwise there would be no market for tranquilizers like job redesign job enrichment the quality of working life etc the worker at work as to a tragic extent off the j ob is passiveaggressive not for him and  especially not for her the collective solidarity heroics of labors storied past but absenteeism jobjumping embezzlement of goods and services selfsedation with drink or drugs and effort so perfunctory that it may cross the line to count as sabotage  these are the ways the little fish emulate the big fish who flush from peddling junk bonds looting savings and loan associations and extending home loans indiscriminately let  government bail them out if they cant collect   they triumphantly downsize outsource and toyotaize along with new requisitions and repressions which await their neologisms  what if there were a general strike  and it proved permanent because it made no demands it was already the satisfaction of all demands there was a time when the unions would have thwarted anything like that but they dont count any more someday the bosses may miss them  the future belongs to the zerowork movement the revolt against work  should one well up  unless its object is impossible because work is inevitable do not even the consultants and the technofuturologists take work and so much else for granted indeed they do which is reason enough to be skeptical they never yet foresaw a future which came to pass they prophesied moving sidewalks and singlefamily aircars not computers or recombinant dna their american century was japanese before it was half over  futurologists are always wrong because they are only extrapolators the limit of their vision is more of the same  although history the record of previous futures the graveyard of previous predictions is replete with discontinuities with surprises like the personal computer try to find it anticipated in any science fiction or eastern europe try to find any academic and or intelligence community anticipations of the imminent demise of communism  attend to the utopians instead the difference between the utopians and the futurologists is the difference between more of the same and something different since the utopians believe life could be different  and it will  what they say just might be true   work referring to what workers do should not be confused with exertion work in the physicists sense play can be more strenuous than work in a social sense work is compulsory production something done for some other reason than the satisfaction of doing it that other reason might be violence slavery dearth  unemployment or an internalized compulsion the calvinists calling the buddhists right livelihood unlike the play impulse none of  these motives even maximizes our productive potential work is not very productive although production is its only justification  enter the consultants with their toys  although it does not have to be play can be productive so forced labor may not be necessary when we work we produce without pleasure so as to consume without creating  containers drained and filled drained and filled like the locks of a canal job enrichment the phrase implies a  prior condition of job impoverishment which debunks the myth of work as a source of wealth work devalues life by appropriating something so priceless it cannot be bought back no matter how high the gnp is   life enrichment on the other hand consists of the suppression of many jobs and the recreation in every sense of the others as activities intrinsically enjoyable  if not to everyone for any length of time then for some people at some times in some circumstances work standardizes people as it does products but since people by nature strive to produce themselves work wastes effort lost to conflict and stress play is pluralistic bringing into play the full panoply of talents and passions submerged by work and anaesthetized by leisure the workworld frowns on jobjumping the playoriented or ludic life encourages hobby hopping as their workconditioning wears off more and more people will feel more and more aptitudes and appetites unfolding like the colorful wings of a brandnew butterfly and the ludic mode of production will be the more firmly  consolidated  you say you love your job fine keep doing it your sort will help to tide us over during the transition we feel sorry for you but we respect your choice as much as we suspect that its rooted in your refusal to admit that your present prodigious efforts made life especially yours no better they only made life seem to go by faster you were coping in your own way you were hurrying to get it over with  with the abolition of work the economy is in effect abolished also replacing todays teamsters hauling freight will be welcome wagons visiting friends and bearing gifts why go to the trouble to buy and sell too much paperwork too much work   although the consultants are inept as reformers they might make magnificent revolutionaries they rethink work whereas workers want to think about anything but but they must rethink their own jobs first for them  to transfer their loyalties to the workers might not be too difficult  its expedient to join the winning side  but they will find it harder to acknowledge that in the end the experts on work are the workers who do it and especially the workers who refuse to,jzen4d

406,I’m frequently the “bad guy” at my job and I hate it so much,so without getting into too much detail for obvious reasons i have been wfh due to covid office job managing claims will not specify for what for a fortune 250 company been doing this for around 25 years   some of the claimants will bitch and complain about the dumbest shit okay that happens theyre probably the same people who flip out at the waiter at the restaurant for no reason   but then there are the people who actually have legitimate complaints about the process and likei agree but i cant tell them i agree or obviously ill be in trouble for talking shit about my employer and whats holding up the claim isnt me personally not doing my job its because im waiting on another party to submit information or waiting on someone to finish this review or waiting on a manager to sign off or what have you and i try to tell people without trying to push the responsibility on the other party even if its the truth just because thats not a good look this is the process im trying to work with you sorry its taking so long or this is the way its working out etc etc and constantly im just painted as an adversary you just dont care about helping me or my family you just want to deny my claim because you dont want to do your job youre just holding things up because youre lazy and incompetent this is the worst customer service ive ever received and i hope you get screwed one day the way youre screwing me like bro im just the same as you working some job to get paid and feed myself i have to follow these rules whether theyre dumb to you or not   anyways i dont know if its due to the pandemic or something but people been extra spicy at me lately and its just starting to wear me down mentally i try to tell my manager about it and she says she understands but its just the nature of the job it has great capacity to help people but sometimes its just such a long convoluted process that doesnt help anyone at all and it sucks to be on the other end of it too getting told at least once a week that ive ruined someones life even if its not true and i objectively know that whatever happened isnt really my fault is starting to get to me i feel like the nature of the job kind of pits me against the customers its giving me so much anxiety and i hate that i have to sit here and take this for 40 hours a week  i know this subreddit is more just to vent about your company or your coworkers rather than customers or something but i wanted to put this here since its still about work i know i could justfind another job but as we all know each job has its own set of crap to deal with theres also so many other aspects of my job not customer related than i hate such as having everything we do tracked with metrics having us do the job of 2 people for the earnings of 1 etc but whats been weighing me down lately are the above things   i have off tomorrow through next monday and literally on my lunch break today i was thinking about how im already dreading coming back to work on tuesday,k0l2hh

413,I used to think it was weird that I didn't know a lot about most of my friends' careers and jobs.,yet the next time i would see them or interact with them i still wouldnt ask or talk about it i thought that it meant that i just wasnt close enough with them  then after finding this sub and others like latestagecapitalism i came to realize that i didnt really care a lot about my own job so why would i care about someone elses whats more telling is most people dont voluntarily share this information that often either because why would they who wants to talk about the almost 13rd of their life that sucks the most   when i did talk with someone who actually liked their job it was because they had found their passion of course that didnt mean their jobs werent still severely flawed like doctorsnurses being dangerously overworked teachers being criminally underpaid or scientists having to spend half their time looking for research funds when you think about it how many jobs are out there in which you would look forward to showing up to in the morning and also didnt exploit you in same way or another,jxt921
414,Months of overtime has killed my enthusiasm for anything,when the pandemic started my work tried to allow people to work less to limit exposure however within a week it became clear that we were getting far more orders than usual i work in a distribution center so fewer than normal work hours quickly became constant overtime that has gone on for months  even when trying to take time off unpaid because vacation time quickly ran out i still worked about 4050 hours a week recently that turned into 66 hour work weeks as we switched to 11 hour shifts 6 days a week and in a couple days it will turn into 77 hours a week as we lose that last day off despite all the hours were working the total workload only grows a week ago we had a backlog of about 700k orders when i came in today it was over 1 million and we havent even gotten black friday sales what amazes me is that the company fired over 70 people about a month ago which was when our backlog began endlessly growing  were gonna be working 11 hour shifts 7 days a week until new years and probably more if this year has been an indicator which means im likely to miss christmas with my family i get no real time for anything i can maybe play 1 game for an hour or so after eating and bathing ive already had a breakdown at work and my supervisors are aware of my mental state  im a heavy introvert and its super difficult to spend what little time i have with friends because of that work has completely consumed my life and i hate it so much this pandemic has either left people destitute and begging for anything that will pay or it has given those that still work enormous workloads that drain your soul and kill your ability to care for anything  my supervisor gave me a bit of a reprimanding a while ago and one thing he said that struck out to me was you just dont seem to care anymore im surprised it took him so long to figure that out how can i care about my work when i do nothing else all i do is toss clothing onto a conveyor that will likely disappoint some bratty kid because they got socks for christmas instead of toys how can anyone care about work like that beyond its ability to pay the bills  im looking for work elsewhere right now but being in a small town makes finding something that pays enough near impossible it also doesnt help that im an extremely inexperienced driver just bought my first car a week ago and im still too scared to go on the highway oh what i would give for just a month or so of vacation,jy7kon
415,Is this all there is to life?,im 18 years old and in may i got my first job which is a shitty 95 in a call centre dealing with covid patients it was okay for the first few months because if im being honest i was thoroughly enjoying the feeling of a weekly paycheck after years of living off my parents and asking them for money if i ever wanted or needed it   that quickly got old though around 3 months in i started to become more and more depressed which was manageable until about a month ago i now wake up every morning annoyed that i didnt die in my sleep and angry that i have to be subjected to 8 hours of being treated like shit by both the people im calling and the control freak manager i have i spend the day calling these people and being depressed in between calls which doesnt last long because im being constantly watched and cant even slack off for a couple of minutes without being told to get back to work and to explain why im not on the phone for years i was so excited to leave school and the entire teacherstudent superiorinferior relationship behind yet its exactly the same in the workplace if not even worse because the consequences arent detentions and losing lunchtimes but being fired and no longer having an income  by the time i finish work i am exhausted and want to go to sleep but instead i spend the rest of the evening dreading the following morning i stay up extremely late because i dont want to sleep and be transported at hyper speed to the next morning of depression and self hatred which means im sleep deprived through the day ive been in this job for a little over 6 months and its already completely destroyed my will to live if this is all there is to a life in the workplace i better find a way out or else ill probably jump off a bridge long before i reach 30,jxgi3w

417,Can you imagine being triggered by people because they do nothing?,heres some real comments ive gotten in response to my decision to do nothing all from your average everyday conservatives      its not my money folks like this commie trash have to worry about its my wellstocked armory and militarytrained skillsets that should terrify them they will literally never see me coming  i hope this person fucking starves  i hate anti work people more than anything else  why do we have to pay for these sacks of shit losers with our taxpayer money  if you are just against working completely you are a degenerate piece of shit  yeah it pains me that someone types this using a device they didnt pay for sitting in someones house they didnt pay for and not see anything wrong with it    lmao  the first one is my favorite i also like the guy who hates us more than anything else so murderers and rapists are apparently less evil to this guy than a human who doesnt do anything i thought it was a troll at first but 27 people upvoted it  honestly im glad it pains them that i do nothing its hilarious to me i have fun everyday while they take part in and defend capitalism doing things that many of them dont enjoy its funny that they will tell people like us to take control of our lives while giving up 57ths of their own sorry but if you are spending the majority of your life doing things you dont really want to be doing then you yourself have no control over your life you have control over your life for 2 days of the week i have control over mine every single day   i love that people think that the lifestyle i lead shouldnt be possible in their free society i love hearing them whine about people like me who have real freedom under their system when that isnt supposed happen the fact that doing nothing is so triggering to conservatives is very convenient for our side   i thought i actually had to try to fight their system you know with effort but according to them i can just do nothing and that counts as a revolutionary act can you imagine have a boot down your throat so deep that you actually think a person who does nothing is a issue that needs to be addressed   its a great feeling knowing that by sitting here apparently im doing something they wish i wasnt able to im gonna do so much nothing for my entire life you have no idea like its going to be my mission to do as much nothing as possible and to helphttpswwwredditcomrfreemediaheckyeahwikiindex as many others do the same as i can,jyeqkt

475,No one can force you to work. Have you ever considered quitting your job to live off the land?,for most of human history humans didnt need money for their survival they built their homes collected cultivated and caught their food built communities that survived together i guess at some point money became the center of things you need money for food you need money for a house you need money for clothes but money in itself doesnt create these things people do   i believe the idea that we need to rely on companies for our own survival is bs the idea that we need to work our life away in order to pay for things companies provide is bs   we dont need restaurants furniture stores clothing stores banks etc but theyre nice to have  i am not saying get rid of these services but the idea we must rely on them and must work our life away in order to pay for the services they provide bothers me   we have a ton of things that are convenient to us but we dont need them most people are capable of creating things they just dont know how because they have never needed to some people only know what they learned in school and what they need to know for their job   i remember learning about ancient civilizations in school and being told that how these people lived is just terrible in comparison to the great society we live in now but lately ive been feeling like the workforce is a prison and that anyone is capable of escaping it if they really want to   i often dream about buying out land and just living off it i wonder if anyone else has thought of this creating a community and thriving together,jyoalq

Finally a victory after so many years of crappy injustice!,some of you might know me from this post here previous story of horrible bosseshttpswwwredditcomrlifeadvicecommentshrjzl7cantholdajobbecausei27mstandupformy   if you dont thats okay im just so happy to finally stick it to a boss after months of recording this boss was for my janitorial job for an elementary school the one mentioned above that tried to make me drive with company equipment with no compensation whatsoever  my boss continued to do shady things like this as well as other things like   reusing vacuum bags by cutting them open and stapling them shut again  cutting our hours and expecting us to clean 50 more due to the pandemic  refusing to allow someone to call out sick unless they have a fever of 1014  after i was possibly exposed to covid my gm told me to come into work anyways and just wear a mask we cant afford to be a man down while you are being tested  having a meeting of covid regulations such as taking temperatures before you enter a building for work only to have absolutely no one to do it for the employees not even the school office staff or nursing office knew about this protocol when i went to get temp checked before my shift started the day after the meeting  the list goes on unfortunately but last month was the final straw i go into work and i find that a classroom is untouched no dirt no trash no signs of anyone being in this room in the last 24 hours the school had been open that day and the rest of the classrooms were dirty so i call my boss because of covid protocol and because i wasnt told anything of this i wanted to make sure i was still supposed to check the room and not get possibly infected by covid  before i continue our company has a policy if there is a positive covid case or even a possibility of covid then the room needs to be left alone for 12 days before it is deep cleaned by several staff  i call my boss and ask her what is going on with this abandoned room and thankfullyi record the conversation without her knowledge she goes on saying she is taking this covid stuff seriously blah blah blah and that there was a possible covid case with a child the childs grandmother had contracted the disease and had previously spent the weekend with the grandmother right before she started to show symptoms my gm then tells me to clean the room anyways because they still have school tomorrow  i remind her of the covid policy she stated during the pandemic team meeting we had i simply wanted communication because if i hadnt called her to ask i would have never known about this i even have told her on several occasions that i have multiple autoimmune diseases that puts me at extremely high risk so i could use a warning just in case i need to be extra careful for a specific room she started getting aggressive saying well thats your jobyou are at risk thats just part of it and they dont even tell me half the time what is going on and its illegal for me to tell you the little girls name and personal information about her covid test  this turns into an argument going back and forth with each other her spouting off company policy and when i simply voice my concern she tries to shut me down completely i was treated like the bad guy and that i was overreacting  i sent the voice recording to corporate hr as some people suggested in the story above and they actually got back to me and opened an investigation its been one month since i have heard back from them and im thinking about texting my old shift manager to see what is going on i hope she has been fired or at least reprimanded and is following proper protocols from now on they have several older staff and they work with children i sincerely hope that no one gets sick due to her lackadaisical treatment of this pandemic   if people ask and if its not against the rules i might just post the audio file and let you guys hear it if you want  tldr  my boss was lazy about covid protocols and i record her conversation of blatant lies reported her to hr and havent heard from my boss or any other ex staff workers since they opened an investigation,jyl9ij

504,The toxicity of the corporate world,so the girl im seeing works as an accountant though i have absolutely no interest in the corporate or financial sector i of course have an interest in her endeavours the other day she told me of a concept at her firm called utilisation which basically uses hours worked and productivity as a barometer for how well employees are being utilized  she told me about a meeting she had last week which outlined that since the outbreak of covid employees has worked 90 of their hours the previous quarter yet productivity had more than doubled naturally the partners of the firm who take in a nice 800k a year to do little more than tell the people below them what to do were not happy with this and despite the great increase in productivity they still wanted people to work even more hours in a time in which peoples mental and physical health are more important than ever  it just goes to show that no matter how hard or smart your work even if you do work hideous overtime hours the people at the top are so consumed by greed and avarice that they will only ever want more from you to continue to line their coffers absolutely fuck this  i would actually rather be homeless than play such a servile role to those who would also rather see me homeless than anywhere close to their financial equal  in my barbershop i run based on quality if you are up to my standard you can work as many or as little hours as you want so long as youre happy secure and you dont struggle to pay your chair rental at the end of each week if youre not up to my standard of barbering then i will provide guidance and get you up to the standard off of my own back so that we can both benefit from working together this is how i feel the working world should be unless ubi becomes a thing but sadly is isnt  fuck the rich,jxne5g

514,"""Selling"" is a man made concept and people doing it for a living aren't contributing anything useful.",currently we build enough homes and produce enough food for everyone but because of our current man made economic system simply producing enough for everyone isnt considered to be enough were told that even though the homes are built and the food is grown there is more work that needs to be done according to them we need to sell these things something that nature isnt actually asking us to do   nature is asking us to grow things build things distribute things teach others protect others but never sell things to others selling is a man made concept that does not replace any function of nature needed for the survival growth or well being of our species every salesman stockbroker banker business owner and landlord is not contributing to to our species in any necessary way   nature doesnt care how you believe things should be once a home is built or food is grown that was the work the required work is now totally over beyond distributing it to those in need no more work is required for that item once it exists in its completed form countless humans spend their entire lives doing things that nature isnt even asking of us   no one on rantiwork believes that everyone should have to work while a few of us sit on our asses if you think that then you missed our point completely were anti unnecessary work leading to unnecessary forced labour no one here not once has ever suggested certain things arent required by nature in order for our species to survive and flourish and yet somehow that always seems to be the common straw man argument used against us this misunderstanding is so common that its rare to be able to have a conversation about this without being hit with classic questions like but whos gonna grow the food who will build homes you dont think hospitals should exist do you want to go back to being hunter gatherers   like yeah guys you got us all 195000 of us are actually just super into foraging   they rarely have an actual understanding of our claims or position and because many of them are so triggered by their own straw man arguments they never actually stop to listen to what were actually saying our position has never been and never will be that no types of work are necessary our point has always been that the current economic system creates made up jobs that arent actually necessary for any natural purpose they exist only as a means of supporting yourself in man made system for no other reason than to support yourself in the man made system once you eliminate all the jobs that arent required by nature for example selling then we could easily eliminate massive amounts of unnecessary labour   were allowing nature to determine for us what is and is not required for the survival of our species as far as nature is concerned once something is built or grown it can then be considered completed the fact that our man made economic system then says no more work is required by people before we distribute these things is irrelevant to the way nature actually works  by defending a system that is making people perform jobs that nature does not require in order to survive youre creating a world where empty homes outnumber the homeless by 6 to 1httpswwwhuffpostcomentrypost733b692546 youre creating a world where we can fill grocery stores with food and end up throwing much of it out ignoring the people sitting directly outside of those stores desperately needing it nature is not requiring them to earn it humanity already earned it by producing it   were not antiwork in the sense that we think no work ever has to be done were antiwork in the sense that we realize that were already producing more than enough for everyone without the need for every single person to be doing something for no other reason other than to convince others that they deserve things that have already been produced   everyone must work or die isnt actually how nature works its how your man made system works   if you believe that a man made concept like selling things should determine if people get food water and shelter then you have no right to complain about having to take care of people who dont have the essentials of a human life we could easily make sure everyones needs are met without the majority of people ever moving a muscle but by defending this system youre creating unnecessary poverty so people like you will have to pay for their spot via taxation whining that you dont want to pay for the lazy people to get a free ride is ironic because nature isnt even asking you to by giving the middle finger to nature and allowing man made concepts to determine who and who does not get treated equally you signed up to live in a world surrounded by people in need for no reason other than selfishness and ignorance   this is why so many posts on rleopardsatemyface are capitalists complaining about how their own system that they vote for and defend works by not stopping the required work where nature allows us to stop it youre creating all the issues in your system that you hate so much like leeches if you dont like living in a world that has so many people in need dont support a system that creates and accepts poverty when we already produce enough to eliminate it  we could easily live in a world where very few people have to work in order for our species to thrive but you dont want that you want people to work made up jobs in order to survive because youre delusional enough to think thats how it has to be despite living in a post scarcity society you want to create more work than what is required by nature once the actual work is done to produce what is needed you think it shouldnt be distributed immediately like nature allows nature isnt asking everyone to work only the people who defend this man made economic system are asking that of everyone and guess what  were not going to  regardless of our refusal there will still be enough food water and shelters for everyone thats why people who refuse to work dont feel bad at all for doing nothing we know for a fact that society is already over producing enough for everyone without needing our help we can see clearly that the majority of people who take part in this system arent actually doing things required by nature so in reality theyre contributing the exact same amount as we are nothing,jxvkrr

537,Beware Employers who Use Your Enjoyment as a Means to Greater Exploitation.,nail mucus for sincere is generally harvested by just letting the nails crawl around and the slime is collected by machines beneath them it gives them warm mist to induce slime since nails make the most slime when theyre happy  they cant hurt the nails because nails stop producing slime once they die and for nails to produce optical slime they must be fed well and be happy  meaning the two brain cell mollusks most likely live a fulfilling life of working a 95 crawling around in a anna then get a lavish meal afterwards    ,jvux5y

544,Strange thing I've noticed (rant),i visit this sub a lot and very much subscribe to its core ideals but even though i struggle a bit to cope with the 40 hour workweek as a programmer i cant help but really really wanting a fulltime programming job to the point that its just a desire that bothers me constantly    a job is supposed to be a means to an end but capitalist indoctrination and my reflexive constant comparison of myself to my old peers who werent laid off from my old programming job makes me feel like im falling behind and stagnating even when im doing my best to learn new things i wish i loved programming for its own sake and because it makes me happy but im not sure i do     does anyone else feel this way that they kind of dislike having a job but cant stop obsessing over essentially the idea of having one people were so interested in my job and the projects i was working on they would treat me with so much more interest and respect because i was employed even though they didnt know or care about software dev    im still kind of traumatized and very angry at being laid off without any warning just months into my first dev job at being rejected for so many jobs because someone else always swoops in with more years of experience or better connections or whatever the hell else it pisses me off that people with 5 years of experience are applying for entrylevel jobs but even entrylevel jobs ask for so much experience i cant really blame them   the job market has gone completely insane and no longer makes any sense its all made up because employers can tell people to jump and people will ask how high unfortunately im included in that   ps dont even get me started on how many times i have everythingmostly everything the job is asking for but they just want more years of experience than what i currently have i apply anyway and never hear anything back sometimes  a rejection email comes my way if im lucky,jwnao2

might not detract from their nobility 2  gtthe romans recognized but two noble and free professions agriculture and arms all the citizens by right lived at the expense of the treasury without being constrained to provide for their living by any of the sordid arts thus they designated the trades which rightfully belonged to slaves the elder brutus to arouse the people accused tarquin the tyrant of the special outrage of having converted free citizens into artisans and masons 3  gtthe ancient philosophers had their disputes upon the origin of ideas but they agreed when it came to the abhorrence of work nature said plato in his social utopia his model republic nature has made no shoemaker nor smith such occupations degrade the people who exercise them vile mercenaries nameless wretches who are by their very condition excluded from political rights as for the merchants accustomed to lying and deceiving they will be allowed in the city only as a necessary evil the citizen who shall have degraded himself by the commerce of the shop shall be prosecuted for this offense if he is convicted he shall be condemned to a year in prison the punishment shall be doubled for each repeated offense 4  gtin his economics xenophon writes the people who give themselves up to manual labor are never promoted to public offices and with good reason the greater part of them condemned to be seated the whole day long some even to endure the heat of the fire continually cannot fail to be changed in body and it is almost inevitable that the mind be affected what honorable thing can come out of a shop asks cicero what can commerce produce in the way of honor everything called shop is unworthy an honorable man merchants can gain no profit without lying and what is more shameful than falsehood again we must regard as something base and vile the trade of those who sell their toil and industry for whoever gives his labor for money sells himself and puts himself in the rank of slaves 5  gtproletarians brutalized by the dogma of work listen to the voice of these philosophers which has been concealed from you with jealous care a citizen who gives his labor for money degrades himself to the rank of slaves he commits a crime which deserves years of imprisonment  gtchristian hypocrisy and capitalist utilitarianism had not perverted these philosophers of the ancient republics speaking for free men they expressed their thought naively plato aristotle those intellectual giants beside whom our latter day philosophers are but pygmies wish the citizens of their ideal republics to live in the most complete leisure for as xenophon observed work takes all the time and with it one has no leisure for the republic and his friends according to plutarch the great claim of lycurgus wisest of men to the admiration of posterity was that he had granted leisure to the citizens of sparta by forbidding to them any trade whatever but our moralists of christianity and capitalism will answer these thinkers and philosophers praised the institution of slavery perfectly true but could it have been otherwise granted the economic and political conditions of their epoch war was the normal state of ancient societies the free man was obliged to devote his time to discussing the affairs of state and watching over its defense the trades were then too primitive and clumsy for those practicing them to exercise their birthright of soldier and citizen thus the philosophers and lawgivers if they wished to have warriors and citizens in their heroic republics were obliged to tolerate slaves but do not the moralists and economists of capitalism praise wage labor the modern slavery and to what men does the capitalist slavery give leisure to people like rothschild schneider and madame boucicaut useless and harmful slaves of their vices and of their domestic servants  gtthe prejudice of slavery dominated the minds of pythagoras and aristotle  this has been written disdainfully and yet aristotle foresaw that if every tool could by itself execute its proper function as the masterpieces of daedalus moved themselves or as the tripods of vulcan set themselves spontaneously at their sacred work if for example the shuttles of the weavers did their own weaving the foreman of the workshop would have no more need of helpers nor the master of slaves  gtaristotles dream is our reality our machines with breath of fire with limbs of unwearying steel with fruitfulness wonderful inexhaustible accomplish by themselves with docility their sacred labor and nevertheless the genius of the great philosophers of capitalism remains dominated by the prejudice of the wage system worst of slaveries they do not yet understand that the machine is the saviour of humanity the god who shall redeem man from the sordidae artes and from working for hire the god who shall give him leisure and liberty  gt1 herodotus book ii  gt2 biot de labolition de lesclavage

605,"I can't get through the workday without crying, I don't know what I did wrong. I need advice",in october i got fired from a job i loved i was a pc repair tech at a local store i had surgery in september even returned sooner than expected and walked in to find my replacement sitting right there next to my desk i thought nothing of it and sat down and started fixing machines only to be dragged away from my work by the higher ups at the company because they didnt want two new people i had been there for 3 months in the same room  they assigned me to salvage and get what i could out of the machines that people had brought in to be recycled at first one of them told me to just pull anything with valuable metal out of the machines mostly the ram and motherboards if it wouldnt take me too long they said i could return to fixing machines after the recycling room had been dealt with and all the new hires could have a training day where they trained us on the phones i had been using the phones with no issues since shortly after i started there  then someone else came to me and assigned me to salvage the machines by determining whats worth refurbishing and what isnt and that i had to make the company 3x what they paid me i made 11 an hour i said i would try my best ive never even used ebay in my life and got to it they told me to even load the machines with operating systems if i could a 24 hour process for each machine i would have to run diagnostics replace or decide not to replace whatever was fucked and then load the os  oh by the way i had to set up a new desk in a back room because i wasnt supposed to be in the same room as the new hire i refurbished and set up the desk myself with one of the salvage machines even redid the networking that took a whole day  so im going through these machines and start sounding the alarm bells there are maybe 10 machines in the recycling room actually worth anything and they were worth maybe 100200 fully loaded with an os and entirely undamaged i start sounding the alarm bells i want to make it clear to the people above me that this is a situation set up for failure  one of the higher ups who i was under command of had a tendency to ramble in paragraphs and go off on tangents they also were not a tech oriented person they just happened to own the place they blasted me for bringing this situation to their attention telling me they have a plan and that i dont know their business model  eventually they had a moment of clarity and told me that they wanted me to just sell the machines regardless of how much they are worth just to get rid of them oh and they revealed that loading up the machines with operating systems again a 24 hour task per machine was just to and i shit you not keep me stimulated what they really wanted was just an excel spreadsheet with the worth of every machine on it  what the fuck  so i spend the next day making the excel spreadsheet and hand it in the next day they tell me to come in at noon i do and they fire me  and that was the end of that job i was barely scraping by on 11 an hour but i was happy i was fulfilled i had a purpose  so i start looking for a new job thinking about shooting for something in it i like computers i even went out and did half of my a  and that brings me to my current job i accepted a job as a help desk tech for a grocery store and i hate it i fucking despise it i cant even keep it together at my desk  i dont understand it should be cool im in charge of everything that has a circuit at every store i drive the spaceship  i hate it the most i can do on my end is reboot something anything further than that usually needs a tech from a company that we outsource to they have to go to the store and replace the part and i hate talking on the phones so much this job despite being tangentially related to my previous job that i really love has totally beaten me down  i dont even know why the people are nice they say im really good at it but i feel like im in a cage that cold gray cubicle i cant even put anything nice on it because seating isnt assigned and i have to spend ten hours a day on a 4 day 3 day schedule staring at this screen and the furthest i can go with any issue is just rebooting something  i thought i would be a good fit i think its my adhd or something i think ironically enough that i need to be stimulated i dunno i was just thinking maybe what i should have taken away from my previous job is that i like the repair tech part not that i like the pc part  i dont know what to do i had to take many breaks to the bathroom today to go cry i just lost it as soon as i got to my car my parents are being really supportive and they told me that it isnt worth it to just quit theyll help me  but that doesnt solve that in it as you go further and further up you do less and less hardware i dont want that i want the reverse i want to eventually work up to louis rossmann levels of depth with the repair at least as long as im doing this and not my main love which is music  im definitely calling out tomorrow and probably quitting full stop after that but i feel like such a failure im not against working an honest job i felt like my bench tech job at least when i was actually fixing stuff was healthy i was taking walks during my lunch break meditating before my shift it was great now im so low i would be considering hurting myself if i didnt have my girlfriend here to keep me tethered  where do i even go from here i obviously cant progress any further in it because the starting point is help desk thats just what you have to do i think i have to work with my hands and use my noggin to be satisfied i cant just sit at a cubicle all day  like i said i could extrapolate on the repair tech part but i dont know how or what field i would even go into i wanted to get my aampp but i didnt feel ready to drop 45k on the program  i just feel like such a bum my job is easy all i have to do is hit the reboot button and then call and tell them welp that didnt work time to send a tech but it feels like the tasks from among us just dragging and dropping and clicking and ugh  thanks for reading sorry for the rant,jw8mtx

612,"If you believe taking part in an economic system that had your lifestyle predetermined for you is ""freedom,"" then I WANT you to think I'm stupid.",because i honestly think same of you  im not sure most people have recognized and accepted that some of us really dont hold traditional values when it comes to things like work and money anymore to the point that were not ever going to take part in this system when it comes to what a successful life looks like more and more people will be teaching their children the exact opposite values compared to those we received growing up its not just something we talk about or believe without acting upon were actually opting out for good now regardless of the consequences in fact having unnecessary consequences in a man made post scarcity system is why were opting out to begin with will this have a immediate effect on the economy or system nope but none of us are delusional enough to think that ignorance on a scale this massive can be destroyed quickly or easily   though im personally an emanationisthttpsenwikipediaorgwikiemanationism not a atheist i believe that the growth of atheism is a good comparison when it comes to ideas like antiwork or anarchism 20 years ago atheism was a pretty obscure concept for many people atheists existed but many were closeted and really had no way to communicate with others who held the same beliefs two decades later and atheism can no longer be considered a niche topic we have subs like ratheism with 2 million subscribers and huge increases statistically in the amount of people who no longer identify with any religion the number of atheists has doubledhttpswwwbarnacomriseofatheism since 2003 thats a significant increase and its only going to continue to grow   clearly it can take a long time for niche ideas to gain traction but once the seed is planted they can absolutely have a snowball effect i admit that as people who dont hold the belief that giving up our lives to work is necessarily succeeding we have a long way to go were still in the growing process for sure i dont think we can say weve won until every single human is able to choose for themselves how they live their lives without being threatened by economic fascism until every entity brought into this world has an actual choice rather than a predetermined lifestyle were going to have to fight   i honestly dont know if any of us will live in a free country in our lifetimes ignorance may reign supreme for the foreseeable future but regardless we should absolutely do what we can to help fight for true freedom even if it feels like kicking sand at the waves i know it can seem like a battle that is impossible to win but acting uncaring and purposefully ignorant towards important issues to get us to feel hopeless is part of why fascists are getting their way currently just use their indifference and ignorance against them use it as fuel to fight for a free world the fact that so many people tell you it cant happen should only make you more passionate to spread truth  ive learned to actually enjoy being so directly opposed to the way most people think this is because even though they will claim otherwise we can affect them i know because i get made fun ofhttpsredditiq0if8 enough by conservative subs to see just how much they dislike hearing what people like us have to say they know that many people in the coming generations are going to hold the exact opposite values as they do some of them are even willing to admit ithttpsiimgurcomwpchlddpng and they are not happy about it  they know that as time goes on humans are going to become less and less persuaded by propaganda and that eventually the scales will start to tip in our direction some of us are already here just waiting call it larping if you want make fun of us because like the title states i want anyone on the side of fascism to think negatively about me i want people who think money has more value than human life to think there is something wrong with me because i think there is something wrong with them i actually dont value their currency at all i truthfully do not do things in exchange for money and it makes me proud when i find people who refuse to believe that   someone in the thread linked above stated that people like me would do anything if offered 10khttpsiimgurcomovvs8z0png that comment made me smile because it proves that many people honestly dont understand yet that they live in a world where some people literally dont value their way of life to any degree anymore they are so accustomed to money having power that cant accept people like us even exist    to anyone downplaying ideas like antiwork and anarchism thank you for your ignorance by refusing to take these ideas seriously youre allowing them to grow faster with much less resistance downplay all you want but understand that you really do look as stupid to us as we do to you know that many people now hold the opposite belief about what a successful life looks like understand that as time goes on were not going to shrink in numbers were going to grow and grow until eventually what was once a niche concept will become impossible to ignore if you want to ignore us for now go for it but were not going to ignore you were completely and totally aware of just how big of a threat fascism is to freedom and were definitely going to be pointing it out to as many people as we can until the values you hold so dear are seen in the same archaic light as slavery  i know that youre going claim to be on the side of freedom right up until people try to live in ways that go against your values and way of life ive said it before and ill say it again conservatives and capitalists hate true freedom with a passion they will stop as nothing to make sure their way of life and their values are protected even if it means destroying the lives freedoms and values of the person next to them they want the capitalist way to be the only way and anyone going against this to be mocked and left to die they absolutely do not want you to have the freedom to wake up each day and live your life the way that doesnt match their worldview im not being sarcastic when i say they are actually directly and openly opposed to real freedom   this is why they love freedom propaganda so much its comforting to tell themselves theyre not what we say they are this is why theyre able to call fascism freedom without hesitation this is why they can actually think they are on the right side when they fight against antifascists they are actually willing to admit that they are profascism it should not be understated how terrifying that is masses of humans who are admitting that they think fascism is a good thing propaganda should never ever be taken lightly it is clearly extremely dangerous and it allows people to hide truths and convince otherwise normal and good people of horrendous things   its exactly like the proud boys changing leaders from a open racist to a blackhispanic americanhttpswwwwndcom202010blackproudboysleadernotwhitesupremacistscansee they knew how people perceived them so they tried to mask the truth but anyone with half a brain knows that they just confirmed what everyone already knew its the same thing as claiming to love freedom while also openly declaring that people should have to take part in capitalism or die by calling economic fascism freedom they are doing the same thing the proud boys did they are admitting the truth by trying to hide it   they dont have a choice if they want to preserve their way of life then they have to hide what they believe because if they dont people will realize very quickly which side is actually fighting for freedom if that happens things would start to shift in a direction they desperately dont want they will absolutely fight to conserve their system their values even if it means lying to themselves and others about what they actually want and believe the good news is that with enough time and people telling the truth lies this big always die tribalism slavery feudalism all dead capitalism is next on the list both sides are becoming more hostile because both sides know that the truth is out in the open now you either accept that youre against antifascism making you a fascist or you accept that you are surrounded by fascists regardless of the side youre on that is a ugly truth   though im not defending him or his actions i think in many ways trump accidentally played big role in helping people see that ugly truth many people didnt even care about politics before this election but his willingness to be cruel and proud has opened the eyes of many people he backed a openly racist group during a presidential debate obviously disgusting but things like that did significantly more bad than good for his own side he showed us all that people like him really will do anything it takes to protect their way of life no matter the cost regardless of truth he sped up the transition to a world where people like himself no longer have power just by being himself his side got trapped and they were forced to admit that they are proud profascists who believe nothing is more important than preserving their way of life   they really dont care if it means lying defending racism or spitting in the face of freedom they dont care if it means people will go without food and water that it will mean letting children sleep in cars and tents with their parents rather than homes that there will continue to be unprecedented amounts of suicide crime and unhealthy lifestyles leading to countless early deaths they cant care because to them their system their way of life has to come first no matter what   i read an article about journalist who witnessed a homeless man in new york about to commit suicide by jumping onto subway tracks people started yelling at him not to save his life because it was the right thing to do but yelling because they thought it was selfish of him to consider suicide in this way as it would make them late to work the journalist was shocked by their heartlessness but im not because i know that to them their system is more important than doing the right thing its more important than the truth its more important than a human life   their system means everything to them so it should mean nothing to us,jwas4n

Maybe writing this out will make feel better.,my job has me feeling worthless nothing but a number overworked underpaid under appreciated and less than a human tbh  ive been the only person on staff since july yup just me taking own the load of two other people everything rests on my shoulder   as for many people this year has been hard who cares if were in a pandemic who cares if were such in a divisive time in the country who cares if you on the brink of a mental breakdown who cares if youre in tears before your 10am daily zoom meeting you just need to go to work pretend to be happy make the owner money but wear a mask of course   last night i was absolutely sick shivering in bed sweating up a storm but guess what i cant call out because im the only one on staff why not use a sick day well i only have two sick days per year i dont go i cant pay rent  i think that was the lowest point of my life when you realize that your are nothing i just need to be awake by 615am catch the subway and be in the office by 7am to make other people money   before the pandemic i was working at a job that i absolutely loved living out my passion   now i work in a wellness facility that offers no health care plan and gives you two sick days per year pretty ironic  thanks for listening most people tell me that i should be lucky i have a job anyway,jx6eyr
624,COVID = Bad performance,was just told im doing too much by a coworker which hit me in the feels pretty hard i dont perceive it that way because the bosses expect more  a week ago i had a midyear performance review where it was written in the final comments that im trending towards an unsuccessful year however this contradicted every thing said in that review without context it would be read as a significant improvement to last year however im casted this year as behind in my project which is mainly do to a month of covid furlough and a hacker virus that set us back predictable two months in total im being askedto catch up two month of work or underperform working ot every saturday the pay is nice but fml,jwk2xo

626,Work doesn't value you,i am the only female who graduated college in my entire family tree i am also the only engineer college was really fun for me because i loved learning about circuits and electromagnetism and all the nerdy engineering stuff you can think of still wasnt the best student though after graduation i got into my dream job a pretty prestigious company i had ambition so i worked as hard as i could and i wanted to climb that ladder and i honestly enjoyed it because i was with a great team i met my boyfriend through work and when we started dating he would tell me about his frustration about working not just his current job but working in general his current job was also his dream job so he thought hed be treated better than his 2 other jobs that overworked him i didnt quite understand why he was so upset about working and honestly thought he just needed a day off to relax then alas the real culture around work was starting to unravel before me   1 i had a coworker stalk me at work he sat next to me and at home he lived next to me too i reported it to hr i was quite heartbroken by how i was treated by them long story short they didnt see him as a threat and moved his desk one row down a couple months later a friend who works in the same company reported him to hr because he was stalking his gf she was treated the same way   2 the project i loved so much shut down and i had to join another team the team lead for that project overworked everyone and verbally harassed certain people in the team and it was uncomfortable so i reported him to hr hes slightly better but he still gets away with a lot   3 i worked my ass off the first couple years and my name had been going around as the person who does electrical drawings i became the expert in a certain subject and worked overtime every week to help out a bunch of projects including my main project i havent gotten a raise once or a promotion   there are other things but the list would be too long i now understand my boyfriend i now have opened my eyes to the toxicity of the culture we are seen and treated as replaceable resources we are told by work that we are a family yet we can easily be disposed of you might say im feeling this way because its my first job but changing jobs only delays the feeling even though there was a time i enjoyed working i am still grateful to have opened my eyes to everything wrong with the culture,jwkk0j

638,The systematic reduction of my effort into a single numerical output is the most demotivating thing I've ever experienced.,no consideration for anything  the only thing that matters is a single minded single focused goal   lose 12 the team  still need to hit the goal   global pandemic  still need to hit the goal   wildly changing and expanding responsibilities  guess what still need to hit the goal   higher ups not supporting at all baiting and switching confusing the entire team not pushing any of the rest of the company to meet their goals  well no one cares ted just hit the goal it doesnt matter what else happened this is an arbitrary number someone put in a spreadsheet 13 months ago and you have to make it happen even if shorthanded and the world is upside down    it just adds to the already palpable misery of spending significantly more than 12 my time working and doing things that i dont enjoy but then to be purely reduced into a number its inhuman  i could have come up with a cure for cancer or invented perpetual clean energy but if i dont hit that number its all over  i could crush 1000 other projects and have the happiest and most productive team along with executing everything asked otherwise but its all about that damn spreadsheet and that one number  not allowed to tell a story or give any background or provide any detail  just show the target and actual and be judged    ltrantgt  anyone else feel like this too,jw197u

641,Capitalist utilitarian irony,ok so im about to take on a construction utility job and ive worked for a while before just with a small labor crew the first thing youll notice is that most of the crew are mexicans who drive old carswhen i came into the office today for the application all those cushy staff positions are full of white men with very clean trucks does anybody see the irony the only reason i point out race is to give you a better idea of how fucked up the situation looks like at my former job we would have to sometimes call in the engineer to use his truck bed to haul miscellaneous crap out of worksites dont tell me capitalism is utilitarian,jwy1y5
642,I'm surprised we haven't abolished paying people hourly and started paying people salaried instead.,before you downvote me ill admit this is uscentric since i am from the usa but some things may apply to your country if you are outside of the usa and i am not advocating that this happens because this is a terrible idea but i feel it is the way we are heading ill admit this is a repost from another sub lostgeneration but ill make some minor tweaks heres why   the vast majority of health insurance in the usa is tied to employment since you technically arent ever really off if you are salaried employers could get more intrusive about your personal decisions like how you take care of yourself and what you eat if you dont work out etc im aware some companies have certain perks if you do certain things though but i could see things getting really nuts if they arent there already i remember when i worked at my first job out of the military some brand new high school graduate in my training class told me i should not drink so much soda and i drank a lot in the class to keep me awake because it was boring as shit was it healthy probably not but i needed something to keep me awake im not a badass or tough guy by any means but i politely let her know i was thankful for her concern and if you are going to be nosy and judgy you might want to say something to the guy who just spoke to our class who is 250300 lbs   working at home has become more common lately for obvious reasons i wonder if anyone is getting harassed off the clock or working longer or harder even prior to covid i have heard it is getting more common for employers to bug people off the clock   the minimum salary for exempt employees i believe went up then went back down or the proposed increased minimums never were passed into law regardless its pretty damn low  yes some fields like the majority of new jobs created in the past few years prior to covid have been lowwage lowskilled service jobs like fast food and retail it makes sense those jobs are hourly because if its slow or something and send people home or cut hours if sales are down but im surprised none of the big companies have lobbied to keep minimum wage the same correct me if i am wrong because if you took the federal minimum wage times it by 40 hours and 52 weeks in a year you get 15080 thats best case scenario if you get fulltime hours plus some of those workers are essential and i can see the companies claiming all their employees are heroes and want to serve the populace  walmart is the biggest employer in the usa and their minimum salary for hourly workers is 11 an hour higher in areas where the minimum wage is higher but they dont pay that much more and if you times that by 40 hours and 52 weeks a year you get 22880 a year obviously not all employees are full time and some jobs pay more and your pay may go up based on years of service but lets say you are at 11 an hour and  lets reduce the hours to 28 in a week and you get 16016 yes it is a little bit more than what the federal minimum wage is right now if they worked forty hours a week but im surprised corporations havent lobbied to abolish hourly wage and make people salaried theyd save money from not having to pay overtime and they would be able to work you to the bone if they wanted and when things got crazy since all of their employees are heroes and want to serve according to their ceo,jwu8f4

644,Just left my WFH job that poisoned my outlook on life (or maybe enlightened me?) and often made me want to kill myself. Let's see how that goes,our performance is graded on customer surveys which it took me a very short time to realize are horrible metrics for performance because they are completely based on luck a customer can have a great experience but be an 80 year old with memory issues who confuses your survey for another and grades you harshly you can get a bad survey for a previous person setting false expectations for the customer or misinforming them you can get a bad survey for something that is 100 not your fault like a customer dropping their phone down an oil well   i realized that this mirrors real life to a depressing degree everything is decided by luck and and the belief that you can do whatever you put your mind to all that other saccharine bullshit is only peddled by the ones that got lucky that very belief is the most destructive thing in the whole of humankind because all it does it lead people off cliffs,jvu0h7

672,On reducing the workweek,hi  as far as i see most people take 40h workweek for granted that leads to wanting to make more jobs to end poverty so my question is why nobody talks about making the workweek shorter and then just having more shifts for example 8h could get reduced to 6h so that there is one more shift that way a plethora of new places to work would arise   there must be a reason why nobody talks about that as far as i see the reason cant be that the economy would come into troubles because the same amount of goods would be produced there just would be more people working on it maybe it would make the work even more productive and no bullshit jobs however it might be the case that salaries would change and become closer to each other so that some people would get angry because they have less money than before thats as far as i see the only logical reason for rejecting that idea if we neglect conspiracies however i would love to hear what others think are there any other objections  also i must say that i dont know much about economics i came to the argument above just by common sense and by comparison of that potential world and the current one i dont see that anything could be worse in that potential world than in the current one basically the argument is the following          premise 1  compare the world with the reduced workweek with the current one there is nothing different from the economics side       premise 2  people would love to have more free time      premise 3  jobs affect only economies and peoples wellbeing            conclusion  having the reduced workweek is better than having the current one   so as far as i see people could object four things here     1 premise 1   as i have already said i am not knowleadgeable about economics so i may be wrong i would love to hear opinions of others however i think that it is just common sense if nothing ceases to be produced economy stays the same      2 premise 2   i know that some people would argue that people in general are not that able to spend time on their own ie freedom and free time is dangerous kinda brave new world thinking         3 premise 3   i may be wrong here but i dont see anything other currently     4 coming to conclusion   i think that there is nothing to disagree with here the things are pretty obvious if we compare two things and they are the same in every aspect except one of them where the new one is better then it is obvious that the new one is better in general however one might say that the number of people who would get angry for having worse salaries is greater than the number of people who want freedom i think that argument would lead to the discussion luxury vs neccesity what is luxury what is neccesity etc and it may be personal but in my opinion neccesities are a lot more important than luxury ie luxury shouldnt even exist until everybody has a clear respectable way to get neccesities  tell me if im missing something i would love to hear the reasons for people not mentioning that idea that much   have a peaceful day,jui0ao

691,Toxic environment: my story,i would like to share my story need all these feelings getting out of my chest i am working in marketing and one and half year ago i joined a company at the beginning the management looked normal i wasnt impressed by some of their choices but not a reason to quit over the last 7 months it became a nightmare and home office did not help zoom calls communitys calls hours and hours spent in front of the cam to slow down the workflow they hired a new member in the management this person became my nightmare setting up unrealistic targets with ridiculous bonus system i ended up with doing most or all of the tasks this person was supposed to do preparing also every time presentations that heshe will need to present to the big boss and shortly having a glance at all the things i have done without any help heshe is also impossible to please and had hard time even for taking decisions for the smallest things that normally wouldnt take to me much of my time to get these done efficiently we have community meetings where the big heads blame the teams for lack of ownership never questioning themselves during these meetings you are forced to share with everyone where you failed even if you dont necessarily thing you failed they can be up to 47 hours zoom calls i work in the middle management and i am realizing more and more that this means do all the job that others above you should do but they love to call it flat hierarchy without any gratification they tell you to be vocal but if you open your mouth they treat you like a fool they tell you you want to be part of the problem and not of the solution  i started having panic attacks insomnia my mood was going down especially over the weekend i tried to reach out people on upper positions to look for help and they ghosted me even if they were appreciating my work its sad because i used to love my job but the environment is completely toxic and i just cant go back to it anymore my body and mind are refusing to accept it every day i tell myself i deserve more they shouldnt decide for me and my health but its so depressing seeing how companies are exploiting their employees now even more during pandemic giving you zero support or understanding,juiv05

700,Had my bonus deducted because I was ‘disrespectful’,3 months ago my company did a work from home survey as they were exploring the possibility of shifting roles to a permanent wfh basis we were asked to indicate the frequency that we wanted to work in the office i indicated 3 to 4 times a quarter  my manager questioned the option i selected and she was clearly unhappy   she wants people in the office everyday even though our company has been performing really well in the past 8 months despite everyone working from home she says we are a family and such close knit relationships and sharing  teaming cant happen with people being remote i gave her my honest view that it would be wonderful if we were given more flexibility to wfh post covid as it promotes work life balance and job satisfaction i also added that i understand in asian cultures wfh is usually frowned upon we are asians in an asian country but covid has shown us we can wfh effectively while still producing good results i then added that if she wants us in the office thats fine too as we have been doing that for years precovid   today during my performance review she cited this interaction and said i was disrespectful when i talked about asian cultures and values i didnt realize it was disrespectful to try to have an honest discussion about my own culture   because of this she deducted 2 from my bonus  she said while i am good at my work i need to improve on my teaming and my tone during interactions  she wants to add tone and patience to my career objectives for next quarter  how the fuck does one measure tone and patience    im so close to quitting,jvam1o

A job on the other hand...,after 2 weeks in quarantine stretched to 3 on monday its time to go back to the factory i loved work from home my actual work can usually be done in an hour 4 if you count all the teams meetings suddenly there is no two hour commute each way the work is actually interesting most of the time there is just not enough of it to keep me busy for the full 8 hours monfri the trouble is that i now have to go back to being a seat warmer for 8 hours per day  at the moment i can feel that i have some energy and inspiration for art music cooking etc again my apartment looks clean and organized for the first time in ages 3d printers and design software have been running nonstop here making costume parts for cosplay a theatre company etc  now the mother of all sunday dreads is hitting me the energy is gone and its only saturday im on the verge of literally crying contemplating how i can get out of it i wish i could quit but its already hard to pay all the bills as a single guy on an engineers salary nevermind when youre out of a job  god im so tired and i honestly just want it to end,jtykht

736,"What is the point of anti work? (serious post, I am genuinely curious)",so i guess i should preface this in a way my partner and i are very lucky not that we were born into wealth we werent but that we are lucky enough to live in a country will good social security and socialised healthcare both just happened to specialise into very in demand and high paying fields that dont require full time work or any expensive universitycollege education that allows us to spend a majority of our time at home with our family when i work i work long hours 6072 a week for 23 months at a time a typically spend the rest of the year not working while my partner only works 620 hours a week running her own business and that allows us to live a very comfortable upper middle class lifestyle     so thats out of the way were very lucky not having to work minimum wage 40 or more hours a week each just to get by     but im wondering whats the idea with anti work is it to live off the land and your own labour that would require a lot more work then most off of spend at any job or is it to live off of social security is it to go towards a socialised society where everyone is provided for equally regardless of job or social status is it anti capitalism where you dont want to work for pennies making the boss rich     a completely work free society cant be the goal even if your not working for the man and doing it yourself youd still need to get food and shelter and everything else and that requires work its just not paid     so anti workers what are you for and against i genuinely want to know,jujhyr
737,[Taxes] The Argument to Tax Work-From-Home Benefits - Ksenia Galouchko,choosing to earn a living from home once the pandemic ends is a privilege that you should pay for according to strategists from deutsche bank ags research arm  working from home will be part of the new normal well after the pandemic has passed the strategists led by luke templeman wrote in a note we argue that remote workers should pay a tax for the privilege  the team propose a 5 levy for those who work from home on a regular basis and not because of a government lockdown mandate such a measure could raise 48 billion a year in the us and about 16 billion euros 188 billion in germany they say to fund subsidies for lowincome earners and essential workers who are unable to work remotely relates to the argument to tax workfromhome benefits more from wives stop leaving money management to your spouse got lucky got it right how newbie stock jocks beat the market dalio says now is special moment for markets as china ascends peter thiel is richer than ever as tech eclipses macro mess  deutsche bank research undertook a survey to examine the major global shift toward remote work that occurred as a result of the covid19 pandemic which may endure as many professionals discover financial personal and professional benefits of the change according to the results more than half of those working remotely want to continue doing so for between two and three days a week even after the health crisis ends the survey of 800 people was conducted in september  working in the comfort of ones own home saves money on travel lunch and socializing according to deutsche bank research and offers greater job security and flexibility the strategists said yet people who are working remotely are also contributing less to the infrastructure of the economy potentially extending the slump in national growth they said  that is a big problem for the economy as it has taken decades and centuries to build up the wider business and economic infrastructure that supports facetoface working templeman said  the proposed levy would be paid by the employer if they dont provide their employee with a desk whereas if the worker decides to stay home based on their own needs they would be taxed for each day they work remotely according to deutsche bank research in the us the strategists calculate such a tax could pay for a 1500 grant to the 29 million workers making under 30000 a year and unable to work from home  it does make sense to support the mass of people who have been suddenly displaced by forces outside their control templeman said those who are lucky enough to be in a position to disconnect themselves from the facetoface economy owe it to them  source from bloomberghttpswwwyoutubecomredirectqhttps3a2f2fwwwbloombergcom2fnews2farticles2f202011112fyoushouldpayataxforworkingfromhomedeutschebanksays3fsref3dlagjc1tdampvhgmdndkig4gampredirtokenquffluhqbdrbret2wgw5tlhyx0xlwkiwyjjstzrcwxfoz3xbq3jtc0trempydgd4qndzenm4wglkawn5ytnqavg2rwmzlvg2qk81y2rubxlhn0jgvxnkwtfrni1vrkrure5lankyx1rhmgzflwhkcvbhb1e2d2vkehhov0zhrfftx0hsvfzhrwzawc1twtdomejjdwz5djf5wq3d3dampeventvideodescription,ju9fa5

753,Just watched the movie The Assistant and felt sick,thats a movie about the assistant of an executive in the film industry the movie is focused in a full day of work of the assistant in the office  the boss is a cheating psycopath who takes advantage of young women asking for sexual favours in turn of positions in movies or whatever they do the focus was more on the assistant girl and how she felt about seeing the man trick young women and nobody give a shit about it he didnt sexually harass her but he bullied her called her incompetent said she was worthless stuff like that and in the end she had to apologize to him by email and say how much she was thankful he gave her that opportunity she had to do tasks that were obviously below her position like cleaning the garbage of the boss office after a meeting talking to his angry rude wife and cleaning what appeared to be sperm from the couch of the boss office to avoid vomiting i just told myself it was some food he dropped there    her coworkers didnt seem to care much for them it appeared it was just another normal day not a big deal she went to hr complain about how the boss was having sexual encounters in the office and preying on women and the guy from hr discouraged her from filling a complaint ridiculed her accused her of making a fuss because she was jealous the boss didnt give her attention made an innappropriate condescending remark about her apperance and then called her coworkers and the boss saying she went there the hr   also she arrived very early in the morning way before 8h and only left way into the night when the boss said he didnt need her anymore she had to work weekends ate lunch a sandwich at her desk and dinner was frozen microwave food everyone in the office was just burried in their computers and phones and all the interactions just seemed cold and artifitial it almost seemed like a personality cult where everyone was corcerned about what the big boss was doing at what time he would arrive where he was who he was meeting he btw arrived after 10 the assistant arrived way before 8am left when he wanted including he left to go abbuse a young girl and missed an important work meeting leaving the potential partners furious so not only a disgusting cheater but also incompetent and disrespectful one of guys from the company was the one who was called to put out the fire everytime things were burning and he was treated as just another employee didnt get the recognition he deserved   so its fair to say i just watched an horror movie because honestly all that corporate atmosphere just made me sick the entire time   i just wonder is it possible to be jobs in the world that are so bad as what was pictured in the movie is the corporate atmosphere in the us like that,jvigy4

759,I went across the counter on a woman and tried to slap her at my first job ...,i worked in a little family owned restaurant at the time first job id ever really had  except for being a cashier for 2 days at a dead end grocery job  had a lady come in one night and order a couple of burgers and some fries to go then sat down on the bench to wait for them  as soon as she sat down a busload of baseball players kids and their parents arrived and we were slammed the ladys order came up while i was in the middle of taking a bunch of orders and i called out the order but she didnt respond so i set it over on our little to go table because honestly id forgotten the order after being bombarded by about 30 kids and their parents all at once most of them were only ordering ice cream but some got food  when everybody had cleared away from the counter and the chaos had settled down a bit the lady walked up to the counter and was like where the hell is my food and i asked her what she had ordered she said the burgers and fries in a very duh tone i said oh yeah theyre over here let me get them for you i called out the order but you didnt answer so i set them over here   meanwhile her order had only been on the table for about 56 minutes  she took the bag from me and sneered at me before leaving three minutes later shes peeling back into the parking lot barely gets her car parked leaves it running and comes storming back inside to yell at me that her food is cold  i assured her that the food couldnt be cold because it was in a styrofoam box and honestly hadnt been on the table longer than 5 minutes she insisted that i touch it and see how ice cold it was i touched the burger and it was warm i told her again that it was warm but if she wanted we could replace it  she was like dont bother you were too rtarded to get the first order right i dont have time for you to fuck up the second one   my supervisor came from the kitchen in time to grab me by the back of the shirt and pull me away just before my hand could make contact with the ladys face she held me back as she looked at the woman and said shes not rtarded shes crazy and i will let her go now do you want another burger or not  the lady dumbfounded grabbed her food made a pissed off noise at us and left didnt ever see her in the restaurant again,ju8fkm
760,Honest question with a story,i dont understand anti work or the concept of working until 70ish heres why   so i grew up poor and graduated highschool with a 18gpa because from 716 i was extremely epileptic in 7th and 8th grade i was having upto 18 grand mals a day aka i was dying and suffered pretty bad brain damage durring that time my brother beat the absolute shit out of me daily it wasnt brotherly fighting it was horrible abuse for my 16th birthday i got a lawn mower without an engine my dad helped my put an engine in it i was told i can mow lawns and buy my own carso i did all throughout highschool i mowed lawns until it was dark being a highschool kid i of course spent all of the money on unless crap lol   after highschool i started welding dump trucks for 15 an hour i got sick of that and looked into how rich people became rich i stumbled across day trading and the stock market so i studied that while working i thought it was a get rich quit thing so i quit my job and traded expecting to become wealthy real fast then quickly learned that wasnt the case so i went back to work and welding school and practiced tig welding until i mastered it i landed an aerospace welding job my schedule was 9am  1130am day trade noon  1pm gym 2pm  1am welding job i worked my ass off i became lead welder my supervisor and superintendent loved my work ethic and how i pumped out so many parts without failing xray or the other weld inspections so i got a pay raise more vacation and i could mess around without getting points or getting yelled at as long as i got more than enough parts done for the day   my old friends from highschool always complained about being tired or how much work they had to do or how hard life was yet on snapchat they would be at parties be high or drunk they eat like crap and stayed up all night my co workers would complain about not getting paid enough and working too much but they had new cars big houses spent way to much on fast food energy drinks alcohol etc 90 of them didnt have a plan or a goal for retirement they worked enough to not get fired but thats it nothing more nothing less i asked my friends and co workers why not spend less money or work more efficiently why not keep goals or do something different in life why not budget what about downgrading houses and cars to save money spend less on food why not come up with a plan to eventually start a business or invest  but everytime id open my mouth id get looked at like i was crazy it bothered me and i started thinking hhmmm maybe i am crazy and trying to become wealthy is a rigged game  i didnt let it get to me so i worked even harder on trading and at welding i finally started to make money trading consistently and my welding got even better then out of no where i was having complex partial seizures a week went by and i was getting 515 a day so went to the dr and once again i was diagnosed with epilepsy my new medicine made my welding and trading stuffer but i worked around that adapting to my new brain my seizures were basically bad staring spellsrun away thoughts and still were happening even with medicine but a month went by and i was back to where i was with trading and welding after working my ass off with trading i was confident enough to quit my welding career and take the step into full time day trading   now i trade full time from 9am1130am i have the freedom to do what i want when i want but i continue to work on myself and my skills in life everyday  i understand people have to make house payments or car payments or have kids they need to take in account but i firmly believe anyones excuse is just thatan excuse i know a guy who has 4 kids was 24k in debt and now hes  made it and he came from nothing he took a vow to never work for a boss ever again and he sacrificed so much and now hes on top of the world and still grindingeven my sister saw what i did she broke up with her bf and immediately started working on a fishing boat and became waitress at the same time for a long time now shes doing her own thing and is so close to being where im at in life   questions why do so many people hate work why not make the sacrifice and escape the rat race theres so many options in life so why not explore them   even if you went fully off grid back in nature you still have to put in a huge amount of work for food shelter water and more  basically why does it seem this anti work thing is so popular with my generation im a millennial or gen z not sure lol   i just dont get it ,jtxgys
761,I have had more than 100 jobs so far. I'm 26.,i would go to a temp agency find some warehouse shift and they would make me start from next day    usually i would last a week my record is 3 months sometimes i left after an hour sometimes one hour was enough to break me  in one warehouse i started a total of 7 times before they realized that im that guy   usually i would leave because of a verbal fight i had with a supervisor i would see an injustice like a beautiful girl not working and me having to pick her slack and i would ask for justice just to be told youre just an employee shut up basically many similar cases  sometimes i would just be so exhausted from all the heavy lifting that i would leave i would rather be homeless thats how much i hated it my step counter had 20 miles per day walked in the warehouse with those heavy safety boots  i was able to make more than a hundred jobs because agencies dont even remember you and their database deletes old entries after three months   im jobless again living with my parents again i have no money and i only eat from the fridge use the internet and actually its so much better ill have to eventually hold a job because i feel sorry for my parents i guess ill have to start drinking antidepressants or kill myself or go back to monke   peace,jujlk7

810,Micromanagement and meetings nightmare JOB,so i am working a second gig because i cant pay my bills with the one i already have its on the editorial end of a magazine too focused on making money selling advertisement even though this has been a dead end model of business for more than a decade     the first month everything was cool my boss was nice and my coworkers were pretty chill them the nightmare began      i realized the company hired me for half of what the person on my  position earned i thought this was the standard salary until i accidentally got a memo from the higher ups with a salary tab hearing that they would resume paying back in full after a 50 cut due to covid19 i found out this way that now everybody even people in a position in the same level of hierarchy as me will be paid a lot more than me     not only that but in order for people to earn their full wage back the company started to measure the amount of work everybody does that includes me so now we have to fill an excel tab daily with all the things we did on the day at the end of the week our bosses tie this in with our goals and based on the overall percentage they get paid accordingly meaning if they reached 80 of the weekly goal overall then they get 80 of that 50 cut but for me since i didnt have a cut that percentage means how much of my wage am i going to get paid 90 for 90 of the goals and so on we also have daily zoom meetings to tell our superiors what do we have planned for the day and to tell them exactly what are we going to spend our time on     apart from that we get calls out of nowhere for constant virtual meetings just as i was typing this i recieved a call for a zoom meeting no warning whatsoever and they micromanage this they count assistance to meetings on an excel tab and missing even one means getting short of your goals we get approximately 3 or 4 zoom calls per day which pummels our productivity to the ground i got one of my superiors mad by telling him during one of said meetings that i wasnt able to get shit done with so many calls and that most of what we discussed could be summed up on an email he told me he needed to confirm we were working even though we are forced to go to the office in spite of the covid rising and these meetings were a great way for him to know whether we were in front of our computer or slacking off     to make matters worse every tuesday at 9 am we have a meeting with the sales department to present the rankings of our site and social media this is a nightmare because they are always complaining that my team doesnt do enough to rev up the traffic our site gets even though they are right theres another problem there we dont have reporters community managers photographers or an editor i do all of that with a quota of 3 articles per day 3 facebook posts 3 instagram stories and photos and 6 tweets with two exclusive interviews every week oh and i also have to send 2 newsletters and edit and shoot videos for the magazine     im still on 3 months trial but ill be going out my merry way after that period ends i dunno if i should tell them their company sucks ass and they do everything there is to do wrong      just needed to get this off my system thanks for reading,jsfwk6

813,"Last week, I applied for a senior position in a Fortune 100 company. This week, they say I'm not skilled enough, even though I surpass the criteria on their advert.",im not going to say what company or job it is as they might see this post i doubt it but saving for anonymity   last week i had a zoom interview with a fortune 100 company for senior position in the field i specialize in their criteria was as follows  1 five years industry experience 2 postgraduate experience 3 good technical knowledge 4 able to use industry software packages 5 commercial awareness 6 experience in training others 7 experience in modelling data 8 understanding in python 9 ability to communicate with others  so lets go through them  1 i have seven years of industry experience 2 i have a phd 2 masters degrees and 2 bachelors degrees 3 points 1 and 2 cover my technical knowledge 4 i have trained people to use the software packages they want me to use 5 i have tendered many projects in my time 6 i have trained many people including undergraduates postgraduates and colleagues 7 i have extensive experience in modelling data 8 i have a proficiency in python and used it to model and analyze data 9 i have given presentations all over the world at conferences and liaised with clients  because of my experience and exceeding the expectations of the job criteria i stated that a starting salary of 68000 approx 80100 would be suitable even those salary websites friends and old colleagues state that this is a good average salary however the interview instantly took a turn and you could feel the tension   yesterday they got back to me and stated that they would like me but that my experience isnt enough to warrant this senior role as they were actually looking for someone with eight10 years industry experience and that i am not skilled enough to be a senior in their company  as their criteria is different to other companies therefore they could only offer me 38000 approx 44800 with no negotiations but offered me bonus incentives such as bonuses for hitting and exceeding targets workfromhome allowance to cover utilities and a couple of other things which could double my salary per year yeah right   i asked why they wouldnt consider me for the role which was specified but all i received was the same platitudes  even though the job description stated five years industry experience  so because they wasted my time i am going to waste their time they have asked me to come into their office bearing in mind this is in a different country  they are paying for my travel expenses at least which is a twohour flight from my home city they want me to come in for a skills test during the pandemic i might add i told them id be more than happy to turn up  am i going to turn up am i fuck  i just received confirmation that they have booked my flight and a hotel for the night im not going to go i am going to blame it on the pandemic yes you may think i am a bad person for doing this but at least i wont be burning any bridges with them they can waste someone elses time  i fucking hate working in offices and i detest being around people that are all about the company i also hate people who dont pull their weight and demand more and more of you  which was the reason why i left my previous company this lazy ass fuck that would always be on the phone to his wife getting paid twice as much as me for sitting on his ass all day hes probably living the dream as he does fuck all but not that the expense of me asshole i also hate the whole culture of office work i am direct and do not shy away from confrontation i am also not underselling myself i havent been in academia for 12 years and industry for seven to be given a subpar salary find some other sucker  so you know what fortune 100 company fuck you,jsw0pl

821,Thoughts on an ideal economic system,so ive been thinking a lot about this and not being an expert in the field these are my loose thoughts they dont describe a coherent system but certain points ive come to realize are critical in changing our society because of how often they seem to interfere with what id call a star trek economy im writing this because i dont see many of these types of stream of consciousness sorts of comments because people usually only point out singular aspects of the economy and because i feel a vision for a revamped economic system is lacking and hardly discussed in its possible entirety   capitalism as it is now shouldnt exist  defined as inidividuals owning brands and factories and undemocratically ordering around employees wherever companies need to exist they have to be run democratically not necessarily directly but with enough possible individual input as say citizens of switzerland have being egocentric here where youre free to challenge individual government boardceo decisions and where a board can be elected by the employees secondly entrepreneurship in and of itself isnt something worthwhile we need to minimize the work to be done by humans and automation and transfer of newly available lifetime has to be one of our primary goals for this reason we cannot tolerate a vampiric financial ruling class however i can concede that a moderate financial inequality can be motivational for people that produce actual innovation and actual surplus value think new cancer drug instead of new iphone more cars repaired instead of more money made for shareholders  i suggest something like a 110 limit where 1 is a national ubi and 10 is the limit anybody can make including worth and inheritance etc the whole stock system shareholding investing needs to be illegal no more of this category of bullshit jobs prohibition of vampirism instead for the remaining companies if you want to support the development of a product donate to them or just help someone start something you just  imagine this guys  give money without return lets see how many of these people actually totally like starting companies you guys  something like a separation of production income distribution and market advertising in the classical sense should be outlawed would be handy business must cater to what people want without psychological intereference it also must not benefit more from more business  the profit motive must be eliminated it is responsible for so much misery and limitations in this world from copyright mafias to unaffordable insulin to climate change and kids working in sweatshops separate instances should deal with the profit the market desires and the actual production  of course these things alone still dont solve some critical questions how do we effectively automate away labour and construct a society where a lot of people just dont need to work how much should a ubi be in relation to an income ceiling how much is actual bullshit jobs and how many do produce some type of worth for society could we deal with ego problems and the fact that some people that had a passive fabulous income are now normal everyday working folk how do we reconcile the fact that a big class of society just wouldnt have to work anymore  because for the countless flaws our systems have right now they do provide an awful lot of luxuries and conveniences thinking easy fast food decongesting nosespray pink fur toilet seats whatever albeit at the cost of heart attacks suicides in teenagers rapid climate change environmental holocaust child labour and at most 20 average years of retirement between slave labour and death  another important thing is actual political engagement how do we get our desires and ideas heard and spread across the western world what can we do to stop dreaming and take physical action internet discussions on their own our useless  the communist subreddits can chat until theyre blue in the face unless every single one of them put together flyers start parties and get going from door to door  discuss,jsf44x

Let me know what you guys think?,so i was thinking for a future sustainable model in which no one has to work under someone is making some form of a resource based economy   basically the idea is to split countriescitiesstates etc into smaller decent sized communities these communities are sustainable by providing free foodwatersheltertransportenergyand a set amount of currency with no strings attached basically using things and concepts that already exist so people dont have to work major concerns from everyone is who would do the labor my solution is to just give the jobs to people who want to work for more currency people with currency could buy non essentials which is very appealing    in turn this would hopefully increase innovation and coming together for a common good in order to fully automate things like food production transport and anything else  ideally any businesses would be owned by workers not a sole owner or cooperation in order to keep work and production ethical   also in terms of how these communities are governed there would be no political figures instead  i was thinking of something along the lines of a libertarian anarchy which mostly focuses upon the individual making sure that each person has the maximum amount of freedom personally i believe by having a community solely vote it would exclude the minority creating conflict also i believe that less laws are the way to go as long as what you are doing isnt interfering with anyone else the concept of libertarian anarchism would have to be tweaked but its just a general concept as an alternate option communities could chose a system until one worked however in some cases this could lead to ruin,jsrezq

854,I finally reached my breaking point.,after months of struggling with depressionanxiety i finally had a nervous breakdown on tuesday i got up in the morning got ready for work and right when i went to grab my keys to leave i started sobbing uncontrollably i tried my hardest to pull myself together so i could just get the day over with but i couldnt stop i ended up calling off and ultimately i immediately filed a leave of absence request in hopes to receive short term disability for a couple of weeks   i moved to a new city a year and a half ago and on top of the isolation from moving away from the only home i ever knew the pandemic isolation hit me even harder so i have virtually no support system here besides my fianc im away from my mom and sister who i used to see every other day and now i only see them a couple times a year i have never felt so shitty in my entire life i look back on the person i was four months ago and i was stressed then but i was managing stress at work on top of everything else was just too much to handle    i spoke to my supervisor and basically blubbered on the phone like an idiot and let her know everything that was going on oddly enough she was supportive in a way that i didnt expect and said she would hold my job for a few weeks and that we could talk about stress management at work when i came back i have a physicians note to be off work until the 30th of november but im already dreading going back because im just so embarrassed people are going to ask me what happened and if im okay has anyone else gone through this i need this time off so that i can focus on myself get my meds situated and feel better im just feeling really down on myself and feeling so ashamed that i cant even handle life the pressure of capitalism is still ingrained in my brain somewhere i guess,jsufzw
855,Why I'm sad this morning: Story time.,earlier this year i ended a job due to a combo of being burned out hating retail customer service and pandemic anxiety mental selfcare during covid  back in august i started planning on returning to postsecondary for the first time in over 10 years   my thought process was that i dont have the pieces of paper that i need in order to get jobs that i dont hate   to be entirely clear the fact i need a job angers me to my bones but there isnt much i can do about it and keep a roof over my head  so i found some ideas of schooling i wouldnt mind jobs i wouldnt necessarily mind having if i had said schooling and could potentially lead to me working for myself or doing a thing i liked   but in order to do that i needed government assistance money because i live in canada thats possible today i got the numbers back as to how many dollars i can expect from the government and even with that i cant afford to live and go to school   i came up with a mockup budget of a scaled down version of what i currently have and even with that scaled down version i still couldnt afford my life costs and tuition in order to do that i would have to get some kind of parttime likely retail job to afford the schooling  i havent done postsecondary in over 10 years i want to focus exclusively on schooling so i can do as well as possible and learn as much as possible   ive already put in 4 months of my own time so many fucking emails sorting shit with incompetent people unclear policies etc and over 300 worth of my own amp friends money for deposits and transcripts and etc   still after all that im still almost 200 short on the first term 4000 short for the second term and likely 3000 short for the third term at the end of next year   quite literally i do not know what to do   if i was capable of wanting to deal with humans i might have considered a construction apprenticeship but i dont have any money up front for a union fee i dont have any prior construction skills that i would be able to offer someone willing to train me more i dont know how to find those people even when it isnt a pandemic also i dont want to deal with humans except i know i have toso i figured a postsecondary space would be the most structured and require the least amount of organizing on my part scoffs well that was incredibly inaccurate  credit and other loans are not possible for me something ive investigated in the past so thats also a nope   so now i have a decision to make    do i try to find a way to get a parttime job so i can afford schooling but in the process risk mental health as well as grades and learning capacity  do i give up on the schooling process forget the 300 and the 4 months of life i cant get back and cancel everything after i find a fulltime job and go back to working aka hating 5 of 7 days of the week and anxious the other 2  do i try to find a government assistance program so i can continue being off on mental health leave because this world is a crapshoot  do i start praying to the aliens to obliterate the universe jokes i started that like a year ago  i mean if i had the emotional energy to deal with more bullshit like this i would have kept my fulltime job working customer service but i didnt because i couldnt   and the idea of needing to go back to hating my life just to afford to stay alive when i didnt ask to be alive to begin with is infuriating beyond words and terrifying especially because im trying so hard and keep slamming into bureaucratic red tape walls  and thats why im sad this morning,jsy953

859,vent about a terrible job interview,yesterday i had terrible interview via zoom  after booking the interview i looked up the glassdoor reviews and yikes  abusive malignant staff driven to stressinduced breakdowns like death row inmates  so i figured id chalk it up to interview practice  but it was bad  really bad  because of connectivity issues they suggested i switch off my video option  so i could see them but they could not see me  after some introductory waffle and chat the serious questions began  i could clearly see that the main interviewer was not impressed with my answers  she was rolling her eyes and such  i thought her questions were very vague and broad so i tried to get some clarification and that did not go over well  and then it just went to shit  interviewer had about a million what a fucking moron faces going a mile a minute  and she knew i could see that  she became increasingly angry and frustrated  i just  shut down  i shut down like a little kid getting berated by a parent  i thought about just pulling the plug on the interview but i was too drained of life to actually decide  obviously i wasnt trying to give good answers by this point and this enraged the interviewer even more  finally it ended  im still shaken up  im also thinking well so what if i turned out to be a dud the interviewer has plenty of experience she must know that happens sometimes  it makes her job easier  she can just cross me off the list  that is what the interview is for   did she really need to get so pissy just because i stumbled on the first few questions  did she think that rolling her eyes at me was going to improve the interview   as you can imagine i find those reviews quite easy to believe now    ugh why does getting a job have to be so hard  it wasnt this hard 2530 years ago im that old  i had some bad interviews back then but not the shitshows i encounter now,jsw386

872,"The realization of ""actual"" work after all the work of graduate school is depressing",sorry if this doesnt belong here but it seems like the best place to post this sort of thing and not get the you havent even started working response which is both annoying and insulting and i need to get it out  ampx200b  im on the end stages of finishing my phd and ive realized that i dont think things are going to get better ive worked so hard for so many years that im completely burnt out on it and have absolutely zero interest in the topic anymore or research in general which is making the last push more difficult than it already is so soon ill be faced with the problem of finding a job relevant to my skills which is now in a field i have zero interest doing anymore work in also i feel like since the phd was such a big life goal that when it was done somehow things would be less difficult i was certainly promised when i was young that continuing my education was the path to successmoney and a good life which is absolutely not always or even often the case anymore im going to have to keep working until i freaking die even if its not at school i cant even afford to take a break when i finish even though ive realized lately that i dont want just a break i want to stop im so damn tired of working and im only 30 this system is broken and of course the pandemic means i might be forced to take a break if continuously searching for a job every moment so i can pay my damn bills and not end up on the street not to mention student loans an be considered a break maybe it will all work out but im just so damn tired and it seems so exhausting to even consider everyone i talk to just gives me the whole well thats life well it shouldnt be i shouldnt have to dread my future because im going to have to spend most of my waking time working i hate it im so mad that we have developed this culture where everyone is expected to work the vast majority of their life just to be allowed to survive in society  ampx200b  tldr finishing phd realizing that isnt the end of work and that i hate the system for forcing us to work our lives away and for leading me to believe that this much work for the multiple degrees would be worth it,jtf1wk
873,If any job in a system pays poverty wages then the system only works if someone is in poverty.,so sick of people being told to get new qualifications to get better jobs  say you do a degree maybe open university in the uk working every free minute you have for four years and you get a wellpaying job someone will still have to do your old job  no matter what someone will need to wait tables clean floors and wash cars these people deserve to live unless we elevate everyone then the system only works by being propped up by an underclass history will judge us harshly for this and rightly so  america was greatest when the boomers were young because the minimum wage was so high all countries should look to that as an example because the current system of capital being taken out of circulation and hoarded is hurting us all,jtked5
874,The shambles of my work environment (long),hello thanks for reading this it may be a long one so apologies for that  i work in a national operationscontrol room for a global market leading company basically a glorified call center for clients employees and linked business partner companies   i work 12 hour shifts on a 4 on 4 off rotation sat in front of 4 computer screens  our team should be made up of 4 people and our supervisor however we have 3 and a supervisor i am second most experienced with only 2 years service then someone with 1 year and a brand new person within last 3 months  currently our supervisor is off sick having a surgical procedure then will be off recovering a couple of months then another one of our team is also off sick awaiting a procedure but has a doctors note confirming absence from work  to add to this our big boss recently left for a new job leaving his second to be in charge this second is rarely in the offices as he has shacked up with one of his direct subordinates and they now live together  so that leaves myself and someone who is brand new to run 5 inbound call lines 2 outbound call lines that we have to chase up and still work on the email requests we have come through for third party companies and contractors  then they still want incoming call waits under an average of 30 seconds across the team  we dont even have tappyclicktocall we have to manually dial each number  naturally working 12 hours a day or night you get pretty tired we only get 1 hour break each however with the current staffing levels this obviously affects how we can take our breaks if at all  the company hasnt arranged adequate cover from other staff to help my team as they refuse to pay extra incentive for overtime they will only pay flatrate pay  so i work my ass off all daynight doing as best as i can only to get chewed out for making one or two mistakes when ive made thousands of interactionscalls all shift  not worth the pitiful 23000 a year they pay me cowboy company posing as a top employer and brand,jtdmmx

881,Pocket checks at work are dehumanizing.,im not sure if its like this in other parts of the world but in ontario canada its extremely common in the retail environment  several of the places ive worked at including my current job have a policy that every time an employee is leaving the premises they have to submit to a pocket check to make sure they arent stealing anything then after be escorted to the door hell some places dont even allow you to have pockets at all so every time i go to leave my minimum wage job i feel like im going through bloody airport security  i just dont understand the logic behind it you dont do this to customers 910 times the ones who are shoplifting right out in the open or any form of management but of course the bottom rung employees cant be trusted at all  best part is its a refurbished garbage store where half the stock doesnt work and has little to no value,jt6per

883,I feel like almost no one IRL understands - a rant after a terrible day at work,some background i have an office job where i make a decent amount and everyone at my company is wfh due to covid since last march to at least through next april under normal circumstances its a pretty chill though not exactly enjoyable job with an ideal or normal workload you probably only do 45 hours of work per day unless youre really bad at managing your time however due to covid our workload has doubled or even tripled in part due to the nature of the job and also due to a lot of people across the office going out on leave  quitting therefore giving the remaining people more to do also my aunt works there too in the same position as me just in another location   so the other day i was telling her that after we get back to a normal workload it would be so amazing if i was able to just work the 2025 hours a week that i actually do    her yeah youd only make half of what you make now though    me yeah but they could just not do that just pay us what they do now it ends up being the same    her but were hourly   me right so they could double our hourly rate or switch us back to salary    her but why would they do that if were not full time    me but we already sit around for the half the day doing nothing theyre paying us for doing nothing so why not just let us go when were done for the day were still doing the same amount of work for them    her butwere hourlywhy do we deserve full time pay for half days    me its a fortune 250 company im pretty sure theyll be okay   her changes subject    i mentioned earlier in this post that weve been doing double or triple the normal workload lately this has been going on since march with no reprieve in sight no bonuses nothing except for some thank you emails from corporate i kind of jokingly told her that i therefore want triple my salary the salary of three people since our employer apparently considers me three people i said i make 50k normally wheres my 150k this year im not actually expecting this btw lol  she looked at me like i grew a second head   its so frustrating that no one else seems to understand this why is it so bad to question our employers and push back against the status quo some people are so complacent,jsmqg9

885,Tired of Struggling for a Better Job,i work a terrible job that pays around 9 an hour its at a school and they recently had an opening in their tech department that starts at 15 an hour ive been with the school for a few years and have been a reliable and a good employee i put in for the job and didnt even get an interview or anything my hobbies are building pcs repairing them etc for people i know the job was very basic simple and would have been awesome to get into some form of the tech field and get that work experience it would have been life changing for me to be honest    as bad as it sounds making 15 an hour would have allowed me to actually have the money to live life instead of just scraping by not being able to spend money on what most people consider necessities im so sick of working 40 hours a week and literally have nothing to show for it other than hating 57ths of my life the worst part is im intelligent and capable of so much more but im stuck in this shit job with no way out    this whole thing has made me realize my bosses dont give a fuck about me and dont even care enough to act like they do i really just wish i could find something i could do for a living that didnt make me hate existence and allowed me to be somewhat comfortable financially,jsivog
886,It just makes me fucking sick how we’ve let it got this bad,minimum wage is laughable work full time there goes 50 of your monthly paycheck oh and lets not forget the 1025 that go to taxes making it so every 4 weeks or something youre basically giving free labor you need roommates to even survive because a damn studio for a single person is goddamn expensive  and then we got the cat fees dog fees hell sometimes you even need to pay their monthly rent the application fee the move in fee the deposit first month and sometimes last months rent and i can keep going but all of this crap for some goddamn poorly designed apartment rust dirt and overexpensive place to live bloody hell   i swear to fucking god i just wanna get on live or youtube and just call out every motherfucker and this whole shitty system i dont even give a fuck if im cancelled shot in the head or whatever   id rather fucking die than to contribute to this bullshit why the fuck are we still supporting this crap oh yeah cause half the population is dumb as bricks half of em even dumber than that and the smarter ones are either the psychos in charge of things being used to further psychos agendas the scientists docs engineers etc and the left of the smart ones are poor af or dead by homicide or suicide   i d i o f u c k i n g c r a c y weve literally bred ourselves to be domesticated obedient little drones yeah weve got some protests and riots but its okay most of the populous is fed and entertained even though theyre suffering but thats okay weve invented a whole new means of population control via the drug and therapy industry and if that fails the elites of the world will just flee to their privately owned land and impose martial law and destroy absolutely any resistance whatsoever because in todays current world technology and power is in their favor and before that even happens theyre first trying to create a whole world that looks like china in terms of surveillance and theyll try to harness the power of robots and ai to create their new world order im not talking about illuminati just the rich people in power and companies possibly at one point killing off any nay sayers and furthering the world into something even worse than an episode of black mirror    i wanna blow my fucking brain off sigh i honestly feel like im in the matrix or something  life is absolutely hell and theres no sight of anything that resembles to our fairy tales of heaven besides eternal oblivion but even that is probably not real considering how were already here in the first place and were literally a part of the universe so its not like we can actually die just change into another form what im getting at is along the lines of panpsychism and the egg,jsmm51

911,How dare you use your unpaid time off!,so i 21m work at plantai mean amazon and ive been at this fucking place for 2 years now i make poverty wage duh because the facility is part time and im lucky if i get 20 hours therefore i live at home have no car and i just spend my free time focusing on my college classes  anyways ive been trying for the last 2 years to get a better position but i kept getting denied and nobody would even tell me why im not a lazy worker and management always likes to point out how hard i work so they can move me to the sections with the most fucking work long story short i went to hr and told them i was pissed and that i was on my 6th application with no reply back on why i havent gotten the job ive seen asshole new hires come in and have high tier positions within 2 months the lady agreed and said shed look into the problem and that she also is confused because you work so hard  i just got an email after working my shift and walking my standard 2000030000 steps something like 10 miles these fuckers denied my 7th applicationbecause i was below 10 hours of unpaid time of and im now also penalized  you fuckers only give us 20hrs of upt every 3 months why the fuck cant i use my time off thats the whole point of having it not to mention they take an entire hour of upt if your so much as 1 minute late for work  keep in mind they didnt say i wasnt qualified for the position  and they wonder why nobody likes working these bullshit jobs   i will say this again hard work gets you nowhere these days but fucked in the ass,jtx5ld
912,Unpopular Opinion: Most Europeans don't know how good they have it.,the benefits and worklife balance given to the average european worker are unimaginable for americans   european workers get more than 10 public holidays 56 weeks paid vacation maternity leave for several months paternity leave essentially unlimited sick days virtually no unpaid mandatory overtime and most fulltime workers work less than 40 hours a week  here in america despite chronic pain and numerous health conditions i am working 60 hours a week with no overtime pay with only 2 sick days a year with only 4 vacationpto days a year no holidays off and no family leave or paternity leave and this is considered good for a job in my industry for which i had to get a masters degree to enter all of my friends and colleagues are in similar positions  my wife works 70 hours a week and receives 5 days off including sick days for the entire year she is 7 months pregnant and gets no time off for childbirth or maternity leave the plan right now is for her to give birth in the morning and come back to work later in the day read again she will give birth and come back to work on the same day and no she did not qualify for fmla  and before you start crying that americans have higher salaries than europeans  thats only true for a few certain select professions like computer engineering or medicine in my field accounting and audit european workers generally make more after tax  so everytime i see europeans on here complaining about how they are suffering because of their work lives i honestly get enraged i hate to gatekeep here but you have no idea what real suffering is   the average european worker would probably have a total psychological breakdown and become violently suicidal if he or she tried living and working in america for more than a couple of years  the worst part is i cannot even quit or take a break because then i will lose health insurance nor can i kill myself to end the pain and stress because my family is dependent on me not can i just get up and immigrate to a better country because getting a job overseas is near impossible unless you are a specialist in some high demand field   for the worker america is hell  and there is no escape here,jsxwck

922,Humanity has no direction and is stuck in mire of never-ending consumerism - There are no winners in the end.,whats the direction of humanity it would seem in the 60s there was a great hope that we would expand our knowledge of the planet and breach the walls of our own solar system but then it all kinda dropped off and as the decades rolled on we allowed a small class of human beings to gain a massive amount of wealth and power that they keep in private hands  on islands in foreign bank accounts wrapped up in stocks and shares  none of which this wealth benefits the majority of people or their governments that are supposedly democratically elected   it would seem to me that the world is stuck in mire the capitalists dont want to move away from a system that garuntees them their place at the top living in total luxurary away from any of lifes unpleasantness over the cracks of crumbling societies all over the world they pave over broken underfunded systems with private ones  the ones that require money to access so that while the world burns they can ignore all of that with little hindrance to themselves   its not unusual for countries to have 2 education systems 2 law systems even housing that is designed to seperate rich from poor the whole covid thing shows just how directionless we are as a species the people at the top of the pile have fluffed the whole test by their only focus being on keeping the economy open so that people can consume and keep the system going   in 2020 we may not have flying cars or interplanetary travel but we do have the means to house feed clothe and educate people up to a university level  and we should be  we could reduce the working week quite heavily but that would require a change in the economy that capitalists will not accept   capitalists hate change they always have to have their hands forced in britain we build the canals first 1700s all of the capitalists were wretched when trains came along and did everything they could to stop them from taking off then they built the main motorway roads and got rid of half of the railways  effecting shareholders in the railways etc   anyway humanity isnt going anywhere wealthy people have no vision for the future politics is rigged overton window has been dragged to the right for decades now across the world and climate change will probably end us all   thank you for coming to my ted talk,jrkifb

925,"Just got out of an interview, I'd like to vent.",so if anyone is familiar with my past posts here you may know that ive been looking for work since february of this year   since february i have applied to 150 jobs i have been rejected by 90 been interviewed by less than 10 of them and received absolute silence from the rest  today i had a job interview with burlington   the position i applied for was labeled as seasonal stockroom associate when i mentioned that i would require training using the cash register the hiring manager was confused and told me that i applied for a cashier position this is not the first time this has happened it seems that corporations love to pull an ol switcharoo with positions on job candidates and act like you did something wrong   i have been considered for the position but theres a bunch of hoops i need to jump through  first they will send me an email link to complete an online workday assessment which should take at least an hour if my assessment is received well they will then invite me to orientation which is essentially a full day of unpaid work that will determine if i can perform the required duties and undergo any necessary training  only after that will they schedule a second interview that determines if i am eligible for the position   and lastly since this is a seasonal position i only work when they need me too and i am paid minimum wage in accordance to those randomized hours this means i will be making inconsistent minimum wage  ampx200b  i hate american work culture and capitalism so much the health economic and political crisis that this nation is going through has violently torn off the already poorly arranged facade that corporations had over them and revealed that american work culture is just pure sadism  i swear that these hiring managers derive a sick sense of pleasure from forcing their job candidates to go through all these unnecessary hoops just to get a minimum wage job  looking for a job in the usa is like running in a maze with 100 different exits and every single exit has a saw trap that you need to get through before escaping   and the biggest issue is that i have no other choice but to participate in this system i have zero other options   i hate the usa i hate work and i hate capitalism,jrtngv

928,"What do you think ""anti-work"" means?",serious question to you the reader what does antiwork mean   is antiwork hating the idea that you have to work in order to survive in the past working meant getting up at the break of dawn plowing fertilizing gathering your crops taking care of the livestock hunting for meat sewing your own clothes mendingbuilding your own house etc you would put in work every single day just to survive on the frontier you would barter with people in order to attain things that you couldnt provide for yourself  your life was in your own hands you owned your time if you didnt put in the work you didnt last very long unless you turned to crime and robbed others of their hardearned fruits of labor or relied on others to take care of you  in todays modern world the work is a bit different but the idea isnt basically youre hypothetically getting up at the crack of dawn commuting to work for someone else in order to get paid a currency that has a perceived value which you use to buy the things you need to survive ie food shelter clothing etc your time isnt your own while employed by someone else youve agreed to give them your time and work in order to get paid so that you can survive you could opt not to work in todays society but youd have a hard life surviving   so in the very general situations ive described above the conclusion is that in order to survive you still have to work whether its you living off the land or you selling your time and labor to someone else   given the state of our modern societies how can someone that is antiwork thrive what do they expect to be able to do in order to survive im genuinely curious because a utopian society where anyone and everyone can do what they want with their time sounds very optimistic and unobtainable   the thing is even if youre living on a deserted island or piece of unknown land somewhere off the grid youre still going to be putting in the effort to survive youll still be working the only difference is that youre in control of your time and where youll spend your efforts   maybe im getting hung up on the word work in antiwork is antiwork something else something like a belief where youre not against work per se but against the system that has made a society where your survival is almost out of your control,jr4nnc

963,I think working for $10.50 an hour added onto my ptsd,dont wanna ramble on about what caused my ptsd  having to work in a hotel and expected to clean about 16 to 20 rooms in 8 hours for 1050 has definitely caused me to have trauma symptoms  sometimes having a partner sometimes alone didnt matter if the room was trashed or not it had to be done by the end of shift  usually guests only left after the 11 am check out time maybe 2 or 3 guests leaving before check out to put it simply the last 5 hours of my shift was rushing to clean the entire room and bathroom  loud vaccuum pressure put on by supervisors partner may or may not be in a terrible mood or hate my guts  every day  i still get pain in my stomach thinking of it at times  this was a part time job by the time i quit  went from 40 hrs 36 hrs 24 each reduction of hours from worsening symptoms  dread from going in waking up 3 hours early due to anxiety  i dont understand how my father who ive lived with since my mom kicked me out when i was 16 has done this for 15 yrs or so  ive confronted him about the stress and asked him if he wanted more from life at all  no im comfortable as is  i asked him if he truly feels happy  and then i broke down  from reliving the stress from my school years from the stress with my mother from the job i had i asked him if he was happy or felt satisfied while having to pay about half of his paycheck maybe 23 of it even on bills on his car loan insurance groceries streaming services that i feel horrible for complaining while people who have less than us are suffering   that the job i had made questioning the quality of our lives triggering traumatically triggering  i can do nothing for people who i wish to help because i no longer have income i cant enjoy my hobbies anymore i have all the time i could wish for to enjoy and explore hobbies  it all just makes me feel like a leech because i physically and mentally am not strong enough to handle the stress of a job  i wouldnt mind working if at least what i needed for survival had been taken care of for me heating rent ac utilities id pay for anything extra with whatever income i would have with those not weighing on me  i apologize if this sounds like whining  my point is i cannot work without getting immobilized from anxiety and physical trauma symptoms before even getting ready to go to work  thank you for reading and apologize for the sheer amount of text,jqqeim

969,Is working remotely any better than in person?,im considering eventually looking for remote work because i hate having to do all this extra effort outside of work waking up earlier than actual shift making a meal to bring making yourself look presentable driving to work work for way more hours than i want and go home to then make dinner and clean up i guess im wondering if wfh is any easier in terms of work load and work related stresses i keep imagining that itll be so nice to do all of these activities during your break and how nice itll be to just be in the comfort of your home but i think im seeing things through rose tinted glasses the only thing that im worried about is since people arent in the same building therell be way more phone calls and tbh i have bad phone call anxiety id appreciate hearing everyones opinion on their wfh job,jry1cf
970,I have hope for this future though,under capitalism workers of not sell products they sell their life itself of 8hour intervals  this of seen of a necessary sacrifice of continue living but workers are mostly producing for the owners benefit     consider a burger that costs 1 of produce but of sold for 3 of of takes 3 minutes of make 67 of produced each minute of contrast the worker receives just 167 per minute of 10 of hour  were the worker given the full value of their labor they would only have of work a 2hour shift  but instead workers labor the extra 6 of pay for the owners yacht       you have nothing of lose but your chains ,jrz3ai
971,Working makes my life not worth living.,i dont have time or energy for university hobbies travelling not that i can travel anywhere with covid around but you get the point exercise therapy or social life   you know what i do have time for though spending 8 hours a day helping some ridiculously rich people get a little more rich in exchange for an incredibly tiny fraction of their profits so tiny that i have to make some more money on the side or id have to eat nothing but rice and beans because my dear landlord kindly takes over half of my paycheck  in the meantime im trying to finish my degree in the hopes that it will help me get a better paying job in the future but im struggling a lot despite studying something im genuinely interested in  for a few months ive been meaning to go to therapy to help me with a few mental health issues but i genuinely have problems finding some free time and more importantly i dont think i can even afford it  sometimes i feel like my only choices are starving to death or living a life that is just utterly unenjoyable,jqvfjf

973,Retail and Covid,so im dumb as hell and got a part time retail job for the season  its the store that pays good anyway not only am i remembering why i hated retail sneaking you on the schedule out of nowhere overworking you its part time but im working full time etc but they also text us nearly every day about another team member testing positive for covid im genuinely concerned there is really nothing by way of prevention besides masks it seems so unsafe and people just flock to this store like nothing is going on out there i guess im just venting but do you ever look at these situations and think wtf  do i need money this badly our system is jacked up,jqsha9
974,"If you have to do things against your will everyday, you aren't in a position to call anyone a loser.",its so strange to me when people who give up their lives to work mostly doing things they would rather not be doing try to make me feel bad for my refusal to do so by calling me a loser in my opinion if your entire life revolves around doing things against your will then you havent in anyway won so you have no right to call someone else to chooses an alternate lifestyle a loser im not saying people who work are losers i think everyone has the right to live how they want but i certainty dont think wage slaves are in a position that is higher than a person who just chooses to chill and lead a calm work free life   whats even stranger to me is how many people refuse to accept that they do not live in free countries i dont understand especially here in america why everyone is so obsessed with lying about being free most people have literally no say in the fact that they will have to live their lives in a particular way in order to earn money i dont get why people have to be do dramatic about it to the point of straight up lying   all countries operate under capitalism a system that requires you to take part in it at threat of death your country isnt special you arent free to make a decision on your lifestyle for the most part you will definitionally be taking part in capitalism or suffering due to lack of full person hood lying to yourself about living in a free country wont change this no matter how much propaganda you force feed yourself and others why lie is it some sort of defense mechanism they have i cant imagine refusing to understand what words mean in order to defend my country being something it isnt   like its okay that were not free thats why many of us are fighting but lying about it just seems beyond irrational to me it always seems like the people who preach the most freedom propaganda hate freedom the most they are usually people who literally will tell you to my your face that they believe laziness if grounds for starvation if you think that then you cannot also claim to like freedom freedom has a meaning and it does not include making people live in a certain way or else thats literally the opposite,jrpg52
975,I feel obligated to make my 'free time' efficient and it's exhausting,im sat here this evening absolutely exhausted and dejected i started working at my first job 6 years ago and here i am all this time later still pounding out each day and ending up anxious belittled and fed up broadly i feel like i have a task list as long as my arm each day that i get in and i sit in a chair like im chained there slogging through it and crossing things off crossing things off crossing things off that list until it gets to 5pm   the thing is i have a lot of hobbies i enjoy i like cycling painting reading gaming collecting records discovering new music collecting comic books i have so much i want to diwht my life and time and i cant do i just cant i have no time to express myself at all so the few meagre moments i get i started making lists again like spreadhseets just like work lists of books of tv shows of games of models to paint places to cycle my whole life is checkboxes and all the enjoyment of gone   i want it to end i hate being demeaned made to feel like im the office villain for asking for better pay and conditions like im in a workhouse,jr6qn2

981,"Employer makes fun of me for requesting that he put on a mask, I quit",i walked out of my pizza delivery job last night because the restaurant owner made fun of me for asking if he could put on a mask the guy walked in and ive never met him before so i thought he was simply an ignorant customer i asked him politely if he happened to have a mask he pulled out a pack of cigarettes and said ive got my mask right here okay dude that doesnt even make sense i said would you mind getting a mask he said yes i would i quickly backed away because of course the guy was only three feet away from me speaking right in my face he smirked and gestured to one of my coworkers like whats with this guy i responded by stating did i am immunocompromised and catching coronavirus would likely mean my death still grinning he pointed to my mask and informed me that i am protected because of my mask the way he was grinning and the tone of his voice conveyed that he was deriving great pleasure from making fun of me of course i started shaking and decided to just leave on my delivery run and when i came back i would ask who this horrible customer was   when i returned to the restaurant i asked my colleague who informed me that it was the owner the owner are you kidding me i thought it was just an ignorant and unempathetic customer turns out its an ignorant and unempathetic owner putting his employees lives at risk and worse making fun of them for their vulnerabilities i turned to my manager and said i quit i announced loudly so our table of customers could hear what was going on i then went home and cried for 3 hours and submitted a complaint to a health board of some kind   if anyone would like to respectfully submit a comment to the owner in an attempt to change his mind i invite you to do so i would like to win him over on the idea of saving the lives of the vulnerable especially his own employees mannys downtown pizza in plymouth new hampshire,jqempx

986,Work's Toll on My Mental Health,this morning i woke up immediately angry and ready to throw and destroy things i ended up pacing around my apartment screaming my frustrations and probably scaring the neighbours in the process then i took a benzo to calm down and now im a grumpy zombie so i still wont be able to do my work properly today this wasnt the first time this happened and it surely wont be the last  this is no way to live and believe me my coping is better than it used to be ive been through therapy and was hospitalized for workinduced suicidal ideations and i used to frequently have to leave work because of debilitating anxiety attacks literally like convulsions i got fired from one job and my employer would not tell me why but i suspect it was because i made the mistake of admitting i have anxiety issues and panic disorder  im not built for this world but i have no idea what else to do except suffer for the next 50 years until i die theres no way ill be lucky enough to retire part of that is my own fault as i tend to spend a lot when i hate life and dont care to those who say start your own company and become your own boss that would be taking on levels of stress and risk that i could never mentally handle  on top of this for employee reviews we are always expected to give the impression we are ready for more responsibility and more work whereas truthfully im barely hanging on as it is preferably id like to stay in my current position and learn to deal with increasing amounts of stress in addition to wanting to gain more technical knowledge on the product i work on but of course being content in your current position is looked upon unfavorably to a corporation  the stress ive been through im also convinced has permanently damaged my cognitive functions i make little mistakes and slip ups all the time and misremember things a lot although it probably doesnt help that everything i work on is in a rush so i cant properly take my time on things anyway im a barely functional human and im consistently pushed to the limits which in turn stresses me out and causes even more mental degradation  the funny thing is i like this job more than any other job ive had and i still hate it  im so sick of this cycle but i dont see any other way no matter how well i learn to cope theres always going to be a part of me that despises this system and just existence in general at this rate if im lucky ill have a work induced stroke by 35 and finally get out of this shit,jrlv7d

991,The Best Job I Ever Had (Story),a while back i posted about a job i had for years that was absolutely awful for which im actually in therapy  thought id share the opposite and tell you about a job i loved i know right  let me be clear i loved this job because i had to do very little and it made me feel extremely cool  in 2015 i got a job at sea world in san diego i know many of you will have feelings about that organization but bear with me  the first job i had there was in admissions id stand at the front gates take peoples tickets have them do the dumb little thumb scan and let them in after a while they had me working in the parking payment booth  i fucking hated it  after a few months i had an opportunity to apply for the job i actually wanted as a narrator in the education department i got the job did the training and started working  heres what a typical day would look like clock inget todays schedule go to an animal exhibit id been scheduled for sharks pinnipeds beluga whales etc talk on the microphone for 5 minutes chat with guests and answer animal questions until another big crowd arrived rinse and repeat for 6090 minutes until someone came to take over do the same thing at the next scheduled exhibit take a break do more of the talking thing for 2 hours lunch work break work go home  employees are given 2 15minute paid breaks and a 30 minute unpaid lunch   heres the kicker our department did everything on halfhour increments so 15minute breaks became 30minute breaks and our 30 minute unpaid lunch was really an hour half of which was paid we would clock back in and just sit back down because we had nowhere to be for another half an hour wed just sit around and chill in the outdoor employee area just outside the employee cafeteria where theyd sell food at cost 2 for a cheeseburger that costs 12 in the park sure thing  the only part i really considered work was the narrations which we wrote ourselves that means i only really worked about 2 hours of the day in total for an 8 hour shift aside from that i was either shooting the shit with my coworkers behind the scenes or talking about animals which is my favorite thing to do anyway  another huge bonus was the uniforms all of the customer service related jobs involved wearing these ugly buttondown shirts with horrible patterns on them our uniforms black pants or shorts and a blue tshirt that said zoological operations on the back  made me feel like a rockstar   we were also the only department that had contact with guests that were allowed to wear sunglasses  id have done that job until i died if not for 2 things they were pretty much only parttime 3 eighthour shifts a week or 4 sixhour i left that job because i moved to seattle to start a new life  the irony is not lost in me that the best job i ever had involved very little work but thats kind of the point right,jqt53r

1012,Death by corporate!,remember  when you were young and a new day dawned the adventures of the day  were awaiting you there were no limits and everything was yours to  explore nobody told you what to think believe or do or so you  thought you still had to go sleep brush your teeth wash yourself eat  your food and do your homework whenever your parents told you so you  had a nice childhood and your parents let you dream they were never too  concerned with what you would do in life as long as you were happy you  thought their message was genuine but now you know it was self  preservation they never knew how society really functioned they hated  the game but some part of them still wanted part in that game a bit of  recognition to their efforts if you scream loud enough that money does  not bring happiness even if you dont believe it a part of you will  believe it you picked up on the dissatisfaction nagging at the edges of  their existence not consciously but eventually it spilled over into  the conscious as well you never noticed their struggle with poverty  because to a child poverty is an unknown concept you were creative and  you realize now that as long as you are creative you are not poor and as  long as you can dream you are rich you were the richest little child  in existence do you remember  as  you were made to slowly fit the mold you would fight it more and more  what were they trying to push you into do you remember how you fought  it do you still have that fight in you  almost  nobody escapes the mold and our dreams are replaced by their dreams  their dreams become our dreams by the time you were done with high  school you fitted the mold perfectly you promised your parents you  would bring them riches they would have it all everything they were  never able to give you you would bring them so they could finally be  happy marvel at the beauty in the world was replaced with the question  of how someone else was able to have more matter under their control  than you how did they do that why is it not mine if you would have  been a person of low self esteem you would have believed that these  things were never your right to begin with anyway you are not a person  of low self esteem you are a disciplined and all that riches will be  yours  although you made many  mistakes you did pay attention to your parents like the illiterate  school teacher they taught you something they never really seemed to  grasp themselves but maybe knew was there a possible journey towards  discovering the real value of things at this point in your young mind  you did not pay attention to any of that though what counted is social  standing and money the most impressive human beings had in your mind  tons and tons of money money is the benchmark of success and service in  society right  you kept doing  well your parents were probably proud but you didnt care anymore if  they were proud or not it became a whole different beast altogether  competition more money than your parents or siblings or friends is not  important anymore if you want more money than your boss but wait who  is this person with the big mansion on the hillside that should be me  me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me  ampx200b  ampx200b  ampx200b   meme  ampx200b  ampx200b  ampx200b  you  became a meme a meme toxic to its host you looked up to the  programmers the accountants the lawyers the neurotic people in suits  soon you became one of them yourself granted you thought you just got  very lucky so lucky to score that prestigious corporate job for that  big famous company you did not even need to tell people what you did  you just told them who you worked for who owned your dreams and they  would respect you it was great the first year as you did not need to  dream for yourself anymore your bank account always had a nice amount  of money sitting in it for you to spent on whatever you pleased and you  liked yourself in a suit  slowly  it started eating away at you as you climbed the ranks and made  friends within the machine the higher you get the more you have to  dream their dream even when you sleep you dream of it your weekends  you dream of it your free time you dream of it you are becoming it  management becomes your social circle and you hang out with them around  their large backyard pools when the wives are inside with the children  they talk to you about that chick that they fucked you play along  because you are good at it the only topics you talk about is your job  infidelity and golf  for 15 long  years you climb but it is never enough and you never seem to get there  it is always out of reach and no promotion is ever enough no raise is  ever enough the authority that comes with it is boring and empty that  new car feels fantastic the first month you drive it and after that you  loathe traffic all the same  you  remember the little child that was inside of you full off hopes and  dreams you tried to kill that child but you failed and from time to  time you feel it in your periphery a quiet sob life becomes evermore  unbearable your friends start slipping as the political climate changes  and mistakes are laid bare not you though you were always just one  big lie too lazy for infidelity too tired to be unscrupulous as life  starts losing its meaning you start to experiment with chemical  motivation the options are unlimited but not much has been tested  then  something inside of you starts to stir and tries to resist your actions  but you overpower it time after time you are a winner although at  this point you are not sure what that means anymore too tired to  change too chemically charged to stop and no courage to end it all end  it all  wake up  wake up   wake up   wake   up,jrcjrr

1025,My PTO may be getting cut in 2021. What are some legal/non-fireable ways to give the middle finger back?,i work a typical 95 though i really do 94 and ive been working from home since march due to the pandemic and probably not going back to the office any time soon  in mid2019 our parent company sold us to another parent company  in 2020 we kept our same pto accruals from the previous parent company and were able to roll over any 2019 pto into 2020  so this year 2020 i had a shit ton of pto   my normal 23 pto days for employees in the 310 years of employment range  1 floating holiday essentially another pto day  2 weeks of pto that i purposely saved from 2019 for my honeymoon in february 2020 which was was cancelled due to the pandemic  and since we cant roll anything over from 2020 to 2021 ive been using all of it  so barring my 2 weeks that i rolled over from 2019 my 2020 pto was essentially 24 days  but we just got our 2021 benefits and my pto is taking quite a hit  now ill get   14 pto days for employees in the 35 years of employment range   march will be my 5year anniversary and the 510 year amount is 16 days but i doubt theyll bump me up or give me another day since my 5year is partway through the year  3 floating holidays  10 sick days  so although that comes out to 27 days i can take off its really 17 pto days and 10 sick days  this kinda sucks because its tough to schedule sick days like pto because you generally use sick days the day of  and only 1 person on our team ever gets sick enough that he actually cant work even from home  so when do the rest of us have the opportunity to actually use them  we might not get sick all year  we did learn that the sick days are decided between the manager and their team with no need for a doctors note and our manager is pretty chill and agreeable  so one of my teammates and i are tossing around the idea of seeing if our team 3 guys  our manager can agree on a system to use mental health sick days like if one of us is feeling burnt out a particular week we all agree to give that person a day off that friday or whatever  that person uses a sick day but weve all known about it days in advance  however if we cant figure out something like that im losing a week of pto which sucks  so in that case what would be some legalnonfireable ways to give the middle finger back,jrtr5n

1030,"Productivity has increased 80+% since the 50s, automation is and has taken millions of jobs, yet the 4-day work week or less working hours is nowhere to be seen..why?",i wouldnt mind working if i was either to able to afford a actual life eg familyhouse or if it was less work eg only 4 days but most people nowadays doesnt matter if they have a masters or high school degree still work 95 commutewhy  95 is not 95 its not especially if you live in the middle of nowhere and have to commute at least 1 hour if not 2 daily like i would have to after that your most productive and awake hours have been spend at work peak productivity ends at 14 pm and you are left with spending your last 23 hours eating getting ready for the next day or just doing chores and a bit of mindless entertainment since you are still in the decompressing phase and most of the time will not be able to fully engage in something actually thoughtful  why do we not have less work hours amp more pay yet big tech companies have tested it out and it literally makes productivity skyrocket while still making the workers very happy,jqu4d4

1032,Part-time Work,hello  ive been working parttime only just started a few days ago and have been experiencing and thinking about certain things regarding parttime work and wanted to see if others had similar experiencesthoughts ive had the same thoughts and issue with previous jobs as well  want to start by saying that this isnt meant to be a post about how parttime is as bad a fulltime i am massively sympathetic to fulltime workers parttime is a lot better but still it doesnt fix the problems with workwork culture  though i only work parttime i spend a lot of the time worrying and dreading going back of course this is a big issue with fulltime work too but i find that even in parttime and less serious roles that issue is still there especially when the job is miserable  also often when working parttime they just spread the hours so whilst you do work a lot less hours your day is still essentially occupied by work because you have to prepare for work and it renders much of the day useless for hobbies or other activities  anyone else feel similar about parttime work and have similar experiences  thanks,jrscvc

1034,Retail during Covid and part-time work,hello  i posted a few days ago about starting a new job and how i dont feel grateful for the job though people tell me i should be here is the posthttpswwwredditcomrantiworkcommentsjotj2lbeinggratefulforajobduringcovid  the colleagues have so far been friendly the general work atmosphere is fairly laid back at least by retail standards however at the end of the day im still paid minimum wage and doing a customer facing job checkout where people do not follow the proper covid protocol   what makes this worse is that behind the scenes it is impossible to socially distance from other colleagues and hence none basically do i dont blame them for this but as someone with ocd and other issues this is fucking horrible for me   im only part time about mid 20 hours a week 4 days on 3 off granted this is much better than fulltime i could not cope doing fulltime  however i wanted to say that whilst parttime is a lot better its not a full answer to the problem if the job is miserable its still miserable and you spend much of the time off worrying about going back   also often they just spread the hours so whilst you do work a lot less hours your day is still essentially occupied by work because you have to prepare for work and it renders much of the day useless for hobbies or other activities  this isnt meant to be a post about how parttime is as bad a fulltime i am massively sympathetic to fulltime workers parttime is a lot better but still it doesnt fix the problems with workwork culture  anyone else feel similar about parttime work and have similar experiences   ampx200b  thanks,jrs7h6

1039,Decided to call in sick today,another rantvent plus an update to my condition as i described in my previous post sorry if this ended up too long     im not feeling well today so i decided to call in sick and not coming to work fortunately i was able to go home and preparing myself to go to hospital the doctor diagnosed my with gerd in addition to exhaustion from working too much and suggested me to rest for few days before returning to work     i regret that i only contacted hr when i called in sick i should have contacted my boss and superior too however i forgot to do that since i was only focusing on my own health back at the hospital resulting in my boss and superior asking me to submit my daily report i told them that i didnt come today and probably for few days as suggested by doctor and fortunately they listened and replied get well soon at least i can catch some break     until just now when i was about to go to sleep my boss contacted me again asking if i already well enough to come tomorrow since he needs help on preparing some presentation material and stuff again i replied that my doctor insisted me to rest and not touching my job until i fully recover and politely refuse his request because of those reasons i was afraid he would force me to to the work from home but luckily thats not the case this is despite i sent my doctor note to him and others which stated that i need few days to recover     see the problem is that he keep piling one task after another on me recently i was supposed to do lab work at most but he thoughts that he hired me for something higher so he asked me to make a daily report on the ongoing production process at the factory every day and he asked me to finish the report during the time when i still havent even finished with my lab work which is also an important task and my supposed job here     another thing is he will sometimes tasks me on some rnd stuff which is beyond my knowledge and other stuff there was a time when i was asked to redo some inspection on rejected goods even after the other worker just finished the inspection and submitted the result just to make sure oh and there are one other instance when i was asked to come on saturday and sunday because of urgent things that needs to be done  already consulted to my parents some coworkers doctor and therapist and the conclusion is i am indeed unsuited for working at factory environment however i cant just ragequit because of the reason i stated before hence why im trying to keep coming to work in spite of everything until today where i just cant force myself because i cant keep up anymore i even experienced panicconfusion attack few days ago because i was dreading work and i felt a sudden fearnervousness of coming the next day which worried my parents and they did their best to calm me down     i dont know what to say anymore and i dont know what will happen later nor i want to think about it i just want to rest my mind and i hope i can quit from working faster and safe,js9g0u

1046,"""Just find another job""",i get the sentiment a lot usually it doesnt matter what job im at theyre doing something incredibly frustrating that all the workers know isnt morally right      and its always the same that doesnt sound acceptable you should find another job from others       i ended up getting like a 15 settlement from a class action lawsuit at one 5 years after i had already left         i think its a common thing fuck employees over thousands of dollars on their paychecks every year until legal action is collectively involved pay employees 15 and lawyers get a mil or 2 its just how it runs nowadays                 im not sure if others realize how hard it is to find work that treats their employees as human       there has not been one job ive been at that had rules you could actually follow all of them had contradictory rules where you could easily find yourself having to choose which one to break to complete the task and continue to get yelled at weekly for it employees just accepted this and were always prepared to get scolded every week  they tried pointing out the flaws of the system and the employer would see their point but then nothing would change so they got tired of it and would just see getting yelled at as part of the broken system           its all just a circus,jqzu0c

1051,“There’s just not enough hours in the day”,its a pretty common sentiment people lament not having enough time to spend time with family having down time doing housework participating in hobbies and running errands they have to squeeze a lot of that stuff into two days of the week oftentimes making those days stressful instead of relaxing   most of the time i see it said in a lighthearted manner like a food blog giving you tips on meal prepping here is how i plan and cook my meals every sunday because im just so busy the rest of the week    most of those people dont even realize that the problem is probably their jobs taking 812 hours of their day i mean they know its their job and sometimes they even acknowledge it but they dont see it as a problem for some reason   sunday night thoughts ,jmdd3w

1062,"Mirror, mirror on the wall: Who is the worst ""LinkedIn Influencer"" of them all?",hey guys hope youre all doing well and staying safe this is a throwaway account because i dont want to be identified and traced back for professional reasons warning rant coming up  the answer to the question posed above is jonathan tesser im sure you guys have seen him floating around on linkedin the whole vp of insights amp analytics thing at nyc amp co the career whisperer for young professionals dude but why ill tell you about my friends experience with him not only does he post shitty condescending crap on his linkedin he is a narcissist that makes passive aggressive comments about people and insults them  a couple days ago one of my friends called me crying they had just gotten off the phone with him after they talked about a potential internship opportunity doing some marketing thing they eventually want to go into a more technical field and currently have 2 other gigs going on more closely related to the long term career path they want to go down engineering and data science after asking a couple questions about the position my friend decides the project isnt right for them and politely tries to decline saying that they want to go into a different field instead of marketing perhaps they could recommend someone that might be more interested they also mention that theyd have to split up their time between their current internship and his project if they were to work for him he gets mad at this statement and says that wouldnt be possible what the fuck how else are you supposed to pay the bills does he know that 15 an hour for 2025 hours a week doesnt cover living expenses anyway usually employers say okay move on to the next candidate this person wasnt the right fit for the project   this guy gets angry as fuck and literally blows up on them he says and i quote heres some constructive feedback you know i know youre a young professional and all but you mentioning x field makes it come off as if youre saying youre too good for the project you really shouldnt say that to someone of my stature then he proceeds to dangle the fulltime offer in front of them saying stuff like you know my original plan was to have you on as an intern and bring you on full time which i have the power to do but i guess thats not possible anymore next time you should just say you arent interested in the project  did they literally not just tell you that they werent interested in your stupid project how the fuck is a young professional telling you about their long term career trajectory offensive to you so what if they want to do something different than marketing furthermore your title as vp of insights amp analytics indicates your responsibility and wisdom its not a fucking weapon you can use to terrorize young professionals and threaten to blacklist them why is he even acting like nyc amp co is some prestigious company to work for anyway young grads would rather work for companies like amazon google goldman sachs mckinsey whatever but guess what this isnt even the worst part he then goes on and makes a passive aggressive post about their conversation on his public profile with 80000 followers saying that young professionals these days dont appreciate new opportunities its not a good look wasnt he the one that said my friend splitting up their time between their current work and his project wouldnt be possible and he wouldnt want that then he proceeds to talk shit with all his other colleagues and its obvious hes talking about my friend saying shit like this literally happened to me today i cant believe people dont appreciate my efforts to help them so let me get this straight  my friend turned you down because they want to go down a different path and you proceed to belittle mock insult and imply that youll blacklist them pull away the fulltime offer during a fucking pandemic where fresh grads are already struggling and then make a petty public post about your private conversation with them   what makes me angry is that my friend is way too fucking nice to stand up for themselves or say no to people this weird ass dude tried selling them his analyst program when they first met that doesnt actually teach you anything no technical coding shit or anything it supposedly teaches you how to communicate effectively as a data analyst he called them things like mistermissy as well this makes me mad because he literally doesnt know my friend already has it hard enough as it is theyre a lowincome first gen person of color the child of immigrant parents they also have a hard time with selfconfidence and really asserting themselves in the workplace my friend literally told me they just thanked him for his constructive criticism and ended the call   its already fucking hard enough breaking into the industry as a fresh grad during a goddamn pandemic not to mention my friend already struggles with their confidence just for a douchebag like this guy to shit all over them and threaten blacklisting them its just so disheartening to see something like this happen after ive seen them try and grow out of their shell for so many years and just when theyve begun to branch out something like this happens i did my best to try and reassure them that this interaction wasnt their fault its his ive spoken to a couple of my other friends that go to the same school and guess what this isnt even the first time this has happened whenever someone disagrees with this guy or gives constructive criticism he threatens to blacklist them and wields his title around like its some sword he can use to ruin young professionals careers just because they dont bend to his will other people that want to do data science have warned me about what a douche he is but after hearing my friends story and listening to them cry for hours because he literally destroyed their confidence about what they want to do makes me fucking furious does he even know how many therapy sessions my friend has attended to build the confidence to go out there and face the job search with a brave face does he know how hard my friend has had to struggle to get where they are today recovering from narcissistic abuse and trauma from their parents i have literally watched my friend struggle and cry about difficult courses paying rent on time dealing with anxiety about the future competing with their peers pleasing their parents and whatnot then again i wouldnt expect a narcissistic fuckface like him to understand these challenges  young professionals are nave and still figuring things out yes but theyre not your fucking punching bag that you can just take your anger out on when they put their foot down and disagree with you theyre just as deserving of respect as anyone else  hey jonathan if youre reading this you mr potatohead looking fuck i suggest you stop threatening to blacklist young professionals especially female  firstgen  lowincome students from the industry word spreads quickly and you will find that this is a small world  people find out about these interactions one way or another and if i ever see you on the streets of new york ill fucking clock you  tldr jonathan tesser not only does he make shitty linkedin posts a portion of them are petty posts about actual people on top of that he tries to sell everyone his weird ass analyst program finally when you disagree with him he threatens to blacklist you on top of mocking and belittling you,jo2gg0

Team Director didn't even say bye to me lol.,hi all first time posting here using a throwaway even though ive been following this subreddit for a really long time as the title says i resigned from my job last month and been living off savings since then not sure how much longer i can go on for   im 27 yo and every single job ive ever had i end up quitting my mind cant fucking take it its waking up starting at a screen all day come home with no time to do anything and mentally fucking exhausted have dinner sleep and repeat i always put in my best and try to add as much value to the team as possible i have a long history of depression and anxiety and the only way i can see myself ever working in that same environment again is getting heavily medicated and be so mentally out of it that id need to be put in a bs position where i dont really do anything but stare at a wall but then what is the point of living like that thatd be 40 hours a week of feeling miserable and useless  i just resigned from my job after only 2 months and i am absolutely done with working in corporateoffice environments i got a really great offer with high salary and benefits but after i think the second week i realised i was in hell it was just impossible to do this i was starting to drink a lot after work just to cope because the feeling of sleeping and knowing i was gonna wake up to the same fucking routine every day was some of the worst pain ive ever had i mustered the courage and i told them i was gonna take time off and do something else so i gave them 2 week notice and my last day was mid last month big boss didnt even talk to me after that    ampx200b  i dont ever want to see another fucking excel or powerpoint sheet ever again not one more bs team meeting not one more fun team dayoff where we have to do team building exercises we have all become slaves to this system that is giving us the bare minimum to just be able to have food and shelter i had a very good salary compared to most of the people but what is the point it is impossible to buy an apartment or a house where i live so only option is to move the fuck out of here and commute 1 hr to work every morning and 1 hr to work every night i would forever be renting paying some fucking bald boomer 50 of my salary for a small 1 bedroom place for myself while hes chilling in the caribbean drinking all day while adding absolutely no value to anything can someone explain to me what this world has become where do we all go from here,jnlkth

1155,Doesn't capitalism require the bottom to suffer in order to hold the system up?,so im working on a project and what ive noticed about the capitalist system is that it depends on people being ranked lower in society  grocery store workers janitors cashiers restaurant workers etc are literally the backbone of capitalism my argument is that capitalism causes and encourages poverty more people on the bottom are more people to profit on however a lot of people say it helps poverty rates am i missing something  i also think this can apply to education as more people acquire a college level higher rank in society education it creates a dropping value for a college level education therefore lowering that persons rank seeing someone with a degree working for minimum wage or a minimum wage job isnt that rare now a days   in conclusion if more people start acquire a higher salary or more qualifications the bar is raised higher because the system cant sustain that many higher ranking people before their salaries drop  it seems almost impossible to have everyone earning a high wage 100k under capitalism higher wages just means prices will increase making the 100k people be on the bottom rung  anyone have thoughts i havent found that much info in favor of my opinion   ampx200b  btw i did post this on another sub first ,jnr0j0
