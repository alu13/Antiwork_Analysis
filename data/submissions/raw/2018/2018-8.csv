1,“Jobs” are just more debt that banks use to profiteer from!,"Fiat currency and the way the elite/banks/corporations actually turn profits from debt are relatively well known concepts these days. 

I’m fairly certain at this point that whatever word magic was used to create the whole system also now applies to jobs. 

Even supposed “well paying” jobs [Careers TM; as they’re referred to in The King’s English] don’t actually create or produce anything of value and rarely fulfill a purpose with any measurable result. 

“Jobs” basically exist nowadays as a column in a spreadsheet that accountants use only as a means to derive profit (think interest, bonds, investments).

3,"I want to quit the corporate life, but feel awful about it.","Hi all. As you can see in my post history, I’ve written a lot about my unhappiness in my current job. I’ve done everything I can the past month or so to look for a new job in a different field, something that would suit me better, yet haven’t landed anything. 

I can’t help but feel jaded with the whole process at this point, of dealing with corporations, and being tied to them to be able to survive. I don’t want a cushy corporate job anymore. I know this for a fact. However, I’d feel awful about quitting it because of my father payed for almost 90% of my college degree. It was a very expensive, degree, too, and I’m very lucky he supported me in it. So I feel very conflicted about this issue. I know what kind of a lifestyle I’d like to pursue, continuing with my side gig of serving and possibly dancing, as well as starting work as a nanny, and I know I could make good money with these pursuits, but guilt holds me back from doing it. 

Guilt for not adhering to a “business woman” stereotype like my dear father always wanted me to be. Guilt because he paid and sacrificed so much to get me through college. Guilt because he wants me to be stable but I hate the “stable” 9-5 life and I’m already disappointing him by not adhering to my former religion. I want to give back to my father and mother and make them happy but I feel this would be taking it a step too far. Especially seeing I’m from a traditional work-oriented background. Does anyone have any advice for me?",False,98wj7t,throwaway5673217,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/98wj7t/i_want_to_quit_the_corporate_life_but_feel_awful/,27,31

15,Nietzsche on work,"&gt;Oh, this moderation in ""joy"" of our cultured and uncultured classes!  Oh, this increasing suspiciousness of all enjoyment!  Work is winning over more and more the good conscience to its side: the desire for enjoyment already calls itself ""need of recreation,"" and even begins to be ashamed of itself.  ""One owes it to one's health,"" people say, when they are caught at a picnic.  Indeed, it might soon go so far that one could not yield to the desire for the vita contemplative, (that is to say, excursions with thoughts and friends), without self contempt and a bad conscience.  Well!  Formerly it was the very reverse: it was ""action"" that suffered from a bad conscience.  A man of good family concealed his work when need compelled him to labour.  The slave laboured under the weight of the feeling that he did something contemptible: the ""doing"" itself was something contemptible.  ""Only in otium and bellum is there nobility and honour:"" so rang the voice of ancient prejudice!

19,So what do we do about it?,"Just found this sub. Love it. But all of the posts I see are just propagating discussion over the problem.

My question is what do we do about it? Everyone's situation and goals are different so I'm not looking for a one size fits all answer. The world is the way it is. I suppose we could start a movement... but don't expect our culture to change in our lifetime. A good amount of jobs out there HAVE to get done or the infrastructure we live in will crumble. i.e. ""Someone's got to do it"". But that someone can be some other brainwashed worked who thrives on exchanging his best years for a wage.

Still though - if you have no job, you've got no income. How then do you continue your way of life? Or, how do you alter it to be sustainable?

There are groups like /r/financialindependence and /r/simpleliving out there that discuss their own strategies, but financial independence entails hustling and grinding for a good 15+ years before you can live off of your savings and simple living may or may not be the answer depending on where you live and your situation... and you could very well not be interested in either as a solution to our ""anti-work"" predicament.

23,The reason why I'm so passionate about separating work from life.,"Hi guys, I joined this sub a little while ago and have really been loving it so far. I wanted to.get a little personal with you all about the reason why I'm even here and why I have the views and attitude that I do towards jobs.

Just to give you folks a little background, I am a 20 year old junior in College who believes that a job is absolutely nothing more than just a method of making money. It is not your life, it is not what defines you, and it does not set your worth. 

Basically from the time I was born up to when I was 17 years old, I was a VERY all around joyous guy. I just loved life. Ask ANYBODY and they'll tell you, ""John (my name) you're always smiling!"" 
""John I love how much you laugh!""
""John everytime I see you, you just make me feel better""
""John you're always so happy!""

Honestly, I really was just a happy guy. If I ever did get sad about something, I'd get over it in literal minutes. Life was just full of light. 

*NOTE, this next section I'm about to share with you all is something I NEVER talk about b/c I like to act as if just never happened due to how traumatizing it is. But for the sake of this post, I'll share some of the details*

 But, when I turned 18 years old, EVERYTHING started to become dark. Everything. 
The main reason for this is that I got my first ""big boy"" job (that label is such bullshit btw, a job is a job), and thought this was a huge accomplishment in life. I thought I was on my way to ""making it"" in life because I got a better paying job. As a result, I based all of my happiness on this job and saw it as who I was. That's the norm in society anyway, I was finally able to ""fit in"". 
Go me!
This job was everything to me
I saw my co-workers as my FRIENDS, I could ""trust them"". 
The supervisor was always right too! Nobody should dare to question her! She ""cared"" about me because I was a ""proud employee""!

Well, every single time I went home I let everything that happened at that job get to me. I was no longer John, I was employee # ______ (I thankfully forgot that cursed number). My co-workers who I thought were my friends all started to talk behind my back and just see me as another pair of hands, not John. 
And you know what they were right, whoever that person was, that was not me. I sacrificied my life to a job thinking that this was it and that work always came first, no matter what. 
And no matter how well I tried to do, the ""higher-ups"" at that job always found something to scold me about.
I became depressed for the first time in my life. The guy who was notorious for constantly smiling and lifting up people around him was now having increasingly darker &amp; darker thoughts until they became suicidal.
I felt worthless. At that job I was nothing, and outside of it I had no life. My life was the job. I had stopped loving my passions and the things that used to hold real value, I just felt empty. All of the time.
At the time I didn't understand why, I just thought this was ""growing up"" and I should be proud that I was so devoted to that job. 

What a fucking fool I was.

It wasn't until that same supervisor I ""loved"" terminated me after I worked there for a year (because I called in due to a severe stomach ache) that I finally opened my eyes. It's a day I'll never forget, July 15th 2017. That's when I started the process of becoming myself again. 
I used to get TERRIFIED at the thought of losing that job, yet when it happened, I felt fine. I felt perfectly fine. As each day passed, I felt happier, and happier, and happier, until I finally realized that feeling I constantly had before July 15th was depression. The real deal.
 The thing that I thought would never happen to me. When I fully realized what had happened to me, I sat down and just thought very hard 
Thought about the TRUE cause of it, and how to NEVER lose myself like that again. 

The biggest revelation I came to was that a job is NOT my life. It's NOT who I am.
My life is literally EVERYTHING OUTSIDE of that place. I rediscovered my passions, my values, and who I AM. I became myself again. 
And stopped letting a place I'm only at to make money actually have any meaningful  control over my life.
I stopped putting any real emotions and care into jobs and everybody there. Because to them, I'm just a tool. They'd never admit it, but I don't care if they do or not b/c I know the truth. 
It was these realizations that I made that saved my life and allowed me to become myself again. It's been over a year since this has happened and everything is still awesome,  the job I've worked since then has had absolutely NO effect on me b/c of what I just mentioned. 
I learned to revolve my life around my life, and not some hellhole I don't even be at in the first place.
 I get my money and GO, because I've got a life to live.

26,What would you do if you really didn't have to work anymore?,"I'm asking here because I think that you all have probably thought about this way more than I have, and my life is kind of in a tail spin right now.

I'm early forties and I don't have to work. I was let go from my job last year due to the department closing, but I was encouraged to come back as a fill in at the main hospital. I decided that I am too old to be working a mix of nights and days, full time some weeks no time others and at the whim of everyone else.

I had always made about 3 times what my husband made, so my working was essential to having a fair to good standard of living. But due to wage stagnant in my profession and a huge raise for him over the past few years he now makes enough to cover the necessities.

His job is something that he would do even if he didn't get paid, he just loves it even on the hard days. Mine was a sacrifice I made to get the money I wanted. So we decided that I don't have to work if I don't want to.

I don't know what to do with myself anymore. I didn't realize how much of my self worth was tied to my job. I see every help wanted sign as a prod to be productive, but the wages offered are an insult.

What reading material, podcast, YouTube channel or whatever can you recommend to change my perspective. I need a wake up call that says ""stop feeling sorry for yourself and take advantage of this rare and wonderful opportunity""

Sorry if this sounds all humble braggy or insults people still stuck in the struggle, but I did work hard for many years and if I didn't have an equal partner with whom I have always shared everything I would not be in this position.

32,Just had a great vacation,"Seriously. Not that I traveled anywhere and stuff. Just went home to my folks and my good friends. Earlier summers I've had some work days here and there and no uninterrupted vacations. This time my horizon just consisted of time that I could spend doing whatever, for the first time since I was much younger. And that's what I've done--socializing, went to some hikes in my area, helped my friend moving some shit after a social event, fishing in the ocean and just gave it away to people who wanted it. I've been pretty poor due to my vacation but I've been spending very little money.

Man, vacations are really awesome. I've never felt healthier, more complete, more emotionally secure. I've been sleeping like baby, active, creative, more sure of my identity and had better and more fulfilling connections with people. I've come to realize that capitalism actually robs workers of this natural vitality and turns it into profit, leaving us sick, damaged and miserable. Seriously, extracting profit from our health. Why should it be considered a vice to demand more leisure? I thought the whole point of technology was to give us more free time to just be human beings. We seriously need to fight for its abolition as soon as possible, so that living, loving, hoping, dreaming, feeling human hearts all over the world don't have to be churned through this alienating grinder.
