5,"Jerome K. Jerome on work, from “Three Men in a Boat”","&gt; It always does seem to me that I am doing more work than I should do. It is not that I object to the work, mind you; I like work: it fascinates me. I can sit and look at it for hours. I love to keep it by me: the idea of getting rid of it nearly breaks my heart.

&gt;You cannot give me too much work; to accumulate work has almost become a passion with me: my study is so full of it now, that there is hardly an inch of room for any more. I shall have to throw out a wing soon.

&gt;And I am careful of my work, too. Why, some of the work that I have by me now has been in my possession for years and years, and there isn't a finger-mark on it. I take a great pride in my work; I take it down now and then and dust it. No man keeps his work in a better state of preservation than I do.
But, though I crave for work, I still like to be fair. I do not ask for more than my proper share.

&gt; But I get it without asking for it - at least, so it appears to me - and this worries me.",False,8jyj4i,The_Ebb_and_Flow,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/8jyj4i/jerome_k_jerome_on_work_from_three_men_in_a_boat/,2,12

21,Trying to find an article about ‘hard work’.,"There was an anarchist website online (I want to suggest ‘bash back’ for some reason) saying that in reality people are working too hard, that it’s causing them serious health issues, or that hard work doesn’t bring wealth as common wisdom suggests. Eventually the owners closed down their website, but I’m sure that the article is available somewhere on archive.org. The trouble is, I have no clue what its name was. Does anybody know what I’m talking about?

If it’s of any help: I think that maybe some of the website’s background was pink or purple. Later it was yellow until the ’site disappeared. I think that it shut down in 2017.",False,8lq5xd,CentristsAreScum,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/8lq5xd/trying_to_find_an_article_about_hard_work/,1,21
