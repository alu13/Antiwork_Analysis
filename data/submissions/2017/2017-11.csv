8,"Searching for Info/Sources on Communities, Social Norms Throughout History","For a personal pet project of mine, I'm looking to gather information on societies that have incorporated any number of aspects that in our modern day U.S. late capitalist society we might be missing out on (hutterites communal ownership of goods, roman public baths and gardens, work-life balance in pre-industrial societies, the asian custom of removing one's shoes at the door http://asianlifestyledesign.com/2010/04/asian-custom-removing-shoes-at-door/, putting kid's accomplishments on the fridge with magnets, public libraries, anything that contributes to civil society and public interaction). Absolutely any social customs, cultural norms, public policies/institutions that people might see as adding value to human experience.
