Store Leader, PetSmart Empress Walk
'5095 Yonge StA3,

Toronto, ON M2N 624

2007-21-R United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW.
Canada), Applicant, v ETM Canada Corporation Responding Party

Dear Mrs.

As you are aware, on February 1%, 2022, UFCW Canada, filed an application for
certification on behalf of the workers at the PetSmart Located at 5095 Yonge St. We are
closely monitoring the workplace to confirm whether the employer is abiding by the
Ontario Labour Relations Act.

Ithas come to our attention that members of your management team have been
practicing intimidation and coercion in order to refrain employees from becoming union
‘members by introducing the possibility of the store closing down i the union certfcation
{goes through. Ths is clear act of intimidation

Under sections 70, 72, 76 of the Act, workers have the right to freely organize the
union, without interference from members of management or persons acting on behalf
‘of management. While an Employer is permitted to voice its opinion about unions, an
Employer is not permitted to question, harass, discriminate against, or intimidate
‘employees regarding the Union.

‘Abiding by this legislation, we request that the Employer provides a statement to the
workers reassuring them that there will be no store closure because of the certification
process. We strongly urge you to ensure that all members of management abide by the
Act and respect the righis of employees to freely discuss, join and participate in the
union. Failure to do so will result in the union being forced to fle charges of Unfair
Labour Practices against the Employer at the Ontario Labour Relations Board,

Sincerely, , yf
Laura Pefia
National Representative UFCW Canada.
