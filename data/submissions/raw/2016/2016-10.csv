11,Anti-work and ecological collapse,"I'm new to this sub, and I just wanted to share a few unqualified thoughts and provoke a discussion. Hopefully I don't step on any toes.

There is a mountain of evidence that we are facing an environmental catastrophe, and it is directly linked to our productivity. It is the things that we do that are filling the air with CO2 and the seas with plastic. Yet our productivity is worshipped at the same time, seen as essential, apparently more essential than living sustainably. 

People who are unemployed are castigated and punished, through the threat of hunger, and the social shame of using food stamps. Yet, it is the unemployed who are doing the least harm to the planet, on average, since they have the least income. They produce no toxic crap through their labor, and they consume less of it.

They are the enemy of the growth economy but the friend of the planet. Those people that don't buy a new TV every two years, or a new car every five, they are living more sustainably than the middle class family that recycles and only eats organic, since for every token gesture they make, they undo it a hundred times over with their annual vacation to Hawaii, their new kitchen, their endless consumption of toxic plastic that will leech into the earth for thousands of years to come.

There has to be a space given to the conscientious objector who cares for the planet, in fact, we have to start encouraging it, if we want our grandchildren to even be able to survive. 

To me, anti-work doesn't mean a rejection of effort or care, it means rejecting a system that cares only for it's own needs, that sees people as tools for short-term economic growth. Environmentalism cannot function within this structure, since it comes in direct conflict with the main aims of capitalism. 

It's all well and good funding renewable energy, and trying to make our lives a bit greener, but as soon as concern for the environment steps on the toes of capitalism, it's ignored, and if the issue was forced by protest, it would be beaten down. 

Work, for the majority of people, is the production and sale of stuff, and no one gives a shit if that stuff is worthwhile or meaningful, or if it's poisoning the planet. Refusing to work is refusing to consume, and it is the morally correct position, in the light of the horrific news that we read daily about the extremely precarious that we find our planet in.

18,An Argument For Work.,"You work that you may keep pace with the earth and the soul of the earth.
For to be idle is to become a stranger unto the seasons, 
and to step out of life's procession, that marches in majesty and proud submission towards the infinite.

When you work you are a flute through whose heart the whispering of the hours turns to music.
Which of you would be a reed, dumb and silent, when all else sings together in unison?

Always you have been told that work is a curse and labour a misfortune.
But I say to you that when you work you fulfil a part of earth's furthest dream, assigned to you when that dream was born,
And in keeping yourself with labour you are in truth loving life,
And to love life through labour is to be intimate with life's inmost secret.

But if you in your pain call birth an affliction and the support of the flesh a curse written upon your brow, then I answer that naught but the sweat of your brow shall wash away that which is written.

You have been told also that life is darkness, and in your weariness you echo what was said by the weary.
And I say that life is indeed darkness save when there is urge,
And all urge is blind save when there is knowledge,
And all knowledge is vain save when there is work,
And all work is empty save when there is love;
And when you work with love you bind yourself to yourself, and to one another, and to God.

And what is it to work with love?
It is to weave the cloth with threads drawn from your heart, 
even as if your beloved were to wear that cloth.
It is to build a house with affection, 
even as if your beloved were to dwell in that house.
It is to sow seeds with tenderness and reap the harvest with joy, 
even as if your beloved were to eat the fruit.
It is to charge all things you fashion with a breath of your own spirit,
And to know that all the blessed dead 
are standing about you and watching.

Often have I heard you say, as if speaking in sleep, ""He who works in marble, and finds the shape of his own soul in the stone, is nobler than he who ploughs the soil.
And he who seizes the rainbow to lay it on a cloth in the likeness of man, is more than he who makes the sandals for our feet.""
But I say, not in sleep but in the overwakefulness of noontide, that the wind speaks not more sweetly to the giant oaks than to the least of all the blades of grass;
And he alone is great who turns the voice of the wind into a song made sweeter by his own loving.

Work is love made visible.
And if you cannot work with love but only with distaste, it is better that you should leave your work and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with joy.
For if you bake bread with indifference, you bake a bitter bread that feeds but half man's hunger.
And if you grudge the crushing of the grapes, your grudge distils a poison in the wine.
And if you sing though as angels, and love not the singing, you muffle man's ears to the voices of the day and the voices of the night.",False,59dm31,triggermethis,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/59dm31/an_argument_for_work/,14,0

23,What are some of the key concepts of anti-work?,"If you were listening to an anti-work talk what are some of the key concepts you'd want introduced?

5) Anarchism
6) Technological Unemployment / Automation
