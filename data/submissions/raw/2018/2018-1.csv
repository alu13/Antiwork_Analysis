0,The whole bid for submission by current managerial values is based on almost one mistake: the confusion between working and fulfilling one's potential,"My contribution on r/antiwork, experimental ^^

i posted it originally on r/depression : 
https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7o31hp/is_work_really_accomplishing_potential/

I precise this was a point of view completely unrelated to depression and that I think that even when I'm okay. When I'm depressive, it's because this world is offering nothing aside eternal work. Saying that in order to avoid idiot linking antiwork to depression. Work is depression.

&gt;Dunno, it striked in my head, I just writed :
""The whole bid for submission by current managerial values is based on almost one mistake: the confusion between working and fulfilling one's potential""
Have it something right ? I'm speaking of course about the social way we are seeing work. In the way work as it is socially understood, is really one dimensionnal, like if somewhat every competency that humanity was able was separated in each individual, impacting view of life of each. We are always referencing to the quote ""work is tripalium"" and stuff in social term. Imo it's at least currently (while not in IA society :) ) a false idea to modify work, because while there is a hierarchy/domination, even from outside workforce (government manage work activities while work hierarchie = smooth/flat), there will be always some form of resistance finishing with creating new morality, new idea, and cutting off what work are mean to do : producing for surviving as a species.
Accomplishing your potential mean you use actually fun, you use imagination, you use discipline, you use your emotions, you use self control, you use your ability to introspect, you use your memory, perhaps ultimately a excellent work would be one that reflect the most the life wich all are actually living, meaning you have to use your memory in a global way, not being limited by artificial rule we are creating. A real work have part of actually not working, and not being managed for not working as it happen in homosexual company in silicon valley.
Isn't it a problem for those who are seeking actual accomplishment ? I don't mean forcibly extra uppa uda mega accomplishment, just for the stuff itself. There is ppl wich are actually working better in choosen activities / in hobby mode. Aren't you more concentrated in this place than in work ? I'm not saying that writing in reddit is a higher accomplishment than your work, probably not if you are in IT for example, but writing here require more completeness than doing 1 repetitive task for all the month there another one then another one...
The main problem with trying to submit ppl with moral (like in our typical managemental way of seeing the work world) is that it end with devaluing moral itself more than being in a complying/not complying problem",False,7ozd27,noaydi,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/7ozd27/the_whole_bid_for_submission_by_current/,4,8

5,Would you do your job if you did not need to have a job?,"If you did not need a job to live, would you be willing to do your job at all?

  I'm a teacher.  I like my job.  I don't think my particular school would exist as it is under any regime without mandatory work, but if it did, I think I'd still do it.  I'd still be willing to do a job like the one I have. 

My last job...Hell fucking no.  I had a class of ... difficult students.  Without coercive economics I doubt there would be many people both willing and able to help them.  I mean there aren't many with that.  OTOH, without coercive economics, I doubt half of them would have needed to be in a class like that.  Would the abused parents have stayed with their abusers?  Would the abusive parents have been abusive to begin with? Would the parents stressed by the choice between their work and children have to sacrifice their kids' needs in order to keep a roof over their heads?  Maybe if the answers were no, the kids who were left would have been tolerable enough, even fun. I dunno.

Edit:  perhaps I should rephrase:
Would you be willing to do the kind of work that you do if you didn't need to do it to survive?  Do you think anyone would?  Would your job even be necessary?",False,7t0ab9,betamaxforever,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/7t0ab9/would_you_do_your_job_if_you_did_not_need_to_have/,26,5

16,What would be ideal working time for you without completely abolishing work ?,"Imo : 

- 3 to 4 month vacation. We NEED long pause, this have to be understand. Ppl should be able to accomplish ambition outside their work, and be able to disconnect from work for real. We should accept too that some ppl need real disconnection wich sometime mean doing nothing for months. Week end are fake disconnect. You are generally not liked by other ppl because of the work you do, but because of your ability to accomplish something personnal (tested and approved, the most really interesting part of my life in term of accomplishment and contact with ppl was 1,5 year of unemployement doing music, organizing some event - Ive tested the contrary too : when I work, I lose all my friend, not speaking only about music, I become just an uninteresting zombie). If it's not everyone, it's for a part of the population, wich have to be taken into consideration. Aside this long pause, 5 to 8 week of vacation is preserved.

- 30 to 50 hours a week, even more, whatever : this don't matter for me if Ive 1). Choice need to be given thought for those who have families, or a life outside of work. I generally work 40 to 50 a week and the only real problem is the fact it will be always like that more than the fact I'm working over 35, but working over 35 can be an issue for those still not homosexual and wich are still trying to have a life while working.

- Retirement : optionnal, but given rigth. Some ppl will be okay with working in old age, some other would like to experience something other.

- No ""psychological"" obligation in work, you don't have to be happy to do something you don't like : modifying your emotion for someone is called relation of perversity. It's as if the worker was in constant contact with a narcissist. Forced compliance need to be abandonned.

- sabbatical year : the real disconnect
