3,Fresh to the job scene,i m currently looking for my first job  because of family obligations for most of my teen life i wasn t able to get a job because i had to be at home taking care of my siblings and maintaining the house  but now they ve gotten older and can look after themselves so that allows me to get a job  and wow  i am not a excited at all  i do not want to get a job at all  i love working and being active but the thought of getting paid almost nothing at some crappy job sounds scary and horrible  that s not living man    to end this off with a question  is it really possibly to make money off the things you love  the internet is a great place to start career but it seems like such an uphill battle  fighting for attention and all that ,k3vzqb

5,Being excited to get a new job seems awfully sad when you think about it.,my friend got a new job recently  we all were invited to dinner to celebrate  i thought the entire time  what are we celebrating   having a job is something i need to live  i spend hours of my day commuting  doing boring things i don t enjoy  tasks for other people  i get home when it s dark and have just enough time to get some food and think about going to work the next day    my typical day right now is getting up early in the cold  showering to wake up  doing the mundane morning routine then taking the commute to work  i get into the office  blinded by the fluorescent lights  i get some coffee and spend the first half of my day talking to people i don t really want to be spending my time with  the rest of the day is about spending all my energy on things for other people while checking how long is left before i get to go home   then we get old and retire  except now i have all that free time to enjoy but without the youthful energy i once had to enjoy it  that energy was spent working    it s all terribly depressing when you sit down and think about it  but i need that job to live  and p s  i hate when people tell me  do the job you love and you ll never spend a day in your life working again  because unless you can find me a job which allows me to lounge around some days  cuddle with my cat  watch some shows and have some light exercise then perhaps head outside  try new hobbies and travel  then sadly that job doesn t exist ,k3mhc7
6,Teaching High Schoolers,i'm a high school teacher  online  and spend about half my day with seniors  we have one 30 minute class with about 15 kids where the whole point is for me to check-in with them and make sure they're set up to graduate  being keenly aware of the state of things  it's really hard to be optimistic with them about the future  i know several of them will certainly go off and thrive doing something they love  but the rest are sure to be eaten up by the systems that be  that frightful hobgoblin will burn their world and enslave them to help burn it  they  for the most part  are aware of this as well  i think it's a misconception that young people are hopeful  young people need power to enact change    in the words of greta thunberg at the age of sixteen     we've had 30 years of pep-talking and selling positive ideas  and i'm sorry  but it doesn't work  because if it would have  the emissions would have gone down by now  they haven't  and yes  we do need hope  of course we do  but the one thing we need more than hope is action  once we start to act  hope is everywhere   i am often at a loss -- i usually just encourage them to dismantle systems of oppression and make art ,k33lb0
7,Why are people worried about robots stealing their jobs?,this is purely hipothetical  if robots are ever able to take over all or most of our jobs why would that be a bad thing  what would happen then  shouldn't everybody be free if that happens  i know it won't because capitalism and the rich have to make money somehow but damn there would really be no need for people to work then but i'm sure they still would  our society is sad ,k30bmi
8,Post Covid Work Culture/Stress for entry Level Associates (INDIA),as you all know  economy has been pretty rough since lockdown with many losing their jobs along with their life savings  this question is for those who were still left with their jobs but were working at an entry level for various companies in bangalore  how has been the work from home experience post lock down  also if you guys were called to work from office again  post your experiences here   how has the management been treating you  were they behaving same like before pre covid era  or were they resorting to threatening measures to get the work done  have you guys been working more  or put under more stress than before  also i would like to know some of the positive outcomes that work culture has bought for few people here post lockdown  the last point i want to know from the workforce here is that  do you think hr ever really listens to your concerns or problems  or they are just there to secretly take side with operations  management leaders  please note   this post is not for the senior level management people  including team leaders  because i know there is always a confirmation bias that would come out from this level of management  and i am not blaming them  it's inherited human nature to always prove their point of view that they are right  i am sure the upper level management is dealing with their own set of challenges  but trust me no one can deny the fact that the real productive work which gives an organization value  and brings in the profit is being done by the ones who are at bottom of the organization level  i am talking about junior level associates  analysts  programmers mis executives etc who actually sits for 10-16 hours a day and gives out the real productivity  i would love to hear their point of view  that's all ,k3c530

12,I just had one of the most depresing talks of my life,im spending the day at my parents house and my mother came to me to ask me how i was doing at college  we dont talk much about studies but i  almost  always try to be sincere with her  so i told her that i was getting super stressed out because of all the assignments from college  something thats getting worse because i hate my career more every day that passes  she then told me that this is what life is  and how my sister comes home super stressed from work most days and even crying a few times from the preasure his boss puts on her  she then put herself as example of the same as my sister and lastly told me how my father  the only one that enjoys is work in the family  has ridiculously long work hours that force him to work in weekends and stay till late most nights  she was going for the  life is hard  but u have to live it  approach  but has only managed to leave me desolated    i guess that if i had any hope in my future it may have helped me to get motivated  but what i didnt tell her is that lately the stress is becoming depression as i see my future darker every day  right now i just want to walk away from this place until my legs collapse  but i cant because im a prisioner of my own life  a life thats only going to get worse when i end college   p d  english is not my first language  sorry for any mistake,k3ajic
13,"My dream is to live free. I idolize buddha who found pure bliss while wandering and being “homeless”. It proves that wealth is a concept, that contentment is an idea.

16,Things I like and dislike about this sub,after getting downvoted heavily for making a fair point  imo  i wanted to wrap up what i think is good and bad about this sub    what i agree with   i initially came here because i have one of those boring office jobs that will tire you out till your brain gets drained completely  i know there are worse jobs out there and i know how hard it is for many to make ends meet at the end of the month  i do not have that problem and therefore am privileged    nevertheless i have every right to hate my job  hate company culture and corporate bullshit  i despise many aspects of capitalism and am deeply worried about how money accumulates and how 1  of the population owns 50  of the money land influence and so on  this is deeply flawed and it gets worse every day  this is why i joined r antiwork and this is what i agree with  if a company makes a surplus  people should benefit from it  not everyone contributed in the same way so it shouldn't be divided by the number of people but still there are limits to how much a person can actually contribute and therefore  earn  and right now  this balance is just ridiculous  we shouldn't let neoliberalism dictate how wealth is distributed and make sure that chances are fair for everyone   what i disagree with   many people in this sub seem to oversimplify  that just by distributing existing wealth  taking it from the rich  everyone can do whatever they want and follow their dreams  even if you took all the billionaires' money it wouldnt allow everyone to do their hobbies full time  this is just not how economy works  you want to be an artist and have society pay for your basic needs  so be it  but then everyone should be able to do so  all our blue collar workers included  this will dramatically increase the prices for those services and taking out your trash  building your street  growing your food and so on will be much more expensive because if given the chance most people would rather do anything else or at least not do their job for 40h a week    some of you might say that we just need to automatize jobs but there are limits to that too  in the us there is 1  of the gdp coming from agriculture  20  industrial and 79  is the service industry  you just can't automatize all of that and to be honest  i don't see that coming anytime soon   we could all have more time to spare for the things we love but that doesn't come with having the newest gadgets  a  big  car  your own property and so on  you can't have it all at once  because eventually someone will have to produce it for you  we are all dependent of contributing our part to have wealth as a society  unless we agree on lowering our standards  we will not be able to all do whatever we want all day  i am not talking about living in the woods  but still you would have to give up a decent amount of wealth in order to do so as a society and as far as i can tell  the vast majority is not willing to even sacrifice the tiniest bit of their wealth  so this is just not a realistic scenario   i would really wish for this thread to end in a constructive discussion  but i guess that people will downvote the s it out of this thread ,k3zj84

Is it possible to find a job that is just looking for an employee to fulfill their role?,i looking at job postings right now  and every job is looking for someone who goes above and beyond   learning on and off the clock  etc all that shit   it really seems that everyone is looking for people to do more than they are going to pay them for  and expect us to be enthusiastic about working there   are there actually companies and businesses out there that just want someone to do their job well and that's it  everything i'm looking at seems to read  if you just do your daily responsibilities  that's not enough here   i just want a position that all that is expected of me is my job responsibilites  and anything above that is considered a plus  not an expectation  is that even possible these days ,k2tfrp

25,"As a European, the US is the last place I'd want to live",i'm from the uk and live in france now  the us is a seriously broken society  just the stories i hear about overworking and the pure cost of things over there genuinely shocks me  if you guys are sick of working i really think the best option is to just leave the states   in the uk things aren't quite as good as in france  but the healthcare is completely free  i can turn up at a hospital with just myself and be treated   in france the govt just seems to hand out money  there are a few organisations which just give you money to help with rent and stuff if you can show you need it   you rarely do though  two people can live comfortably for  1500 in most cities outside of paris  some cities rents can be as low as  400  i lived in nantes and paid that for a small apartment   i get the impression that over there you guys need thousands just to survive  and are constantly living in fear of a financial emergency  i can think of 50 countries i'd live in before the us   maybe my opinion is inaccurate  but this is what i see looking from the outside  wonder if you guys agree and have ever considered ditching the us ,k36u8e

31,24 and Disabled,i m somewhat of a lurker on this sub  i recently got my first full-time job in october 2019  it was actually americorps service in an office  but i ve been working from home since march  that term ended in august 2020  but then i signed on to do another 300 hours for the same org  down to half time  i m so fucking sick of it to be honest  it was okay earlier on  but now i have no excitement for it  fortunately i should be done the second week of january 2021    that s a little intro  so like i said in the title i m 24 and disabled  the conundrum i m in is that i could choose to never work again because i receive social security  but that means living in poverty the rest of my life  i m not too excited about working  but i want to do something to improve the world  i could try working for myself again  on green buildings  so i set my own hours and shit  that s probably what i m going to do honestly  office jobs fucking suck   anyway  what do you all do for work  or are some able to not work too ,k3pt28
32,It ain't over till the boss man sings.,exactly two weeks ago i put in my notice  i work with children with disabilities and quitting meant they would have to find someone else to take my cases  they told me they would make a fading plan  and once my cases were faded we could amicably split  fine    they have done nothing  in fact  no one has even talked to me since the day i put in my resignation  i have another job now  i am literally employed somewhere else  but my previous employer hasn't faded me off my cases  they know the guilt providers feel when we leave our clients with no services  they want me to feel like i am abandoning my cases  when it is really the higher ups who have made no plans for continuity of care    today i was sick  i am salaried and even though i can make up my work during the rest of the week they told me i needed to use pto  fine  i don't care  i submitted the request  denied  the same manager responded telling me that because i resigned i can't use pto  if i resigned  why am i still here  they docked me for today    this feels like an abusive relationship  i left but they won't let me leave  they have ignored my fading plan  but they sure as hell didn't ignore me asking to make up my work later in the week    my work    no  it isn't my work  it's theirs  just because you can't find a replacement doesn't mean i didn't quit  i am trying to compose a professional email telling them i am done waiting  why is it so hard to think of the words to say  they have stepped all over me for the past year  and after i finally got the courage to quit  here i am  still working here     can you please leave me alone  i don't work here anymore ,k4371n
33,So I asked my manager for resignation from my crappy toxic job,i'm a new member and i saw a lot of posts about people sharing their experiences  so i decided to share a bit of mine too   i work as a software developer for a local company  i started as an intern and became a full-time employee  since my intern times  i was already the main maintainer of the company's most important system  they just threw loads of work on me and forced me to work overtime even this being literally illegal for interns   in those 2 years working for this company i had lots of mental breakdowns and overwhelming sensation of dread and hopelessness  worked my bones off for a salary below the average for it professionals where i live  having to deal with a chaotic work place with toxic people and incompetent superiors  that one time  they forced us to work 8 am to 11 pm from mondays to sundays for 3 weeks because they thought it was a good idea to start an enterprise-level project 3 weeks before the deadline   i snapped this weekend and decided to quit  now i still have to work the next 2 weeks because the law protect the company  forbidding me from quitting whenever i desire to without previous warnings  but i'm already a lot better and brighter than before  my gastritis and anxiety are under control  i'm not so stressed anymore and i'm even a bit energetic  this is so weird  i'm not energetic in years   my boomer parents are already bothering me  they are shocked  saying i'm complete  pussy  for quitting  an idiot for choosing being unemployed in times like that and i need to find another job right now  without even letting me have time to recover from trauma and chronic stress  ps  i don't even live with my parents in years   anyway  i'm also worried about the future  i don't know if i'm going to find a job anytime soon  but it's liberating at the same time  i hope i can get some rest after all of this   i hope none of you ever have some experience like that  no one deserves it   thanks for reading  i had to let it out of my chest  have a great day ,k499fr

54,Gave notice to quit my job but man I just cannot do it anymore,i started a new job earlier this month as a cashier at a department store  i wasn t happy about it because i just finished my bachelor s degree in the summer and wanted a job in my field but the job market is obviously not the best right now  so i had to apply for retail stuff which i ve been doing since high school and i absolutely despise it and was so happy to be done  but i took this cashier job because i figured it ll be easy and familiar and i needed some money    i absolutely hate it though and i didn t realize how much worse it s all gotten with covid and my new workplace doesn t take anyone s temp when you come into work  coworkers have all been talking about going to the bars every night  and a bunch of them already had the virus plus all the customers who can t wear their masks properly and come through my line coughing  i can t do it anymore lmao  my notice was to leave next friday but i just wanna stop showing up  i mean they already know i m quitting so what s a few days early right  it s not gonna be a problem really because i m going to law school next year so i doubt ditching a cashier job is gonna come back to bite me in the legal profession ,k301s7
55,Need Advice.,first a bit of backstory  i work in a nursing home kitchen as the kitchen manager  we have gone this whole time without an covid cases  we get tested 3 times a week  all of a sudden we have a major outbreak going on  another thing to know is i am the best worker  which i hate  i am the one that does all the little things that everyone forget  the one who picks up everyones slack  the one who get used and abused  within the last few months i have been the one to pick up most if no all open shifts  we had one out that had a baby  people on vacation and so on  the last few weeks i had been like 3 peoples amount of work into one shift  what doesnt really count for anything but a very exhausted employee   there was a shift opened on sunday  decided on friday not to take it  this morning i wake up to text so and so got sent home possible covid and they are still short for the evening shift  going to have to deal with the aftermath tomorrow  at this point i want to get covid just to self quarantine  i can without contracting but my anxiety has been so high to even consider asking to do that instead  i just dont know what to do  any suggestions ,k3eqwd

57,automated bartender,my former roommate is a chef  and a few years ago he took me to a trade show that i saw an automated bartender  now if all our needs were met you would only need somebody to load the machine  and program it  depending on how busy the bar is it may be an hour worth of work a month to load the machine  and programming only needs to be done once  the machines have an id reader to ensure the person is over 21  and a credit card reader with a tap and pay so the person can pay for their drinks  it's an absolutely great machine to install if all our basic needs were met  i can honestly see this being installed over the next 10 years in most locations  a machine like this is a big reason why we eventually need to adapt some sort of basic income  the rules that were in place for our grandparents need to change for modern society ,k39y5w

62,"Has anybody here moved from an IT career (software dev/data science) to the trades (plumbing, electrician etc) in their 30's?",full disclosure  i did post this question also over on   https www reddit com r askmenover30 comments k450xq anybody moved from software devdata science to https www reddit com r askmenover30 comments k450xq anybody moved from software devdata science to  i believe it's consistent with the rules of r antiwork to post it here also  i wanted to get the opinions of people here       key  ds   data scientist data science   sd   software developer software development     currently employed as a data scientist  ds  in the uk  but really starting to burn out  i've always been a life long learner  but the rate at which the field is changing is quite inhuman   it's hard to explain if you're not in the field  still  basically the completion is enormous  read global competition  and the field is quite saturated  and i've noticed  anecdotally  that employer demands are increasing and wages are stagnating  people are even starting to point this out   https towardsdatascience com ridiculous-requirements-from-data-scientist-job-ads-d84fa716af73 https towardsdatascience com ridiculous-requirements-from-data-scientist-job-ads-d84fa716af73  to do well in your career  you really need to be in london  or another expensive tech hub  i know one can now work remotely  but it is really not as fun as its sounds  and companies offering remote working opens themselves up to more candidates and more competition for you  frankly  i don't think it will be long until data scientists are ten a penny  i don't really think i want to keep having to stay up to date  i feel like the returns are ever diminishing  i certainly can't see my self doing this in 5 years   i keep thinking about getting into the trades  my reasoning is as follows    amp x200b     i know that things change in the trades  electricians have to keep up with new legislation  for example  but not at the rate they do in ds  i don't think you can truly feel like a master in data science or software development  a software dev's skillset can quickly become obsolete  you're basically continuously competing with fresh blood because the tool stack has shifted and your experience with an outdated technology counts for nothing  an electrician  on the other hand  has skills for life  not only is one constantly having to learn  but one also has to constantly ensure that they are not working themselves into a corner  i e  you constantly have to hedge your bets with the topics you choose to focus on    many of the trades have a barrier to entry  you need to be licenced  whereas anybody can call themselves a data scientist  or even a software dev  you can't call yourself an electrician gas engineer    ds sd can easily be outsourced  it's harder to outsource the trades    ds sd is increasingly becoming automated  again you have to keep up with the latest tools  all the while adapting to aspects of your job being automated  in fact it's kind of your job to automate stuff and eventually put yourself and other out of work  i don't see electricians etc  becoming automated any time soon    ds sd  if not working remotely  need to live in expensive tech hubs  london  oxford  cambridge  those with a skilled trade are in need everywhere    many ds sd employers expect you to have  passion  this is especially true on the ds side  i don't see this kind of cult culture in the trades  people seem so much more down to earth in the trades  but maybe i just haven't looked hard enough  as tech workers  we seem to have to wear this mask and be super excited about synergies and growth hacking  nobody expects a plumber do plumbing as a hobby  in the ds world  there is a culture that expects you to live and breath data science and technology    the ds hype train  there is so much hype out there that setting realistic goals puts you in the dog house  i've lost count of the number of times a non-technical manager has told me to do something  i explain that it's not actually possible  i'm an expert in my field  and i've been told just to get it done  it turns out they skimmed a medium article  got the wrong idea  and made promises to important people without first consulting anybody who knows whats they are doing  instead of owning up to their mistake  they double down  declare it doable and try to make out that you aren't good enough at your job    i feel like ds sd careers are a race to the bottom  ds and sd literally give code away for free   https github com https github com  and companies in need of data science solutions offer prize money  instead of hiring a team to complete the work   https www kaggle com https www kaggle com  these companies get thousands of solutions for putting 10k prize money down  again i don't see this occurring in the trades  nobody expects to be able to put 1k down for a new bathroom  have 200 plumbers all submit their bathroom  pay only the winning plumber  and keep the other 199 bathrooms    relates to the previous point  you can strike out on your own  as a plumber you can start your own business  not easy  but doable  as a data scientist  it's more difficult when everybody gives their code way for free on github    in the trades you can work on the side  in the it world  most contracts forbid moonlighting  and you sign over all your ip copyright rights to the employer  they basically own you   all in all  i don't think a ds sd career is all it's cracked up to be  i know the trades have their own sets of issues  your body goes etc  it's long hard work  but i feel like it doesn't suffer from the above issues       so with this in mind  has anyone changed fields  is the grass really greener  or am i being naive  i don't want to romanticise the trades  or suggest for one moment that they are easy  so forgive me  but i do feel they offer opportunities to somebody with sound work ethic  am i thinking about this wrong    i'm becoming quite jaded and burnout and reevaluating options  but no idea what my next move should be  my current career path is giving me a lot of anxiety  tackling big open-end data science projects with uncertain outcomes  doing the work of 2-3 people  mangers with no understand of the work calling the shots  the intense competition nipping at my heels  i know one could argue that all work is uncertain  but in the data science world  that statement is on another level  one often doesn't know if what they are attempting to do is even possible ,k48ws3

I want the right to be lazy.,first off  i'm not exactly sold on the idea that we all need to be working for society to function  bullshit jobs are real  not only that but the job market is shrinking because of automation  what's going to happen when many people are out of a job for no fault of their own  sucks to be them i guess   second off  the jobs that we currently value are ones we don't pay enough  you value your teachers  your pilots  your plumber  give them better pay  i didn't realize how we thank teachers for teaching our children is by having them live just above the poverty line    gt wait  what if all of the teachers in the world stopped working  would you really be so happy about the idea of not working then   yes  that's a great idea  that's called a global strike and i am all for that plan  frankly i wouldn't be surprised if they all decide to quit collectively  we treat them terribly    gt so  you just want to not work  at all  not even a little   no i would work  i just wouldn't work for a capitalist  i would volunteer my time as i want to  my time as i see fit    gt so how would you make money   oh you're right  i still have to make money  hm  ubi  give everyone a base income and everyone would be set  and don't make it something stupid like 900 a month  make it at least 1 500 a month    gt but where does that money come from   the same place we seem to get all of the money for our f  wars  we would stop fighting wars in the middle east to pay for the ubi   now considering all of the bullshit jobs are gone  teachers are paid double their current salary and we've stopped fighting wars in the middle east  i would say we are now the most efficient country ever   please make this happen god ,k474yl

121,The only true way that work will abolished,the only way that the social and economical construct of humanity will change is  imo  through automation  the thing a lot of people fear the most might actually be the key  as ai gets advance enough to figure out cures to diseases and a formula solution that can solve world hunger then that would eliminate part of the need for humans to work  you could also program ai robots to build a community that people can live in with materials that don't hurt the environment  its already been done a thousand times through multiple projects with limited funding and is progressing slowly but humanity doesn't want to embrace it  you already use computers cellphones  cars and all the technology around you and never gave it much thought as to how much it helps you cope with the challenges of life but when it comes to saving you from cancer or a traumatic injury you wouldn't trust a machine to administer care or medicine  why    this is where the future is headed  its going to happen  its inevitable  people are always quick to assume the machines will take the jobs  that is the whole point  the only  job  humans need is the ones assign to yourself to accomplish something you want to accomplish  not working for some corrupt ceo paying you pennies to be exploited for 40 hours a week  why do you work  for food shelter and pay your bills like electricity etc  if that is already taken care of by technology then what would there be left for you to do besides spend time doing things you enjoy  working should be a choice  not a necessity  that idea would be so foreign to majority of people it would leave them dumbfounded   people are too in love with money and its monopoly  ex  oil industry meat processing fossil energy industrial agriculture etc  and don't want to embrace a lifestyle change so my thought is if we don't allow the assistance of ai to accelerate our learning and machines to cover many labor intensive tasks then we won't be able to reach the point where we have the option to merge with the two  that is the only solution because evolution won't be fast enough to survive the coming world events or space itself and that will be the end of humanity sooner than people care to think ,k4d8j1

128,"Until Capitalism dies, we're not going anywhere.",conservatives like to claim that the world is just going through some sort of temporary phase  that eventually all the protesting  riots and advocates for a better world will disappear and the world will go back to  how it was    lmao    if you're a conservative  someone who doesn't think the world should progress to something better  then i'm going to need you to listen real close to the next sentence     the  world  you  grew  up  in  is  gone    it's done  it's over  you now live in a world filled with people who are going to tear this shit down and watch it burn so something better can take it's place  it's not a phase  it's not something that will end soon  your kids are going to grow up in a world that is much more radicalized and violent than the one you grew up in yourself  they're going to go their entire lives watching people fight directly against the way of life you hold so dear   don't misunderstand me  when i say  it's over  i don't mean to say our side has already won  i'm saying that the world where the lines weren't as thick as they are now isn't going anywhere anytime soon  this is going to be the way things are until capitalism dies  we're going to get louder and louder  fight harder and harder until every single human here is treated with respect and love  regardless of how much of your worthless currency they have   fuck money  fuck servitude  fuck ranking humans and what they deserve via pieces of paper  whenever i say this  people tell me that  it's not just paper  it's mostly digital now  as if the fact that it's not even a real thing makes it less of a disgusting and archaic concept   just like slavery  capitalism is nothing more than an outdated system protected by immoral people  until it's dead  we're going to riot  we're going to protest and we're going to fight  it doesn't matter what country we're from  how long it takes or how many of us are lost in the process  humanity as a whole is more important than any of us are as individuals  none of us can do this alone  but together  we can absolutely destroy this system and create one that works for everyone    this selfish system that values money over human life is going to be crushed under the weight of the masses  we're already starting to see this come to fruition  the funny thing is that capitalism is the cause of so many problems  that people don't even need to realize that it's what they're truly fighting against in order to bring about it's demise   if you're a conservative  racist  homophobe  transphobe or any other type of bigoted fuck wit  i'd suggest waking up and taking a good look around  because the ball isn't rolling in your direction anymore  at this point you don't stand any chance of  conserving  your way of life indefinitely into the future  even if you do decide to fight back now you're still going to lose  because there are  a lot  more people worldwide suffering under your system than there are thriving under it    we should all keep in mind that throughout history every single economic system has died  despite being defended by immoral humans  tribalism  slavery and feudalism  all dead  economic systems always end up dying  no matter what  no matter how many people unjustly protect them  you don't have to like it or agree with it because it's a historical fact  capitalism is going to die eventually just like every other economic system of the past  any pain it causes conservatives to watch their system crumble can't come close to the amount of pain they caused others by supporting and defending it for so long    to all the petrified snowflakes that are currently  prepping  i say good call  you should be scared  because we plan to do to your system exactly what it did to humanity  leave it behind ,k33mnq

141,(RANT) My colleague does 5 hours free labor weekly,furlough pay is confusing as hell  so much so that i just gave up on understanding it and assumed that my pay would be correct  that is until this week  when my colleague and i both had to put in extra hours as our other colleague was ill  i told her that she needs to make sure that our job isn't getting free labor out of us  so we worked it out   my colleague gets paid 8 hours of furlough pay per week  regardless of how much she actually works  this was dressed up as a great deal as she could potentially only be needed for 4 hours and still get paid for 8  however  we worked out her hours for this week and she's actually done 13  this means that she's worked 5 hours for free this week   similarly  i'm being paid regularly for some hours and furlough for others  so we worked out that i shouldn't be working any more than 5 hours extra  on top of my usual hours  per week   it's just astonishing to me that a job will take free labor from you and dress it up as a present  i'm so glad that we checked for her sake - she's a single mum working 2 jobs and would be losing out on over  100 per month   ps  when we were first furloughed  our boss also told us that we were free to come in for a coffee if we felt bored or lonely at home  i love my colleagues and i would gladly go out for a coffee with them  but they won't catch me coming to work just for a chat  ,k0wstb

156,*Rant* My employer cares more about productivity than public or employee safety.,tldr  my boss might have covid and is still working  and her boss doesn t give a shit about covid regulations and public safety  and now i m scared i might be sick  i want to report them but i have no clue how to even do that or if i can    as if i didn t have a few dozen reasons that i hate my job  i am not so angered with my job that i really want to get this out there    when i first started this job we immediately had to quarantine for two weeks because an employee had a family member with covid  we all got tested  then went back to work after 14 days with pay  it was nice  actually  for context that ll matter later  we work in a small office that comes face to face with the public  there are less than 6 employees at a small retail loan office    fast forward a few months  my boyfriend s mother was diagnosed with covid  we had just seen her 5 days prior  and he had seen her less than 48 hours ago at the time  i told my manager and she jokingly said  let s pretend you didn t say that  because if we get quarantined again they aren t gonna pay us this time  i was very concerned  to say the least    then about 2 weeks went by and now my manager is sick as a dog  she has all the symptoms of covid  she still showed up to work  just to let us know  she s going to get tested for covid because she thinks she has it  she got tested and then let the district manager know this and he said  you should probably go home if you don t feel good because if you get anyone sick with covid they could sue us    not  you should go home because you re not feeling well and need to rest   not  you should go home because you re endangering your employees and the public   his only concern is them getting sued  priorities  right    so  she stays at work all day and then takes the next day off because she literally can t get out of bed  then she came right back today because her  very concerned  boss has literally nagged her constantly at home through texts about numbers  and productivity and is threatening her job if she doesn t push us to do more loans and collect on more accounts  so it s clear his concern for her working while sick is bs because he s scaring her into working while sick because it s month end  so she was at work all day in this tiny office  not social distancing or wearing a face mask  she even texted him and said she isn t feeling good at all but it s up to him if she goes home or not  he only said  okay  he didn t even answer her question  so she stayed all day today again  then he harped on us all about productivity  clearly giving no shits that she s at work  possibly with covid  which then inspired her to hold a private meeting with me about my productivity in an even smaller room 3 feet away from me with her germs going everywhere  again  she possibly has covid but still hasn t gotten any results yet    now  i m sitting here feeling randomly lightheaded and my throat has been bothering me all day  i am choosing to believe it s just due to stress  lack of sleep and anxiety  but now i m worried i have covid because of these shitty  greedy  sociopathic corporate  leaches  i don t know if i can report them or what  i just am so sick on this place and i don t even want to go back friday ,k16mu7

Not lazy just don’t want to do meaningless shit for someone who wouldn’t care if I dropped dead the next day,i graduated college two years ago and furthered my education through two years of continuing studies for another bachelor s degree in nutrition  i graduated and was fortunate enough to get accepted to a competitive internship across country and moved  i loved the thought of finally being somewhere brand new and having that independence and freedom of starting fresh  but i absolutely hated the idea of conforming to a box  i knew it in my head i didn t like the program but carried on anyway because that s what we ve been conditioned to believe right  get a degree  slave away at a 9-5 job  get married  buy a house  have kids and continuing slaving away for the next 40  years until you have the next exciting thing to look forward to retirement  i was afraid of disappointing the people around me but i knew deep down  my life is mine and only mine and i couldn t justify spending a minute doing something i couldn t bare just so i could please the people around me by participating in the rat-race of our capitalist society  i want the freedom to work wherever i want doing things i love and have ample time to pursue my interests and travel    anyway  i ended up withdrawing from the program because my head and heart both just weren t in it  i immediately got a job in the nonprofit sector and had zero drive or passion for it  it wasn t a typical corporate job but there was no meaning to it and i hated being disrespected and talked down to like i had no worth  so i trusted my gut and left  right now for income  i am a  freelancer  taking care of people s dogs  i started about a month ago and have made  700 which is decent for starters but not remotely enough for survival  i m very content watching dogs for money as it brings me a lot of joy and is my primary form of therapy and encourages me to get some exercise in when i have a dog under my care    i also have a lot of interest in creative work particularly in digital media  i m currently helping a friend launch her business by helping her design templates for social media use that matches her aesthetic and branding  she does not have any clients at the moment since she has not launched yet so i told her i d be happy to help her without any monetary compensation right now since it ll help me build a portfolio  i love this type of work but i also need more income  but do not want to make the same mistakes of jumping into a job solely for the money  i want to continue freelancing but feel stuck unqualified and i know the market is saturated  i m not looking to make 6 figures a year but simply just enough to be comfortable and then some  any advice for me here on next steps  i d love to hear your story if you started from the bottom freelancing and now do it for a full-time income ,k0zy3q
165,What is so wrong with taking a leave of absence from working?,when i was in college about 1 5 years in i found myself completely depressed and anxiety ridden because i had no idea what i wanted to do and went right to college after hs  luckily i found the strength to take a leave of absence from school even after my father yelling at me and being quite upset at the fact i needed a break ended up working 2 jobs for a year off from school and was the best thing i ever did  got my bearings and finished college after that   but now since i m done college and in the workforce i feel like i need another break from this fucking work  i ve been at it for 4 years since graduating and the 15-20 days off we get a year do not cut it   i wish i could take a leave of absence from my job and go back in a few months but i feel like no one ever offers that unless you are pregnant  i guess i just need to quit and find another job after i ve recouped my mental   but again even mentioning this to my father he said  you need to minimize the time between this job and your next  fucking why  if i want to take 1 2 or 3 months off with some of the safety net i ve acquired from working and live cheaply for a few months before getting another job i should be able to  the pressure put on every day people in the working class is too much for me sometimes and i want a fucking break  which i should be able to take without consequence ,k0w1pd

171,Getting paid monthly feels like some weird form of torture.,i've been working jobs that paid weekly  up until now  and how the fuck do people live like this  i constantly feel broke  maybe i'm going through withdrawal from weekly paid dopamine hits but this is killing me    i'm usually really good at financial planning but watching the expenses pile up over the course of a month is making my anxiety act up  four weeks of gas payments  four weeks of groceries  one dentist appointment it feels like this a simple way to end up accidentally spending more than you earn    when i used to work weekly i could chip away at my credit card bill weekly and drop it back to zero by the due date  i didn't feel that bad about paying smaller amounts of money but now  having to pay everything in one lump sum makes me feel like i've not gotten paid at all ,k13m3v

212,[RANT] Supervisor and higher-management gets paid at least double for less work and being able to boss around?, i remember my first day where i got almost fired twice    some supervisor made only me do the literal heavy-lifting for things that were also at a high place where i could barely reach filled with items of varying sizes  some which fell on me  she made me do it for like ten aisles  alone  i started on one aisle  and and then a coworker called me to two other aisles to work on  after i worked on those i returned  still having some of my energy left after all those heavy-lifting  to the initial aisle and the supervisor thought i hadn't budged from there and called me slow and  speed up dude  in her accent  i can understand questioning me to check why i was slow  i wasn't  but   i thought if you were getting paid better  especially being at a higher-level with less work  you would be acting more professional  but no guess you just want to stroke your ego   later  i finished all my assignments  and was given an easier task  after i went to get other resources  i noticed my work-station was hijacked by others who have been working there for years  they also used up all the things i was using  since it was still my first day  i didn't know where to look for it  and i went back to the usual place hoping someone filled it up again   though it was still empty  suddenly the manager  sees me ask why i am doing nothing  although it was only 1 minute i stepped away from my work  after it got hijacked  to look for new work  i saw his face getting angry thinking that i wasn't slaving at all  more misunderstanding  which made me even angrier having this similar thing happen to me on the same  first-  day on i kept a stern face told him what i was doing  and he backed off somewhat     was this a victory  no  in the end i was still a slave  wasting my time  only minimum wage compensation  doing more and dangerous work  than my bosses  for my bosses to earn their pity and and be chewed upon by their misunderstanding    i mentioned they also want to stroke their egos  well  this way  your ego will also be getting bigger along with the number of your enemies  i thought they enjoyed their  'wonderful'  career and life  so why do they make more enemies   oh  maybe they just have a death-wish ,k1lcxk

214,Exploitation of new employees.,i wanted to share a story of a day of work which just ended  and at the same time  make a point   today our boss was out for most of the day so my colleague who's been working there for 4 years decides she does not want to cook   i work at an italian restaurant  so cooking is our job  she went and made unimportant and kind of useless things the whole day  cleaning every corner and etc  while prep-kitchen work is something all experienced employees do everyday inbetween rush hours for an hour or two everyday  she pretended to be there most of the day  i'm not dumb  i know what has to be done there and how long it takes  i also was in a terrible condition  my stomach hurt and i was super nauseous and since food and cooking makes lots of smells  onions  bacon  etc  my day was super hard which i mentioned from the very start of the shift  she didn't care though  she'd show up in moments of rush where i couldn't do everything alone  mind you she didn't come in to help me  somebody would call her in  that happened maybe twice  she'd come in  start making some orders and when she'd notice i'm done with mine  she would just say  here  i've started two of those  finish them  and move on  so i'd finish hers and  go on  alone    my last straw was when the shift manager asked me to clean the fridge  where drinks are stored  and while i was doing it she was back and standing by the pan and then shift manager brought her a couple of orders so she just turned around and left screaming  get them done  i pretended to not hear her and so she came back and just told me - can you make those  i'm sick of cooking  though she barely cooked today - she had most of the stack of takeaway food boxes  pretty much all  while i  on the other hand was almost halfway through my second full stack  while i was cooking she didn't even bother to pretend to work - she just stood there  supporting her head with elbows on the table and was talking to the shift manager  later when shift manager went for a break she would just yell out orders and wait until i make them  because i was in a hurry  i fucked up two orders  because i forgot to read the comments  she gave me shit for this and also for making a bit of a mess in her side of the refridgerator where our ingredients are stored  which is usual when you are  you know  working  especially since i was doing it all alone  she made me clean it all up while she sat by the table with her phone 'waiting for orders to come'  it was really nice when she was telling me amounts and names of dishes and watching me hurry while just sitting  i feel exhausted since i had nausea and terrible stomach pains and was working alone all day even through most of the rushes  which is not a new experience  that happens a lot not only when you're new  but if you are also young especially   most working environments are toxic like that and they suck  how is one supposed to be happy after being stressed out after having to do all the work on time and without mistakes all day  it's exhausting both physically and mentally ,k1i6h0

216,"You live under a system of servitude, which is why ""freedom"" propaganda is so prevalent",i've probably made a post like this in the past  but i don't care because this is important  the word freedom and the word servitude both have definitions  when i was a teenager  i truly wish an adult looked me in the eyes  and explained this simple truth to me  so as an adult  i'm going to explain it to whoever is reading this    the definition of  servitude https www merriam-webster com dictionary freedom  is  a condition in which one lacks liberty especially to determine one's course of action or way of life   the definition of  freedom https www merriam-webster com dictionary freedom  is  the absence of necessity  coercion  or constraint in choice or action   every human you have ever met lives under capitalism  and you will be taking part in it or else  this  by definition  means you are under a system of servitude  the opposite of a system of freedom or free choice    i'm not making an argument  i'm simply explaining to you that words mean things  they have definitions  you don't have to like it  you don't have to agree  because again  it's not an argument  like i said  i wish as a teenager a adult told me the truth  but that never happened  it would have helped me a lot to know that at least someone has a grasp of what is going on and was able to explain it in such a simple way   instead of the truth  i was  like so many of us  lied to by economic propaganda and the victims of that propaganda  i was never sat down and told that no  i don't live in a free country  and i most likely will not in my lifetime  and i really  really wish someone would have told me that  i hate the fact that i had to learn that as an adult    if someone tells you they live in a free country  they are accidentally lying to you  you're not special  your country is not special  it is no more or less free than anywhere else  you live under the same system of economic servitude as north koreans  if someone tries to convince you that you live in a free country  i would not take life advice from them  i'm not saying treat them poorly  they are victims of propaganda  and you should feel bad for them and try to educate them in an attempt to  break the spell    don't let lies win  don't let propaganda win  tell the truth  tell your kids the truth  tell as many people young and old as you can the truth  i know it's uncomfortable to accept this fact  but it's very important that as many people know the truth as possible  otherwise the world will continue the way it is  and if you care about humanity  you know we can't allow that ,k2k1be
217,This is how fucked the system is,my goal is to not have to work ever again  i did pretty much everything perfect  and got incredibly lucky  and the earliest possible age i'll be able to retire is 40    here's all the things that went right     i joined the military at 17 years old  right out of high school  earliest start possible  i was essentially working a full time job  i had to deploy twice and put my life on the line for 4 years     i did not leave the service unscathed however  i have quite a few issues with my health that have put me on 30  disability  the government sends me  400 a month to make up for this     after i got out  i worked two jobs  40 hrs wk total  while on the gi bill  and got a stem degree  no student loans  and i had steady income     i got a job making 55 000 a year  i quit after a year and got a new job making 80 000 a year     i bought a tinyhouse for 80 000  my loan   taxes comes to about 800 mo  electricity  internet  water  etc bring it to 900 mo     i have a girlfriend that pays me  200 mo in rent   i don't do much aside from play free videogames  if you're wondering where i got the age calculations from  it is assuming a 4 5  growth and essentially having enough money in the market that the 4  of returns each month equals what i spend monthly   short of having someone give me a ton of money and rolling a 100 on luck  things really worked out for me  i was born into a working class family and both worked my ass off and got incredibly lucky along the way  i didn't die in the service  i didn't have student loans  i got job offers  i was able to find a new better paying job   i spent time researching investing the correct way too  and if the market doesn't crash and continues an upward trend  the earliest i could potentially hope to not have to work again  is at the age of 40  after having worked 23 years of the prime of my life    how fucked is that  that is only if you do everything perfect  there are so many people out there who weren't nearly as lucky as me  the didn't get that job offer  or they had some medical condition come up that bankrupts them and now they can barely afford to feed themselves or their families    that's the best it gets guys  well for 99 999  of us  the best it gets is 23 years of work  through the prime of your life ,k1vwhf

230,rant about writing essays as part of job applications,so  this is a thing now    i'm old enough to remember that it wasn't always like this   along with unpaid time spent on tests and work samples and interviews  employers are increasingly adding the step of requiring an essay or answers a bunch of essay-style questions on the topic of why you want the job why they should give it to you  the kinds of questions that could come up in an interview   in my experience this comes before any interview or even a brief phone screen   sometimes it's required just to submit your application   you can't just dash them off in 20 minutes either   it's 5-20 in-depth questions asking for  detailed  info about specific stuff   plus if you want the job you want to write something halfway intelligent  so that will take longer   you could easily spend several hours preparing your application    with no guarantee that any of it will ever be read   sure  i can pop off a resume and cover letter   if they're  actually interested  in me we can take it from there   but this essay stuff is so unreasonable   i figure jobseekers are putting in literally billions of unpaid hours a year on stuff like this   nothing stops employers from making their hiring process as onerous as they want  as long as some applicants are willing to do it   any are   this is just a further example of how we're in deep shit   and yet it is barely discussed ,k1r0e5

262,Perspective from a Manager.,i worked at a company for 12 years from part-time to salaried department manager   not that the pay was very great  i have since left  but it gave me a different perspective on managing people  for most of those years i worked under a manager and asking for time off was always like trying to grind diamonds with play-doh and we'd be given groans and i don't know blah blah blah or had to  make it up somewhere else  cause they were doing us a solid by letting us have time off  as part-time employees mind you  even if we were working 40hrs a week   so when it came my time to sit in the chair i found out being a manager was laughably easy   retail mind you  nothing is that important in retail  i told my employees never to worry about asking for time off  you are part time  you don't get paid vacation time  you are telling me when and when you cannot work  no questions asked  i asked if anyone had preferred regular work weeks or special needs  like i need to be home by whenever for kids  or school or whatever  and made a set weekly schedule for everyone so they could count on consistency of what to expect instead of our previous shooting fish in a barrel toss up of what was coming schedule  i asked everyone to give me as much notice on  day-off requests  as possible and accomidated  even if it was last minute  i asked before putting someone else in their place to cover that shift and if no one could would  tough beans we were a little short that day  again retail  never that important  i always encouraged younger employees who would talk about leaving to go back to school or train for a better job  i had realistic expectations of their motivation for making a company money was  which is none  but just expected them to do their jobs not stress themselves out about it  i ended up having the best functioning department in the whole store within a few months of treating my employees like people with lives outside of work and who were only here cause they need   it wasn't fucking hard  if i had the authority to give out raises to everyone would get them   i don't really know what the takeaway here is  maybe just that you are not asking for time off  you are telling your employer when and when you cannot work  it is not your job to stress nor your responsibility to put your mental physical health on the line for any job  you manager boss whatever may be stressed about things  but their job is usually just as unimportant as yours and they don't need to be stressed  the world keeps turning  never stress about work  it's your life first and foremost ,k2p9wn

271,I hate my great job,22f  sorry for posting so much on here  i'm technically in a great job  you can almost choose your hours as long as it totals 40 minimum and you show up every weekday  there is no boss breathing down your neck besides a morning check in and a weekly meeting with everyone  no one cares how you do things as long as you get all your tasks done for the day  this also means that you need to figure out what needs to be done a lot on your own and plan how you'll achieve it on time  i've seen a lot of people say how they'd love to have a job where you have a lot of the control  but not me  i hate that soon i'll have to be figuring out what needs to be done on my own  i need someone to guide me  tell me what to do  and tell me i did it right  not just when i first learn the task  every single time  this is most likely because my sister kind of bullied me throughout my childhood and would call me stupid and rant about all the things i did wrong over just trying to make dinner  i don't trust my abilities  my pace  and my judgement for this job  i feel like once i'm on my own it'll take me 10 5-11 hours instead of my normal 9 5  it doesn't feel worth it when you don't get paid ot  after taxes i'll only get about 24 000 a year  this doesn't mention that before my lunch break my back muscles tighten up and it kind of hurts for the rest of the day ,k0jk23

274,Competency based interviews,i find there aren't a lot of threads bashing competency based interviews and where i do find them  there's always one person who defends them  they are certainly one aspect of work culture that richly deserves criticism as they are a complete abomination originating from a rat-like human mentality    if i interviewed someone for a job i would ask them about the job  not about them according to pseudo scientific scoring categories based on  personality  or what work culture designates as a desirable personality  which equates to none  a true competency based interview would focus on the actual job  but competency based interviews do not focus on the knowledge someone has but on how they parrot corporate ideological garbage back to the hiring panel  they also discriminate against introverts and people on the spectrum  when practiced they are a tool of psychological prejudice  a type of crime  yet not many people recognise this and seem to think they're fantastic  i find this bizarre  although the general public have lost their sanity in recent years  finally  are there fields which are immune to this infesting  toxic  corporate effluent or has this interview technique infected every area of the working world ,k0g4lr

289,The society we live in.,anybody else find it unbelievably sad that we judge people by what they do for a living the money they take home  i was hanging out with some friends the other night and i swear at least 90  of our conversation was talking about money and jobs and such  i work retail at the moment in my early 20 s and it really pissed me off when one of my friends    who by the way is very very conservative  was saying how if you are still working retail past 40 you are a failure  this alone really pissed me off because i have coworkers over that age who are some of the most nice people i have ever met  and just because they don t make hundreds of thousands of dollars does not make them a failure  my friend and i then got in a slight argument over if jeff bezos is immoral or not  i think jeff is a dick who hordes wealth  my friend says he has a right to make that much money    funny when people making like 20k a year still defend people making billions  i don t want to go into anymore of this  guess i just needed to rant how i really hate the society i m living in  this materialistic world where you are judged on the amount of paper you make or the silly job title you hold  i am really thankful at least the mega rich will die just like me  our graves will be the same size    and if they get a bigger grave they will be dead and in the void and will not care  rant over ,jz7ukv

330,Examples of living without ‘work’,   i read this excerpt a while before i found this subreddit and i finally found it so i could post it here    in the european squatter s movement  some cities have had or continue to have so many squatted social centers and houses that they constitute a shadow society  in barcelona  for example  as recently as 2008 there were over forty occupied social centers and at least two hundred squatted houses  the collectives of people who inhabit these squats generally use consensus and group assemblies  and most are explicitly anarchist or intentionally anti-authoritarian  to a large extent  work and exchange have been abolished from these people s lives  whose networks run into the thousands  many do not have waged jobs  or they work only seasonally or sporadically  as they do not need to pay rent  for example the author of this book  who has lived within this network for two years  has survived for much of that time on less than one euro a day  moreover  the great amount of activity they carry out within the autonomous movement is completely unwaged  but they do not need wages  they work for themselves  they occupy abandoned buildings left to rot by speculators  as a protest against gentrification and as anti-capitalist direct action to provide themselves with housing  teaching themselves the skills they need along the way  they fix up their new houses  cleaning  patching roofs  installing windows  toilets  showers  light  kitchens  and anything else they need  they often pirate electricity  water  and internet  and much of their food comes from dumpster-diving  stealing  and squatted gardens   in the total absence of wages or managers  they carry on a great deal of work  but at their own pace and logic  the logic is one of mutual aid   i know dumpster diving and squatting probably isn't most people's ideal vision of their life  but i also don't think working your life away at a meaningless job is most people's ideal vision either    this is from  anarchy works  by peter gelderloos   link https theanarchistlibrary org library peter-gelderloos-anarchy-works toc22   there are lots of examples of stateless societies and people functioning outside of our definition of work today  it s super long but really in depth  it covers tons of topics and questions like   without wages  what is the incentive to work   don t people need bosses and experts  and lots of information on how decisions are made in equitable societies  and how disputes are solved  here are a few more excerpts from what i ve read    some worry that if we abolish capitalism and wage-labor  no one will work anymore  it is true that work as it exists now for most people would cease to exist  but work that is socially useful offers a number of incentives besides the paycheck  if anything  getting paid to do something makes it less enjoyable  the alienation of labor that is a part of capitalism destroys natural incentives to work such as the pleasure of acting freely and the satisfaction of a job well done  when work puts us in a position of inferiority   to the boss who oversees us and the wealthy people who own our workplace   and we do not have decision-making power in our job but must mindlessly follow orders  it can become excruciatingly odious and mind-numbing  we also lose our natural incentive to work when we are not doing something that is useful for our communities  of the few workers today who are lucky enough to actually produce something they can see  they are nearly all making something that is profitable to their employers but completely meaningless to them personally  the fordist or assembly line structuring of labor turns people into machines  instead of cultivating skills workers can be proud of  it proves more cost-effective to give each person a single repetitive task and put him or her on an assembly line  no wonder so many workers sabotage or steal from their workplaces  or show up with an automatic weapon and  go postal    indigenous societies with less division of labor had no problem doing without wages  because the primary economic activities   producing food  housing  clothing  tools   are all easily connected to common needs  in such circumstances  work is a necessary social activity and an apparent obligation from every member of the community who is able  and because it takes place in a flexible  personal setting  work can be adapted to every individual s capabilities  and there is nothing to keep people from transforming work into play  fixing up your house  hunting  wandering in the woods identifying plants and animals  knitting  cooking a feast   aren t these the things that bored middle-class people do in their leisure hours to forget their loathsome jobs for a moment ,jzw3aq

365,Why do we seem to want to believe that the art world is a meritocracy?,addition to title    when nothing under capitalism is  a meritocracy   so i've been studying and making art for the last 6 years and beyond and something i've had to grapple with is the idea of the self-made artistic genius' success  i used to believe this  too  but i've had to find out that this is magical thinking  however  i keep seeing neoliberal logic around the topic of success in the wider field of artistic world  which to all of those who work in it is infamous for being harshly precarious and instable as a source of income and as having below livable wages for all those who seek to work in it without already having the backing of rich sponsors  read most often rich parents   those of us who are the 95  of art students who go on to make a living outside of the field are called  bitter  when we bring this up and told that  maybe we weren't good enough artists  when that is not what eg  the fine arts market is about at all   the fine arts market sells status objects that gain value by being charged with symbolic capital  read  references to other greats of the art world  philosophy or politics that are currently  in  for rich people to pose with to uphold a facade of charitability and responsibility  many arts collections are also investments  as art gains value over time rather than losing it  singular artists' sponsorships like bets placed on racehorses in the hopes of an even greater win down the line  and artistic project funding by banks etc  motivated by the incentive to launder money while appearing cultured  social and modern   that is the plain truth of the field  even if you try to stay out of the institutional scene  you'll find that it is a schmoozefest  who knows who  who has a good reputation already  what is in  who can perform what's hip most convincingly  who can market themselves more aggressively as the one s who know    i wonder if the denial of these circumstances is somewhat of a self-protective mechanism of denial and deflection    la  if i made it or my friend did  and we are both competent people  the industry must be fair because how else would we have made it  and that denial must be intensified and multiplied in accordance with the cognitive dissonance caused by knowing ourselves to be good artists and responsible people and knowing at the same time that we are not valued for that  but rather for what we can create in terms of symbols of wealth and status  how much we can kiss ass and how we can justify hierarchies by doing the markets' bidding and making luxury items out of dire struggles   pardon my language  but i am pissed off    we are quintessential flunkies  part-time ducttapers and boxtickers  to use david graebers categorization  we exist to cool the faces of rich with beautiful fans and to entertain with a multitude of tricks up our sleeves and if we don't do that we're considered worthless under capitalism   maybe i am bitter  but i would rather be authentically angry at how i can do almost nothing of artistic consequence in my position without it being subsumed under neoliberalism  i am in an institution that lives off my unpaid work  i am not the consumer here  i am the product and the producer at once  maybe my art is shit  but that doesn't explain why people with equal skill have more opportunities to present and get paid for their work  why they have connections even before getting into university  why they have the money to pay for good supplies  why they have the time to dedicate themselves entirely to their artistic careers  why they can wear designer clothes and spend their evenings at events  networking  why they are the 5  that  make it  after uni and the rest of us are non-starters    let me repeat that   less than 5  of fine art students go on to find paying work and a career in the field   maybe it's different in other areas  but i have a hunch that it's not by much  those 5  tend to be names you already know  or who have one relative or another already in the arts and culture scene   it's a self-referential  self-maintaining elitist network  why pretend that it isn't when hardly anything under capitalism is about ability  and so much about what standing you started with  i'll leave it up to you to answer that for yourself ,k05xua

373,Reparations: Could it set precipice for descendents of wage slaves in the future?,i had a question pop in my mind this morning  upon waking from my peaceful slumber  about reparations in the distant future   i considered pondered this   once reparations are made to the descendants of chattel slaves  could that set precipice for reparations for descendents of capitalist neoliberal wage slaves     i know that there is a  highly  discernable difference between wage slavery and chattel slavery   i'm not advocating wage slaves deserving reparations anytime soon  and especially not until the descendants of chattel slaves receive the reparations they've been requesting     an undebatable fact  though  is that today's working class have less rights than serfs peasants  and that was the catalyst for this thought process   what is the chance that establishment hasn't delivered reparations for descendents of chattel slaves because they fear it might set precipice for other reparations in the future ,jzmyqp

378,We should use PIRACY to our advantage 🏴‍☠️,piracy is a form of  digital anarchy    i know some people think it's selfish because it  hurts creators  but in reality  piracy does nowhere near as much harm as denying less fortunate people access to educational material and potential happiness does  we absolutely should use piracy as a way to  fight the system  not only because it can work  but because it's something that cannot be stopped  it's in our control  there is literally nothing they can do about it  other than trying to convince people it's wrong    they know they can't stop it  so they lie and try to convince people that copying and stealing are the same thing  the truth is that unlike stealing  when you copy something the original stays exactly as it was  words have definitions  even if capitalists would prefer we ignore them  trying to change or ignore the definitions of words to preserve an outdated economic system is both stupid and dystopian as fuck    i believe we should work together to show as many people as possible that our society doesn't need subscription based companies like netflix  hulu  disney  hbogo  amazon prime and others  not only would this help in the fight for digital digital freedom  but it could also help people realize that much of our current systems infrastructure is a lie that could be done away with absolutely no downsides    think of all the companies that  just like netflix  are really only glorified middle men  take a company like wal-mart  what service do they offer other than essentially storing and putting price tags on items  society can grow  produce and distribute everything wal-mart sells  without the need for wal-mart  this is true for  every  store  we can manage all the important aspects of production  distribution and storage without these giant companies existing  selling isn't a requirement of nature  it doesn't add anything beneficial to our society  another example is landlords  what purpose do they serve   owning  isn't a service  we can build and distribute homes without them  there are countless examples just like this    companies like netflix are lying out their teeth when they claim that they're providing a service  literally every single thing on every single streaming platform is available for free to any person with a internet connection  anyone can plug a hdmi cord into their tv from their computer and stream  download or torrent the content themselves  we don't need to pay for a streaming service in order to do this  in fact  not only is all the content already available for free  but you'll have access to a  much bigger  library of content than all those services combined  in reality those  services  are doing nothing more than limiting what technology is already capable of by splitting all the content onto different platforms  that makes them  by definition  media limiting services  why the hell should anyone pay just to let a company limit the capability of technology  how is that a service    humanity has the capability to store every movie  book  song  digital class and more in one centralized location  every single person in the world could have direct access to literally everything that has ever been made digital  for free  capitalism however  can't keep up  so in order to protect itself  everything is placed behind unnecessary paywalls  stopping technology in it's tracks  and preventing millions of people from sharing  learning and being happy    how about  fuck you  capitalism    we should want as many humans with the ability to educate themselves as possible  it's not just about fun stuff like movies  it's also about educational material which is even more important in my eyes  can you imagine how many humans in the world would have chosen to learn something  but couldn't afford a book  digital class or tool needed to do so  i guarantee you it's a lot of people  especially in lower income parts of the world  i believe that preventing technology from being used to it's full potential is much more detrimental to the well being of humanity than most people realize    don't let these companies limit what our species is capable of to protect their outdated economic system  like i said  this is something that they can't do anything about  and we should take full advantage of that  they can't stop us from sharing  they can't stop us from using the internet for good  i really believe it would help push our world to change if enough people have their eyes opened to what is already possible    if you agree  and you want to learn to pirate or help others learn  there's a sub linked on my profile that you may find useful  i'm more than willing to help anyone in terms of learning about piracy or finding what you need  so please don't be shy  we also have a discord with many people who are much smarter than me who are willing to answer any questions too    to be very clear  i get  nothing  by people joining our sub or discord  i don't care at all about views  making myself look good or anything weird like that  i'm not trying to promote this for any reason other than to help  i just want every person to have direct access to what the internet has to offer  so they can in turn offer the same to others  i want our species to be as smart  well connected and taken care of as possible  that honestly is my only goal  if you have any ideas on how we can help more people and spread this information outside of reddit please let me know  we can't let anti-piracy coalitions like  ace https www alliance4creativity com  convince people that sharing is immoral  i consider them criminals to humanity  and we need to stand our ground together    pirates are preserving the digital history of humanity  and sharing that with everyone  they are the good guys  they are on the side of humanity  unlike giant companies who claim to be offering services that in reality  people can offer themselves  all they care about is money and protecting an archaic economic system  they are making the world a less intelligent and less happy place  stop letting them screw over technology  the internet and our species as a whole  show them that we really don't need them     tldr  - learn to pirate  teach others to pirate  help spread knowledge and happiness to as many people as possible  stop letting companies pretend they're offering services when we can do it without them ,jzclsu
379,"There Is No Profit In Peace, Only In Conflict",capitalism is fundamentally based on making as much profit as possible  this means two things  - peace can never happen under capitalism - workers can never be paid the full value of their work under capitalism  because the surplus value always goes to the owners as profit   so if you want peace and workers to be paid the full value of their work  then you must abolish capitalism   the alternative is what we have now  to always live in a world with conflict  amp  to always be undervalued ,jzn881

397,Charity is an insulting concept,just to give some context  i speak as someone who has worked in the non-profit charity sector  i know there are lots of amazing charities with great people doing fantastic work  but i want to talk about where the conceptual understanding of charity came from   charity is inherently a conservative capitalist idea  entrenched in the idea the the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie take pity on those without and donate their excess money out of goodwill  the post war labour british prime minister clement attlee hated charity as a concept  because it would take the place of social security and instead of mandating fiscal and other support to those living in poverty etc  it was up to the 'kindness' of the privileged few to determine whether or not they should spare their loose change    structurally  therefore  we should seem to dismantle the concept of charity  and demand that people inherently deserve access to resources not by virtue of their financial standing but their inherent worth as a person ,k0750l

401,"No Future for the Workplace, by Bob Black",essay by bob black  published in 2015    source https archive org details insteadofwork page n91 mode 2up     buy the book https littleblackcart com index php dispatch products view amp product id 529     no future for the workplace  the best future for the workplace  as for the battlefield  is no future at all  with belated notice taken of a crisis in the workplace  the consultants surge forth with faddish reforms whose common denominator is that they excite little interest in the workplace itself  done to   not won by   the workers  their tinkerings are very much business as usual for business  as usual  they may raise productivity temporarily till the novelty wears  off  but fiddling with the who  what  when and where of work doesn t touch the source of the malaise   why  work   changing the place of work to the home is like moving from albania to somalia in search of a better life  flextime is  as the microsoft office joke goes  for professionals who can work any sixty hours a week they want to  it is not for the service sector where the greatest numbers toil  it will not do for fry cooks to flex their time at the lunch hour nor bus drivers at rush hour  job  enrichment  is part pep rally  part painkiller    uplift and aspirin  even workers  control  which most north american managers find unthinkable  is only self-managed servitude  like letting prisoners elect their own guards   for western employers   glasnost  and  perestroika    how soon we forgot those unforgettable words    are too little and too late  measures that would have been applauded by 19th and 20th century socialist and anarchist militants    indeed  it was from them that the consultants cribbed them   at best now meet with sullen indifference  and at worst are taken as signs of weakness  especially for north american bosses   relatively backward in their management style as in most other ways  concessions would only arouse expectations they cannot fulfill and still remain in charge   the democracy movements worldwide have swept aside the small fry  the only enemy is the common enemy  the workplace is the last bastion of authoritarian coercion  disenchantment with work runs as deeply here as did disenchantment with communism in eastern europe  indeed  many were not all that enchanted  with either of them in the first place  why did they submit  why do we  because  as individuals  we have no choice    there is far more evidence of a revolt against work than there had been of a revolt against communism  were it otherwise  there would be no market for tranquilizers like job redesign  job enrichment  the quality of working life  etc  the worker at work  as to a tragic extent off the j ob  is passive-aggressive  not for him  and  especially not for her  the collective solidarity heroics of labor s storied past  but absenteeism  job-jumping  embezzlement of goods and services  self-sedation with drink or drugs  and effort so perfunctory that it may cross the line to count as sabotage   these are the ways the little fish emulate the big fish who  flush from peddling junk bonds  looting savings and loan associations  and extending home loans indiscriminately  let  government bail them out if they can t collect     they triumphantly downsize  outsource and toyota-ize along with new requisitions and repressions which await their neologisms   what if there were a general strike   and it proved permanent because it made no demands  it was already the satisfaction of all demands  there was a time when the unions would have thwarted anything like that  but they don t count any more  someday the bosses may miss them   the future belongs to the  zerowork  movement  the revolt against work   should one well up   unless its object is impossible because work is inevitable  do not even the consultants and the techno-futurologists take work  and so much else  for granted  indeed they do  which is reason enough to be skeptical  they never yet foresaw a future which came to pass  they prophesied moving sidewalks and single-family air-cars  not computers or recombinant dna  their american century was japanese before it was half over   futurologists are always wrong because they are only extrapolators  the limit of their vision is more of the same   although history  the record of previous futures  the graveyard of previous predictions  is replete with discontinuities  with surprises like the personal computer  try to find it anticipated in any science fiction  or eastern europe  try to find any academic and  or intelligence community anticipations of the imminent demise of communism   attend to the utopians instead  the difference between the utopians and the futurologists is the difference between more of the same and something different  since the utopians believe life could be different   and it will   what they say just might be true     work  referring to what workers do  should not be confused with exertion   work  in the physicists  sense  play can be more strenuous than work  in a social sense  work is compulsory production  something done for some other reason than the satisfaction of doing it  that other reason might be violence  slavery  dearth   unemployment  or an internalized compulsion  the calvinist s  calling  the buddhist s  right livelihood  unlike the play impulse  none of  these motives even maximizes our productive potential  work is not very productive  although production is its only justification   enter the consultants with their toys   although it does not have to be  play can be productive  so forced labor may not be necessary  when we work we produce without pleasure so as to consume without creating   containers drained and filled  drained and filled  like the locks of a canal  job enrichment  the phrase implies a  prior condition of job impoverishment which debunks the myth of work as a source of wealth  work devalues life by appropriating something so priceless it cannot be bought back no matter how high the gnp is     life  enrichment  on the other hand  consists of the suppression of many jobs and the recreation  in every sense  of the others as activities intrinsically enjoyable   if not to everyone for any length of time  then for some people  at some times  in some circumstances  work standardizes people as it does products  but since people by nature strive to produce themselves  work wastes effort lost to conflict and stress  play is pluralistic  bringing into play the full panoply of talents and passions submerged by work and anaesthetized by leisure  the work-world frowns on job-jumping  the play-oriented or ludic life encourages hobby- hopping  as their work-conditioning wears off  more and more people will feel more and more aptitudes and appetites unfolding like the colorful wings of a brand-new butterfly  and the ludic mode of production will be the more firmly  consolidated   you say you love your job  fine  keep doing it  your sort will help to tide us over during the transition  we feel sorry for you  but we respect your choice as much as we suspect that it s rooted in your refusal to admit that your present prodigious efforts made life  especially yours  no better  they only made life seem to go by faster  you were coping in your own way  you were hurrying to get it over with   with the abolition of work  the economy is  in effect  abolished also  replacing today s teamsters hauling freight will be welcome wagons visiting friends and bearing gifts  why go to the trouble to buy and sell  too much paperwork  too much  work    although the consultants are inept as reformers  they might make magnificent revolutionaries  they rethink work  whereas workers want to think about anything but  but they must rethink their own jobs first  for them  to transfer their loyalties to the workers might not be too difficult   it s expedient to join the winning side   but they will find it harder to acknowledge that  in the end  the experts on work are the workers who do it  and especially the workers who refuse to ,jzen4d

406,I’m frequently the “bad guy” at my job and I hate it so much,so without getting into too much detail for obvious reasons  i have been wfh due to covid  office job  managing claims  will not specify for what  for a fortune 250 company  been doing this for around 2 5 years    some of the claimants will bitch and complain about the dumbest shit  okay  that happens  they re probably the same people who flip out at the waiter at the restaurant for no reason    but then there are the people who actually have legitimate complaints about the process and like i agree  but i can t tell them i agree or obviously i ll be in trouble for talking shit about my employer  and what s holding up the claim isn t me  personally  not doing my job  it s because i m waiting on another party to submit information  or waiting on someone to finish this review  or waiting on a manager to sign off  or what have you  and i try to tell people  without trying to push the responsibility on the other party  even if it s the truth  just because that s not a good look  this is the process  i m trying to work with you  sorry it s taking so long or this is the way it s working out  etc etc  and constantly  i m just painted as an adversary   you just don t care about helping me or my family   you just want to deny my claim because you don t want to do your job   you re just holding things up because you re lazy and incompetent   this is the worst customer service i ve ever received and i hope you get screwed one day the way you re screwing me  like bro i m just the same as you working some job to get paid and feed myself  i have to follow these rules whether they re dumb to you or not    anyways i don t know if it s due to the pandemic or something but people been extra  spicy  at me lately and it s just starting to wear me down mentally  i try to tell my manager about it and she says she understands but it s just the nature of the job  it has great capacity to help people but sometimes it s just such a long convoluted process that doesn t help anyone at all and it sucks to be on the other end of it too  getting told at least once a week that i ve  ruined someone s life   even if it s not true  and i objectively know that whatever happened isn t really my fault  is starting to get to me  i feel like the nature of the job kind of pits me against the customers  it s giving me so much anxiety and i hate that i have to sit here and take this for 40 hours a week   i know this subreddit is more just to vent about your company or your coworkers rather than customers or something but i wanted to put this here since it s still about work  i know i could just find another job  but as we all know  each job has its own set of crap to deal with  there s also so many other aspects of my job not customer related than i hate such as having everything we do tracked with metrics  having us do the job of 2 people for the earnings of 1  etc but what s been weighing me down lately are the above things    i have off tomorrow through next monday and literally on my lunch break today i was thinking about how i m already dreading coming back to work on tuesday ,k0l2hh

413,I used to think it was weird that I didn't know a lot about most of my friends' careers and jobs.,yet  the next time i would see them or interact with them  i still wouldn't ask or talk about it  i thought that it meant that i just wasn't close enough with them   then  after finding this sub  and others  like latestagecapitalism  i came to realize that i didn't really care a lot about my own job  so why would i care about someone else's  what's more telling  is most people don't voluntarily share this information that often either  because why would they  who wants to talk about the almost 1 3rd of their life that sucks the most    when i did talk with someone who actually liked their job  it was because they had found their passion  of course that didn't mean their jobs weren't still severely flawed  like doctors nurses being dangerously overworked  teachers being criminally underpaid  or scientists having to spend half their time looking for research funds  when you think about it  how many jobs are out there in which you would look forward to showing up to in the morning  and also didn't exploit you in same way or another ,jxt921
414,Months of overtime has killed my enthusiasm for anything,when the pandemic started my work tried to allow people to work less to limit exposure  however within a week it became clear that we were getting far more orders than usual  i work in a distribution center  so fewer than normal work hours quickly became constant overtime that has gone on for months   even when trying to take time off  unpaid because vacation time quickly ran out  i still worked about 40-50 hours a week  recently that turned into 66 hour work weeks as we switched to 11 hour shifts 6 days a week  and in a couple days it will turn into 77 hours a week as we lose that last day off  despite all the hours we're working  the total workload only grows  a week ago we had a backlog of about 700k orders  when i came in today  it was over 1 million  and we haven't even gotten black friday sales  what amazes me is that the company fired over 70 people about a month ago  which was when our backlog began endlessly growing   we're gonna be working 11 hour shifts 7 days a week until new years   and probably more if this year has been an indicator  which means i'm likely to miss christmas with my family  i get no real time for anything  i can maybe play 1 game for an hour or so after eating and bathing  i've already had a breakdown at work  and my supervisors are aware of my mental state   i'm a heavy introvert  and it's super difficult to spend what little time i have with friends because of that  work has completely consumed my life and i hate it so much  this pandemic has either left people destitute and begging for anything that will pay  or it has given those that still work enormous workloads that drain your soul and kill your ability to care for anything   my supervisor gave me a bit of a reprimanding a while ago  and one thing he said that struck out to me was  you just don't seem to care anymore  i'm surprised it took him so long to figure that out  how can i care about my work when i do nothing else  all i do is toss clothing onto a conveyor that will likely disappoint some bratty kid because they got socks for christmas instead of toys  how can anyone care about work like that beyond its ability to pay the bills   i'm looking for work elsewhere right now  but being in a small town makes finding something that pays enough near impossible  it also doesn't help that i'm an extremely inexperienced driver  just bought my first car a week ago and i'm still too scared to go on the highway  oh what i would give for just a month or so of vacation ,jy7kon
415,Is this all there is to life?,i m 18 years old and in may i got my first job which is a shitty 9-5 in a call centre dealing with covid patients  it was okay for the first few months because if i m being honest i was thoroughly enjoying the feeling of a weekly paycheck after years of living off my parents and asking them for money if i ever wanted or needed it    that quickly got old though  around 3 months in i started to become more and more depressed which was manageable until about a month ago  i now wake up every morning annoyed that i didn t die in my sleep and angry that i have to be subjected to 8  hours of being treated like shit by both the people i m calling and the control freak manager i have  i spend the day calling these people and being depressed in between calls  which doesn t last long because i m being constantly watched and can t even slack off for a couple of minutes without being told to get back to work and to explain why i m not on the phone  for years i was so excited to leave school and the entire teacher-student superior-inferior relationship behind yet it s exactly the same in the workplace if not even worse because the consequences aren t detentions and losing lunchtimes but being fired and no longer having an income   by the time i finish work i am exhausted and want to go to sleep but instead i spend the rest of the evening dreading the following morning  i stay up extremely late because i don t want to sleep and be transported at hyper speed to the next morning of depression and self hatred which means i m sleep deprived through the day  i ve been in this job for a little over 6 months  and it s already completely destroyed my will to live  if this is all there is to a life in the workplace i better find a way out or else i ll probably jump off a bridge long before i reach 30 ,jxgi3w

436,What Makes Antiworkers Different.,i was recently thinking about why it is that i don't want to seek out a job like a lot of other people  why the dreams of other people are my nightmares   it clicked  my dad is a guy who likes to work and go to the office  he's always liked his structure being decided for him   i think the reason a lot of us can't stand the thought of a job is because we are truly independent people    i started thinking about my life and i pretty much don't like any form of structure imposed on my life by someone else  this bleeds into friend groups  teams  and just about everything  i want to decide everything for myself and for some people  i can understand why that can be scary  but i'd rather try to find the purpose of my life in myself rather than from a corporation or a religious group   i know there are many reasons people subscribe to antiwork and i also relate to the idea of not being a cash cow for corporations  i hate the idea of working to survive and fund basic necessities don't get me wrong   but does anyone relate to this idea of hating other's imposed authoritarianism in your life ,jykfqa

471,What is being in the army like since there are no wars going on?,like there s no wars going on so what is being in the army like  they probably just train and then chill and relax and do nothing all day because there s no war going on right now right  so it s not like they are in the battlefield risking their lives  so maybe going in the military is the motive for us who don t like work ,jxbhgq

475,No one can force you to work. Have you ever considered quitting your job to live off the land?,for most of human history  humans didnt need money for their survival  they built their homes  collected  cultivated and caught their food  built communities that survived together  i guess at some point money became the center of things  you need money for food  you need money for a house  you need money for clothes  but money in itself doesn't create these things  people do    i believe the idea that we need to rely on companies for our own survival is bs  the idea that we need to work our life away in order to pay for things companies provide is bs    we dont need restaurants  furniture stores  clothing stores  banks  etc  but they're nice to have    i am not saying get rid of these services  but the idea we must rely on them and must work our life away in order to pay for the services they provide bothers me    we have a ton of things that are convenient to us  but we dont need them  most people are capable of creating things  they just dont know how because they have never needed to  some people only know what they learned in school and what they need to know for their job    i remember learning about ancient civilizations in school and being told that how these people lived is just terrible in comparison to the great society we live in now  but lately ive been feeling like the workforce is a prison and that anyone is capable of escaping it if they really want to    i often dream about buying out land and just living off it  i wonder if anyone else has thought of this  creating a community and thriving together ,jyoalq

496,I think I got my boss fired or at least on thin ice. Finally a victory after so many years of crappy injustice!,some of you might know me from this post here   previous story of horrible bosses https www reddit com r lifeadvice comments hrjzl7 cant hold a job because i 27m stand up for my    if you don't  that's okay  i'm just so happy to finally stick it to a boss after months of recording  this boss was for my janitorial job for an elementary school  the one mentioned above that tried to make me drive with company equipment with no compensation whatsoever   my boss continued to do shady things like this as well as other things like     reusing vacuum bags by cutting them open and stapling them shut again   cutting our hours and expecting us to clean 50  more due to the pandemic   refusing to allow someone to call out sick unless they have a fever of 101 4   after i was possibly exposed to covid my gm told me to  come into work anyways and just wear a mask  we can't afford to be a man down while you are being tested    having a meeting of covid regulations such as taking temperatures before you enter a building for work only to have absolutely no one to do it for the employees  not even the school office staff or nursing office knew about this protocol when i went to get temp checked before my shift started the day after the meeting   the list goes on unfortunately but last month was the final straw  i go into work and i find that a classroom is untouched  no dirt  no trash  no signs of anyone being in this room in the last 24 hours  the school had been open that day and the rest of the classrooms were dirty so i call my boss because of covid protocol and because i wasn't told anything of this  i wanted to make sure i was still supposed to check the room and not get possibly infected by covid   before i continue our company has a policy  if there is a positive covid case or even a possibility of covid then the room needs to be left alone for 1-2 days before it is deep cleaned by several staff   i call my boss and ask her what is going on with this abandoned room and thankfully i record the conversation without her knowledge  she goes on saying she is  taking this covid stuff seriously  blah blah blah and that there was a possible covid case with a child  the child's grandmother had contracted the disease and had previously spent the weekend with the grandmother right before she started to show symptoms  my gm then tells me to clean the room anyways because they still have school tomorrow   i remind her of the covid policy she stated during the pandemic team meeting we had  i simply wanted communication because if i hadn't called her to ask i would have never known about this  i even have told her on several occasions that i have multiple auto-immune diseases that puts me at extremely high risk so i could use a warning just in case i need to be extra careful for a specific room  she started getting aggressive saying   well that's your job you are at risk  that's just part of it  and  they don't even tell me half the time what is going on and it's illegal for me to tell you the little girl's name and personal information about her covid test   this turns into an argument going back and forth with each other  her spouting off company policy and when i simply voice my concern she tries to shut me down completely  i was treated like the bad guy and that i was overreacting   i sent the voice recording to corporate hr as some people suggested in the story above and they actually got back to me and opened an investigation  it's been one month since i have heard back from them and i'm thinking about texting my old shift manager to see what is going on  i hope she has been fired or at least reprimanded and is following proper protocols from now on  they have several older staff and they work with children  i sincerely hope that no one gets sick due to her lackadaisical treatment of this pandemic    if people ask  and if it's not against the rules  i might just post the audio file and let you guys hear it if you want   tl dr - my boss was lazy about covid protocols and i record her conversation of blatant lies  reported her to hr and haven't heard from my boss or any other ex staff workers since they opened an investigation ,jyl9ij

514,"""Selling"" is a man made concept and people doing it for a living aren't contributing anything useful.",currently we build enough homes and produce enough food for everyone  but because of our current  man made economic system  simply producing enough for everyone isn't considered to be enough  we're told that even though the homes are built and the food is grown  there is more work that  needs  to be done  according to them  we need to  sell  these things  something that nature isn't actually asking us to do    nature is asking us to grow things  build things  distribute things  teach others  protect others  but never  sell things to others  selling is a man made concept that does not replace any function of nature needed for the survival  growth or well being of our species  every salesman  stockbroker  banker  business owner and landlord is not contributing to to our species in any necessary way    nature doesn't care how you believe things  should be  once a home is built or food is grown   that was the work  the required work is now totally over  beyond distributing it to those in need  no more work is required for that item once it exists in it's completed form  countless humans spend their entire lives doing things that nature isn't even asking of us    no one on  r antiwork believes that  everyone should have to work while a few of us sit on our asses  if you think that then you missed our point completely  we're anti  unnecessary work  leading to unnecessary forced labour  no one here  not once  has ever suggested certain things aren't required by nature in order for our species to survive and flourish  and yet somehow that always seems to be the common straw man argument used against us  this misunderstanding is so common that it's rare to be able to have a conversation about this without being hit with classic questions like   but who's gonna grow the food  who will build homes  you don't think hospitals should exist  do you want to go back to being hunter gatherers    like yeah guys  you got us  all 195 000  of us are actually just  super  into foraging    they rarely have an actual understanding of our claims or position  and because many of them are so triggered by their own straw man arguments  they never actually stop to listen to what we're actually saying  our position has never been  and never will be that  no types of work are necessary  our point has always been that the current economic system creates  made up jobs  that aren't actually necessary for any natural purpose  they exist only as a means of supporting yourself in man made system for no other reason than to support yourself in the man made system  once you eliminate all the jobs that aren't required by nature  for example  selling  then we could easily eliminate massive amounts of unnecessary labour    we're allowing nature to determine for us what is and is not required for the survival of our species  as far as nature is concerned  once something is built or grown  it can then be considered completed  the fact that our man made economic system then says  no  more work is required by people before we distribute these things is irrelevant to the way nature actually works   by defending a system that is making people perform jobs that nature does not require in order to survive  you're creating a world where empty homes outnumber the homeless by  6 to 1 https www huffpost com entry post 733 b 692546  you're creating a world where we can fill grocery stores with food  and end up throwing much of it out  ignoring the people sitting directly outside of those stores desperately needing it  nature is not requiring them to  earn it  humanity already earned it by producing it    we're not anti-work in the sense that we think no work ever has to be done  we're anti-work in the sense that we realize that we're already producing more than enough for everyone  without the need for  every single person  to be  doing something  for no other reason other than to convince others that they deserve things that have already been produced     everyone must work or die   isn't  actually how nature works  it's how your man made system works    if you believe that a man made concept like selling things should determine if people get food  water and shelter  then you have no right to complain about having to take care of people who don't have the essentials of a human life  we could easily make sure everyone's needs are met without the majority of people ever moving a muscle  but by defending this system you're creating unnecessary poverty  so people like you will have to pay for their spot via taxation  whining that you don't want to pay for the  lazy  people to get a free ride is ironic because nature isn't even asking you to  by giving the middle finger to nature and allowing man made concepts to determine who and who does not get treated equally  you signed up to live in a world surrounded by people in need for no reason other than selfishness and ignorance    this is why so many posts on  r leopardsatemyface are capitalists complaining about how their own system  that they vote for and defend works  by not stopping the required work where nature allows us to stop it  you're creating all the issues in your system that you hate so much like  leeches  if you don't like living in a world that has so many people in need  don't support a system that creates and accepts poverty when we already produce enough to eliminate it   we could easily live in a world where very few people have to work in order for our species to thrive  but you don't want that  you want people to work made up jobs in order to survive because you're delusional enough to think that's how it  has to be  despite living in a post scarcity society  you want to create more work than what is required by nature  once the actual work is done to produce what is needed  you think it  shouldn't  be distributed immediately like nature allows  nature isn't asking everyone to work  only the people who defend this man made economic system are asking that of everyone  and guess what    we're not going to   regardless of our refusal  there will still be enough food  water and shelters for everyone  that's why people who refuse to work don't feel bad at all for doing nothing  we know for a fact that society is already over producing enough for everyone without needing our help  we can see clearly that the majority of people who take part in this system aren't actually doing things required by nature  so in reality  they're contributing the exact same amount as we are   nothing ,jxvkrr

they descended  since they must thus have all their time free to watch over the interests of the republic  with their mental and bodily strength  they laid all labor upon the slaves  likewise at

for as xenophon observed   work takes all the time and with it one has no leisure for the republic and his friends  according to plutarch  the great claim of lycurgus  wisest of men  to the admiration of posterity  was that he had granted leisure to the citizens of sparta by forbidding to them any trade whatever  but our moralists of christianity and capitalism will answer   these thinkers and philosophers praised the institution of slavery  perfectly true  but could it have been otherwise  granted the economic and political conditions of their epoch  war was the normal state of ancient societies  the free man was obliged to devote his time to discussing the affairs of state and watching over its defense  the trades were then too primitive and clumsy for those practicing them to exercise their birth-right of soldier and citizen  thus the philosophers and law-givers  if they wished to have warriors and citizens in their heroic republics  were obliged to tolerate slaves  but do not the moralists and economists of capitalism praise wage labor  the modern slavery  and to what men does the capitalist slavery give leisure  to people like rothschild  schneider  and madame

596,Former boss's twisted view of work,at a former employer  my boss's wife was pregnant with their 2nd child  it's uncommon  but it's possible for a father and a mother to create a child whose blood type is incompatible with the mother's blood type  i mention this because that was the situation they were in    that condition is manageable if they do regular transfusions for the baby  don't ask me details because i'm no doctor  on one particular occasion they had to go in for an emergency procedure and nearly lost the baby  then a few weeks later  the baby was born very prematurely and had to stay at the neonatal icu for a few weeks    after those weeks had passed  baby was doing better than expected and got to go home sooner than they had anticipated  i'll never forget  it was a tuesday   my boss came to work at his normal time that day and left late morning to pick up his new baby with his wife  he drove the 25-ish miles to the hospital  drove the 35-ish miles back home then  dropped off his wife and baby  and drove back into work   i told my gf at the time that story and she said she would've divorced me on the spot  i left that employer for that and a litany of other reasons  it was clear to me that to get ahead there you had to put the company before literally your own family and that's just not something i could offer ,jvmv9l

605,"I can't get through the workday without crying, I don't know what I did wrong. I need advice",in october  i got fired from a job i loved  i was a pc repair tech at a local store  i had surgery in september  even returned sooner than expected  and walked in to find my replacement  sitting right there  next to my desk  i thought nothing of it and sat down and started fixing machines  only to be dragged away from my work by the higher ups at the company because they  didn't want two new people  i had been there for 3 months  in the same room   they assigned me to salvage and get what i could out of the machines that people had brought in to be recycled  at first one of them told me to just pull anything with valuable metal out of the machines  mostly the ram and motherboards  if it wouldn't take me too long  they said i could return to fixing machines after the recycling room had been dealt with and all the  new hires  could have a  training day  where they trained us  on the phones   i had been using the phones with no issues since shortly after i started there   then  someone else came to me and assigned me to salvage the machines by  determining what's worth refurbishing and what isn't  and that  i had to make the company 3x what they paid me  i made 11  an hour  i said i would try my best  i've never even used ebay in my life  and got to it  they told me to even load the machines with operating systems if i could  a 2-4 hour process for each machine  i would have to run diagnostics  replace  or decide not to replace  whatever was fucked  and then load the os   oh by the way i had to set up a new desk in a back room because i wasn't supposed to be in the same room as the new hire  i refurbished and set up the desk myself with one of the salvage machines  even redid the networking  that took a whole day   so i'm going through these machines and start sounding the alarm bells  there are maybe 10 machines in the recycling room actually worth anything  and they were worth maybe 100-200  fully loaded with an os and entirely undamaged  i start sounding the alarm bells  i want to make it clear to the people above me that this is a situation set up for failure   one of the higher ups who i was under command of had a tendency to ramble in paragraphs and go off on tangents  they also were not a tech oriented person  they just happened to own the place  they blasted me for bringing this situation to their attention telling me they  have a plan  and that i  don't know their business model   eventually they had a moment of clarity and told me that they wanted me to just sell the machines regardless of how much they are worth  just to get rid of them  oh and they revealed that loading up the machines with operating systems  again a 2-4 hour task per machine  was just to   and i shit you not  keep me stimulated  what they really wanted was just an excel spreadsheet with the worth of every machine on it   what the fuck   so i spend the next day making the excel spreadsheet and hand it in  the next day they tell me to come in at noon  i do  and they fire me   and that was the end of that job  i was barely scraping by on 11  an hour but i was happy  i was fulfilled  i had a purpose   so i start looking for a new job  thinking about shooting for something in it  i like computers  i even went out and did half of my a   and that brings me to my  current  job  i accepted a job as a help desk tech for a grocery store and  i hate it  i fucking despise it  i can't even keep it together at my desk   i don't understand  it should be cool  i'm in charge of everything that has a circuit at every store   i drive the spaceship   i hate it  the most i can do on my end is reboot something  anything further than that usually needs a tech from a company that we outsource to  they have to go to the store and replace the part  and i hate talking on the phones so much  this job  despite being tangentially related to my previous job that i really love  has totally beaten me down   i don't even know why  the people are nice  they say i'm really good at it  but i feel like i'm in a cage  that cold  gray cubicle  i can't even put anything nice on it  because seating isn't assigned  and i have to spend ten hours a day  on a 4 day  3 day schedule  staring at this screen  and the furthest i can go with any issue is just rebooting something   i thought i would be a good fit  i think it's my adhd or something  i think  ironically enough  that i need to be stimulated  i dunno  i was just thinking  maybe what i should have taken away from my previous job is that i like the  repair tech  part  not that i like the  pc  part   i don't know what to do  i had to take many breaks to the bathroom today to go cry  i just lost it as soon as i got to my car  my parents are being really supportive and they told me that it isn't worth it  to just quit  they'll help me   but that doesn't solve that in it  as you go further and further up  you do less and less hardware  i don't want that  i want the reverse  i want to eventually work up to louis rossmann levels of depth with the repair  at least as long as i'm doing this and not my main love which is music   i'm definitely calling out tomorrow  and probably quitting full stop after that  but i feel like such a failure  i'm not against working an honest job  i felt like my bench tech job  at least when i was actually fixing stuff  was healthy  i was taking walks during my lunch break  meditating before my shift  it was great  now i'm so low i would be considering hurting myself if i didn't have my girlfriend here to keep me tethered   where do i even go from here  i obviously can't progress any further in it because the starting point  is  help desk  that's just what you have to do  i think i have to work with my hands and use my noggin to be satisfied  i can't just sit at a cubicle all day   like i said i could extrapolate on the  repair tech  part  but i don't know how  or what field i would even go into  i wanted to get my a amp p but i didn't feel ready to drop 45k on the program   i just feel like such a bum  my job is easy  all i have to do is hit the reboot button and then call and tell them  welp that didn't work  time to send a tech  but it feels like the tasks from among us  just dragging and dropping and clicking and ugh   thanks for reading  sorry for the rant ,jw8mtx

612,"If you believe taking part in an economic system that had your lifestyle predetermined for you is ""freedom,"" then I WANT you to think I'm stupid.",because i honestly think same of you   i'm not sure most people have recognized and accepted that some of us really don't hold traditional values when it comes to things like work and money anymore  to the point that we're not ever going to take part in this system  when it comes to what a successful life looks like  more and more people will be teaching their children the exact opposite values compared to those we received growing up  it's not just something we talk about or believe without acting upon  we're actually opting out for good now  regardless of the consequences  in fact  having unnecessary consequences in a man made  post scarcity system is why we're opting out to begin with  will this have a immediate effect on the economy or system   nope  but none of us are delusional enough to think that ignorance on a scale this massive can be destroyed quickly or easily    though i'm personally an  emanationist https en wikipedia org wiki emanationism  not a atheist  i believe that the growth of atheism is a good comparison when it comes to idea's like anti-work or anarchism  20 years ago  atheism was a pretty obscure concept for many people  atheists existed  but many were closeted and really had no way to communicate with others who held the same beliefs  two decades later and atheism can no longer be considered a niche topic  we have subs like  r atheism with 2 million subscribers  and huge increases statistically in the amount of people who no longer identify with any religion  the number of atheists has  doubled https www barna com rise-of-atheism  since 2003  that's a significant increase  and it's only going to continue to grow    clearly it can take a long time for niche ideas to gain traction  but once the seed is planted  they can absolutely have a snowball effect  i admit that as people who don't hold the belief that giving up our lives to work is necessarily  succeeding  we have a long way to go  we're still in the growing process for sure  i don't think we can say we've won until every single human is able to choose for themselves how they live their lives  without being threatened by economic fascism  until every entity brought into this world has an actual choice  rather than a predetermined lifestyle  we're going to have to fight    i honestly don't know if any of us will live in a free country in our lifetimes  ignorance may reign supreme for the foreseeable future  but regardless we should absolutely do what we can to help fight for true freedom  even if it feels like kicking sand at the waves  i know it can seem like a battle that is impossible to win  but acting uncaring and purposefully ignorant towards important issues to get us to feel hopeless is part of why fascists are getting their way currently  just use their indifference and ignorance against them  use it as fuel to fight for a free world  the fact that so many people tell you it can't happen should only make you more passionate to spread truth   i've learned to actually enjoy being so directly opposed to the way most people think  this is because even though they will claim otherwise  we can affect them  i know because i get  made fun of https redd it iq0if8  enough by conservative subs to see just how much they dislike hearing what people like us have to say  they know that many people in the coming generations are going to hold the  exact opposite values  as they do  some of them are even willing to  admit it https i imgur com wpchldd png  and they are not happy about it   they know that as time goes on humans are going to become less and less persuaded by propaganda  and that eventually the scales will start to tip in our direction  some of us are already here  just waiting  call it larping if you want  make fun of us  because like the title states  i want anyone on the side of fascism to think negatively about me  i want people who think money has more value than human life to think there is something wrong with me  because i think there is something wrong with them  i actually don't value their currency at all  i truthfully do not do things in exchange for money  and it makes me proud when i find people who refuse to believe that    someone in the thread linked above stated that people like me  would do anything if offered 10k https i imgur com ovvs8z0 png  that comment made me smile  because it proves that many people honestly don't understand yet that they live in a world where some people literally don't value their way of life to  any degree  anymore  they are so accustomed to money having power that can't accept people like us even exist     to anyone downplaying ideas like anti-work and anarchism   thank you  for your ignorance  by refusing to take these ideas seriously  you're allowing them to grow faster  with much less resistance  downplay all you want  but understand that you really do look as stupid to us as we do to you  know that many people now hold the opposite belief about what a successful life looks like  understand that as time goes on  we're not going to shrink in numbers  we're going to grow and grow until eventually what was once a niche concept will become impossible to ignore  if you want to ignore us for now  go for it  but we're not going to ignore you  we're completely and totally aware of just how big of a threat fascism is to freedom  and we're  definitely  going to be pointing it out to as many people as we can until the values you hold so dear are seen in the same archaic light as slavery   i know that you're going claim to be on the side of freedom  right up until people try to live in ways that go against your values and way of life  i've said it before and i'll say it again  conservatives and capitalists  hate  true freedom with a passion  they will stop as nothing to make sure  their  way of life and  their  values are protected  even if it means destroying the lives  freedoms and values of the person next to them  they want the capitalist way to be the only way  and anyone going against this to be mocked and left to die  they absolutely do not want you to have the freedom to wake up each day and live your life the way that doesn't match their worldview  i'm not being sarcastic when i say they are actually directly and openly opposed to real freedom    this is why they love  freedom  propaganda so much  it's comforting to tell themselves they're not what we say they are  this is why they're able to call fascism  freedom  without hesitation  this is why they can actually think they are on the right side when they fight against anti-fascists  they are actually willing to admit that they are  pro-fascism  it should not be understated how terrifying that is  masses of humans who are admitting that they think fascism is a  good thing  propaganda should never  ever be taken lightly  it is clearly extremely dangerous  and it allows people to hide truths and convince otherwise normal and good people of horrendous things    it's exactly like the proud boys changing  leaders  from a open racist  to a  black-hispanic american https www wnd com 2020 10 black-proud-boys-leader-not-white-supremacists-can-see  they knew how people perceived them  so they tried to mask the truth  but anyone with half a brain knows that they just confirmed what everyone already knew  it's the same thing as claiming to  love freedom  while also openly declaring that people should have to take part in capitalism or die  by calling economic fascism  freedom  they are doing the same thing the proud boys did  they are admitting the truth by trying to hide it    they don't have a choice  if they want to preserve their way of life then they  have to  hide what they believe  because if they don't  people will realize very quickly which side is actually fighting for freedom  if that happens  things would start to shift in a direction they desperately don't want  they will absolutely fight to conserve their system  their values  even if it means lying to themselves and others about what they actually want and believe  the good news is that with enough time and people telling the truth  lies this big  always die  tribalism  slavery  feudalism  all dead  capitalism is next on the list  both sides are becoming more hostile because both sides know that the truth is out in the open now  you either accept that you're against anti-fascism  making you a fascist  or you accept that you are surrounded by fascists  regardless of the side you're on  that is a ugly truth    though i'm not defending him or his actions  i think in many ways trump accidentally played big role in helping people see that ugly truth  many people didn't even care about politics before this election  but his willingness to be cruel and proud has opened the eyes of many people  he backed a openly racist group during a presidential debate  obviously disgusting  but things like that did significantly more bad than good for his own side  he showed us all that people like him really will do anything it takes to protect their way of life  no matter the cost  regardless of truth  he  sped up  the transition to a world where people like himself no longer have power  just by being himself  his side got trapped and they were forced to admit that they are proud pro-fascists who believe nothing is more important than preserving their way of life    they really don't care if it means lying  defending racism or spitting in the face of freedom  they don't care if it means people will go without food and water  that it will mean letting children sleep in cars and tents with their parents rather than homes  that there will continue to be unprecedented amounts of suicide  crime and unhealthy lifestyles leading to countless early deaths  they can't care  because to them  their system  their way of life  has to come first  no matter what    i read an article about journalist who witnessed a homeless man in new york about to commit suicide by jumping onto subway tracks  people started yelling at him  not to save his life because it was the right thing to do  but yelling because they thought it was selfish of him to consider suicide in this way as it would make them  late to work  the journalist was shocked by their heartlessness  but i'm not  because i know that to them  their system is more important than doing the right thing  it's more important than the truth  it's more important than a human life     their system means everything to them  so it should mean nothing to us ,jwas4n

Maybe writing this out will make feel better.,my job has me feeling worthless  nothing but a number  overworked  underpaid  under appreciated  and less than a human tbh   i ve been the only person on staff since  july  yup just me taking own the load of two other people  everything rests on my shoulder    as for many people  this year has been hard  who cares if we re in a pandemic  who cares if we re such in a divisive time in the country  who cares if you on the brink of a mental breakdown  who cares  if you re in tears before your 10am daily zoom meeting  you just need to go to work  pretend to be happy  make the owner money  but wear a mask of course    last night i was absolutely sick  shivering in bed  sweating up a storm  but guess what  i can t call out because i m the only one on staff  why not use a sick day  well i only have two sick days per year  i don t go  i can t pay rent   i think that was the lowest point of my life  when you realize that your are nothing  i just need to be awake by 6 15am  catch the subway  and be in the office by 7am to make other people money    before the pandemic  i was working at a job that i absolutely loved  living out my passion    now i work in a  wellness facility  that offers no health care plan  and gives you two sick days per year  pretty ironic   thanks for listening  most people tell me that i should be lucky i have a job anyway ,jx6eyr
624,COVID = Bad performance,was just told i m doing too much by a coworker  which hit me in the feels pretty hard  i don t perceive it that way because the bosses expect more   a week ago i had a mid-year performance review  where it was written in the final comments that i m  trending towards an unsuccessful year  however this contradicted every thing said in that review  without context it would be read as a significant improvement to last year  however i m casted this year as behind in my project  which is mainly do to a month of covid furlough and a hacker virus that set us back predictable two months in total  i m being  asked to catch up two month of work or underperform  working ot every saturday  the pay is nice but fml ,jwk2xo
625,Lunch Hour Meetings,i work in a very typical wage slave corp job  microsoft excel from the second i wake up until the second i sleep  my boss has meetings essentially from 9am to 6pm every day  so the only time he has to speak to me is when everyone else is at lunch  he sets aside 12 00 - 1 30 essentially every day to have meetings with me    i m sort of at a loss for words  do i need to tell him why this isn t cool  wouldn t he have to be dumb to not know  i m not even sure what i d say other than  please  may i eat lunch today ,jwa5x1
626,Work doesn't value you,i am the only female who graduated college in my entire family tree  i am also the only engineer  college was really fun for me because i loved learning about circuits and electromagnetism and all the nerdy engineering stuff you can think of  still wasn't the best student though  after graduation i got into my dream job  a pretty prestigious company  i had ambition so i worked as hard as i could and i wanted to climb that ladder and i honestly enjoyed it because i was with a great team  i met my boyfriend through work and when we started dating he would tell me about his frustration about working  not just his current job but working in general  his current job was also his dream job so he thought he'd be treated better than his 2 other jobs that overworked him  i didn't quite understand why he was so upset about working and honestly thought he just needed a day off to relax  then alas  the real culture around work was starting to unravel before me    1  i had a coworker stalk me at work  he sat next to me  and at home  he lived next to me too  i reported it to hr  i was quite heartbroken by how i was treated by them  long story short  they didn't see him as a threat and moved his desk one row down  a couple months later a friend who works in the same company reported him to hr because he was stalking his gf  she was treated the same way    2  the project i loved so much shut down and i had to join another team  the team lead for that project overworked everyone and verbally harassed certain people in the team and it was uncomfortable so i reported him to hr  he's slightly better  but he still gets away with a lot    3  i worked my ass off the first couple years and my name had been going around as  the person who does electrical drawings  i became the expert in a certain subject and worked overtime every week to help out a bunch of projects including my main project  i haven't gotten a raise once or a promotion    there are other things but the list would be too long  i now understand my boyfriend  i now have opened my eyes to the toxicity of the culture  we are seen and treated as replaceable resources  we are told by work that we are a family  yet we can easily be disposed of  you might say i'm feeling this way because it's my first job  but changing jobs only delays the feeling  even though there was a time i enjoyed working  i am still grateful to have opened my eyes to everything wrong with the culture ,jwkk0j
627,Role models who aren't ruled by their work/don't tie their self worth to their work,hi guys   i hope i'm not in the wrong place   i just got out of a really heavy therapy session  and one of the things i struggle with the most is my self worth  there are a lot of things at factor for that but one of the biggest contributing factors is how much i work   i grew up in a house where working hard  and putting your health at risk for the sake of your work was valued  we're all workaholics to the worst degree  i am looking for role models people i can look at when i'm feeling overwhelmed by my sense of guilt for not wanting a hectic life   do you all have any suggestions ,jw4jfn

642,I'm surprised we haven't abolished paying people hourly and started paying people salaried instead.,before you downvote me i'll admit this is us-centric since i am from the usa but some things may apply to your country if you are outside of the usa and i am not advocating that this happens because this is a terrible idea but i feel it is the way we are heading  i'll admit this is a re-post from another sub  lostgeneration  but i'll make some minor tweaks  here's why     the vast majority of health insurance in the usa is tied to employment  since you technically aren't ever really off if you are salaried  employers could get more intrusive about your personal decisions like how you take care of yourself and what you eat  if you don't work out etc  i'm aware some companies have certain  perks  if you do certain things though  but i could see things getting really nuts if they aren't there already  i remember when i worked at my first job out of the military  some brand new high school graduate in my training class told me i should not drink so much soda and i drank a lot in the class to keep me awake because it was boring as shit  was it healthy  probably not but i needed something to keep me awake  i'm not a bad-ass or tough guy by any means but i politely let her know i was thankful for her concern and if you are going to be nosy and judgy you might want to say something to the guy who just spoke to our class who is 250-300  lbs     working at home has become more common lately for obvious reasons  i wonder if anyone is getting harassed  off the clock  or working longer or harder  even prior to covid i have heard it is getting more common for employers to bug people off the clock     the minimum salary for exempt employees i believe went up then went back down or the proposed increased minimums never were passed into law  regardless it's pretty damn low   yes  some fields like the majority of new jobs created in the past few years prior to covid have been low-wage  low-skilled service jobs like fast food and retail  it makes sense those jobs are hourly because if it's slow or something and send people home or cut hours if sales are down but i'm surprised none of the big companies have lobbied to keep minimum wage the same  correct me if i am wrong  because if you took the federal minimum wage  times it by 40 hours and 52 weeks in a year you get  15 080  that's best case scenario if you get full-time hours  plus some of those workers are  essential  and i can see the companies claiming all their employees are  heroes  and want to  serve  the populace   walmart is the biggest employer in the usa and their minimum salary for hourly workers is  11 an hour  higher in areas where the minimum wage is higher but they don't pay that much more  and if you times that by 40 hours and 52 weeks a year you get  22 880 a year  obviously not all employees are full time and some jobs pay more and your pay may go up based on years of service but lets say you are at  11 an hour and  lets reduce the hours to 28 in a week and you get  16 016  yes  it is a little bit more than what the federal minimum wage is right now if they worked forty hours a week but i'm surprised corporations haven't lobbied to abolish hourly wage and make people salaried  they'd save money from not having to pay overtime and they would be able to work you to the bone if they wanted and when things got crazy since all of their employees are  heroes  and want to  serve  according to their ceo ,jwu8f4

644,Just left my WFH job that poisoned my outlook on life (or maybe enlightened me?) and often made me want to kill myself. Let's see how that goes,our performance is graded on customer surveys which it took me a very short time to realize  are horrible metrics for performance because they are completely based on luck  a customer can have a great experience but be an 80 year old with memory issues who confuses your survey for another and grades you harshly  you can get a bad survey for a previous person setting false expectations for the customer or misinforming them  you can get a bad survey for something that is 100  not your fault like a customer dropping their phone down an oil well    i realized that this mirrors real life to a depressing degree  everything is decided by luck and and the belief that you can do whatever you put your mind to  all that other saccharine bullshit is only peddled by the ones that got lucky  that very belief is the most destructive thing in the whole of humankind because all it does it lead people off cliffs ,jvu0h7

670,Just got a job offer from a company that ghosted me months ago,i applied for a job and got an interview in july  the interview went well but i didn't hear back from them at all  not even a rejection  yesterday i got an email for a job offer for something that has opened up out of nowhere  but i'm not going to take it because it's kinda far away and i already have a higher paying job  i'm also thinking they are underpaying or mistreating the workers considering i'm actually a little under qualified  it's an education job  but i am qualified in another field  and it's strange to me that they are desperate enough to hire me lol   anyway not sure if i should reply telling them i don't want the job or if i should just ghost them like they ghosted me months ago,juc2bz

672,On reducing the workweek,hi   as far as i see most people take 40h workweek for granted  that leads to wanting to make more jobs to end poverty  so  my question is why nobody talks about making the workweek shorter and then just having more shifts  for example  8h could get reduced to 6h  so that there is one more shift  that way a plethora of new places to work would arise    there must be a reason why nobody talks about that  as far as i see the reason can't be that the economy would come into troubles because the same amount of goods would be produced  there just would be more people working on it  maybe it would make the work even more productive  and no bullshit jobs  however  it might be the case that salaries would change and become closer to each other  so that some people would get angry because they have less money than before  that's as far as i see the only logical reason for rejecting that idea if we neglect conspiracies  however  i would love to hear what others think  are there any other objections   also  i must say that i don't know much about economics  i came to the argument above just by common sense  and by comparison of that potential world and the current one  i don't see that anything could be worse in that potential world than in the current one  basically the argument is the following           premise 1 - compare the world with the reduced workweek with the current one  there is nothing different from the economics side        premise 2 - people would love to have more free time       premise 3 - jobs affect only economies and people's wellbeing             conclusion - having the reduced workweek is better than having the current one    so  as far as i see people could object four things here      1  premise 1  - as i have already said i am not knowleadgeable about economics  so i may be wrong  i would love to hear opinions of others  however  i think that it is just common sense  if nothing ceases to be produced  economy stays the same       2  premise 2  - i know that some people would argue that people in general are not that able to spend time on their own  i e  freedom and free time is dangerous  kinda brave new world thinking          3  premise 3  - i may be wrong here  but i don't see anything other currently      4  coming to conclusion  - i think that there is nothing to disagree with here  the things are pretty obvious  if we compare two things and they are the same in every aspect except one of them where the new one is better  then it is obvious that the new one is better in general  however  one might say that the number of people who would get angry for having worse salaries is greater than the number of people who want freedom  i think that argument would lead to the discussion luxury vs neccesity  what is luxury  what is neccesity etc  and it may be personal  but in my opinion neccesities are a lot more important than luxury  i e  luxury shouldn't even exist until everybody has a clear respectable way to get neccesities   tell me if i'm missing something  i would love to hear the reasons for people not mentioning that idea that much    have a peaceful day ,jui0ao

691,Toxic environment: my story,i would like to share my story  need all these feelings getting out of my chest  i am working in marketing  and one and half year ago i joined a company  at the beginning the management looked normal  i wasn t impressed by some of their choices but not a reason to quit  over the last 7 months it became a nightmare and home office did not help  zoom calls  community s calls  hours and hours spent in front of the cam to slow down the workflow  they hired a new member in the management  this person became my nightmare  setting up unrealistic targets with ridiculous bonus system  i ended up with doing most or all of the tasks this person was supposed to do  preparing also every time presentations that he she will need to present to the big boss and shortly having a glance at all the things i have done without any help  he she is also impossible to please  and had hard time even for taking decisions for the smallest things that normally wouldn t take to me much of my time to get these done efficiently  we have community meetings where the big heads blame the teams for lack of ownership  never questioning themselves  during these meetings you are forced to share with everyone where you failed even if you don t necessarily thing you failed  they can be up to 4-7 hours zoom calls  i work in the middle management and i am realizing more and more that this means do all the job that others above you should do  but they love to call it flat hierarchy  without any gratification  they tell you to be vocal but if you open your mouth they treat you like a fool  they tell you you want to be part of the problem and not of the solution   i started having panic attacks  insomnia  my mood was going down especially over the weekend  i tried to reach out people on upper positions to look for help and they ghosted me  even if they were appreciating my work  it s sad because i used to love my job but the environment is completely toxic and i just can t go back to it anymore  my body and mind are refusing to accept it  every day i tell myself i deserve more  they shouldn t decide for me and my health  but it s so depressing seeing how companies are exploiting their employees  now even more during pandemic  giving you zero support or understanding ,juiv05

(serious post, I am genuinely curious)",so i guess i should preface this in a way  my partner and i are very lucky  not that we were born into wealth  we weren't  but that we are lucky enough to live in a country will good social security and socialised healthcare  both just happened to specialise into very in demand and high paying fields that don't require full time work or any expensive university college education that allows us to spend a majority of our time at home with our family  when i work i work long hours  60-72 a week  for 2-3 months at a time a typically spend the rest of the year not working  while my partner only works 6-20 hours a week running her own business  and that allows us to live a very comfortable upper middle class lifestyle      so that's out of the way  we're very lucky not having to work minimum wage 40 or more hours a week each just to get by      but i'm wondering what's the idea with anti work  is it to live off the land and your own labour  that would require a lot more work then most off of spend at any job  or is it to live off of social security  is it to go towards a socialised society where everyone is provided for equally regardless of job or social status  is it anti capitalism where you don't want to work for pennies making the boss rich      a completely work free society can't be the goal  even if your not working for the man and doing it yourself  you'd still need to get food and shelter and everything else and that requires work  its just not paid      so anti workers  what are you for and against  i genuinely want to know ,jujhyr

748,Constantly thinking of quitting new job.,let's be real  i'm basically a receptionist and there are also 5 other people in my same position  our shift system is 9-5pm  5pm-1am and 1am-9am  which is absolutely ridiculous especially since my country has a curfew in effect for everyone and that starts at 10pm    my job is also at least 30  bullshit  i'm supposed to call persons coming in  on later shifts  at least one hour before they are scheduled to come in to remind them  answer the phone  log people in and out  complete a bunch of bullshit logs  telephone  visitors  receptionist shift log  delivery    i can get scheduled for a double shift and then get scheduled to come in 8 hours later   i don't understand why because i'm not a fucking doctor  i've been at it for about two weeks and i am exhausted even though the work is me just sitting there for 8 hours watching tv or sleeping    1  the night shift would be so unecessary if they implemented a logging in system that involved swiping your id card or a thumb print    2  no one calls in the night so why do i need to answer the phone    3  50  of the documentation i need to complete is absolutely unecessary    4  even though i provide  wake up calls  people are still late  why do i have to remind people to come to work  are they not also adults  no one is reminding me    i'm literally only doing this job for the money but everytime i think of going to work i want to cry and i'm not sure it's worth it   edit  also my company employs a driver for persons doing these late shifts but you can't use him  he doesn't want to come for you at 1am   the driver is not a benefit  my boss said  i share a car and sometimes i can't use it because the other person needs to  i don't understand why the driver can opt not to do his job but i can't  i would also like to be asleep at 1 am   edit 2  they  layed off  the hr department because of covid ,juqbz9

753,Just watched the movie The Assistant and felt sick,that's a movie about the assistant of an executive in the film industry  the movie is focused in a full day of work of the assistant in the office   the boss is a cheating psycopath who takes advantage of young women  asking for sexual favours in turn of positions in movies or whatever they do  the focus was more on the assistant girl and how she felt about seeing the man trick young women and nobody give a shit about it  he didn't sexually harass her but he bullied her  called her incompetent  said she was worthless  stuff like that and in the end she had to apologize to him by email and say how much she was thankful he gave her that opportunity  she had to do tasks that were obviously below her position  like cleaning the garbage of the boss office after a meeting  talking to his angry rude wife and cleaning what appeared to be sperm from the couch of the boss office  to avoid vomiting  i just told myself it was some food he dropped there     her coworkers didn't seem to care much  for them it appeared it was just another normal day  not a big deal  she went to hr complain about how the boss was having sexual encounters in the office and preying on women and the guy from hr discouraged her from filling a complaint  ridiculed her  accused her of making a fuss because she was jealous the boss didn't give her attention  made an innappropriate condescending remark about her apperance and then called her coworkers and the boss saying she went there  the hr    also she arrived very early in the morning  way before 8h  and only left way into the night when the boss said he didn't need her anymore  she had to work weekends  ate lunch  a sandwich  at her desk and dinner was frozen microwave food  everyone in the office was just burried in their computers and phones and all the interactions just seemed cold and artifitial  it almost seemed like a personality cult where everyone was corcerned about what the big boss was doing  at what time he would arrive  where he was  who he was meeting  he btw arrived after 10  the assistant arrived way before 8am  left when he wanted  including  he left to go abbuse a young girl and missed an important work meeting leaving the potential partners furious  so not only a disgusting cheater  but also incompetent and disrespectful  one of guys from the company was the one who was called to put out the fire everytime things were burning and he was treated as just another employee  didn't get the recognition he deserved    so it's fair to say  i just watched an horror movie because honestly all that corporate atmosphere just made me sick the entire time    i just wonder  is it possible to be jobs in the world that are so bad as what was pictured in the movie  is the corporate atmosphere in the us like that ,jvigy4

759,I went across the counter on a woman and tried to slap her at my first job ...,i worked in a little family owned restaurant at the time  first job i'd ever really had - except for being a cashier for 2 days at a dead end grocery job   had a lady come in one night and order a couple of burgers and some fries to go  then sat down on the bench to wait for them   as soon as she sat down  a busload of baseball players  kids  and their parents arrived and we were slammed  the lady's order came up while i was in the middle of taking a bunch of orders and i called out the order but she didn't respond so i set it over on our little to go table because honestly i'd forgotten the order after being bombarded by about 30 kids and their parents all at once  most of them were only ordering ice cream but some got food   when everybody had cleared away from the counter and the chaos had settled down a bit  the lady walked up to the counter and was like   where the hell is my food  and i asked her what she had ordered  she said   the burgers and fries  in a very  duh  tone  i said   oh yeah  they're over here  let me get them for you  i called out the order but you didn't answer so i set them over here    meanwhile  her order had only been on the table for about 5-6 minutes   she took the bag from me and sneered at me before leaving  three minutes later  she's peeling back into the parking lot  barely gets her car parked  leaves it running and comes storming back inside to yell at me that her food is cold   i assured her that the food couldn't be cold because it was in a styrofoam box and honestly hadn't been on the table longer than 5 minutes  she insisted that i touch it and see how ice cold it was  i touched the burger and it was warm  i told her again that it was warm  but if she wanted  we could replace it   she was like   don't bother  you were too r tarded to get the first order right  i don't have time for you to fuck up the second one    my supervisor came from the kitchen in time to grab me by the back of the shirt and pull me away just before my hand could make contact with the lady's face  she held me back as she looked at the woman and said   she's not r tarded  she's crazy and i will let her go  now  do you want another burger or not   the lady  dumbfounded  grabbed her food  made a pissed off noise at us and left  didn't ever see her in the restaurant again ,ju8fkm
760,Honest question with a story,i dont understand  anti work  or the concept of working until 70ish  here's why    so i grew up poor and graduated highschool with a 1 8gpa because from 7-16 i was extremely epileptic  in 7th and 8th grade i was having upto 18 grand mals a day aka i was dying and suffered pretty bad brain damage  durring that time my brother beat the absolute shit out of me daily  it wasnt brotherly fighting it was horrible abuse  for my 16th birthday i got a lawn mower without an engine  my dad helped my put an engine in it  i was told i can mow lawns and buy my own car so i did  all throughout highschool i mowed lawns until it was dark  being a highschool kid i of course spent all of the money on unless crap lol    after highschool i started welding dump trucks for  15 an hour  i got sick of that and looked into how rich people became rich  i stumbled across day trading and the stock market  so i studied that while working  i thought it was a  get rich quit  thing so i quit my job and traded expecting to become wealthy real fast then quickly learned that wasn't the case  so i went back to work and welding school and practiced tig welding until i mastered it  i landed an aerospace welding job  my schedule was 9am - 11 30am day trade  noon - 1pm gym  2pm - 1am welding job  i worked my ass off  i became lead welder  my supervisor and superintendent loved my work ethic and how i pumped out so many parts without failing x-ray or the other weld inspections  so i got a pay raise  more vacation  and i could mess around without getting points or getting yelled at  as long as i got more than enough parts done for the day    my old friends from highschool always complained about being tired or how much work they had to do  or how hard life was  yet on snapchat they would be at parties  be high or drunk  they eat like crap and stayed up all night  my co workers would complain about not getting paid enough and working too much but they had new cars  big houses  spent way to much on fast food  energy drinks  alcohol etc  90  of them didn't have a plan or a goal for retirement  they worked enough to not get fired but thats it  nothing more  nothing less  i asked my friends and co workers why not spend less money or work more efficiently  why not keep goals or do something different in life  why not budget  what about downgrading houses and cars to save money  spend less on food  why not come up with a plan to eventually start a business or invest   but everytime id open my mouth id get looked at like i was crazy  it bothered me and i started thinking hhmmm maybe i am crazy and trying to become wealthy is a rigged game   i didnt let it get to me so i worked even harder on trading and at welding  i finally started to make money trading consistently and my welding got even better  then out of no where i was having complex partial seizures  a week went by and i was getting 5-15 a day so went to the dr  and once again i was diagnosed with epilepsy  my new medicine made my welding and trading stuffer but i worked around that adapting to my new brain  my seizures were basically bad staring spells run away thoughts and still were happening even with medicine  but a month went by and i was back to where i was with trading and welding  after working my ass off with trading i was confident enough to quit my welding career and take the step into full time day trading    now i trade full time from 9am-11 30am  i have the freedom to do what i want when i want  but i continue to work on myself and my skills in life everyday   i understand people have to make house payments or car payments or have kids they need to take in account  but i firmly believe anyones  excuse  is just that an excuse  i know a guy who has 4 kids  was 24k in debt and now he's   made it  and he came from  nothing  he took a vow to never work for a boss ever again and he sacrificed so much and now he's on top of the world and still grinding even my sister saw what i did  she broke up with her bf and immediately started working on a fishing boat and became waitress at the same time for a long time  now shes doing her own thing and is so close to being where im at in life    questions  why do so many people hate work  why not make the sacrifice and escape the rat race  theres so many options in life so why not explore them    even if you went fully off grid back in nature you still have to put in a huge amount of work for food  shelter  water and more   basically why does it seem this  anti work  thing is so popular with my generation   im a millennial or gen z not sure lol    i just dont get it  ,jtxgys

780,"If people put any sort of thought into it, they'd realize that capitalism is basically a pyramid scheme.",it's a system that revolves entirely around competition  which means there will inherently be more losers than winners  people are literally forced to compete against their peers for a limited number of high-paying jobs  those on the top are incentivized to roadblock those who challenge their throne  including the people actually working for them  it's a system that by its very definition means that most people that live under it don't benefit from it  any and all factors are utilized by the rich to rig the game in their favor  race  religion  gender  socioeconomic background  mental disability  physical disability  age   jobs no longer have any real meaning because they aren't about people stepping into roles that will benefit their community  it's about gaining enough money to  buy off  or bargain with the oppressive forces that threaten your happiness and freedom    i know this is obvious to most people here  but it's like we as a society do not see how obviously flawed this system truly is ,jueniy

810,Micromanagement and meetings nightmare JOB,so i am working a second gig because i can't pay my bills with the one i already have  it's on the editorial end of a magazine  too focused on making money selling advertisement even though this has been a dead end model of business for more than a decade      the first month everything was cool  my boss was nice and my coworkers were pretty chill  them the nightmare began       i realized the company hired me for half of what the person on my  position earned  i thought this was the standard salary until i accidentally got a memo from the higher ups with a salary tab  hearing that they would resume paying back in full after a 50  cut due to covid-19  i found out this way that now everybody  even people in a position in the same level of hierarchy as me  will be paid a lot more than me      not only that  but in order for people to earn their full wage back  the company started to measure the amount of work everybody does  that includes me  so now we have to fill an excel tab daily with all the things we did on the day  at the end of the week our bosses tie this in with our goals and based on the overall percentage they get paid accordingly  meaning if they reached 80  of the weekly goal overall then they get 80  of that 50  cut  but for me since i didn't have a cut  that percentage means how much of my wage am i going to get paid  90  for 90  of the goals  and so on  we also have daily zoom meetings to tell our superiors what do we have planned for the day and to tell them exactly what are we going to spend our time on      apart from that  we get calls out of nowhere for constant virtual meetings  just as i was typing this i recieved a call for a zoom meeting  no warning whatsoever  and they micromanage this  they count assistance to meetings on an excel tab and missing even one means getting short of your goals  we get approximately 3 or 4 zoom calls per day  which pummels our productivity to the ground  i got one of my superiors mad by telling him during one of said meetings that i wasn't able to get shit done with so many calls  and that most of what we discussed could be summed up on an email  he told me he needed to confirm we were working  even though we are forced to go to the office in spite of the covid rising  and these meetings were a great way for him to know whether we were in front of our computer or slacking off      to make matters worse  every tuesday at 9 am we have a meeting with the sales department to present the rankings of our site and social media  this is a nightmare  because they are always complaining that my team doesn't do enough to rev up the traffic our site gets  even though they are right  there's another problem there  we don't have reporters  community managers  photographers or an editor  i do all of that  with a quota of 3 articles per day  3 facebook posts  3 instagram stories and photos and 6 tweets  with two exclusive interviews every week  oh and i also have to send 2 newsletters and edit and shoot videos for the magazine      i'm still on 3 months  trial  but i'll be going out my merry way after that period ends  i dunno if i should tell them their company sucks ass and they do everything there is to do wrong       just needed to get this off my system  thanks for reading ,jsfwk6
811,Most people cling so hard to the idea they could make it or be successful,it's our harder barrier to overcome and motivate anti-capitalist thought on the masses  rejecting or even being conscious of the fact you'll wage slave for the rest of your days feels like a death sentence  you lose the motivation to go on  you stop caring that much  too much sentience is a bad thing  it's better to think you're not a slave  it's a defensive mechanism  a reduction in consciousness designed to stop you from perceiving too much exploitation and the mundane nature of reality ,jssngx

813,"Last week, I applied for a senior position in a Fortune 100 company. This week, they say I'm not skilled enough, even though I surpass the criteria on their advert.",i'm not going to say what company or job it is  as they might see this post  i doubt it  but saving for anonymity    last week  i had a zoom interview with a fortune 100 company for senior position in the field i specialize in  their criteria was  as follows   1  five years industry experience 2  postgraduate experience 3  good  technical knowledge 4  able to use industry software packages 5  commercial awareness 6  experience in training others 7  experience in modelling data 8  understanding in python 9  ability to communicate with others  so  let's go through them   1  i have seven years of industry experience 2  i have a phd  2 masters degrees and 2 bachelor's degrees 3  points 1 and 2 cover my technical knowledge 4  i have trained people to use the software packages they want me to use 5  i have tendered many projects in my time 6  i have trained many people  including undergraduates  postgraduates  and colleagues 7  i have extensive experience in modelling data 8  i have a proficiency in python  and used it to model and analyze data  9  i have given presentations  all over the world  at conferences  and liaised with clients  because of my experience  and exceeding the expectations of the job criteria  i stated that a starting salary of  68 000  approx   80 100  would be suitable  even those salary websites  friends and old colleagues state that this is a good average salary  however  the interview instantly took a turn and you could feel the tension    yesterday  they got back to me and stated that they would like me  but that my experience isn't enough to warrant this senior role  as they were actually looking for someone with eight-10 years industry experience  and that i am not  skilled  enough to be a senior in their company - as their criteria is different to other companies  therefore  they could only offer me  38 000  approx   44 800  with no negotiations  but  offered me  bonus  incentives  such as bonuses for hitting and exceeding targets  work-from-home allowance to cover utilities  and a couple of other things  which  could double  my salary per year  yeah  right    i asked why they wouldn't consider me for the role which was specified  but all i received was the same platitudes - even though the job description stated five years industry experience   so  because they wasted my time  i am going to waste their time  they have asked me to come into their office  bearing in mind  this is in a different country - they are paying for my travel expenses  at least  which is a two-hour flight from my home city  they want me to come in for a  skills test   during the pandemic  i might add  i told them i'd be more than happy to turn up   am i going to turn up  am i fuck   i just received confirmation that they have booked my flight and a hotel for the night  i'm not going to go  i am going to blame it on the pandemic  yes  you may think i am a bad person for doing this  but at least i won't be burning any bridges with them  they can waste someone else's time   i fucking hate working in offices and i detest being around people that are all about the company  i also hate people who don't pull their weight and demand more and more of you - which was the reason why i left my previous company  this lazy ass fuck that would always be on the phone to his wife  getting paid twice as much as me  for sitting on his ass all day  he's probably living the dream  as he does fuck all  but not that the expense of me  asshole  i also hate the whole culture of office work  i am direct and do not shy away from confrontation  i am also not underselling myself  i haven't been in academia for 12 years and industry for seven to be given a sub-par salary  find some other sucker   so  you know what  fortune 100 company  fuck you ,jsw0pl

821,Thoughts on an ideal economic system,so i've been thinking a lot about this and  not being an expert in the field  these are my  loose  thoughts  they don't describe a coherent system but certain points i've come to realize are critical in changing our society because of how often they seem to interfere with what i'd call a  star trek  economy  i'm writing this because i don't see many of these types of stream of consciousness sorts of comments  because people usually only point out singular aspects of the economy and because i feel a vision for a revamped economic system is lacking and hardly discussed in its possible entirety    capitalism as it is now shouldn't exist - defined as inidividuals owning brands and factories and undemocratically ordering around employees   wherever companies need to exist  they have to be run democratically  not necessarily directly  but with enough possible individual input as  say  citizens of switzerland have  being egocentric here  where you're free to challenge individual government  board ceo  decisions and where a board can be elected by the employees  secondly  entrepreneurship in and of itself isn't something worthwhile  we need to  minimize the work to be done by humans  and automation and transfer of newly available lifetime has to be one of our primary goals  for this reason  we cannot tolerate a vampiric financial ruling class  however  i can concede that a moderate financial inequality can be motivational for people that produce actual innovation and actual surplus value  think new cancer drug instead of new iphone  more cars repaired instead of more money made for shareholders  - i suggest something like a  1 10 limit  where 1 is a national ubi and 10 is the limit anybody can make  including  worth  and inheritance etc  the whole  stock system  shareholding  investing needs to be illegal  no more of this category of bullshit jobs  prohibition of vampirism  instead  for the remaining companies  if you want to support the development of a product  donate to them  or just help someone start something  you just - imagine this guys - give money without return  let's see how many of these people actually  totally like starting companies you guys   something like a separation of production  income distribution and market  advertising in the classical sense should be outlawed  would be handy  business must cater to what people want without psychological intereference  it also must not benefit more from more business - the  profit motive must be eliminated  it is responsible for so much misery and limitations in this world  from copyright mafias to unaffordable insulin to climate change and kids working in sweatshops  separate instances should deal with the profit  the market desires and the actual production   of course  these things alone still don't solve some critical questions  how do we effectively automate away labour and construct a society where a lot of people just don't need to work  how much should a ubi be in relation to an income ceiling  how much is actual  bullshit  jobs and how many do produce some type of worth for society  could we deal with ego problems and the fact that some people that had a passive  fabulous income are now  normal  everyday working folk  how do we reconcile the fact that a big class of society just wouldn't have to work anymore   because for the countless flaws our systems have right now  they do provide an awful lot of luxuries and conveniences  thinking easy fast food  decongesting nosespray  pink fur toilet seats  whatever  albeit at the cost of heart attacks  suicides in teenagers  rapid climate change  environmental holocaust  child labour and at most 20 average years of retirement between slave labour and death   another important thing is actual political engagement  how do we get our desires and ideas heard and spread across the western world  what can we do to stop dreaming and take physical action  internet discussions on their own our useless - the communist subreddits can chat until they're blue in the face unless every single one of them put together flyers  start parties and get going from door to door   discuss ,jsf44x

827,Potential Alternative to Capitalism and Work? Let me know what you guys think?,so i was thinking for a future sustainable model in which no one has to work under someone is making some form of a resource based economy    basically the idea is to split  countries cities states etc  into smaller decent sized communities  these communities are sustainable by providing free food water shelter transport energy and a set amount of currency with no strings attached  basically using things and concepts that already exist so people don't have to work  major concerns from everyone is who would do the labor  my solution is to just give the jobs to people who want to work for  more  currency  people with currency could buy non essentials which is very appealing     in turn this would hopefully increase innovation and coming together for a common good in order to fully automate things like food production  transport and anything else   ideally any businesses would be owned by workers not a sole owner or cooperation in order to keep work and production ethical    also in terms of how these communities are governed there would be no political figures  instead  i was thinking of something along the lines of a  libertarian anarchy   which mostly focuses upon  the individual  making sure that each person has the maximum amount of freedom  personally i believe by having a community  solely  vote it would exclude the minority creating conflict  also i believe that less laws are the way to go as long as what you are doing isn't interfering with anyone else  the concept of libertarian anarchism would have to be tweaked but its just a general concept  as an alternate option communities could chose a system until one worked  however in some cases this could lead to ruin ,jsrezq

842,The biggest thing I hate about working.,it's all bullshit    everyone seems to accept their life will be nothing more than perpetual doldrums of working long hours with little societal advancement  most people who are born poor  die poor    no one seems care that there are literally tens of thousands of people homeless  millions more living paycheck to paycheck  and deciding between rent and food    yet there are thousands living in exuberant wealth  more money they could spend in 100 lifetimes  how does this make sense  there are people born into wealth who will be rich their entire life  by vaginal chance alone  during the 80's they could of put this money in a bank account and just lived off the interest    then i look at sports  which i loathe  and see people getting paid millions of dollars for driving a car in a big circle  or throwing a ball into a whoop  big fucking deal  yet people fork over their hard earned money just to  be there    also celebrities some people act well  which i can appreciate  then you look at all the goofy bullshit like kim kardashian and other completely fucking useless people a waste of carbon atoms  who get paid millions just to do normal day to day stuff  people eat this shit up  they waste hours of their life staring at a colorful box on the wall watching other people just do stuff  they watch other people play video games and these people make tons of money too  or tons of money just opening up new shit  people watch these unboxing videos for hours on end  as if the essence of the chinese slave worker air inside the sealed box is the queef of a beautiful lady  and the opener has a fetish for it  at least fucking play video games  what is so  cool  about watching other people play games  what's next    vr taking a shit  vr getting gas   i just can not wrap my head around all the bullshit there is  how much waste their is  every fucking time i buy a donut at the gas station i'm handed a receipt  multiply that by thousands of stores every single second and that is a giant waste of paper  it only scratches the surface of all the useless wastes of resources in our country  am i supposed to shit in my hand and return it to the store and proclaim i am dissatisfied with my purchase  i get some people need receipts for business expenses  but that should be asked  not assumed    there is just soooo much bullshit  80 percent or more of people either don't care  or they too are just completely fucking inept  i don't if anyone here has seen idiocracy  i used to laugh at that movie   haha we could never be this dumb and now it's turning into a fucking documentary  i am legit nervous how things will turn out in the near future    kid's don't even go outside these days  cps and the police get called if a 8 year old is outside alone  wtf   toddlers are sat in front of an ipad while mommy and daddy fuck or shoot up meth or do other idiotic shit because they can't be bothered to actually nourish and raise the little crotch goblin    most of us need to accept the fact that the entirety of your life and reality is absolute bullshit  the chance of you being the next ford or tesla or musk or zuckerberg is infinitesimally small  most rags to riches stories are also absolute bullshit and either they had huge initial financial backing  were born into wealth  or in some cases  albeit small  were in the right place at the right time ,jt13x6

854,I finally reached my breaking point.,after months of struggling with depression anxiety i finally had a nervous breakdown on tuesday  i got up in the morning  got ready for work  and right when i went to grab my keys to leave i started sobbing uncontrollably  i tried my hardest to pull myself together so i could just get the day over with  but i couldn t stop  i ended up calling off and ultimately i immediately filed a leave of absence request in hopes to receive short term disability for a couple of weeks    i moved to a new city a year and a half ago  and on top of the isolation from moving away from the only home i ever knew  the pandemic isolation hit me even harder  so i have virtually no support system here besides my fianc  i m away from my mom and sister who i used to see every other day  and now i only see them a couple times a year  i have never felt so shitty in my entire life  i look back on the person i was four months ago and i was stressed then but i was managing  stress at work on top of everything else was just too much to handle     i spoke to my supervisor and basically blubbered on the phone like an idiot and let her know everything that was going on  oddly enough  she was supportive in a way that i didn t expect and said she would hold my job for a few weeks and that we could talk about stress management at work when i came back  i have a physicians note to be off work until the 30th of november but i m already dreading going back because i m just so embarrassed  people are going to ask me what happened and if i m okay  has anyone else gone through this  i  need  this time off so that i can focus on myself  get my meds situated  and feel better  i m just feeling really down on myself and feeling so ashamed that i can t even handle life  the pressure of capitalism is still ingrained in my brain somewhere  i guess ,jsufzw
855,Why I'm sad this morning: Story time.,earlier this year i ended a job due to a combo of being burned out  hating retail customer service  and pandemic anxiety  mental self-care during covid   back in august i started planning on returning to post-secondary  for the first time in over 10 years    my thought process was that i don't have the pieces of paper that i need in order to get jobs that i don't hate     to be entirely clear the fact i need a job angers me to my bones but there isn't much i can do about it and keep a roof over my head   so i found some ideas of schooling i wouldn't mind  jobs i wouldn't necessarily mind having if i had said schooling  and could potentially lead to me working for myself or doing a thing i liked    but in order to do that i needed government assistance money  because i live in canada that's possible  today i got the numbers back as to how many dollars i can expect from the government   and even with that  i can't afford to live and go to school    i came up with a mock-up budget of a scaled down version of what i currently have  and even with that scaled down version i still couldn't afford my life costs and tuition  in order to do that i would have to get some kind of part-time  likely retail job  to afford the schooling   i haven't done post-secondary in over 10 years  i want to focus exclusively on schooling so i can do as well as possible  and learn as much as possible    i've already put in 4 months of my own time  so many fucking emails sorting shit with incompetent people  unclear policies  etc  and over  300 worth of my own  amp  friends' money  for deposits and transcripts and etc    still after all that-- i'm still almost  200 short on the first term   4000 short for the second term  and likely  3000 short for the third term at the end of next year    quite literally  i do not know what to do    if i was capable of wanting to deal with humans i might have considered a construction apprenticeship but i don't have any money up front for a union fee  i don't have any prior construction skills that i would be able to offer someone willing to train me more  i don't know how to find those people even when it isn't a pandemic  also i don't want to deal with humans  except i know i have to so i figured a post-secondary space would be the most structured and require the least amount of organizing on my part   scoffs  well that was incredibly inaccurate   credit and other loans are not possible for me  something i've investigated in the past  so that's also a nope    so now i have a decision to make    - do i try to find a way to get a part-time job so i can afford schooling   but in the process risk mental health as well as grades and learning capacity  - do i give up on the schooling process  forget the 300  and the 4 months of life i can't get back  and cancel everything after i find a full-time job and go back to working  aka hating 5 of 7 days of the week  and anxious the other 2  - do i try to find a government assistance program so i can continue being off on mental health leave because this world is a crapshoot  - do i start praying to the aliens to obliterate the universe   jokes  i started that like a year ago   i mean if i had the emotional energy to deal with more bullshit like this i would have kept my full-time job working customer service  but i didn't because i couldn't    and the idea of needing to go back to hating my life just to afford to stay alive  when i didn't ask to be alive to begin with  is infuriating beyond words  and terrifying  especially because i'm trying so hard and keep slamming into bureaucratic red tape walls   and that's why i'm sad this morning ,jsy953

859,vent about a terrible job interview,yesterday i had terrible interview via zoom   after booking the interview i looked up the glassdoor reviews and yikes    abusive   malignant   staff driven to stress-induced breakdowns   like death row inmates   so i figured i'd chalk it up to interview practice   but it was bad   really bad   because of connectivity issues  they suggested i switch off my video option   so i could see them but they could not see me   after some introductory waffle and chat  the serious questions began   i could clearly see that the main interviewer was not impressed with my answers   she was rolling her eyes and such   i thought her questions were very vague and broad so i tried to get some clarification and that did not go over well   and then it just went to shit   interviewer had about a million  what a fucking moron  faces going a mile a minute   and she knew i could see that   she became increasingly angry and frustrated   i just   shut down   i shut down like a little kid getting berated by a parent   i thought about just pulling the plug on the interview but i was too drained of life to actually decide   obviously i wasn't trying to give good answers by this point and this enraged the interviewer even more   finally it ended   i'm still shaken up   i'm also thinking  well  so what if i turned out to be a dud  the interviewer has plenty of experience  she must know that happens sometimes   it makes her job easier - she can just cross me off the list   that is what the interview is for    did she really need to get so pissy just because i stumbled on the first few questions   did she think that rolling her eyes at me was going to improve the interview    as you can imagine  i find those reviews quite easy to believe now     ugh  why does getting a job have to be so hard   it wasn't this hard 25-30 years ago  i'm that old   i had some bad interviews back then but not the shitshows i encounter now ,jsw386
860,I hate my new job so much that I’m considering not showing up at all for my shift on Sunday.

874,The shambles of my work environment (long),hello  thanks for reading this  it may be a long one so apologies for that   i work in a national operations control room for a global market leading company  basically a glorified call center for clients  employees and linked business partner companies    i work 12 hour shifts  on a 4 on 4 off rotation  sat in front of 4 computer screens   our team should be made up of 4 people and our supervisor  however  we have 3 and a supervisor  i am second most experienced with only 2 years service  then someone with 1 year and a brand new person within last 3 months   currently our supervisor is off sick having a surgical procedure then will be off recovering a couple of months  then another one of our team is also off sick awaiting a procedure but has a doctors note confirming absence from work   to add to this  our big boss recently left for a new job leaving his second to be in charge  this second is rarely in the offices as he has shacked up with one of his direct subordinates and they now live together   so  that leaves myself and someone who is brand new to run 5 inbound call lines  2 outbound call lines that we have to chase up and still work on the email requests we have come through for third party companies and contractors   then they still want incoming call waits under an average of 30 seconds across the team   we don't even have tappy-click-to-call  we have to manually dial each number   naturally  working 12 hours a day or night you get pretty tired  we only get 1 hour break each  however with the current staffing levels this obviously affects how we can take our breaks if at all   the company hasn't arranged adequate cover from other staff to help my team  as they refuse to pay extra incentive for over-time  they will only pay flat-rate pay   so i work my ass off all day night doing as best as i can  only to get chewed out for making one or two mistakes when i've made thousands of interactions calls all shift   not worth the pitiful  23 000 a year they pay me  cowboy company posing as a top employer and brand ,jtdmmx

912,Unpopular Opinion: Most Europeans don't know how good they have it.,the benefits and work-life balance given to the average european worker are unimaginable for americans    european workers get more than 10 public holidays  5-6 weeks paid vacation  maternity leave for several months  paternity leave  essentially unlimited sick days  virtually no unpaid mandatory overtime  and most full-time workers work less than 40 hours a week   here in america  despite chronic pain and numerous health conditions  i am working 60 hours a week  with no overtime pay  with only 2 sick days a year  with only 4 vacation pto days a year  no holidays off  and no family leave or paternity leave  and this is considered  good  for a job in my industry  for which i had to get a master's degree to enter  all of my friends and colleagues are in similar positions   my wife works 70 hours a week and receives 5 days off  including sick days  for the entire year  she is 7 months pregnant and gets no time off for childbirth or maternity leave  the plan right now is for her to give birth in the morning and come back to work later in the day  read again  she will give birth and come back to work on the same day   and no  she did not qualify for fmla   and before you start crying that americans have higher salaries than europeans - that's only true for a few certain select professions like computer engineering or medicine  in my field  accounting and audit  european workers generally make more after tax   so everytime i see europeans on here complaining about how they are suffering because of their work lives  i honestly get enraged  i hate to gatekeep here  but you have no idea what real suffering is    the average european worker would probably have a total psychological breakdown and become violently suicidal if he or she tried living and working in america for more than a couple of years   the worst part is i cannot even quit or take a break because then i will lose health insurance  nor can i kill myself to end the pain and stress because my family is dependent on me  not can i just get up and immigrate to a better country because getting a job overseas is near impossible unless you are a specialist in some high demand field    for the worker  america is hell - and there is no escape here ,jsxwck

922,Humanity has no direction and is stuck in mire of never-ending consumerism - There are no winners in the end.,whats the direction of humanity  it would seem in the 60's there was a great hope that we would expand our knowledge of the planet and breach the walls of our own solar system but then it all kinda dropped off and as the decades rolled on we allowed a small class of human beings to gain a massive amount of wealth and power  that they keep in private hands - on islands  in foreign bank accounts  wrapped up in stocks and shares - none of which this wealth benefits the majority of people or their governments that are supposedly democratically elected    it would seem to me that the world is stuck in mire  the capitalists dont want to move away from a system that garuntee s them their place at the top  living in total luxurary away from any of life's unpleasantness  over the cracks of crumbling societies all over the world they pave over broken  underfunded systems with private ones - the ones that require money to access  so that while the world burns  they can ignore all of that with little hindrance to themselves    its not unusual for countries to have 2 education systems  2 law systems  even housing that is designed to seperate rich from poor  the whole covid thing shows just how directionless we are as a species  the people at the top of the pile have fluffed the whole test by their only focus being on keeping the economy open so that people can consume and keep the system going    in 2020  we may not have flying cars or interplanetary travel but we do have the means to house  feed  clothe and educate people up to a university level - and we should be   we could reduce the working week quite heavily but that would require a change in the economy that capitalists will not accept    capitalists hate change  they always have to have their hands forced  in britain we build the canals first  1700's  all of the capitalists were wretched when trains came along and did everything they could to stop them from taking off  then they built the main motorway roads and got rid of half of the railways - effecting shareholders in the railways etc    anyway  humanity isnt going anywhere  wealthy people have no vision for the future  politics is rigged  overton window has been dragged to the right for decades now across the world  and climate change will probably end us all    thank you for coming to my ted talk ,jrkifb

928,"What do you think ""anti-work"" means?",serious question  to you  the reader  what does  anti-work  mean    is  anti-work  hating the idea that you have to work in order to survive  in the past   working  meant getting up at the break of dawn  plowing  fertilizing  gathering your crops  taking care of the livestock  hunting for meat  sewing your own clothes  mending building your own house  etc  you would put in work every single day just to survive on the frontier  you would barter with people in order to attain things that you couldn't provide for yourself   your life was in your own hands  you owned your time  if you didn't put in the work  you didn't last very long  unless you turned to crime and robbed others of their hard-earned fruits of labor  or relied on others to take care of you   in today's modern world  the work is a bit different  but the idea isn't  basically  you're  hypothetically  getting up at the crack of dawn  commuting to work for someone else in order to get paid a currency that has a perceived value which you use to buy the things you need to survive  i e  food  shelter  clothing  etc  your time isn't your own while employed by someone else  you've  agreed  to give them your time and work in order to get paid  so that you can survive  you could opt not to work  in today's society  but you'd have a hard life surviving    so  in the very general situations i've described above  the conclusion is that in order to survive  you still have to  work  whether it's you living off the land or you selling your time and labor to someone else    given the state of our modern societies  how can someone that is  anti-work  thrive  what do they expect to be able to do in order to survive  i'm genuinely curious  because a utopian society where anyone and everyone can do what they want with their time sounds very optimistic and unobtainable    the thing is  even if you're living on a deserted island or piece of unknown land somewhere off the grid  you're still going to be putting in the effort to survive  you'll still be  working  the only difference is that you're in control of your time and where you'll spend your efforts    maybe i'm getting hung up on the word  work  in  anti-work  is  anti-work  something else  something like a belief where you're not against work  per se  but against the system that has made a society where your survival is almost out of your control ,jr4nnc

984,Are internships a taste of the real working life?,my internship was terrible  i had a really unhelpful boss  bad colleagues  difficult work that was not taught  unpaid overtime  and  little to no time for lunch     i don't think you need to read this part but you may if you want the details  i was attached to this company to do my internship but they made use of us and threw us to do jobs that involves customer service and it skills  i was from it background so i was placed here  however  we were not trained properly  i was literally sitting there watching my colleague who was my friend from school  he didn't teach me how to do many things and left me on my own the following week   my boss was my only lifeline  i tried to ask her for help but she has 0 clue on how it works  my boss then sent another colleague who was her brother to help me after 3 weeks  her brother told me to stop bothering her lmao  i mean i wasn't taught on how to do this man  his help wasn't that great either and he didn't teach me another crucial component of the job but the admin office issued me a ticket and i had to do the other component of the job    this was a shocker for me but hey i attempted to do it as i already voiced out my concerns but they paid no attention and i lost over 400gb of data and hundreds of millions of dollars of the client's data  the boss' brother was so angry with me and he mocked and ridiculed me infront of everybody  like what the actual fck    my other intern friends soon avoided me as word got round the office and i was the main gossip point  which is unfair in my opinion but what can i do   i was transferred to admin site and after one day of semi-training i was asked to do something that i wasn't taught yet again  i lost a few thousand dollars of the company's money and was getting dropped f bombs everywhere   what the actual fuck is working for a minimum wage  i worked 3 to 4 hours after my working hours and even skipped lunch to produce the best work i can and only to be shat on  is this really going to be life    i soon submitted a letter to redraw from the internship programme as i was admitted to the mental health institute due to suicidal thoughts  i feel hopeless and depressed though its been a year and now i'm serving in the army and things are better  i can't help but feel life isn't going to be tough in the corporate world  anybody got anything similar   thanks for listening  have a nice day ahead  just needed to vent,jrasai

986,Work's Toll on My Mental Health,this morning i woke up immediately angry and ready to throw and destroy things  i ended up pacing around my apartment screaming my frustrations and probably scaring the neighbours in the process  then i took a benzo to calm down and now im a grumpy zombie  so i still won't be able to do my work properly today  this wasn't the first time this happened and it surely won't be the last   this is no way to live  and believe me  my coping is better than it used to be  i've been through therapy and was hospitalized for work-induced suicidal ideations and i used to frequently have to leave work because of debilitating anxiety attacks  literally like convulsions  i got fired from one job and my employer would not tell me why  but i suspect it was because i made the mistake of admitting i have anxiety issues and panic disorder   i'm not built for this world but i have no idea what else to do except suffer for the next 50 years until i die  theres no way i'll be lucky enough to retire  part of that is my own fault as i tend to spend a lot when i hate life and don't care  to those who say  start your own company and become your own boss  that would be taking on levels of stress and risk that i could never mentally handle   on top of this  for employee reviews we are always expected to give the impression we are ready for more responsibility and more work  whereas truthfully i'm barely hanging on as it is  preferably i'd like to stay in my current position and learn to deal with increasing amounts of stress  in addition to wanting to gain more technical knowledge on the product i work on  but of course being content in your current position is looked upon unfavorably to a corporation   the stress i've been through i'm also convinced has permanently damaged my cognitive functions  i make little mistakes and slip ups all the time  and misremember things a lot  although it probably doesn't help that everything i work on is in a rush so i can't properly take my time on things anyway  i'm a barely functional human and i'm consistently pushed to the limits which in turn stresses me out and causes even more mental degradation   the funny thing is i like this job more than any other job i've had and i still hate it   i'm so sick of this cycle but i don't see any other way  no matter how well i learn to cope there's always going to be a part of me that despises this system and just existence in general  at this rate if i'm lucky i'll have a work induced stroke by 35 and finally get out of this shit ,jrlv7d

991,The Best Job I Ever Had (Story),a while back  i posted about a job i had for years that was absolutely awful  for which i m actually in therapy   thought i d share the opposite and tell you about a job i loved  i know  right   let me be clear  i loved this job because i had to do very little and it made me feel extremely cool   in 2015  i got a job at sea world in san diego  i know many of you will have feelings about that organization  but bear with me   the first job i had there was in admissions  i d stand at the front gates  take people s tickets  have them do the dumb little thumb scan  and let them in  after a while  they had me working in the parking payment booth    i fucking hated it   after a few months  i had an opportunity to apply for the job i actually wanted  as a narrator in the education department  i got the job  did the training  and started working   here s what a typical day would look like  -clock in get today s schedule -go to an animal exhibit i d been scheduled for  sharks  pinnipeds  beluga whales  etc  -talk on the microphone for 5 minutes  -chat with guests and answer animal questions until another big crowd arrived  rinse and repeat for 60-90 minutes until someone came to take over  -do the same thing at the next scheduled exhibit  -take a break do more of the talking thing for 2 hours -lunch -work -break -work -go home  employees are given 2 15-minute paid breaks and a 30 minute unpaid lunch    here s the kicker  our department did everything on half-hour increments  so 15-minute breaks became 30-minute breaks and our 30 minute unpaid lunch was really an hour  half of which was paid  we would clock back in and just sit back down because we had nowhere to be for another half an hour  we d just sit around and chill in the outdoor employee area  just outside the employee cafeteria where they d sell food at cost   2 for a cheeseburger that costs  12 in the park  sure thing   the only part i really considered work was the narrations  which we wrote ourselves  that means i only really  worked  about 2 hours of the day in total for an 8 hour shift  aside from that  i was either shooting the shit with my coworkers behind the scenes  or talking about animals  which is my favorite thing to do anyway   another huge bonus was the uniforms  all of the customer service related jobs involved wearing these ugly button-down shirts with horrible patterns on them  our uniforms  black pants or shorts and a blue t-shirt that said  zoological operations  on the back   made me feel like a rockstar    we were also the only department that had contact with guests that were allowed to wear sunglasses   i d have done that job until i died if not for 2 things  -they were pretty much only part-time  3 eight-hour shifts a week  or 4 six-hour  -i left that job because i moved to seattle to start a new life   the irony is not lost in me that the best job i ever had involved very little work  but that s kind of the point  right ,jqt53r

997,Has anyone else made the mistake at looking up what the big wigs of your company make?

1011,Why do managers inconviently post schedules just days before the work week starts?,my current jobs - as a part time bank teller and part time server - both like to post schedules one to two days before the work week starts  i don't know if this is typical but   why  i have an opportunity for an interview at another place i'm really keen on working at and all i had to do was give the days i'm available to come in for an interview  well it's been 4 days now and i'm still unable to set a date and time for the interview as i'm awaiting my shift schedule - which is actually behind schedule now so i also have no clue what my serving shifts are until the day before i might potentially get scheduled   i'm trying to schedule my massage therapist and chiropractor appointment and hope i get in this week and find time to prepare dinner this week before my red wine and yucca go bad as otherwise it's hard to find the time or energy to since i work 9-5s or 2-12s  my life isn't sitting around staring at my phone waiting for my schedule to come out and working them and doing nothing else  why do managers not realise or care about how rude and inconvenient this is ,jqwntv
1012,Death by corporate!,remember  when you were young and a new day dawned  the adventures of the day  were awaiting you  there were no limits and everything was yours to  explore  nobody told you what to think  believe or do  or so you  thought  you still had to go sleep  brush your teeth  wash yourself  eat  your food and do your homework whenever your parents told you so  you  had a nice childhood and your parents let you dream  they were never too  concerned with what you would do in life as long as you were happy  you  thought their message was genuine but now you know it was self  preservation  they never knew how society really functioned  they hated  the game but some part of them still wanted part in that game  a bit of  recognition to their efforts  if you scream loud enough that money does  not bring happiness  even if you don't believe it  a part of you will  believe it  you picked up on the dissatisfaction nagging at the edges of  their existence  not consciously but eventually it spilled over into  the conscious as well  you never noticed their struggle with poverty  because to a child poverty is an unknown concept  you were creative and  you realize now that as long as you are creative you are not poor and as  long as you can dream you are rich  you were the richest little child  in existence  do you remember   as  you were made to slowly fit the mold you would fight it more and more   what were they trying to push you into  do you remember how you fought  it  do you still have that fight in you   almost  nobody escapes the mold and our dreams are replaced by their dreams   their dreams become our dreams  by the time you were done with high  school you fitted the mold perfectly  you promised your parents you  would bring them riches  they would have it all  everything they were  never able to give you  you would bring them so they could finally be  happy  marvel at the beauty in the world was replaced with the question  of how someone else was able to have more matter under their control  than you  how did they do that  why is it not mine  if you would have  been a person of low self esteem you would have believed that these  things were never your right to begin with anyway  you are not a person  of low self esteem  you are a disciplined and all that riches will be  yours   although you made many  mistakes  you did pay attention to your parents  like the illiterate  school teacher  they taught you something they never really seemed to  grasp themselves but maybe knew was there  a possible journey towards  discovering the real value of things  at this point in your young mind  you did not pay attention to any of that though  what counted is social  standing and money  the most impressive human beings had  in your mind   tons and tons of money  money is the benchmark of success and service in  society  right   you kept doing  well  your parents were probably proud but you didn't care anymore if  they were proud or not  it became a whole different beast altogether   competition  more money than your parents or siblings or friends is not  important anymore if you want more money than your boss

you just told them who you worked for  who owned your dreams and they  would respect you  it was great the first year as you did not need to  dream for yourself anymore  your bank account always had a nice amount  of money sitting in it for you to spent on whatever you pleased and you  liked yourself in a suit   slowly  it started eating away at you as you climbed the ranks and made   friends  within the machine  the higher you get the more you have to  dream their dream  even when you sleep you dream of it  your weekends  you dream of it  your free time you dream of it  you are becoming it   management becomes your social circle and you hang out with them around  their large backyard pools  when the wives are inside with the children  they talk to you about that  chick  that they fucked  you play along  because you are good at it  the only topics you talk about is your job   infidelity and golf   for 15 long  years you climb but it is never enough and you never seem to get there   it is always out of reach and no promotion is ever enough  no raise is  ever enough  the authority that comes with it is boring and empty  that  new car feels fantastic the first month you drive it and after that you  loathe traffic all the same   you  remember the little child that was inside of you  full off hopes and  dreams  you tried to kill that child but you failed and from time to  time you feel it in your periphery  a quiet sob  life becomes evermore  unbearable  your friends start slipping as the political climate changes  and mistakes are laid bare  not you though  you were always just one  big lie  too lazy for infidelity  too tired to be unscrupulous  as life  starts losing it's meaning you start to experiment with chemical  motivation  the options are unlimited but not much has been tested   then   something inside of you starts to stir and tries to resist your actions  but you overpower it time after time  you are a winner  although at  this point you are not sure what that means anymore  too tired to  change  too chemically charged to stop and no courage to end it all  end  it all    wake up   wake up    wake up    w a k e     u p ,jrcjrr

1025,My PTO may be getting cut in 2021. What are some legal/non-fireable ways to give the middle finger back?,i work a typical 9-5  though i really do 9-4 and i've been working from home since march due to the pandemic  and probably not going back to the office any time soon   in mid-2019  our parent company sold us to another parent company   in 2020  we kept our same pto accruals from the previous parent company and were able to roll over any 2019 pto into 2020   so this year  2020  i had a shit ton of pto     my normal 23 pto days  for employees in the 3-10 years of employment range    1 floating holiday  essentially another pto day    2 weeks of pto that i purposely saved from 2019 for my honeymoon in february 2020  which was was cancelled due to the pandemic   and since we can't roll anything over from 2020 to 2021  i've been using all of it   so barring my 2 weeks that i rolled over from 2019  my 2020 pto was essentially 24 days   but we just got our 2021 benefits and my pto is taking quite a hit   now i'll get     14 pto days  for employees in the 3-5 years of employment range     march will be my 5-year anniversary  and the 5-10 year amount is 16 days  but i doubt they'll bump me up or give me another day since my 5-year is partway through the year    3 floating holidays   10 sick days  so although that comes out to 27 days i can take off  it's really 17 pto days and 10 sick days   this kinda sucks because it's tough to schedule sick days like pto because you generally use sick days the day of   and only 1 person on our team ever gets sick enough that he actually can't work  even from home   so when do the rest of us have the opportunity to actually use them   we might not get sick all year   we did learn that the sick days are decided between the manager and their team with no need for a doctor's note  and our manager is pretty chill and agreeable   so one of my teammates and i are tossing around the idea of seeing if our team  3 guys   our manager  can agree on a system to use  mental health  sick days  like if one of us is feeling burnt out a particular week  we all agree to give that person a day off that friday or whatever   that person uses a sick day but we've all known about it days in advance   however  if we can't figure out something like that  i'm losing a week of pto  which sucks   so  in that case  what would be some legal non-fireable ways to give the middle finger back ,jrtr5n

1051,“There’s just not enough hours in the day”,it s a pretty common sentiment  people lament not having enough time to spend time with family  having down time  doing housework  participating in hobbies  and running errands  they have to squeeze a lot of that stuff into two days of the week  oftentimes making those days stressful instead of relaxing    most of the time i see it said in a lighthearted manner  like a food blog giving you tips on meal prepping   here is how i plan and cook my meals every sunday because i m just so busy the rest of the week      most of those people don t even realize that the problem is probably their jobs taking 8-12 hours of their day  i mean  they know it s their job and sometimes they even acknowledge it  but they don t see it as a problem for some reason    sunday night thoughts  ,jmdd3w

1057,finally quit!,hi  i just found this subreddit and find it very comforting reading everyone s stories and not feeling so alone  so my boyfriend of 4 years and i have been working at the same place  grocery store  him for two years  me for a year  we both have felt extreme burnout in 2020 due to the rapid expansion of our department  with lack of staffing  equipment  room  etc  along with the toxic environment between employees and managers  i am also considered high risk to covid so i spend every day in fear that i m gonna get sick  i have spiraled into a depression and have constant anxiety  never being able to get work off of my mind  with coworkers always texting me on my days off about how terrible it is  we have wanted to quit so bad for the last 6 months and i always tell him we need to stay because they need us and i don t want to disappoint anyone by leaving  well we have hit our breaking point  i have had an anxiety attack every time i tried to go to work this week  and my boyfriend is really worried about my mental health and doesn t want me going back  he s also had his own problems with the company not paying him the right amount  and breaking every promise they make to him about his position  this morning i tried to go to work again  but just couldn t do it  we had a long talk afterward about how we both would rather save our relationship and mental health than dreading every day and being exhausted constantly  we both also have businesses we want to pursue but haven t had the time to put into them because of work  so as of today we are going to put everything into our businesses and continue looking for new jobs  it is definitely scary not knowing what may be next for us  but i feel so relieved to have ended that chapter and to start a new one  good luck to everyone newly unemployed and wanting to quit their job  do what s best for you ,jnq7fw
1058,Flashy policies to appear as if they care but do very little to help you,i work for an insanely large insurance company  they announced in a highly produced video  using our senior leaders like celebrities  that in light of the mental health and covid challenges of 2020 you can use up to 20 hours of your 2021 pto  preaching for us to use our pto to care for ourselves and give ourselves the mental health breathers when we need them most  no q amp a  and then a follow up email stating that the unplanned absence policy will not be changing despite the announcement  so you still get penalized for taking the time they're encouraging us to take if you didn't plan it 10 days in advance  i'm sorry  let me look at my calendar to see when my next mental breakdown is going to be   oh  and btw it's open enrollment so you can't plan time off either now due to  business need  so  thanks for nothing ,jnvtfz

1061,Have you ever watched capitalist greed destroy something before your eyes?,i ask because i am currently experiencing it and would like to hear others stories   here's mine   for several years i worked at a residential treatment facility for mentally ill and at risk youth dream job  btw  60  hours a week working with ill violent youth until my body said no more and i ended up with a pinched nerve that had the entire left half of my body numb for weeks   i quit this year  at the start of the pandemic  and found what i thought would be a nice  cushy desk job to get me through the year of end times  i even thought the company itself wasn't half bad  small  local company providing health care supplies via delivery  started by best friends  no one is rich  everyone seems happy and culture is nice and chill  welp  a week after i start  they announce their 'merge'  fucking buy-out  just say it  by a huge national company   it took them less than a month to begin polluting everything on a terrifying scale  what made the original company successful  good time off  decent hours raises  fast systems to process things  no automated phone systems  and not hunting down folks for copays   the larger company  has systematically  made all of the phone lines automated so that they can record every single thing  which is bad for the elderly calling in  changed all of the time off pay scales  planning on increasing changing hours  so much mandatory overtime  very poor handling of covid  changing the operating system to slower pc's and extremely inefficient programs takes me 5 minutes in the new system to do something that takes about 30 seconds in the old  which is all to ensure that nothing can be done but those systems  no music  no google  nothing  lockers where we are to lock up all of our personal affects especially cell phones  and signing of papers that say you are to have no expectation of privacy while on property  they can search your car  your bag  your pockets  if you are found to have a personal item on you  you're fired  if you refuse  you're fired  but the real kicker  the worst of the worst  they hunt down co-payments  before the products even leave the warehouse  i had an elderly woman call in because she was being hounded for the copay for something that had not even been looked at by the warehouse yet  guess how much it was  0 08  that's right  8 cents  hunting down grandma for 8cents  and if she doesn't pay it  she can't get her medical supplies anymore  because of the way this company operates  the ceo makes  369 an hour    i hate it  and i'm pissed it happened and i'm disgusted at this greed  i just wanted to vent about this and see what others have experienced similarly  did you do anything to change it  personally  i've started putting 0 on their estimated costs  it states it's not a bill  it has to go through insurance first  and they will get their actual bill later from insurance  so i'm not lying to them  but it keeps the money grubbers at the big company from hounding them immediately ,jmumly
1062,"Mirror, mirror on the wall: Who is the worst ""LinkedIn Influencer"" of them all?",hey guys  hope you're all doing well and staying safe  this is a throwaway account  because i don't want to be identified and traced back for professional reasons  warning  rant coming up   the answer to the question posed above is jonathan tesser  i'm sure you guys have seen him floating around on linkedin  the whole  vp of insights  amp  analytics  thing at nyc  amp  co  the  career whisperer for young professionals  dude  but why  i'll tell you about my friends' experience with him  not only does he post shitty  condescending crap on his linkedin  he is a narcissist that makes passive aggressive comments about people and insults them   a couple days ago  one of my friends called me  crying  they had just gotten off the phone with him after they talked about a potential internship opportunity doing some marketing thing  they eventually want to go into a more technical field  and currently have 2 other gigs going on  more closely related to the long term career path they want to go down  engineering and data science  after asking a couple questions about the position  my friend decides the project isn't right for them  and politely tries to decline  saying that they want to go into a different field instead of marketing  perhaps they could recommend someone that might be more interested  they also mention that they'd have to split up their time between their current internship and his project if they were to work for him  he gets mad at this statement and says that wouldn't be possible  what the fuck  how else are you supposed to pay the bills  does he know that  15 an hour for 20-25 hours a week doesn't cover living expenses  anyway  usually employers say okay  move on to the next candidate  this person wasn't the right fit for the project    this guy gets angry as fuck and literally blows up on them  he says  and i quote   here's some constructive feedback  you know  i know you're a young professional and all  but you mentioning x field makes it come off as if you're saying you're too good for the project  you really shouldn't say that to someone of my stature  then he proceeds to dangle the full-time offer in front of them  saying stuff like  you know  my original plan was to have you on as an intern and bring you on full time  which i have the power to do  but i guess that's not possible anymore  next time  you should just say you aren't interested in the project   did they literally not just tell you that they weren't interested in your stupid project  how the fuck is a young professional telling you about their long term career trajectory offensive to you  so what if they want to do something different than marketing  furthermore  your title as vp of insights  amp  analytics indicates your responsibility and wisdom  it's not a fucking weapon you can use to terrorize young professionals and threaten to blacklist them  why is he even acting like nyc  amp  co is some prestigious company to work for anyway  young grads would rather work for companies like amazon  google  goldman sachs  mckinsey  whatever  but guess what  this isn't even the worst part   he then goes on and makes a passive aggressive post about their conversation on his public profile  with 80 000  followers  saying that  young professionals these days don't appreciate new opportunities  it's not a good look  wasn't he the one that said my friend splitting up their time between their current work and his project wouldn't be possible  and he wouldn't want that  then he proceeds to talk shit with all his other colleagues and it's obvious he's talking about my friend  saying shit like  this literally happened to me today  i can't believe people don't appreciate my efforts to help them  so let me get this straight -- my friend turned you down because they want to go down a different path  and you proceed to belittle  mock  insult  and imply that you'll blacklist them  pull away the full-time offer during a fucking pandemic where fresh grads are already struggling  and then make a petty  public post about your private conversation with them    what makes me angry is that my friend is way too fucking nice to stand up for themselves or say no to people  this weird ass dude tried selling them his  analyst  program when they first met that doesn't actually teach you anything  no technical coding shit or anything  it supposedly teaches you how to  communicate effectively as a data analyst  he called them things like  mister missy  as well  this makes me mad because he literally doesn't know my friend already has it hard enough as it is  they're a low-income  first gen person of color  the child of immigrant parents  they also have a hard time with self-confidence and really asserting themselves in the workplace  my friend literally told me they just thanked him for his constructive criticism and ended the call    it's already fucking hard enough breaking into the industry as a fresh grad during a goddamn pandemic  not to mention my friend already struggles with their confidence  just for a douchebag like this guy to shit all over them and threaten blacklisting them  it's just so disheartening to see something like this happen after i've seen them try and grow out of their shell for so many years  and just when they've begun to branch out  something like this happens  i did my best to try and reassure them that this interaction wasn't their fault  it's his  i've spoken to a couple of my other friends that go to the same school  and guess what  this isn't even the first time this has happened  whenever someone disagrees with this guy or gives constructive criticism  he threatens to blacklist them and wields his title around like it's some sword he can use to ruin young professionals' careers  just because they don't bend to his will  other people that want to do data science have warned me about what a douche he is  but after hearing my friend's story and listening to them cry for hours because he literally destroyed their confidence about what they want to do makes me fucking furious  does he even know how many therapy sessions my friend has attended to build the confidence to go out there and face the job search with a brave face  does he know how hard my friend has had to struggle to get where they are today  recovering from narcissistic abuse and trauma from their parents  i have literally watched my friend struggle and cry about difficult courses  paying rent on time  dealing with anxiety about the future  competing with their peers  pleasing their parents and whatnot  then again i wouldn't expect a narcissistic fuck-face like him to understand these challenges   young professionals are na ve and still figuring things out  yes  but they're not your fucking punching bag that you can just take your anger out on when they put their foot down and disagree with you  they're just as deserving of respect as anyone else   hey jonathan  if you're reading this  you mr  potato-head looking fuck  i suggest you stop threatening to blacklist young professionals  especially female   first-gen   low-income students from the industry  word spreads quickly and you will find that this is a small world -- people find out about these interactions  one way or another  and if i ever see you on the streets of new york  i'll fucking clock you    tl dr jonathan tesser  not only does he make shitty linkedin posts  a portion of them are petty posts about actual people  on top of that  he tries to sell everyone his weird ass  analyst  program  finally  when you disagree with him  he threatens to blacklist you on top of mocking and belittling you ,jo2gg0

1067,I'm probably not aligned with most here politically. But I have harsh criticisms of the modern work environment.,people wouldn't leave jobs so much if the annoying uppity fucks called  shift leaders  or  supervisors  didn't get so condescending when they got a  1 raise and a new nametag  these are the people that new employees run from  they need to get off their high horse  people dont leave the owners  they leave from those people   some of the standards held by some workplaces are absolute insanity  often not held by upper management themselves  these can include not making a single mistake on your first day  i've found that to be a common one ,jniw51

1104,Resigned from job after 1 year and 3 months. Team Director didn't even say bye to me lol.,hi all first time posting here  using a throwaway even though i've been following this subreddit for a really long time  as the title says  i resigned from my job last month  and been living off savings since then  not sure how much longer i can go on for    i'm 27 y o and every single job i've ever had i end up quitting  my mind can't fucking take it  it's waking up  starting at a screen all day  come home with no time to do anything and mentally fucking exhausted  have dinner  sleep and repeat  i always put in my best and try to add as much value to the team as possible  i have a long history of depression and anxiety  and the only way i can see myself ever working in that same environment again is getting heavily medicated and be so mentally out of it that i'd need to be put in a bs position where i don't really do anything but stare at a wall  but then what is the point of living like that  that'd be 40 hours a week of feeling miserable and useless   i just resigned from my job after only 2 months  and i am absolutely done with working in corporate office environments  i got a really great offer with high salary and benefits  but after i think the second week i realised i was in hell  it was just impossible to do this  i was starting to drink a lot after work just to cope because the feeling of sleeping and knowing i was gonna wake up to the same fucking routine every day was some of the worst pain i've ever had  i mustered the courage and i told them i was gonna take time off and do something else  so i gave them 2 week notice and my last day was mid last month  big boss didn't even talk to me after that      amp x200b   i don't ever want to see another fucking excel or powerpoint sheet ever again  not one more bs team meeting  not one more  fun team day-off  where we have to do team building exercises  we have all become slaves to this system that is giving us the bare minimum to just be able to have food and shelter  i had a very good salary compared to most of the people  but what is the point  it is impossible to buy an apartment or a house where i live  so only option is to move the fuck out of here and commute 1  hr to work every morning and 1  hr to work every night  i would forever be renting  paying some fucking bald boomer 50  of my salary for a small 1 bedroom place for myself  while he's chilling in the caribbean drinking all day  while adding absolutely no value to anything  can someone explain to me what this world has become  where do we all go from here ,jnlkth

1155,Doesn't capitalism require the bottom to suffer in order to hold the system up?,so im working on a project and what i've noticed about the capitalist system is that it depends on people being ranked lower in society   grocery store workers  janitors  cashiers  restaurant workers  etc are literally the backbone of capitalism  my argument is that capitalism causes and encourages poverty  more people on the bottom are more people to profit on  however a lot of people say it helps poverty rates  am i missing something   i also think this can apply to education  as more people acquire a college level  higher rank in society  education  it creates a dropping value for a college level education therefore lowering that persons rank  seeing someone with a degree working for minimum wage or a minimum wage job isn't that rare now a days    in conclusion if more people start acquire a higher salary or more qualifications  the bar is raised higher because the system can't sustain that many higher ranking people before their salaries drop   it seems almost impossible to have everyone earning a high wage  100k  under capitalism  higher wages just means prices will increase making the 100k people be on the bottom rung   anyone have thoughts  i haven't found that much info in favor of my opinion     amp x200b   btw i did post this on another sub first  ,jnr0j0

1159,How can I get back at my employer for some shitty moves?,i work for a contract security company and  lately  they ve been making some pretty shitty moves and fucking over everyone at my assigned post   first  they upped the pay to  14 when we did temperature screenings  apparently  it was supposed to be a permanent raise that would ve happened around the time i started and not just because of that  when we stopped  it went back down to  12 50 with about as much notification as the raise  answer- none  this pissed off a lot of other guards and a few have quit just because of that  it would ve been the last straw for me  if  it wasn t such a piss easy job and i can get away with a lot being on third shift   second  i ve found out that they ve purposely been short staffing my post and sending one of our guys over to another location on short notice frequently  this presents a problem in this industry because  in a worst case scenario  they can try and force a person to stay for 16 hours if relief isn t available or calls off at the last minute  the whiny shit bags over at scheduling have tried to get me to do doubles many times  but i ve always put my foot down and said i m not available  sure  time and a half is nice  but i m not going to put my health on the line because scheduling can t do their fucking job half the time  as long as there are two people at my post  the place can function- it s usually just the third person that s missing or a fill in running behind  even our supervisor is aware of the bullshit and tells us to just go if we have to    i ve been told i m a great employee  despite what little i actually have to do at my post  and my direct supervisor has been surprisingly understanding  it s corporate i have the issue with  i still want to find ways to fuck with them other than just doing the bare minimum and taking every opportunity to hop on youtube and my switch  idiots haven t figured out that you really can t control what we do in the office when there s no cameras monitoring- i even checked around for hidden ones  there isn t shit or else i would ve gotten written up ages ago  you guys got any suggestions ,jpmqhm
