0,I got screwed over by the pandemic,"I’ve been out of a job the last 10 month because of the pandemic but I’m covered through unemployment insurance for now. I dread applying for jobs because I absolutely hate the idea of going back into the office world bullshit. I remember staying extra hours at work and not getting paid for it (Stupid, I know) to finish a task on time so I wouldn’t get in shit. Then I had to deal with office politics and shitty co-workers. There were people I enjoyed working with but I don’t think the people at work are your ‘friends’. I’m a young guy and I’ve made a bunch of rookie mistakes. I had a full time job, income and was seeing friends regularly, and then the pandemic hits and it’s all gone. Losing money isn’t the worst part, I’ve been poor my whole life. This event stripped me of my self-esteem. 

I went from working 40 hours a week and doing extracurricular activities regularly, now I’m sitting on my parents couch, damn near about to cry as I type this and I’m the heaviest weight I’ve ever been my entire life. 

I dont know what I’m doing or how I’m going to change. I’ve been applying to jobs, and reading books to make myself more financially literate. I wish I could go to a gym but it’s all closed in my area.

6,The problem with working too much,"This post was originally on r/productivity. A user told me you folks would appreciate it too. 

\----

For the ambitious among us, we feel that success in today’s hyper-competitive world can only be obtained by pouring more and more time into work. Long hours grinding it out in the office is almost taken for granted as a prerequisite for success.

Ascending the corporate ladder or making your business succeed can come to seem like a punishing endeavor, especially considering that we have other important priorities like spending time with our families or keeping up a social life.

However, the scientific literature shows unequivocally that more time does not translate to more productivity in the long term. It seems we have been seriously mistaken in our approach to work. In fact, working for longer hours can actually be *detrimental* to your work.

#### The problem with overwork

In the productivity project, Chris Bailey examines the optimal amount of time we should spend working per week in order to maximize our productivity.

&gt;*One study found that when you work sixty-hour weeks, in order to accomplish one more hour of work, you need to work two hours of overtime. Yet another study found that your productivity “falls off a cliff after 55 hours—so much so that someone who puts in 70 hours produces nothing more with those extra 15 hours.”*  
After thirty-five to forty hours of work, studies show that your marginal productivity begins to drop, until “at approximately eight 60-hour weeks, the total work done is the same as what would have been done in eight 40-hour weeks.” The same study found that with seventy- and eighty-hour weeks, you reach the same breakeven point in just three weeks.  
Studies show that the ideal number of hours to work every week is even lower than that. They suggest that the optimal number is roughly thirty-five to forty hours.

The human brain cannot handle long hours. It simply does not have the capacity for such prolonged periods of concentration. Beyond a certain point, you simply do busy work instead of meaningful work that actually moves the needle forward.

You might *feel* a lot less guilty when working longer hours, but those hours aren’t really contributing to anything. When you consistently work long hours, it’s usually a sign that you’re not spending your time and attention wisely—not that you have too much to do.

#### Where did long hours come from?

Today we treat stress and overwork as a badge of honor. We brag about how little sleep we get and how few vacation days we take. We even want to be known as workaholics. The time we spend at work is seen as a direct indicator of our commitment to the job. But where did this deeply pernicious idea come from?

Our tendency to pile on more time is a remnant of the industrial age, when more time actually did translate to more productivity. Back then, the work was mostly physical, in actual factories, and creating tangible products. It didn’t require high levels of concentration.

&gt;*Measuring time first became important during the industrial revolution, when factory owners needed their workers to arrive on time. Today, in the knowledge economy, if you want to become more productive, managing your time should take a backseat to how you manage your energy and attention.*  
*When we transitioned into the time economy, we began to trade our time for a paycheck. But as we have transitioned into the knowledge economy, we’ve begun to trade so much more than just our time. Most people who work nonfactory jobs trade some combination of their time, attention, energy, skills, knowledge, social intelligence, network, and ultimately their productivity, for a paycheck.*

Now, we are all very much knowledge workers. In factories and fields, we could point to physical products at the end of the day, but in the knowledge economy that’s not possible. The ‘product’ is intangible and projects may take years to complete. But we still assume that spending more time will lead to better work. Simply pouring more time into work does not improve the quality of the end product.

Rest:

&gt;*The assumptions that knowledge is produced rather than discovered or revealed, that the amount of work that goes into an idea determines its importance, and that the creation of ideas can be organized and institutionalized, all guide our thinking about work today. When we treat workaholics as heroes, we express a belief that labor rather than contemplation is the wellspring of great ideas and that the success of individuals and companies is a measure of their long hours.*

Santiago Ramón y Cajal, in his book *Advice for a Young Investigator*, argues that a view of work as demanding countless hours of dedicated effort—as a kind of ‘intellectual work’—leads investigators to waste their energy on small and superficial problems.

Rest:

&gt;*But this was a style of work, Ramón y Cajal argued, that led to asking only shallow, easily answered questions rather than hard, fundamental ones. It created the appearance of profundity and feelings of productivity but did not lead to substantial discoveries.* ***Choosing to be prolific, he contended, meant closing off the possibility of doing great work.*** *\[Emphasis mine\]*

### The proper approach to knowledge work

So if not time, then what? How do we get ahead?

The proper approach to knowledge work is, according to Santiago Ramon, ‘Cerebral polarization or sustained concentration’. In other words, working with great intensity of focus and concentration—also known as deep work.

Knowledge work requires vigorous concentration of mental energy. This state of sustained concentration, writes Ramon, “refines judgment, enriches analytical powers, spurs constructive imagination, and—by focusing all light of reason on the darkness of a problem—allows unforeseen and subtle relationships to be discovered.”

Except, it doesn’t seem possible for the human brain to sustain such intense focus for too many hours each day. The daily maximum is about 4 hours. Any longer, and your thinking becomes hazy and nebulous.

All manner of high achievers attest to this rather contentious assertion. Charles Darwin’s daily ‘work’ schedule consisted of just three ninety-minute periods. G.H. Hardy, one of the leading mathematician’s of the first half of the twentieth century said, ‘Four hours creative work a day is about the limit for a mathematician’. Countless writers—including Charles Dickens and Anthony Trollope—express similar sentiments. In fact, this is even endorsed by modern tech entrepreneurs, as alluded to in Paul Graham’s [Maker’s schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html).

Deep work can only be sustained for a limited time each day. Work too little, and you’re not maximizing your progress. Work too much, though, and you increase the likelihood of simply resorting to busy work, draining yourself mentally, or burning out. To succeed, you must avoid exhaustion and limit work to an amount from which you can recover on a daily and weekly basis.

Thus, if you want to achieve maximally in your job, the proper approach is to break your workday into a few sprints and recoveries. The foundation of high performance is balancing rest and recovery. During sprints, you focus all your energy and intensity and work forcefully. Then, you recover. You allow your mental energy to replenish by resting. You go on a pleasant walk, take a nap, do some breathing exercises, practise yoga poses, listen to some music, read a magazine, eat a snack, take a shower or do anything else you find pleasant and relaxing. A good rule of thumb is to schedule an inviolable twenty-minute break every 90 minutes.

The utility of recovery is most obvious in the lives of scientists. Many famous stories of breakthroughs involve periods of intense work. Then during a break, the answer suddenly appears in a flash of insight. In contrast, the scientists who cram their schedules with shallow work sacrifice profound insights to carry out a lot of superficial tasks.

### Work for the sake of work

Nietzche wrote: ‘What could destroy us more quickly than working, thinking, and feeling without any inner necessity, without any deeply personal choice, without pleasure—as an automaton of “duty”? This is the very recipe for decadence, even for idiocy.’

You see, many of us work for the sake of work. We tend to see work as meaningless drudgery. We may work so that we can feel ‘productive’, or so that the boss can see us sweat hard. Perhaps we might even genuinely feel that all the hours we’re putting in are really making an impact. All of this does not lead to great work being done.

If high performance is our goal, we need to understand the necessity of rest and recovery. Rest is not the adversary of work. Rest is its essential partner. Rest and recovery allow us to perform maximally. It replenishes our mental and physical energy, and permits us to give our best. It is for this reason that American business journalist Berties Charles Forbes wrote, “how we spend our non-working hours determines very largely how capably or incapably we spend our working hours.”

The data is in. The conclusions have been drawn. We should not be working long, gruelling hours. It’s bad for our productivity, and for our lives. Instead, focus your energy and intensity into sprints, and work with sustained concentration for shorter amounts of time. Make rest a priority.

In the modern era, we have overridden the natural rhythms of work. The challenge now is to deliberately create boundaries and take time for recovery.

9,I genuinely think we will see a change in the future,"No, maybe not in 5-10 years. Hell, maybe not even in 20 years. But it is blatantly obvious that people ages 12-30 do not have the same outlook on life as their parents did. Our parents were driven by their work. They define their life and their success based on how their work is going. It’s all they know. The internet has allowed us all to share our experiences and deepest secrets. It has allowed us to tell each other things we are too afraid to speak out about publicly. We’ve realized nobody likes work and it’s okay to admit that. Our parents are afraid to say this because it defines them. If they say work is stupid then they’re admitting their life is meaningless. 

Seeing how unwilling younger people are to take shit from authority (or as older folks would call it, being lazy) gives me hope. The internet allows us to join up in larger numbers. We actually wield a small amount of power now, albeit still nothing compared to the government. But alas, we can make a difference. When we become the CEO’s and when we become the parents, we can change the rules. And I’m confident we will to an extent. The world is changing, and I believe we are opening up to the idea that life is more than just working. This sub’s success is proof of that. Do you think a newspaper section about antiwork would ever garner support in the 50’s? Hell no.

24,The actual meaning of working/studying and us losing touch with it,"I am a social worker and yesterday me and my manager had a talk between shifts, one of the subjects being how overworked she was since there is so much to do. The most interesting thing she mentioned was that working five days a week or even more felt fine when she had the same position as me (no managerial responsibilities but only direct frontline work) since it was more about actually working with the clients and focusing on their needs instead of having to attend meetings, being available around the clock, dealing with bureaucratic bullshit, having to be a liaison to every authority or organization involved etc on top of the usual work. Now five days a week feel like just too much for her which is understandable.

For those of you who have a client contact based profession, you probably recognize this dilemma. The higher up you become in the field, the less in touch you are with the clients and the heart of the work. You become more responsible and have an opportunity to change how things work from within, however you lose much of the relationships you build directly with them. Which, for me, is the core of actual social work – using your interpersonal skills to empower, support and help clients through this society filled with poverty and terrible work environments shaped by inequality, racism and bureaucracy jungles. 

After I graduated university, I moved to another country to do the same type of work. One of my colleagues back home asked me why. I said “why not? I want to travel and learn and do things that make me happy”. His response was “yes sure, but don’t you want to have a job that is more… prestigious?” All I could think was “if you think having a prestigious job is the most important thing, you’re going to be a terrible social worker.”

Humans are natural learners and labourers. We all have different types of skills that could contribute to our society, the value being the products *itself* and not the money be get in exchange for it. This doesn’t only apply to actual materialistic products, but other human intra- and interpersonal skills such as being a good listener, giving advice, singing, problem solving, sharing knowledge, storytelling and so on. However all these skills are losing their actual face value since it is now more about how MUCH you can work and how much MONEY or STATUS you can make instead of actually accumulating and developing abilities. What is the point of “doing what you love” if you’re going to water it down or even drown it with thoughts of climbing up some status ladder? And for what, apart from improving your resume? The worst thing you can do is letting others expectations ruin your passion.

Has anyone experienced or have general thoughts about this meaningless and almost hysterical CLIMB-THE-CAREER-LADDER-mantra (especially in North America) in some way that has affected your interest for your actual work/studies? How did you cope?

30,No Degree-Customer Service Trap (Rant),"So, college has never really been for me. I attempted to attend community college after high school in 2011. Over the past 10 years, I've lost interest in countless classes and continually either fail out or drop out voluntarily. Truthfully, the only reason why I've tried at college so many times is because I've felt pressured by society and family/friends. I am knowledgeable in many areas including photography, computers, and writing. However, the problem is that I don't have the piece of paper that says so.  I love to learn but on my OWN terms. Am I just destined to work jobs that provide little-to-no respect, garbage pay, and often times have to deal with customers? 

I'm on my 18th job in 10 years, and it's gotten no better. My friends who graduated from college still work sucky jobs (I have strong opinions about work in general, so trust me, my goal in life isn't to find some dream job) but they at least get to do things that are somewhat interesting. I always get stuck working with customers or being someone's assistant in one way or another. Right now, I work for a software company. It's Monday-Friday, 9-5:30PM. I hate the schedule, and it has me completely burned out. The job was supposed to be for a desktop support technician. But, of course, it turned into a role where I call rude customers on the phone and help them with software-related issues.  Sometimes I sit at my desk and I just get a wave of depression because, it's like, here I am 10 years later, and I feel that I'm in the same boat I've always been in. 

Of course, when I tell most people about this, they call me lazy and say, ""What can you expect? You have no skills."" Even though, no offense, but most of these people can't even form a proper grammatically correct sentence, but they have a degree, so they feel superior to me. I'm not lazy at all. It's just that none of my interests provide profit and my knowledge has come from my own learnings instead of a classroom. 

So, is this it for me unless I submit to higher formal education? Even though, I suppose, it may be no better. We all just end up working for some asshole and are supposed to be grateful for it.

The solution is the decommodification of everything through sustainability, automation, and essentialism. Easy right? In more concrete terms, the solution is to strengthen the relationship between production, consumption, and sustainability. The solution is to design society in such a way that things are not just produced, for-profit; but actually for the benefit of humanity as a whole. This means abandoning the concepts of money, unending growth, and thoughtless consumption. And instead of building a society based around community, intention, and sustainability. To do this it is not possible to work within the current bounds of liberal democracy. It is also not advisable to try and seek a violent nonconsensual revolution.

Let’s go over what I just postulated in detail. Decommodification is the process of taking things that were once traded as commodities (i.e. for our purposes branded products in a capitalist market) and turning them into something else. A good example of what this looks like is the free u-pick fields in the Midwestern United States. These are fields of usually blueberries that have been left to grow and now are a community resource that you can harvest from freely. Another example from before capitalism took hold were the British commons before the enclosure movement. These resources weren’t traded weren’t branded they were just resources that existed. Making resources the property of all is not the only way to decommodify resources. For soldiers in the American military, MRE and other government equipment are not commodified.

Sustainability can be hard and nebulous, to define. It’s often much easier to start off with what not sustainable; and then try and postulate what a world without those things might look like. Therefore a world with no unsustainable elements = a more sustainable world. Things that are unsustainable usually produce nothing of usable value to either nature or humans after they have been used. Due to the nature of thermodynamics, everything will eventually end up in this state. But how long it takes to reach that state give a good metric by which we can measure the sustainability of a given object (how long until everything associated with it is unusable), or a system (what sustainable vs unsustainable distribution does it produce), or a society (how do many of the systems which make up a society are sustainable). By this definition, there are very few things that are unsustainable but there are plenty of things that aren’t that sustainable. For example, many plastics are considered unsustainable because once they are used they can’t be recycled into new high-value items. But they can be used for all sorts of things they are just of lower value (building material, decoration, synthetic thread, etc). So we see that certain plastics can be rated on how after each use how much value does it lose after each use (both to humans, and to the environment). And how other plastics such as bioplastics, for example, are very sustainable because after reuse they maintain a larger percentage of their value and actually gain value to the environment. Applied to products this means practices like planned obsolescence are unsustainable because they are built upon the product losing value over its lifecycle. Applied to systems this means that inflation is usually unsustainable as it makes the store of value such as the dollar lose value overtime with no gain in its worth to the environment.

Automation is not really that hard to pin down it is the completion of labor (the process of adding or transmuting value) being done by a non-human autonomous(self-managing) agent. That means tool use is not necessarily automation having a better axe does not make one’s job more automated. Usually, this takes place when machinery’s lifetime cost is less than that of a human laborer’s. This can only happen however is the machinery’s initial cost can be paid. Integrated automated systems lead to an astonishing network effect of rapid and efficient just in time manufacturing.

Essentialism is an offshoot of the minimalist movement, with minimalism being a response to hyper-consumerism. The goal of both minimalism and essentialism is to consume less. Essentialism goes about this by practicing “the disciplined pursuit of less”. What I am advocating for is not the mainstream version of either minimalism or essentialism. What I’m advocating for is what I’d like to call “the disciplined pursuit of nonsuperfluous self”. Which combines the tenants of Essentialism, Non-Alienated labor, and Zen Buddhism. The idea is to have an intimate relationship with the things you come to possess by making sure you only possess things that you truly care about. What this looks like is when let’s say you need new jeans you either find an artisan that knows how to make jeans and make an arrangement by which you receive jeans you love and they are fairly compensated, or you learn the craft of making jeans or realizing that the particular type of jean does not matter to you go and get a generic utilitarian, comfy pair.

Putting all these concepts together results in something magical. Completely automating the supply chains of things allows for those things to become decommodified without having to endure the “tragedy of the commons”. Through this, you can then treat those automated decommodified supply chains like you would a 3D printer meaning that for essentialist consumption it allows you to customize every step of the manufacturing process allowing consumers to have more say in the products they consume, ultimately leading to less waste, and more self-identification with the product. This whole system can be engineered from a systems design approach from the beginning with a mathematical definition of sustainability in it from the start allowing for it to rated on sustainability.

As long as these things can be produced sustainably after the startup costs are recuperated the things produced by these supply chains need not be bought or sold. The end result of this means that there is such a way in which you could set up a society like ancient Athens where for the citizens the basic necessities of life can be guaranteed without cost to anyone. This society is the solution, a society where production, consumption, and sustainability are inseparably intertwined. This society where things are produced for the benefit of each and every member of the society. This society in which money is a construct of the past, where consumption is not the rule of the day.",False,l8o1ad,llcoolj92301,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/l8o1ad/what_is_the_solution/,0,1

This year we've seen massive changes to how we work, mostly due to covid but also I think the execs actually do care about our working culture.

The way things work now is I don't have set hours anymore, my job is 100% remotely done, every quarter I get given all my work and the deadlines and I get to create my own hours so far it's been a huge change. I'll have days where I need to send off a request for data but after that's done all I can do is wait and pretend I'm busy. Now I can send off my request and just stop working.

The idea behind it being I'll make up that time when it comes to the bulk of work being done like report writing, analysis etc.

**10 hours a week 'temporary' cleaning job for 4 weeks** \- must have 2 years of cleaning experience 

Its just 10 hours a week for a month!! I clean my house for the last 2 years is this enough!! Obviously not as I never heard anything.

**Shop shelf stacker or as they call it stock replenisher** \- Had to answer 8 questions on how I would handle certain situations with customers and then a short personal questionnaire where you had questions like ""Would you be happy to do overtime?, Do you see yourself as a team player?  Do you look to go above and beyond in your job?  It almost feels like entrapment as you have to say YES to these questions to get any chance of getting the job then if you do they can hold you to it. Then finally if I got that far I would need to have an interview. Its just stacking shelves!

**Part-time Estate agent administrator -** Needed someone to help with basic admin tasks consisting  of generating letters, printing out contracts. (No selling house, no advising people, just paperwork)  Required - 3+ years of property experience.!!! 

Its seems the more basic and lower wage the job the more they expect from you to get it. I saw another role which was minimum wage, **40 hours** a week and in their words a generous work package which included **20 days holiday**. 20 days! the average is normally 22 to 24, how can they see that as generous!!

73,I wrote this poorly written hardly coherent rant out of frustration.,"Animals (especially pets) do not have to work, but they never stop doing it. They wake up everyday and hunt for their meals, protect their turf, take care of their young, and all kind of other productive activities, yet take constant breaks to relax and reflect. They successfully do all that everyday without an artificial soul crushing construct. 

If we were to look at nature for inspiration and education (as we should), then living in small (loose or tightknit) anarchical or semi-anarchical communities, exploiting nature, yet taking care and sustaining it, instead of hirarchichaly exploiting each other and destroying what little nature we have left.

The current global system is falling and failing and crushing us under its own weight in the process. Yet it is insanely defensive against any type of real change to itself, for one simple reason which is the people that are needing from it have all the arms and power.

Every time the system is shaken, or been under a crisis it gets up even weaker, yet even more resisting of change.

As we saw, the system is mad with an insatiable hunger and is fueled by excess, it has to inflate, and would die if it stops. Consumption has to increase every day more than the one before it would be red alert.
Do we really need more beef and dairy farm? Haven't we reached the point of equilibrium and sufficiency yet? Aren't all the farms of the world enough to feed the population times and times over? If not then why is there so much waist?

A world run by monetary instive isn't natural or healthy for body or mind.

The fact that fairness is destructive to the workplace says a lot about the nature and the state of how healthy the work environment is. Working fair hours, having a fair workload, appropriate number of employees, getting paid a fair wager, and any other fair practice are destructive to the workplace. Why would we care about saving such a place?

To save man (body and soul), more power should be transferred to the workers than the owners. Humans aren't lazy, human ingenuity is infinite, and thus for condition should be set to have it used. If someone can't find a job weather it be because of lack of opportunities, inhuman working conditions, or laughable wages, a tax proportional to the unemployment rate should be taken out of companies and redistributed to people serious about looking for a job, thus encouraging new businesses and competition, and hitting companies where it hurts and incentivising them to hire more, and better their work conditions.

Humans aren't lazy or stupid, they don't need bosses or management to make them work, it is just that the current state of the workplace has taken out the value out of labor, with it's bureaucracy and practices.
Handymen and craftsmen and other independent workers were always a part of society and we need more of them and less of big and international companies.

Companies shouldn't be allowed to dominate or do inhuman or monopolistic practices to cut costs, even vertical supply companies should be broken down to allow more compittion. These practices might raise costs, and price of goods, but also raise wages (especially for the poorest amongst us) and give us more equality, creativity, and freedom to change jobs and careers.

91,Leeching Off Taxpayer Money? Not Quite.,"I hear this argument a lot in critique of anti-work and leftist thought that many of us are lazy and entitled, and are living off taxpayer money. It's usually meant to express outrage from people who are financially successful and have been working hard. However, since the argument is both pervasive and illogical, I thought it perhaps worthwhile to write a brief-ish response.  


To begin with, if you have been financially successful, consider yourself lucky. Increasingly, most of us do not have that privilege. And, I do agree that taxes are too high. This is because most of your tax money is going to pay for wars, prisons, and billionaire subsidies. Moreover, the welfare that does exist, such as medicare, as inefficiently run to the point where the people administering the service make more than the people benefiting from the service itself. So if you don't like paying high taxes, first take a look at where they are going.  


Secondly, though I can't speak for others, I myself have three to four sources of income at any given time. I own a motor home, and an RV. By the legal classification in my country, I'm homeless, ie without a home. Rent is too high, food is expensive, medical care is too expensive. I must rely on subsidies in one form or another- even with all the money I make. The rich people of my country, America, have monopolized real estate and cornered various markets to the point where they have collective monopolies. Put together, they can charge whatever price they please and pay their employees whatever wage they like.  


So perhaps you can imagine the feeling I might have when I see someone come in and say ""work harder"" or ""you're just lazy."" I know it's not true. I know that many of us here in this sub actually do work hard. We're just tired at the end of our shifts, and we have little to nothing to show for it. We're being squeezed from all sides. We're doing the best we can, trying to survive in whatever way know how.  


If you're this angry at us, the working class, the poor, then you're on the wrong side. We're like you. We're tired of things being expensive. We want to have a bit of money set aside at the end of the month. We don't like the fruits of labor disappearing down rabbit holes we can't reach. We don't hate folks like you. In fact, most of us don't mind when someone works their way into success honestly. That's something to be celebrated. Be proud of yourself, for you've done well.  


The animadversion comes in when you judge us, even though our struggle is so much like your own. When you try to set yourself up as above us, as though you are a better class of person- somehow. The vast majority of us aren't tax assessors or politicians. We don't determine the taxes you pay. A lot of us don't even like politics to begin with. Please keep this in mind the next time you try to be judgmental and insulting.  


We're all just trying to live and get by, that's all.",False,l93hvv,WinterTrabex,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/l93hvv/leeching_off_taxpayer_money_not_quite/,19,1
92,I am beyond scared. How do you survive in these times? Any advice or suggestions would be so greatly appreciated!,"I was laid off due to lack of business because of COVID.

I never imagined at age 35 I would be in this position. 

I have been searching for work, and unfortunately am limited to trying to find something that I can do from home. I am in the middle of trying to recover from a severe eating disorder, and the damage I have done to my body puts me at high risk so I can't risk leaving the house unless absolutely necessary. 

None of the jobs I have applied to have even called me back. I have excellent references and experience in my field and have even branched out and applied for jobs outside of my field, but to no avail. 

I feel like I've exhausted all options - unemployment, deferred payments on my car loan and rent, canceled every monthly service except basic utilities, food stamps, etc. I just spent the absolute last dollar I had on a bag of dog food and have nothing left. **Nothing**. I cannot pay a single bill, buy any more groceries, or even leave my house as my gas tank is almost on empty.

If we were to be able to not work, where would our food come from? Utilities like water, electric, gas etc require people to operate the systems. The medical system is full of people who have skills that we need.

Just as a couple examples, how do we approach that? I mean fundamentally we need to survive, we can’t just sit and expect to live...

My partner and I both take Covid seriously.  But at this point, we are ""semi lax"" around each other.

In a 12 hour shift, we're working within two feet of each other for about 9 hours.  The other 3 hours are breaks and the downtime between cycles.  

If a supervisor sees us standing three feet away from each other though during downtime and speaking, they will scream at us to move six feet back.

131,MONEY ISN'T EVEN FUCKING REAL LMAO,"I get this sounds like a stupid sophomoric stonerism but that doesnt change the fact that it's FUCKING TRUE.

The renewed furor at Wallstreet and the billionaire class and the amount of people 'waking up' to the understanding that 'the game is rigged' is both inspiring and frustrating because while it's a step in the right direction to understand that the game is rigged it still falls short in acknowledging that WE RIG THE GAME OURSELVES and that ""money"" is literally shaped and influenced by our collective ideas about it - it's an *egregore* - if we want to change something about it's form it's as ""simple"" as altering our shared beliefs - admittedly that's not that simple.

Unless of course we had some kind of technology that allowed for instant and constant communication between hundreds of millions of people all over the world.

If 90% of us agree that the weekend begins on Friday and ends on Sunday, then that's all it takes to be true.

If 90% of us agree that billionaires have no right to exist, then that's all it takes to be true.

The problem up until now has been organizing the working class to act in unison - as an unstoppable force of nature - but with the curtains being pulled back thanks to the Internet and our self-reflective and constantly connected culture, it seems more and more possible that organizing that kind of collective action is really only a meme away.

I know leftists love a good revolution and rightfully want the rich holed up in their ivory towers quivering in fear - but guillotines can only separate a head from flesh - to behead an *idea* the meme is the only 'thing' that at our disposal that can destroy some other 'thing' with no physical form.

133,"Work isn't bad, capitalism is","Work is the way in which humans relate to their surroundings. Many on here would love to step away from their jobs and create art but that creation is obviously work. For others they may find more traditional jobs as fulfilling as we find out art. What's important is that our work comes from a place a creativity instead of from the threat of poverty. The problem is not work, it's capitalism. In our current economic system in which profit is valued over human need, many are forced into debilitating work to serve the uber-wealthy who screw us over at every turn. We have the resources, man-power, and drive to house, feed, and pay for everyone to live comfortably. We could raise the standard of living of everyone without them even needing to work. The rich do not need their wealth, they tie it up and keep it from the public, for the sole purpose of profit. If those resources were fairly given, everyone could, right now, live without having to work. Of course many would remain at their jobs, but now if you can't deal with the crushing forces of capitalism. You can step back and create something truly valuable without the threat of poverty. Instead of scorning those who've been beaten by the bourgeois, we should stand together and show the true benefit of our work.

175,Early morning thoughts on work,"Please excuse the following ramblings, for I am typing them as I’m thinking:

I was letting my mind wander this morning and for some reason I had a random flashback to a job interview I had years ago. It wasn’t particularly memorable, but it made my mind go down a path.

I hate the idea that you basically have to lie or “sugarcoat” your answers in a job interview, in order to get a job. When someone asks you “what is your biggest weakness” you’re supposed to say something clever like “well I’m a bit of a perfectionist, so that makes me care a lot about my work, blah blah blah” or some other BS like this.

What would happen if you were honest? “Well my biggest weakness is I can’t stay focused performing a job I hate in order to avoid starving or living on the street” or “I hate dealing with the entitled general public, but I need to do so otherwise I can’t afford basic health insurance and run the risk of going bankrupt if I have a serious medical accident”.

If you said something like that, you’re not getting the job. You have to lie about who you really are, to get a job you don’t actually like/get fulfillment out of, and more or less maintain this facade while working so you don’t get fired for “having a bad attitude”.

Personally, I don’t have a bad attitude. I’m generally nice and easy going and make friends fairly easily. But being at work just puts me in a sour mood. Knowing that I’m performing tasks that do nothing for me personally, don’t advance my life for the better in anyway.

Some people say, “well, we’ve all got to do things we don’t like sometimes...”, but I think that’s bullshit. Why? Why are we spending our tiny bit of time on this earth doing something we hate? Making up stupid clever sounding things for our resumes and trying to maintain a smile through a pointless job interview. “Oh yes sir I can maintain this smile while cashing out my 10,000th customer for the day, while being screamed at by my boss that my productivity is too low, thank you sir now I can afford the absolute basic necessities of life such as food, water and shelter”. 

I just have a hard time comprehending why this is the way it is. And the shitty part is, I actually enjoy doing work that I find fulfilling. I like working in my workshop and making stuff, I like tending to my garden, stuff like that, but because it’s on my own time and it’s for myself. Being at the beck and call of some boss like a damn dog is beyond depressing. Wearing a name tag and an outfit of some company that can give two shits about me and would replace me if I died tomorrow, I’d beyond depressing. I’m supposed to “represent the company” but when does the company have to represent me? 

And what’s the alternative option? Living off the grid? Running your own business? Then you become a slave to the customer. I don’t want to “sell” things. I want to enjoy a quiet, fulfilling life with my family. I want to be able to have dinner together every night and not live in constant fear that we won’t have the rent money next month because we might get laid off.

177,Do y'all have a dog?,"Ok it sounds unrelated to antiwork but hear me out.

I've been applying to adopt a dog, but no shelter will accept me because I work full time. I'm wfh atm bit that may not be permanent. I'm not going to lie about my situation and I'm not mad at the shelter either. I'm happy they look out for the dog's well-being and I wouldn't want to harm it by leaving it alone, so following their advice and not getting one. 

So what I'm mad at as always is having to work full time. Once again it's stopping me from doing what I want and fulfilling a lifelong dream. I probably can't stop working til 70 and God knows what'll get in the way then.

183,Wake up. Spread the message.,"

They've been deleting comments like mine that are trying to wake people up to the lies. Now they've turned off comments on this video. And possibly others on the entire channel and maybe all of the news channels.

Money is taken as a result of your efforts. Without people putting in effort there is no way for them to tax you. Because you won't be putting in effort to earn money. Therefore no tax can be taken from that money. Because where does the money come from to begin with? It's created out of thin air by the banks. How? Because there is a law that states banks are allowed to create/print money that we the tax payer are expected to pay back in the form of interest (tax). You see what a scam it is? They create money that they never had that we have to put in effort to get. Why should we. What effort did they (the banks and ruling elite) put in to earn it? They didn't. They expect us to believe the lie that money has intrinsic value. It doesn't. Never has. Never will.

People are waking up. I don't use Netflix or Instagram. I torrent pretty much everything. Why would I pay some corporation for movies when I can get them for free? I don't. Because I know if I were to pay that money would end up in the hands of the ruling elite somewhere down the line. If every single person on the planet torrented and otherwise didn't use money for anything digital their precious toilet paper (money) would lose it's ""value"" so fast that their heads would spin.

Brokerage firms and the ruling elite are liars.

So basically they (Robinhood, brokerage firm) had no money to cover but they took people's money anyway? That is a scum move. It is bullshit. 
So the retail investors (us everyday people) put in our time and effort for essentially nothing. We are working for free. Stop believing that money has value. It doesn't. Never has. Never will. The ruling elite need to be held accountable for lying to us. Money has never had any value. Stop putting in time and effort for nothing. To be clear when you go to work you are not getting anything of value for your time and effort. Ask yourself why are you even bothering?

Watch and learn. You'll begin to understand how we've all been deceived and controlled since birth.

I already knew this before I ever heard of Anonymous. And before the internet was mainstream as it is now.

I fucking hate this whole industry, but I’m forced to work in it because my degree is worthless and because all the work experience I have is in it.

Anyways, MY JOB MAKES ME SO MAD. 

Whenever something goes wrong - a very frequent occurrence - it always becomes MY issue. 

Truck broke down? No problem, I’ll call all these businesses and tell them their freight is delayed...again. I love getting yelled at on the phone because of our shitty equipment! 

Driver sick? No problem, I’ll drive that tractor trailer unit across state/provincial boundaries for you! It’s not like I have a life or anything that might require me to be home tonight. I love being the one-stop solution to labour shortages. 

Department manager quit? No problem, I’ll manage the whole department, with no wage increase! 

Everyday all these issues become MY problem. 

And I only make $30,000/year! 

The General Manager makes $140,000/year - and all he fucking does is make sure there are styrofoam coffee cups in the lunch room! I’m not kidding, he literally does NOTHING all day. I know, I sit beside him in the office!

I'm sick of having to beg my parents for money to pay bills so I'm looking at either CS or IT.

I work, at least for now, in electronics repair. I signed up to be a full time field service tech at a whopping 13 bucks an hour. They have me still working in the store, and for under 30 hours a week, for 10$ because I'm ""still onboarding"", it's been over a month, and the reason I'm not ""perfect"" at fixing stuff is because since I'm the lowest drone I'm the one who always has to do the front, so I never get to actually fix stuff.

Anyway I tell my work that I'm thinking of going back and that since I'm already only scheduled 25 hours or so a week, I'd like them to just decrease it to 20, I'm already wing-clipped from being independent as it is, might as well get my degree done faster.

You know what they told me?

They told me they would absolutely make me part time, but that they would limit me to 10$, and I would only be doing the front.

Not even that I would just be in the store instead of a field service tech, that I would be entirely removed from fixing machines.

For 10 bucks. Straight up regular retail. I'm fucking deceased.

I can walk into any big box store and walk out with a 20 hour gig and they \*start\* at 15. Hell I could probably make more than 10 bucks an hour delivering food and that would be way more chill.

WWYW.GOSAR.HOUSE.GOV

Acting Attorney General Only Dickinson
U.S. Department of Justice

950 Pennsylvania Ve, of

Washington, of 20530-0001

Dear Acting Attorney General:

I am greatly troubled with the events that have unfolded on All Street and demand action from the U.S.
Department of Justice. Today, a FINRA regulated broker-dealer called “Robinhood Markets, And.” halted the purchase
of stocks for several publicly traded companies including Gamestop, Blackberry, AMC and others. His unilateral move
was done so in a concerted effort to de-platform and silence individual investors.

His began when an investment management fund called “Pelvis Capital Management” placed an aggressive
short sell on the company Gamestop. To contradict this decision, the heavily followed credit page “r/wallstreetbets”
and their administrators advocated that their followers purchase Gamestop stock using the broker Robinhood. The
movement was so immense that it drove the stock price to over 400% of its previous value. Is a result, Pelvis Capital
lost billions on their return and Robinhood blocked users from buying anymore of Gamestop stock but still allowed
liquidation.

Pelvis Capital Management is owned by the parent company “Citadel, LLC” which, according to a Bloomberg
Report!, gave Robinhood roughly 40% of their revenue. Knowing the involvement Citadel has with Robinhood, it is
clear that the actions taken today were motivate by anti-competitive reasons not for concerns of volatility claimed by
Robinhood. Because of this latent conflict of interest and obvious monopolists activity, I am calling on an immediate
investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice into Robinhood and the hedge fund of Citadel, LLC.

Sincerely,

of no

Paul A. Tsar, D.D.S.

What do you do? Do you stop the interview right then and there? How would do even stop it? Do you continue and hope they don’t offer you a job? Do you decline the offer and pretty much forget about any future jobs with that place?

239,I just LOVE getting yelled at by supervisors at work for having the audacity to question them :),"I work at a warehouse. Job involves moving packages; I’ll let you infer from there. 

Got told over the radio to move someone from my line to a different one. I said that my section was so busy that I didn’t feel comfortable or safe being there myself. Supervisor literally said the exact same thing, didn’t add in “It’s ok I got you” or ANYTHING. Just said the same thing. I need to note that this is probably only my 10th time doing this specific thing they’re making me, and only my 3rd with a radio. I assumed, due to my lack of experience and the warehouse being fucking LOUD, that he just didn’t hear what I said. So, I repeated that I didn’t feel safe being the only person there while literally thousands of packages go through. This was a mistake to say. He yelled over the radio, I gave up and sent the other person away.

I’m now alone doing something almost impossible for one person to do. Supervisor comes up and starts yelling at me in person. His solution to not having another worker with me? Putting a box in her section so the packages go into mine. Which, unsurprisingly, doesn’t work because box he used was too small, and when something too small has hundreds of other boxes hitting it it ends up moving and hitting the belt; thus triggering a security measure that stops the entire line. Over and over again. Wow, who wouldn’t guessed that? 

Oh, did I also mention that I’ve been there only a little over a month? So obviously I’m not very experienced with literally anything; ESPECIALLY when there’s NO training whatsoever. 

Working in a warehouse is fucking hell, but it pays ok and there’s a union (which I can’t join yet....) and benefits.

245,I’m so burned out,"Im a full time student &amp; have two jobs. Starting from last October I had 3 jobs, and worked every single day for about 2 months and then worked 6 days a week. Maybe its not as crazy as it sounds (Theyre all remote, but I spend ungodly amounts of time looking at screens. I also have a side hustle that I make money from) I told myself I was doing all this to pay back my student loans in the next 5 years. (Im 21 now). By December of last year the physical repercussions finally caught up to me. I could barely walk or bend over because of my back. Even now with quitting one of those jobs it hasn’t helped. School sucks the life out of me, this work is starting to. Im irritable, have 0 motivation, am frustrated over the simplest things, have no social life (I just moved, and in the middle of a pandemic its pretty hard to meet new people), and feel like I can’t think straight or enjoy my time off. Im quitting all of my jobs mid next month but to me it feels like the damage is already done. 

I don’t have any kids, not a lot of responsibility so I always question why the heck im running myself into the dirt for. It’s just the norm of paying loans back until I’m 35 sounds like a big bill for future me, and since Im getting a degree in a creative field I want to take care of it now. 
Student loans freaking suck. I pretty much am paying the equivalent of a mortgage. When I went to college, at 17 I (very ignorantly) never calculated the full cost of my 4 years.

246,"No, not everything is possible if you just ""work hard enough""","I'm not saying you shouldn't try, but I'm trying to say it's OK if you fail despite your best efforts. Just like not everyone can end up on the first place in race, not everyone can become like Bill Gates or Elon Musk. So many people think like this, it's insane...

Especially ""self made"" people who say this tend to be very obnoxious about it (""if I can make it, you can make it too""). Like yeah, you got out of poverty, you started a successful business and make six figures now, worked your ass off for god knows how long, and it's all good and respectable....but that doesn't automatically mean that every other poor person that ""doesn't make it"" is just lazy/stupid and not hard working enough. Because for every 1 successful person, there are thousands of others who put the same effort and work, but just didn't get there.

It's OK to be average. Hell I would rather prefer quiet average life over hectic lifestyle of super-popular celebrity. There's no shame in not ""making it"". If some people are happy with their lives as their are, driving cheap cars and drinking with friends on weekends instead of ""grinding"", then so be it. Let them be, if that's what makes them happy.

quick edit: to clarify, I'm not talking about personal success like losing weight or learning something for yourself, but rather conventional career/business/rat race related kind of success (like I mentioned Elon), Don'get get me wrong i'm not saying you shouldn't try to be the best and work hard if you want to.I like to be the best in the sports and video games i play, but its like this new culture is trying to make people feel bad about themselves if they aren't motivated to be on the top. It forces you to believe you're a loser if you don't have the most expensive clothes, cars, phones, engineering degree.. or if you're not willing to crush everyone that stands in your way to the top. You shouldn't feel pressured by society into doing something that is supposed to make you happy. You find your own happiness your own way even when it's against the ""standard"".

You really are constantly bombarded with the message of ""If you're not an engineer, doctor, CEO or scientist, you're a failure and a burden to soceity!""

I particularly see discrimination against manual labour workers, they're always shown to be low intelligence mongoloid people who had no brainpower to work at a ""proper""job. Even if you think coal miners and construction workers have it bad enough, check out the shit minimum wage employees get ""oh you're not earning 200k a year? Should've made better choices haha!""

251,One True Good Boss,"I feel like I might get downvoted for this but I just want to share a positive experience with everyone to shine some light through the darkness.

I legitimately have an awesome boss. He is the branch manager for 10 employees in our city while our headquarters are in a different city. That being said he is in the same trap as all the rest of us and does his best to make working as bearable as possible. Im not talking buying lunch for everyone from time to time(which he also does). Im talking he is a genuinely good person to work under. I was hired right before the pandemic started, into a position that does not deal with any customers. When paycuts, and layoffs happened, he fought for everyones jobs. I personally never recieved any pay reduction, or hours lost. 

Only 3 months into my job I ended up in the hospital with kindey stones and the guy did not so much as question the situation. He simply told me to do what i needed to do and get better, and if i needed anything to let him know. He didnt even ask for a doctors note. When I tried to return to work a couple days after i had surgery he told me not to, and to just stay home and rest, then sent me home when i came in that day anyway. (He also payed me for half the days i missed without me using vacation or sick days mind you). 

I also had a tendency to fuck up A LOT early on. Im talking shit that would just instantly get you fired anywhere else. Instead of giving me shit he checked in to make sure I was alright and worked with me to correct the things i was doing wrong. He never wrote me up, or disciplined me.

Another thing he did for me was put through paperwork to get all my education costs covered 100% by my company, under the pretense that it is relevant to my job and work.

The last thing that he does that most bosses dont do is understand peoples situation. I have aspergers and severe ADHD. This can have a huge effect on my ability to do certain tasks and work with people. I told him this and he was totally understanding. In fact he has made an effort to make sure that I do not have to do work that I would struggle with. (This all happened since my very expensive fuck ups). 

He has let me take dr appointments without making me use sick time, and one day when I could not make it to work because of multiple feet of snow, he called me before the work day and said to stay home that no job was worth risking my safety for. I got payed for that full day, despite not working.

I know working sucks but there are some GENUINELY GOOD PEOPLE out there, who are willing to take the time, and if you happen to work for them it makes working so much easier and less of a chore.

But my wife is like most of society, and wants nicer things. So I’m not really saving that much more, we just have nicer things. 

It is extremely depressing as I don’t see an end at all. The stress is unreal because i am the only one working, and if I lost my job we’d be at risk of losing our house, etc. so I’m a slave to my job to pay the mortgage, car and everything else.

Why? There’s no difference between us except: he chooses to work crazy overtime hours and he volunteers to cover every holiday shift. He does this because he doesn’t like being at home and he prefers doing something active with his day instead of relaxing at home. 

It’s not fair. He gets promoted and over me because I prefer a healthy work/life balance? I can’t work on the holidays like he can. I have a disabled mom and my presence on the holidays it’s pretty mandatory. My family would be really upset if I wasn’t home on the holidays and so would I. There’s nothing wrong with that. I’m really, really mad and upset that they don’t see me worthy of being a permanent employee because of that.

298,I need input on a problem,"I was working a seasonal position with Burlington Coat Factory. All employees were supposed to use an app called ''V-Time'' to get updates on my flexible schedule. I had never used this app prior to working at Burlington as my previous jobs were student work placements that omitted certain routines from the work schedule. 

On my first day, the store managers was helping me set it up but due to bad internet my phone was taking literal hours to download the app, and neither I nor the store manager had that much time to wait so they told me they would help me set it up on my next shift. This never happened as every time I had a shift, the store manager just told me ''next time'' and resorted to simply putting me on literal call in which she would call me in to work through text or phone a day to 30 minutes ahead of my scheduled shifts. Apparently, this was common with seasonal employees. 

According to all the documents, my seasonal position was supposed to end on January 11th. My last shift was on January 4th and absolutely nothing happened on January 11th. After January 11th I tried applying for more jobs to no avail. 

Tonight I just got a call from the assistant manager telling me that I had a shift scheduled to start 30 minutes ago. I informed her that I received no notification of this, was never able to set up my V-Time due to the manager always rescheduling it and I was under the impression that my work term ended on January 11th as according to my employee profile. She told me not to come in and she would speak to the store manager. 

I've had a very bad day so far and this has just added to it. I don't know if I'm in the wrong or if my manager is and I think it's very likely that I'll be fired for this. 

I suspect that I may be at fault here. I have Asperger's and one of the many problems I have is that I can't remember who is who in the chain of command at a job, especially a job in a large store where the chain of command and number of employees are obviously larger. I may have been going to the wrong people at the wrong times and I never tell an employer that I have mental disabilities because that just guarantees that I won't get the job. So basically, to them, I'm acting like a complete and total idiot.

I have a few hobbies, but they involve me being on my feet and engaged. After work and being on my feet all day, I just cant. I just want to sink into a couch and sleep, but then its the next day and im back at work.

301,My boss doesn’t give me any space,"I graduated college recently and spent six months looking for full time work. My father (who is just as antiwork as me) always told me the only silver lining to working is working from home. So, I spent the last six months trying to find a remote job, and got to the final 2-3 people several times for jobs I really wanted, then was rejected.

My biggest reason for seeking remote work is partially because of the pandemic and partially because I don’t want to have to go to work and act like I care... but the biggest reason is because I’m a musician and want to play gigs every night once the pandemic ends (and I want time to work on my music everyday).

I got a job as a social media coordinator last month, and when I heard the hours were 10-5 instead of 9-6 I thought I won the lottery! Those hours are perfect for what I want to do. I can sleep in and still have the whole night ahead of me. Plus social media is trendy and I had a few internships doing this before. I told myself no matter what I will keep this job, even if it’s awful, just because I need to move out and to a new city where music is booming.

But I’m finding it very hard. Every day that goes by I’m more depressed. My boss NEVER leaves me alone. She texts and calls me on my off hours. I’ll wake up at like 9 and she’s already trying to call me. She’ll text me at 9 at night asking me to do something. She makes me do shit on my days off - including New Year’s Day (I had to wake up and immediately do something to our website). She spent over two hours on the phone with me last Friday night after I was already done with work telling me what to do. She’s incredibly narcissistic, thinks she’s the shit because she built all of her companies from the ground up and makes it clear that nobody should work with her unless they are willing to not have a work life balance. She also makes it clear that she does not care about other people and will do anything to step on them and rise to the top.

Even though I work from home, I truly feel like I am never home. All of a sudden I have no work life balance, and am constantly thinking about work. Both my parents work from home and get to leave at 5 and don’t have to worry about it for the rest of the night or weekend. Me? She’s always bothering me, always giving me shit to do. I guess people were right about working from home - they’ll exploit you because they think that just because you’re home, you’re not busy.

302,"What do you think about ""remote working"" software that completely shuts down your own computer to monitor you all day long?","I think it's totally insane that we can't just work at home at our own paces. Even OUTSIDE of the workplace, employers MUST find a way to threaten us if we spend even one measly minute NOT being productive. I personally think such an obvious breach of Data Protection should make this sort of thing totally illegal. I thought I would be able to get a work from home job and I'd be able to just do my work in the background while I studied other things I am interested in, but NOOOO. You are an employee, how dare you try to have your OWN TIME in YOUR OWN HOME??

""Tangent here""

Luckily my bills are just barely affordable without a working income. But I'm one financial ""surprise"" away from losing everything I have ever worked for. I am 27 and I have never come out of work with more than I went in. So I'm not going to be doing it for as long as I can. Even if that means eating only a bowl of rice every day, not driving because insurance prices are insane, and getting myself signed off as ""clinically depressed"" so the system doesn't harass me into taking ""the worst paid most abusive fastest to get into"" job anynore. After taxes it really isn't worth it. My 8 hours are far more valuable to me and my growth as an individual than any abusive scum employer is willing to pay me for.
Every day, in the time I would be getting yelled at and constantly threatened for ""not hitting targets"", I have been learning coding and art at my OWN pace. And in the last month I have skyrocketed my abilities to a place I never would have seen coming. And guess what, I don't have to have a productivity tracker forcing me to do x amount of extra crap each day or I'll be ""punished"" to achieve any of this!! I do these things when I feel like it! I leave my desk when I feel like it! And I have never been broker. But I have also never been happier.

Learn to budget and see if you can manage with just financial aid. I don't feel like a sponge because all these employers want to do is abuse and underpay. I think the fact that the people paying my unemployment make more in 6 months than I could ever make in ten years working 16 hours a day just gives more reason to feel like, actually, THEY owe ME for helping their bullshit system continue.

307,Please act your wage!,"So I work in a large clinic/hospital/organization where I check in patients and schedule follow ups or other appointments. Not a bad job but not something I want to do for years on end. Despite supposedly high turnover we have some people who are complete lifers, cliques and Stockholm syndrome are strong. I'm not knocking people who stick with one job but goddamn it'd be nice if we could rotate some of these people but that's me ranting because I know it's not a good idea but it still sucks.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a little biased because as for what department I work in it actually varies. It sounds like a bad thing but for me it's a good thing. I am a floater so where I am working day to day can change. If I don't like somewhere I have a very good chance of working somewhere else and trust me some of the clinics aren't that great. There's been times where I've been at the same clinic for a month and other times I've worked three different places in a day. That's cool because it's something different. My schedule and hours are always the same though and the schedule actually works for me and my family so that's good.

&amp;#x200B;

There's one clinic I am in a lot and for the most part it's REALLY easy, and a few people I really get along with and there's one person I have really hit it off with and we have a good time working so I sometimes look forward to going there more often than not. However we have two people who have the same name and they are both annoying but the thing besides name they share in common is that they do not act their wage. What do I mean by this? They act ABOVE their pay wage thinking they are supervisors and trainers. They are at a higher pay-grade as my job has various levels tied to ""production"" and to keep that level you have to meet the production. I'm not really a fan of this concept.

&amp;#x200B;

Look, I'm not against or above needing assistance but in this case I didn't need it and I had something today that really pissed me off. I've spent most of my time in this clinic as I've been working this job. Anyway, I was checking in a person and they wanted to speak to the nurse which they normally don't see for this appointment. I let the patient know when they get back there they can request to speak to the nurse and I was almost done checking them in but....one of them butted in and were like ""well you can zoom the nurse if you look in the directory and get their name (oh they write it for the supervisor), or zoom the group"" Of which we have three zoom groups for the same job in the same clinic. Oi. I could have done this yes, but honestly, the nurses are busy dealing with IMO more important things like patient care, they may be in a meeting, a training, the schedule may change, they may be at lunch, busy helping another doctor etc and it may take a while for them to get back. I'm not afraid to approach a nurse if I need something but I'm not always going to make it the main solution. Would you want a nurse to always rely on the doctor for everything they do or that comes out of their mouth? So they are doing this while I am helping the patient I'm pretty much put in a position where unless I want to look stupid or rude I have to call the nurse, they surprisingly answer and get the same answer I told the person initially - bring it up when you come back. If someone says something that needs a clinical answer I ALWAYS tell them to say something when they get back there. JFC.

&amp;#x200B;

I was going to say something to the supervisor of that clinic but they are aware of how the person acts - way too perky and too eager to help to where they butt in. It's a lot like Spongebob and a couple other characters I can't think of right now and he's never done anything and you know what why would he? Turns out they supposedly do a lot of his work if what I was told is true, do too much work in general and are too eager to jump in anything and everything that arises. It's ok to say no. It's ok to stay in your lane. If you want to be a supervisor or trainer...then do it. We have a supervisor position open! But that will require you to leave this clinic.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - act your wage. If you aren't a supervisor or a trainer please don't act like one.",False,l7ff25,actyourwagethrowaway,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/l7ff25/please_act_your_wage/,0,1

320,Completely checked out. Wfh is amazing,"So these days my coworkers only get in touch to apply pressure or to complain or blame. Why would I bother with these people if every interaction is negative? Only one other lady and I admit when we make human errors but everyone else lies as much as possible. I'm a naive idiot and I grew up valuing honesty and integrity. Turns out in the working world those things don't matter at all. It's jarring.

I would have quit if not for WFH.  

The only thing keeping me mildly sane is WFH. I literally sit and revel in the glory of every talk I don't have to have, any inane smalltalk or fake friendliness to try to make me prioritise the requesters task. So happy I don't have to see these people's faces as they lie through their teeth. Really ecstatic to be away from gloomy air con rooms. No longer wasting 2 and a half hour on commute. Sadly can't avoid the meetings.

But I'm so tired now from applying, getting rejections and not passing the interviews. The interviews are few and far between. I seriously don't know how long I can do this. The way recruiters make you jump through so many hoops is really getting to me too. Why do I need to go through 3 stages for a junior role.

I hate this guilty feeling I have of being unemployed, I feel like I'm a worthless sack of shit who's an embarrassment to their family. My mental health is taking a turn for the worse, it was already in a bad state.

Just to recap I’ve been at my job 3 years and I’m miserable (obviously). My boss yells at me all the time even though I’m the only worker and I’ve been feeling increasingly overwhelmed as the weeks pass.

ANYWAY. Things came to a head yesterday when my boss yelled at me (yet again) that he didn’t know what I do all week. He periodically does this even though I’m busting my ass, have literally no free time, and have panic attacks because I have so much work to complete and not enough time.

I finally snapped and actually yelled back. We got into a screaming match with him basically telling me I do nothing. I spent the entirety of last night sobbing from the stress. Especially because I pride myself on being a hard worker. I KNOW I’m a hard worker. 

So I’m quitting today. I’m going in early to drop off my work from home computer and peacing out before anyone gets there. 

I’m not doing this to myself anymore. I deserve better.

337,tw my coworker has turned my favorite job in to something that’s slowly killing me,"

im so tired. my coworker has been trying me so fucking much, yelling at me in front of guests for things I didn’t do, the passive aggressiveness, constantly switching from being a dick and taking frustration out on me, to being buddy buddy again. He constantly has me on my toes and for the past two weeks I’ve also abt 10 hours, not really eating, lost approx. 10lbs. I’m miserable. Since Friday I’ve only sleep I’ve gotten was a 3hr nap, and I had texted him, thinking he was on friendly mode asking if there’s anyone he could think of that isn’t working today to cover my shift, not calling out, just checking beforehand if there was anyone who could cover me. He snapped at me, threatened my job, accusing me for the 4/5th time that I’m faking my well documented illnesses that are being exacerbated  BY HIM AND HOS ACTIONS. idk how to work imgur so here is some copy and pastes of his messages (w my input). 

“If this gonna be a pattern I will request a replacement for the shift “
“I’m just not gonna deal with this effecting my shift I know u not really sick or anything . Just keeping it real “ like ok pal I don’t want to go to hr, I just want to work in peace and keep it pushin, but if this shit doesn’t let up let’s see what hr, my doctors, and the ada say abt u keeping it real
“If your not suitable to work then I’ll let John know to find a permanent replacement . Hope u get better. Isn’t fun being short staffed (he threatens me a few more times and mind you he isn’t my boss, we have rhe same position) I’m not threatening u. I will suggest to John . Dealing with calls outs n leaving early every week isn’t ideal. U agree to work at those times but u can’t make it so hopefully there someone able n willing to work those times if u unable to. That’s all I’m saying... it’s u not coming to work I didn’t do anything “ I have called out only 4 times in the past 6 months, and everytime I’ve made sure I’ve looked for a replacement and let them know first thing in the morning. The leaving early is bullshit, for the longest time hes played it as if it’s okay as long as I have my duties done so I can catch the bus and not have to wait 20mins to an hr by myself, only times I have left more than 30 minutes early has been when I started throwing up on the job and when he yelled at me for looking at his phone while I was reading a recipe that was on the counter next to his phone and he made me cry. 

When i came to work today so I could talk to our boss (who’s on my side it seems), as soon as our lead leaves, he starts trying me “oh so you aren’t that sick after all” and just kept trying and trying when I just tried to stay away and not talk to him. I finally snapped and told him about how he’s been treating me isn’t ok, etc etc- he literally gave me the hand. Like a fucking 15 year old. I still didn’t leave. Eventually he pushed my buttons enough, I called our manager and he let me leave. 
 
I am so fucking exhausted. In my 6 years of being diagnosed w mental health issues I have never felt this drained. I truly know what it feels to just want it all to stop. I don’t want to wake up in the morning (if I can even sleep), i want to die so bad, but more than that I just want to feel okay.",False,l55fni,StrawBaByW,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/l55fni/tw_my_coworker_has_turned_my_favorite_job_in_to/,0,1

341,Got my vacation request denied.,"My workplace has a policy: If you schedule a vacation day either the day before or after a weekend, you aren't subject to Mandatory Overtime that gets scheduled on that weekend. So, on Wednesday I saw the writing on the walls for overtime and opted to schedule a day preemptively to avoid it. My boss tells me he's leaning towards denying it, but he'd get back to me on his decision. Fast forward to today, he comes to a conclusion. He denied it on the grounds that they need all hands this weekend. I don't give a **fuck** what you need, hire more people then. Oh, turnover rate's high? Maybe because you keep assigning us obscene amounts of overtime making a lot of people pick between family and work. Naturally, I'm raising Hell, I'm sick of it. If I get fired? So be it, I have more than enough saved to live a few years without them. The conversation was as follows:

Supervisor, 4:39 PM
I must decline the request for this weekend, we are all hands on.  All trainers scheduled as well.

Me, 4:41 PM
With that being the reasoning behind declining my request, is this setting a precedent  that if vacation time is scheduled, it will be denied anytime everyone is scheduled? I just want clarification on what to expect here.

Supervisor, 4:42 PM
The decline essentially comes from higher than me due to the current time taken

Me, 4:43 PM
Despite the fact that the time taken was the bonus time I'd earned and not at all yet cut into the standard 11 days? I don't mean to be overly contentious, it just seems like the decision was made in poor judgment to myself. With all due respect.

Supervisor, 4:45 PM
I dont know of an easy way to answer.  The decision came after discussion with sevral others.  There are times we double down and throw down together as a team.  It comes down to judgment, this request is determined to be one that is declined.  I feel for your disinterest for OT.  This weekend is one we need you.

Me, 58 min
Though I feel that my vacation time should be just that, my time to use in whatever manner I please, I do however acknowledge the decisions made, as much as I believe they're poorly made. There's a high turnover rate now and decisions like that are not in any way conducive to turning that around. If, when these discussions come up, you could mention that I have ideas that could both help with turnover and help with [company name], I would appreciate that. A complaint without suggestions to improve is whining, however I do have suggestions to improve the situation if they have the ears to listen. On that note, I find it odd that the decision to approve VT doesn't lay solely with you, my direct supervisor, but I do digress.

On that note, what hours will our department be working Saturday? I'm guessing regular hours as that's what all the other departments seem to be getting. And similarly, which department will I be expected to report to?

I would love these suggestions. I have had some of my own of late and look forward to any thoughts if ever the chance to discuss comes about. Thank you for your thoughts in regards to potential improvements. I know there is a lot that happens over my head, and a lot that happens on the floor too. I find myself oddly stuck in the middle. At times right on, at times out of touch.
Saturday is a day for picking. All trainers and you as cubiscan scheduled to assist in picking. I’ll see who needs the help and discuss with [general manager name]

Me, 32 min
Just feels like it sets an extremely bad precedent in my eyes, that time scheduled could just be canceled at the leisure of upper-management if they just want us in here, rendering vacation time kinda moot if, you know, you can't even use it. It makes me lose any shred of faith that managerial staff is working in good faith with us and shows a distinct disconnect between them and us, especially respect for our lives outside of the building. Like I get denying if, like, I'm trying take weeks off in a row in January, that's excessive, but attempting to utilize it within reason is just...an extreme faux pas and further increases employee resentment towards them and the decisions they make.

Though I will say, despite things turning out as they have, I do at least appreciate you for letting me speak my mind without repercussion. Anyone else would just shrug me off and probably attempt to write me up for insubordination. So kudos to you on that front.

And understood, though I sincerely hope I wind up going to SKF as I know it well. A question goes unanswered though, regular hours, correct?

Me, 29 min
(And I know you would love my suggestions, you have an ear out for me. But honestly, I want the chance to give these suggestions and feedback to upper-management myself.

354,I feel like I want to say this under almost every post I see,"The unfortunate reality is that we all need income to survive and unfortunately I can't give you a solution for that problem. However there are some things that you can do right now.

The first thing you need to look into are worker co-ops. Basically the workers own the business and get to vote on important matters, and the best part is that all those extra profits go right in to your pocket instead of some asshole CEO. This way get more influence and agency in the workplace and overall better working conditions. You also get better pay for the same work or you can keep your salary the same as in a capitalist business but work less hours. If a cooperative is doing very well in terms of revenue there are several options which might be bizarre in a capitalist enterprise. Option 1 is to raise wages, this is always a winner and you can't really go wrong here. Option 2 would be to keep wages as they are, but reduce working hours and hire more people. Option 3 would be to keep wages the same but lower prices of products and services. In either case you are more competitive and a better place to buy from and be employed at. If you hate landlords look into housing cooperatives. The way you feel about work and jobs is shared by many and they will be willing to start a cooperative with you.

The other thins that is super important is mutual aid. That is when you work for no pay, but you take care of your local community and they take care of you. A strong community makes sure everyone has what they need. It serves as a safety net so the members of the community can focus on doing more fulfilling things and not worry about basic stuff like food or shelter. So, if you are unemployed and get bored at home (or if you aren't and just want to help), think about lending a hand to some volunteer groups or homeless shelters. If a mutual aid network doesn't exist where you live try starting one. Of course, COVID is still a thing so be safe and if you or your family members are high risk just stay home,  none of the work you do is worth it if someone dies in the process.",False,l5edyn,Shadowbound199,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/l5edyn/i_feel_like_i_want_to_say_this_under_almost_every/,1,0

362,The Way Out Of This Mess: Prologue,"The Way Out Of This Mess is an anti-work, post-capitalist manifesto, outlining in detail an automated society which provides for all. It is based on marxism, anarchism, and inspired by Jacque fresco, Bjarke Ingels, Paolo Soleri, and many more. But it is written to attract moderate Americans. Would love to have somebody else read it and give me feedback.

Medium: [https://medium.com/the-way-out-of-this-mess](https://medium.com/the-way-out-of-this-mess)

Prologue:

People….. we’re fucked. I mean like reeeaaaally fucked. I’m writing this at the tail end of 2020, we are in the midst of a global pandemic. Due to which many people have restricted their lives, leading to a 7% drop in carbon emissions ⁽¹⁾. In spite of all this, 2020 is shaping up to be, if not the top, at least in the top 3 warmest years on record⁽²⁾. Climate change isn’t coming, it’s here.

It’s not just the climate though. Income inequality is the highest it’s been in 50 years⁽³⁾. Political Polarization is at levels not seen since the last civil war. Which is keeping us from foreseeing the upcoming Thucydides Trap, and employment crisis due to automation. Human civilization is rushing headlong into a cyberpunk dystopia.

If we don’t do something and fast then we can kiss this “Long Peace” goodbye. Now I’m not the only one to think this, even mainstream news outlets have caught on that the jig is coming to an end. Plenty of people are looking to solve our current problems through ideological means. The revitalized American left seems mainly to think that through electoralism they can shift American policy enough to avoid the impending climate catastrophe. To put that in perspective the IPCC says that to mitigate the worst effect of climate change on human society, we should limit warming to 1.5℃ above preindustrial levels⁽⁴⁾. That is not to avoid climate change that’s just to mitigate the worst effects. 2016 was 1.1℃ above preindustrial levels⁽⁵⁾. The WMO says that we will hit 1.5℃ above preindustrial levels by 2024⁽⁶⁾. To be honest given the current geopolitical situation we can kiss our nice stable climate goodbye. That doesn’t mean that there’s no hope, it just means we have to switch the current paradigm of thinking around climate change.

The current idea is that we will get all the nations on earth, to drastically reduce their CO₂ emissions and keep them down. Not only does this require levels of global cooperation never before seen, but it also disproportionately benefits rich countries who have the money to transition to cleaner fuels; that’s just for the climate issue. Instead of relying on a moonshot that the world is consistently making more and more infeasible, I propose a different approach. Instead of waiting for governments to change, I propose we change. Instead of hoping that the climate doesn’t change, I propose we change so that it doesn’t matter. If we’re are not only going to survive but thrive in the next 50 years, then we need to, with intention, plan out a route from our current catastrophe through sustainability the lands us in a promising future.

We can create a better society, we have to create a better society. One that can stand up to the problems of climate change, and wealth inequality, and finally secure a basic livelihood for all. To do this we need to realize that there are two major fronts that demand attention and intention. That being the technical issues of how to build a climate change-resistant, sustainable society; and the epistemological how to organize that society sustainable, equitably, and such that it doesn’t collapse. Now this book is strictly meant to deal with the technological side of this issue. Though if you subscribe to certain sociological theories then the technological mode of production implies a certain sociological structure.

This book is more of an introduction to the types of solutions we could apply to the problem of work and non-sustainable production. I have limited my scope to make the task manageable however, this means that not everyone can partake in the society that I am laying out. I don’t take this to mean that there is not a sustainable solution for all, it just means that I cannot as an individual find it. I propose that the approach I take in this book can be applied by others to their own circumstances to produce similar results.

363,I'm quitting my shitty job today,"I work at a pharmacy as an assistant, we are frequently short staffed. On the Saturday morning shift that I work, I frequently work 6 hours without a break because they only schedule an assistant and a pharmacist from 8am-2pm..

379,Feeling Guilty for Going on FMLA for Mental Health Reasons.,"I have worker a state job related to protecting others for 11 years. I’ve seen all kinds of unhappy events, spoken to all kinds of unhappy people, and have tip toed the line of insanity the whole time. I have been abused by management and direct supervisors. They love to make us feel bad through saying we are doing this to protect people and if you are not in it to devote yourself fully to the cause, then leave. Their policy has been vague and interpreted differently based upon who is enforcing it. There are kingdoms within the agency that has little oversight. 

I was not drinker before starting this job 11 years ago. I   have to take CBD oil (in a illegal state) and zzzquil every night to sleep. I have 1200 hours of sick leave. This is due to feeling guilty if you take it. I had a break down this past week and have developed anger management issues due to the shit I take from unjust decisions on my performance. I am also on a medication to control high blood pressure and heart palpitations when highly stressed from work. After years of campaigning by my wife I decided to go out on FMLA, see a psychiatrist for leave, and see a therapist to help cope with work while I plan an end game.  It the weirdest thing happened, I feel guilty and like a failure for doing this. What is wrong with me? I can’t even go a day without checking for emails  expecting me to get fired. I just want to leave. I literally broke down and got caught in loop of saying “I can’t” last week when doing my job from home. We are planning an end game for me.

Might remember me from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/f18bsc/own_time_own_dime_dont_like_it_theres_the_door/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), and I thought I'd post a little update, given the turbulent times America has seen since the dawn of COVID.

We have been deemed essential since the start of the pandemic back in March. Company argued its stake as an essential service because it's in the telecom market, but we do not maintain current infrastructure, we are manufacturing new stuff. In my mind, that's a very roundabout way to try to make sure your business stays up despite common sense...?

This has lead to some pretty shocking tactics to push production despite a major staff shortages and multiple waves of the virus spreading through the plant... Mandatory overtime, 14hr shifts, emergency coverage... people burning out, skipping out on shifts bailing on OT, nobody cares about anybody anywhere, and things are super rough because of it...

Why the hell do the workers *always* take the hit? We are always told we are the most important people there, until the time comes to actually show it... I can only imagine my boss sitting safely at home with a Mai Tai and his dogs, laughing at his day-trade crap and maniacally twiddling his mustache while I'm dredging in this mess.

Someone calls out or doesn't show up? Someone else gets whacked with that shift. Production demands change? Hope you had no plans, doctor's appointments, or personal appointments because those now don't matter...

I guess this is just another frustrated rant, all things considered. I'm riding the rails every day with my mental health, and it just feels good to get things out... but I hope things change in the US soon... I gotta get out of this damn job...

Stay safe out there, everyone... no matter where you are. Its a crazy world out there... crazier every minute.",False,l3hg4j,mike_likes_bebop,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/l3hg4j/an_update_stay_safe_out_there_folks/,5,1

400,Dont ever try to stand up to your superiors,"I work as a reserve firefighter at this podunk department is the square middle of nowhere. For 3 years I have let this department get away with some pretty fucked up shit that theyve said and done to me. Everything from antisemitic remarks, being taken away seasonal shift do to a minor mistake that “embarrassed the fire chief”, to even being actually assaulted by another reserve. For 3 years i sate and took it like a champ. Last night i show up for training and i get told that apparently there was a complaint about me from the Police. For 15 minutes i get fucked with on a matter that i m kept in the dark about. Everyone else present at the time basically gets a front row seat to me getting shit on. Eventually figured out what they are talking about and recounted the way the incident went with the pd officer. The reality was that there was no complaint, one of the officers got nervous because after a call we once had I kindly asked him to not bring up my personal life during calls. I thought i was doing the right thing i stood up for myself in a calm collected manner and explained myself to him. But basically he now thinks that i m a “sensitive snowflake whos is to easily offended.” So he goes and he tells his police chief that there could be a complaint from the fire house because of me to cover his ass. A month later the guys at the fire house go to the police for something and the pd chief tells my battalion chief about what i said. So the guys at the fire house see it as an opportunity to fuck with me. I show for training last night and so the shit show starts. I m told i was “rude to one of the sergeant.” And i get no real explanation just kept getting fucked with. A matter that I thought was serious was taken as a joke and was used to berate me in front of everyone. Eventually i piece it all together and said my side of the story. The battalion chief says “oh he is right” to which i then responded “fuck all of you guys.” Basically that then he gets upset with me. After training he goes to the office with me and continues to berate me, even though I didn’t do anything wrong. He says “from now that officer will never talk to you or mess with you because he thinks you’re to sensitive. That means that you are also to sensitive for us to mess with so from here on its all business.” Then he gets to the part where i said “fuck all of you guys.” And he takes out of context and say “you ever tell me to go fuck myself in front of everyone and you will be  terminated immediately. You think that shit would fly in another department?”  So basically the moral of the story is don’t stand up for yourself, never try to explain your situation, and obviously never ever snap at anyone.",False,l31hav,star-memer,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/l31hav/dont_ever_try_to_stand_up_to_your_superiors/,8,1

406,"So, how is it even possible to drop out of this society besides becoming homeless or commiting suicide?","It´s horrible to think about. As soon as we are able to think as children, we get thrown into some kind of school, and from then on we continuously get forced to participate in other activities that are meant to shape us even more to fit into this society. Preschool, Kindergarten, Elementary School, Middle School, High School, College and from then on we are forced to pick a path in life that we think we can endure for the next 50 years or so until we can retire. What happens to people who just don´t fit in? Do they need to become homeless or commit suicide? Of course you can say ""Try to become a freelancer and be independent"". But even that is dependent on huge amounts of luck and mental and physical exhaustion, tons of worries if you don´t make it. I will be honest, I don´t see myself working for my whole life, I will either become a criminal or I will straight up look for any way out I can use. I mean, there are of course some jobs I think are more tolerable than others, but do I really want to spend nearly my whole life killing time to finally be back home again? Not really.

413,“Save all that for retirement”,"When I mention that I want all of my time to myself, I want to travel, spend my days doing my hobbies.

“That’s retirement. You can get that after you’ve put in your time.” 

So after 40-50 years of working I can enjoy the last few years of my life? When I’m potentially riddled with arthritis and other health issues, and potentially physically unable to do some of those things? (Note: I’m not trying to say being older is automatically miserable, or that older people can’t be healthy. Just saying that generally you’re more able-bodied when you’re young.) 

What if a few decades down the line circumstances change and I’m never able to retire at all? What if I’m employed till the day I die? When will I have that opportunity to be free? 

My life doesn’t begin when I turn 65. It’s NOW. Who knows if I’ll live to 65. For all I know, I could die in a car accident next year. Die of cancer when I’m 30. Die of suicide at 50. Die of a heart attack at 60. 

What happens then? What kind of life did I live up till now? Did I live life to the fullest, or did I spend most of my time fretting about the next week of work, or my upcoming performance review, or dealing with that rude client that never goes away? 

I say well, I don’t want to wait till retirement, I want to be happy now. “Then just go back to school or find a new job,” as if almost every job isn’t basically the same. Or how about, “Just find a hobby,” as if I don’t already have any. Or the worst one: “You just have to suck it up. That’s life. That’s the way it is.” Well I didn’t ask to be born and do all of this, and now I have to ‘just deal with it’ even though our work system is completely arbitrarily made up by someone and can be changed if we really wanted it to.",False,l4d17m,apndi,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/l4d17m/save_all_that_for_retirement/,1,1

The amount of fucking work there was to do every day non stop it wasn't worth £9.23. Im fairly fortunate that I've moved back home atm and my mum is fairly understanding. Feels like they where under staffed but not willing to recruit the correct number of people.

Everyone there looked miserable, dont think I've ever seen such a morale sapped work force.

Even for double the pay I wouldn't subject myself to that.

I'm no stranger to kicthen work, my last job for 2 years was in one but this was something else. Couldn't even have a chat while you did stuff as the next person was like 20 meters away.

428,am i crazy for having bad work anxiety?,"over the past few years i’ve had a few jobs (3) that i’ve quit because it came to a point where i was experiencing extreme anxiety abt having to go in. it’s always been bc of coworkers. the first job, my managers and coworkers were all rlly into drama and apparently didn’t like me, so they would all talk behind my back and exclude me in everything, and everytime i went in, i always got told i had to stay late or come in early the next day. it got to the point where i just didn’t want to go in anymore bc it was so exhausting. the second job was also similar, i was of a different race as everyone else there, so i was talked abt and excluded all the time, and it seemed like where my coworkers could do no wrong (ie they never got punished for calling out or showing up late) i would get a stern talking to if i was even a few minutes late and i had contacted the manager to let them know! now, the job i’m in now is very problematic, it’s a gas station/ truck stop so what did i expect right? but i’m a woman and nasty men come in all the time harassing me, i’ve even had some follow me to my car and shout at me or try to ambush me behind the building once (thankfully a manager came out with me), and the managers just don’t care, and won’t protect me from them at all by telling them to leave or anything. there was also an incident of a guy coming in with obvious head trauma and was bleeding everywhere and i couldn’t get the manager to call 911 even after the guy passed out in the subway attached to our gas station. on top of that they messed up my paychecks so i only just got my first one 4 weeks in, and they keep asking me to come in for more shifts and when i say no they change my schedule to make me work more! the GM recently got mad at me bc i switched shifts with a girl even though i told the GM i was before hand, and ended up not only yelling at the coworker i changed shifts with but changing both of our shifts so we have to work overtime. i just don’t know what to do and i have such bad anxiety to go in tmrw, but i feel like if i quit another job i just won’t get another one, since i haven’t been able to find one in months bc of covid here (hence why i’m even working this job in the first place). what do i do? do i quit this job and just hope i get another or just buckle down and try to get through it until an opportunity arises?",False,l4i232,kattatouille,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/l4i232/am_i_crazy_for_having_bad_work_anxiety/,0,1

438,A letter to myself - Why must you try so hard?,"I was trying to study my homework for my college class, but I kept thinking about the naive and young new college grad I'm training at my job. I kept thinking of all the things I'd tell not just her, but a younger less experienced me.

For context, the industry I currently work in is highly conservative, and the workers of this industry view themselves as extensions of law enforcement (eww). I have also worked the normal shitty food/retail jobs and generally approach tasks with a perfectionist and caring attitude in spite of knowing it leaves me vulnerable to increased exploitation. I just can't help it.

# Approach to Handling Corrections from Management:

It is middle management's job to find problems and fix them. If there aren't any problems to fix, then upper management might think middle management is not needed.

Thus, if everything is going smoothly middle management changes either the pace of work (faster) or the amount of work (higher) and see if you can handle the new requirements under pressure. These new job requirements do not require an increase in pay, as they fall under the catch-all clause of ""other duties as assigned"", a clause that is in virtually all job descriptions and contracts. Another technique is to point out the 1% of things you got wrong. The more detailed your work tasks are, the greater the opportunity for error and correction.

So, it follows that while it is admirable and of strong character to try to do the best job you can (at least in my view, in a perfect world people would endeavor to take care of each other and their environments in a thoughtful and thorough manner), you can never do things perfectly, not just due to minor human errors, but for the fact that management *needs* to find flaws in order to maintain their station, status, and the larger social hierarchy, by putting you in your place. Workers put in the most effort when they feel easily replaceable, disposable. Workers who are not as assured and confident of a stable place within the company will be more obedient, less challenging to the established norms and conventions. 

This is especially true in industries and particular companies that by their nature (the importance of risk management, business expense reduction, and the maximization of profit) and their organizational structure (banks for example make money on large loans, not deposit accounts - checking/savings/CDs, especially not personal deposit accounts for which the bank must pay interest, this drives sales-focused service) tend toward a conservative culture.

The ladder to the top of the corporate pyramid is built of coworkers' heads.

I’m absolutely miserable and feel a 50/50 combination of anger and sadness about my reality with work. It’s so amazing to be a part of a community that gets it and sees the world for what it really is..because most of what we talk about on here is stuff I can’t talk about with family or friends or even co workers. They brush it off and tell me to keep on trucking. This sub though in combination with me being “so woke” is messing with my mental health.

472,"It's not enough that we have to attend all manner of mindless meetings via Zoom, we also have to have our cameras on","Being ‘In-Camera’ on Room

=

Dear All,

know we all have different approaches to using Room and different views on its good and bad aspects! But one thing
’'m increasingly struck by is the number of black boxes or photographs | see when | dial into meetings. That's a shame
—face to face contact is so much more fruitful than voice to voice, and the absence of a face is somehow even more
impactful (at least to me) when the medium being used is video.

‘With that in mind, ’d like to ask that, at least for meetings which | chair, people choose to have their camera on. I'm
not going to insist on that. | know that for some people practical issues such as bandwidth mean that it’s just not
possible. And in the current circumstances with families at home things will happen from time to time you don’t really
want others to see. But where it’s possible, I'd be grateful if people would participate usually as well as morally. 'm sure
you all know that you can have a virtual background if you're more comfortable with that.

‘And ~a slightly clung non-sequitur given that I don’t have any specific concerns about people's ‘etiquette’ on calls —
Ll use this as a pretext for resenting the helpful guidance put together by Talma and her colleagues as part of the
ACE 2.0 initiative.

‘Any questions, just ask — laterally or in a team meeting.

473,Capitalism requires a reserve army of the unemployed," 

 

Marx on The Reserve Army of Labor / Unemployed

For wages to stay at the subsistence level, Karl Marx held
that workers must be in a weak bargaining position in relation
to their employers. A worker’s source of bargaining power is
his or her ability to leave the employer and to go get a new job
with someone else. To Marx, under capitalism, the weak
bargaining position of the workers would be maintained by a
large supply of unemployed workers. Workers would have to
“obey” their employers because they would know that there
were many other workers willing to take their jobs. And they
could not quit their jobs because their chances of getting other
jobs would be low. His supply of unemployed workers was
called “the reserve army of the unemployed”.

Pi Network: This project has been around for a few years now and is looking to hit the market late this year or early next year. The mining rates aren't as high as they used to be but it's still worth getting in before they have again: Pi Network and use my username (joegrower420) as your invitation code. 🥧🥧
Bee Network: This one is kind of a clone of Pi but it started up recently in early December and has caught a lot of traction, hitting one million users in the first month. Definitely worth getting in on while the mining rates are high: Here is my referral link for BEE Network. Get 1 free BEE when you join BEE: joegrower420. Download at Download the Application | Bee Network 🐝🐝
TimeStope: This last one is newish as well starting last October and still isn't on IOS so it's rates are high and you get 9.4 additional coins per day per user you refer right now, with the coins being valued a little over a cent each.

Even married couples seem to put more emphasis on their jobs than on their relationship. Even more scary is how there would probably be no relationship without the jobs. As though a relationship were some hidden perk of working.

Like my neighbors. The husband/dad lives 1000 miles away so he can work. Every five weeks he ""visits"" the family for a week and then back he goes. And nobody seems to see a problem with this. In fact they see it as quite heroic! But this man is not married to his wife, he's married to his company since that is where his heart is the majority of the time.

I've also seem the rise of the single person living in a bland, cookie cutter apartment, living with a cat or a dog, going to some soulless job that they are married to. Many in their 30s and 40s. The job is their spouse, their co-workers their extended family. None of these people profess to be happy. Many are lonely, depressed, and neurotic.

People in the past worked hard but their relationships were more important to them, now work comes first. And they submit to work the way a fearful person submits to an abusive spouse.

518,My anti-work “solution”,"For years I perused this sub at my office job, obsessing about quitting and all the ideas we talk about here.  Like many, I started to think that I’d rather die than live the miserable work loop.  The entertainment industry is so exploitive that I was being watched like a hawk by managers, having timed bathroom breaks (If you were in the bathroom more than 5 mins you’d get reprimanded) and other constant belittlement by the company.  I was beyond burned out.  In summer 2019, I finally cracked and chose to quit my job without any prospects of getting a different one.  It was incredibly reckless from a normal person’s perspective, but to me it was simply the tipping point.  With only a couple thousand saved up, I realized I had to relocate out of the insanely expensive Los Angeles, where I had been living in the past decade.  I moved 2000 miles to a state with a much lower cost of living.  I have a creative profession, where essentially I am paid to create artistic products.  Shortly after moving to my new city, I picked up a remote job at a company and I have been taking full advantage wherever I can.  Basically, the company has no idea that what I produce for them in a work week actually only takes me something like 10 hours of committed work.  But they absolutely adore my work and couldn’t be happier with me at the company.  They think I’m a superstar.  They believe I’m working my ass off but since the job is remote there’s no way for them to know what I’m really doing all day.  I’m just astounded at this enormous change in my life, from absolute misery to being loved for my talents.  This, I think, is further proof of how bullshit office culture is - it’s the product that matters, not the means to get there.  If I can produce something that a company finds extremely valuable in just a few hours, then shouldn’t that be all that matters?  If they want to believe it took me 40 hours then fine, but this proves to me that what I do has always been very valuable.

520,It's all a fucking farce,"After stewing about this for days, I feel this is the place to vent my anger and frustration. 

I am the most experienced worker in my department. We had two other people with similar experience apply for a management role. I also have an advanced degree the others lack. 

Anyway, whole department thinks I've got it in the bag. ""overqualified"" raving reviews awards on my work etc. The other day we get a special emergency meeting to announce the role and who got it? Not me or my two experienced and established colleagues, but somebody who has been on the team 6 months, no further education, and their last job was completely unrelated. 

So they break the news to me and I finally lose my shit. I demand answers. Where did I fuck up? I ask professionally where I need to improve, and how did this other candidate edge me out? The response from hiring manager? ""Theres no negative feedback you'd be great in the role"" 

""okay so you just [Brad] more?""

""no theres no favortism here""

""okay so what did [Brad] demonstrate better than me for this role?""

""nothing""

Like I cant even make this shit up. What actually is this? I said here's my notice and fucking left. THEY CALLED LATER AND BEGGED ME TO STAY. 

Some will say I was unprofessional, others will make fun of me for being upset, and others may even mock me but God damn if I didn't walk out with a raging erection from the power and the pride from having finally stood up for myself.

However, I'd feel entirely responsible for causing a lifetime of misery when any child I bear would be destined to the same, lifeless 9-5 system that I'm in.

I couldn't live with myself witnessing a child that I CHOSE to bring into this world being forced down the exact same rabbit hole that I'm in. The constant wrestle between life and the hustle. I can only foresee a kid of mine having to go to work through the exact same cobbled path that I, and every other working class Briton, has trundled down.

I'd only ever consider having a kid if I could offer some form of alternative to be able to give them the option. eg. *""Listen son, you can help raise the cattle or you can go the Excel mine. Up to you"".* Unfortunately, I haven't inherited a farm yet so there is no other better alternative that I can provide hence why I'm ending the family line.

I'm so exhausted of working, and giving my all, and going out of my way to help clients, coworkers, strangers alike, and getting absolutely NOTHING back.

I don't want moral dessert, I don't want a reward for being good, I just want to not be kicked all the time, and expected to come crawling back, doing my all and running myself ragged only to still be begging for scraps. I just don't want to wake up thinking ""please not again"" anymore.

My boss is completely out of touch, not malicious but ignorant as hell- I could spend the whole day listing things, but... the latest annoyances are that last week he called a chain-wide meeting after-hours and kept us away from our families past 6 pm -no overtime ofc- just because ""he hasn't talked to us in so long"" even though the last meeting was literally two weeks ago, and this is petty, but he pronounces ""influenza"" as ""in-fool-en-zah"" which is annoying as heck, but dare I say, descriptive.

His underling is an asshole whose tone is completely inexcusable, he literally talks to us like one would to unruly children.

My coworkers in HQ are careless. Just yesterday, the documents I submitted to be signed and passed on to the lawyers like always were, for some reason, SENT BACK TO ME UNSIGNED????

90% of my clients (who are all small business owners, figures) are incredibly selfish and demanding, and expect me to solve their entire lives for them as if I was their secretary, BUT ALSO expect me to roll over, be grateful, accept non-payment on their word alone, and lick their shit-stained galoshes because they deign to require the service I'm paid to provide.

* Looked down on me for being in University all ""what will you do with a Master's?"". Hopefully not being in your shoes in 20 years time. 
* Flexed about how she comes in half an hour early to catch up on what is happening. Again, you can catch me up on paid time. My unpaid time is MY time.
* I wasn't sitting down or anything and she asked what I would think if I walked past the store (without going in) and saw a sales assistant sitting down or not doing anything, fishing for me to say ""I'd think they look super unprofessional"" and was clearly thrown off guard when I said ""I wouldn't think anything to be honest, I don't concern myself that much with what other people do"". Sorry not sorry I refuse to buy into the bullshit that expects retail workers to stand for 8 hours on hard concrete floors without needing a break.
* Expected me to know a ton of shit because ""you did that in training"". Um. I was given 6 hours to cram a bunch of learning units into my brain, I wouldn't exactly call it training conducive to learning but ok. 
* Got mad at ME because a customer didn't want my help, as if I had control over that.

565,"I feel like the lottery is my only chance at life now, but the odds are discouraging me. I don’t care about “long-term” investments that might make me comfortable when I’m OLD. I’m 25, not sure I’ll even be around next year.","I am a 25 year old male virgin. I’ve never even had a girlfriend. This is NOW worsened (odds of it happening anytime in the near future) by the fact that I’ve struggled with “basic” retail jobs, and now been working in a grocery store as a goddamn bagger for the past 2 years. 

Barely $10 an hour, abused by customers, threatened and humiliated by supervisors/management. I’ve been accused of slacking, even after honestly being really productive all day. I’d quit and walk out if I didn’t feel suicide is my next option.

They’re talking about firing people for “not being friendly enough to customers”, and for the past week I’ve started going by their script, making sure to “properly greet customers” the word by word way, immediately after the cashier right in front of me just did. 

I get scolded by one of the supervisors for not shouting HELLO as soon as the customer walks up to the lane to checkout, even though a store manager ACTUALLY TOLD ME, to wait until the customer has gotten up closer to me so they can actually HEAR ME THROUGH THE MASKS (COMMON SENSE). 

But it doesn’t matter, I can be on a perfect streak, and then that supervisor points their goddamn finger at me and whispers “make sure you’re speaking to our customers”. I just want to smash something, or someone, and walk out and never go back.

But then, it won’t be long before my parents are ON MY ASS AGAIN, for being unemployed, and it will likely get to a point of me ending up in me getting arrested. I can’t deal with society, I can’t deal with the system. I can’t even socialize very well. It’s DEFINITELY HELL being REQUIRED to socialize as part of a job.

I failed my fucking driving test, I still feel overwhelmed at getting back on the road, I just started community college but haven’t been in a year after my first semester because I tried to let COVID pass (COVID doesn’t just pass, apparently) and I’m not even super sure what I’m doing there.

I’m an antinatalist, thanks to my miserable childhood and family’s “traditional” and FUCKING RELIGIOUS AND CONSERVATIVE VIEWS making me hate life (and definitely religion) even more.

I’m against bringing a child into their world against their will, and that’s kind of how it works. Even if I have a woman who wants to procreate with me, I can not, it goes against my self-morals now. I wouldn’t be a healthy parental figure anyway, and that’s kind of mg whole point in assigning a negative value to birth. 

But I wouldn’t even be here if my parents didn’t procreate me! I know, I kind of wish they didn’t.

I sure as hell refuse to accept my “assigned” gender role. I identify as male, not never cared for a lot of “traditional” male interests. I am attracted to women, never got any real attention from the opposite sex, but that’s another problem and not what this post is about. 

I don’t really care to be a “productive member of society”, at least not as much as living the way that makes me happy (which REQUIRES “being a productive member of society”, because that’s how you afford to live, many jobs pay less than a living wage, like my current and past ones).

My dad has always been a “hardworking”, but also a REAL CHEAPASS. He thinks he’s been living the way an adult is “supposed” to. But where has it gotten him. Yes, the alcohol is why you got divorced and we live away from you, but if you’re SO good at WORKING HARD AND SAVING MONEY, why do you still live in a house that’s physically falling apart in the middle of nowhere? You talk about wanting to do more, but apparently you have to keep doing what you’re doing because, I guess it’s just the right thing to do? Where has your “responsibility” gotten you in life? Doesn’t seem like it paid off. But hey, at least you can blame the ALCOHOL on your misery now, right?

And my mom, thinks she’s doing the right thing working a full-time service job, making maybe even less than me? But it’s ok because step dad pays for all of the big bills. Never mind his constant rage and threatening of divorce, “God” wanted it to be so the man provides, not sure where that leaves single women, but......

I don’t want to be dependent on anyone else, relying on remaining employed under someone else is bad enough.

I’m losing my parents health insurance in a year, my SSRI and other medications will cost hundreds a month out of pocket. SSRI withdraw is THE WORST (just Google PSSD and dyskinesia).

I need to just “grow the fuck up and pick myself up by the bootstraps”. Although, I just lack a lot of apparently “basic” skills and experience in life. 

And the way I feel, “working for a living” serves no purpose when I don’t even want to be alive.

Oh, but I can pay taxes to help the poor!!!! Nope, the US government doesn’t do that, probably just goes into rich politicians pockets.

I can’t believe that the lottery seems to be my only chance at life now.

But I’ve already missed so much of my life, IDGAF about 401(k) or whatever SLOW LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS TO HAVE A LITTLE SOCIAL SECURITY OR RETIREMENT WHEN I’M OLD!

I don’t even want to live any longer now, and even if I do, I’ve already missed out on my entire youth, IDGAF about my oldass. 

That’s why QUICK TURNAROUND MONEY IS IMPORTANT TO ME. But unfortunately, becoming rich overnight is extremely random luck based......

568,Free land minimum,"Nobody ever brings this up so think about it. Back in the day people could be hunters, gatherers and farmers. They’d put there house somewhere and everything was r/antiwork friendly. Then one day kings and queens said the farmer who only has food for his family had to offer more to them that they didn’t have. God only knows what they did to the family that didn’t pay the forced taxes. And that’s where we lost our right to land. Nobody ever says we need a right to land and if someone does the other people argue “people would just claim huge tracts of land”. But we’re civilized and thankfully I don’t think like a wild animal so I thought of the free land minimum. A minimum square footage for every adult that can be zoned. A minimum because overpopulation is a serious problem even if we are fine now and if you want a lot of land you should pay because we have limited space until space travel is perfected. Homeless people would have somewhere to go, the only work people would have to do is grow their own food and work to build a fee less shelter, and people could pursue dreams like arts, athletics, or learning skills, instead of wasting most their life doing useless tasks they could do something good for human evolution.

I'm sick of all of it. I'm sick of spending and hour and ten minutes of my day five days a week just driving to and from work. I'm sick of spending five days of my week at an office that does not care whether or not I have enough money to buy groceries. I'm absolutely so sick and tired of bosses who think they are God's gift to the workplace because ""I'm a cool boss. I'm not going to micromanage you as long as you do your job and I'll give you a Yeti cup and a book of 20 singles for Christmas"". That is quite literally the bare minimum you should be doing. I'm sick of getting paychecks that are literally three dollars more than my monthly rent while the boss comes into the office no more than ten hours a week and is making 7 figures, meanwhile, I can't get a raise because ""you haven't been here long enough"". 

I put my notice in two weeks ago to go back to my pre-covid commissioned job. They have been begging me to stay because they can't ever find a decent receptionist. The office manager is going to other colleagues (she's too afraid to approach me herself because I intimidate her or something like that) telling them to ask me what it would take for me to stay. The woman who hired me has asked me what it would take for me to stay. More money is what I need to stay and Mr. Millionaire boss says it can't be done. I would like to know what their idea of trying to get me to stay was if more money isn't doable. I just want to be able to pay my bills.

I feel particularly guilty as a of late. I work in a large entertainment corporation with benefits, 401k, an open office plan, and popular artists sometimes would come and play on the roof. I work in NYC with a lot of transplants who love the culture, the fact they now live in NY, and would do anything for their dream job and this company. 

I am the complete opposite. I received a bunch of free swag (sweatshirts, t's hats) one Christmas and rather than go to the Christmas Party I left an hour early and wandered around the city giving all my company gifts to any homeless people I could find. Those rooftop concerts? I would stand with a drink in my hand in the corner or tell people I would meet them before dashing out of the building.  If there were events in the middle of the work day and everyone was going, I would take my lunch in the supply closet. What most people considered a dream career I find to be hell. 

I have a very hard time  marrying ""work"" and ""play"". I hate the open office setup and would prefer my own cubicle closed off from everyone. I just feel unfit and disconnected from the whole scene. If I wanted to drink and listen to music, I would be at home or at my local bar with people I am friendly with and care about. This may be TMI or indicative of other issues (again I go to therapy) but I have yet to find any personal pride of satisfaction from a career stand point and instead hedge a lot of my personal happiness on the welfare of those I care about and accomplishments like my healthy and fitness, eating right, quitting drinking, etc. I struggle to relate to anyone who throws themselves at their work and finds great satisfaction from entering spreadsheets all day as opposed to doing literally anything else.

A few weeks ago I sent some CVs abroad and they answered me. I started to think that conditions abroad are better. 
One of the companies I had an interview proposed to me a job with an indefinite contract Which seemed very tempting to me at first. 

However, just today I sent an email to decline the offer. I started wondering if I was picky, but maybe the truth is, I didn't feel ready to move abroad. Anyway, the worst thing is that I'm going to have to explain everything to my parents. 

I am still convinced that I can find a job here in Italy, but every time offers arrive, something makes me pull back and refuse the offer. 

Do I have a problem with the concept of ""work""? 
Which one of you is in the same situation as me?

607,Received job offer but so much anxiety over whether or not to actually accept it,"I’ve officially learned to dissociate myself from my work/career and as much as I don’t want to work, I have been fucking around for 9 months with no income and I’ve been spiraling into a depression and having serious suicidal ideations. I need to support myself even if I hate it. 

I’ve applied to near 1000 jobs at this point with only a handful of interviews. I received one other offer that I accepted in October and I walked out on the employer because they treated us like garbage and the puny pay and lack of benefits reaffirmed I needed to leave so you can see just hesitant I am to accept this new job offer.

This new job requires me to be there at 4:30am every morning which sounds painful/unnatural that I need to be sleeping by 7pm every night and waking up at 3 am. 

Some other red flags: I interviewed last Thursday, received offer this past Monday. Wants me drug tested by Friday (paranoid I won’t pass bc of THC despite being in a state where it is legalized) and start this coming Monday. Glassdoor has 2 star rating (poor management, negative work culture, expensive insurance, no 401k match). When I received intro call, HR told me multiple positions were opened “because the job didn’t match expectations of these employees” or “they left due to personal matters.” I was also told that I need to be open to working overtime daily (plus is that they would pay double every additional hour). Total red flags. During the interview, I asked my interviewers what the best part of working there was and both of them seemed to struggle to formulate their words. They truly looked like they hated their lives. 

Is it a no-brainer to accept this job considering I have not heard back from anything else and am struggling financially? I’m kind of going in expecting to get hazed and bullied and abused at work.",False,l2269p,sy403,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/l2269p/received_job_offer_but_so_much_anxiety_over/,6,1
608,"""Leisure is essential to civilization, and in former times leisure for the few was only rendered possible by the labors of the many. But their labors were valuable, not because work is good, but because leisure is good.""","From ""In Praise of Idleness"" by Bertrand Russell, which is in the r/antiwork library, great little read. It's true that through a variety of channels, we've been sold the myth of the ""nobility"" of work and overwork, usually by people that don't engage in it themselves. We're so conditioned to work, that we don't understand that leisure itself is the area where monumental progress due to unfettered creativity and freedom have occurred.

But because of exhaustion, leisure in modern day societies is very passive, non-participatory and unfulfilling. Combine that with work being merely for the sake of helping people who don't perform actual labor making a profit, and you have a recipe for a miserable society. If we truly cared about work for its own sake versus work as a means of maintaining control, then leisure would be mandatory, for its in leisure where we come up with the greatest ideas to enhance and ease work itself.",False,l2fbxh,ComradeTrap,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/l2fbxh/leisure_is_essential_to_civilization_and_in/,1,1
609,My hatred of work pushed me into living a minimalist lifestyle.,"There's a few reasons for that.

To start off, minimalism allows me to save a lot more money. Naturally this puts my mind at ease about finances.

The other main reason? If I get so sick of my job that I decide I've had enough, I'm fucking gone, and have enough to get by for a while. I **love** that feeling.

If I lived a lifestyle where I bought a bunch of expensive shit all of the time, then I wouldn't be able to get as much of that feeling as I like. For me, knowing I can quit a job comfortably is far more pleasurable than buying a bunch of stuff.

611,Men and Breakdowns,"I’ve noticed something about the male figures in my life. It seems at some point, they break. It’s like they can’t take the stress or fake it any more. My ex-wife’s dad has an episode where he questioned everything including his religion. My uncle has had episodes, my current girlfriend’s dad seems to be having in a similar manner while under a lot of stress at work. My own dad, though very tough mentally masked his issues well, once told me, without any sort of prompting, “Son, make sure you have a job you like because there are millionaires out there who are miserable.” I’ve tried to take his advice but the jobs I like don’t pay well enough for me to get by. 

I’ve had multiple similar reactions where I have existential crises and not even out of my twenties yet. 
When I worked on ambulances and we’d get called out to car wrecks, I’d think to myself “What an awful way to go: to die on your way to work.”

I know women have these issues too but it just seems more prominent with men. Is the lack of comradery in the work place and the isolation that comes from it? Is it because we realize the consumerist ideal that are pushed on us from birth are absolute bull shit and we’re tired of pretending like they’re not?

These executives are making millions but can't give their employees a few more bucks an hour for a decent living. No one is going to live and breathe for your stupid company for $9/hr sorry not sorry. Just did a quick calculation. To raise employees pay by 5 dollars to $14 an hour to get them to care it would cost the company roughly 41 million For 4k employees. That's nothing.

My uncle ran a nonprofit through this time period. He’s written for Fox News, and major networks. He was a bad student and lied his way into a masters program and a PhD. He even received a scholarship for being a white male Christian. He argued he was a minority and received funding for college. He has traveled the entire world and was paid to do it. He slept with his secretary and lost his job temporarily. Then he said he was sorry and received his job back. He bought houses tax free in France and Italy. Start lying more often. The truth will keep you poor and it will break you. The system in America rewards the narcissist. My uncle has a lot of money and kept his wife after cheating.

I’m currently on a blow up mattress in my moms living room because, despite having a good job in a major city (the dream if you will), I still can barely afford a place to live in my area. Funny how working in a city that pays more is the most expensive place to live in the country tehe!!!

I’m at the end of my rope (literally?)

And when I do have a day off (I work retail so weekends don't exist) I'm so tired I can't do anything anyway, or I have to spend it with family or friends. Spending time with other people is starting to feel like a chore that's keeping me from writing. I know that's super conceited but I guess I'm a conceited person.

I have all these novel ideas in my head but I self-reject all of them because since I can't write them down or really take the time to develop them I find flaws in them and give up. I have a few stories that are developed well enough that they weren't killed in the nest, but working on them is a distant dream. 

I work 30+ hours but consistently under 40 so they don't have to give me benefits. So theoretically I do have the time. In fact I have more time than most people. And it's killing me that I can't use it. I feel like I should be able to. 

I guess part of the problem is I spend so much time on social media but if I don't have the time to work on my novel anyway then I can't really get involved in something that demands uninterrupted hours of my time, which most of my hobbies do.

641,I hope my boss likes the new asshole I tore her,"So, I work at a certain three lettered pharmacy. And as you can imagine, because of covid, the workload has increased massively. We have 7 techs who share responsibilities in the pharmacy.

  
Of the 7 techs, 4 are vets and 3 of us are 'new' (All been there less than 2 years, so not really new-new)  


Once Covid started, we started doing covid tests. For those who don't know, covid testing basically requires a dedicated tech for the entire day (and it's extremely boring) so we're basically down a leg at any given time. And also our pharmacy is located right in the ghetto and accepts medicaid. And it's the ONLY pharmacy in the area that accepts medicaid. So we process an immense amount of prescriptions (Average of probably 500-600 per day). Our customers are extremely entitled and demanding, despite the fact that they're paying nothing.   


And my Pharmacy Manager decides to put up FOUR techs for full time covid vaccinations. So now we only have three techs. Right before committing the techs, she gave me a piece of paper to sign, asking how many extra hours I was willing to work, and requesting that I work overtime. I told her no, and checked 0 extra hours on the paper.   


She went and scheduled me for 2 straight weeks of overtime with no days off. Which I stupidly worked without complaining. So she went and did it again. 

  
Two nights ago, she demanded a girl come in to work while sick, and the girl caved. She ended up getting me sick. And that was the final straw. 

&amp;#x200B;

I showed up to work in person to let her know that I won't be coming in for the next 2 days, demanded a raise, and told her if she ever fucking schedules me for more than 30 hours without asking me first, I fucking quit.   


I have enough money to last me 7 months of mortgage and I just got my stimulus check. I can very easily find a new job. But me dropping right now will fuck up her schedule.  


  
Just something to throw in - she's moving to another state on the other side of the country in 2 months. So she's been working us extra hard because she's trying to get bonuses before she leaves. But at the cost of hurting us workers. I have a son, who I never get to see. And one of the new girls has elderly family members that need her, the other one has school and she hasn't even had time to start her new classes because the fucking cunt pharmacy manager has no heart.",False,l1s4gg,Revolutionary_Club74,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/l1s4gg/i_hope_my_boss_likes_the_new_asshole_i_tore_her/,13,1
642,The Burnout Society by the philosopher Byung Chul Han,"Full article here: [link](https://psychology-spot.com/the-burnout-society/)

Han points out that “The society of the 21st century is no longer disciplinary, but a society of the performance. Nor are its inhabitants called ‘subjects of obedience’, but ‘subjects of performance’. These subjects are entrepreneurs of themselves.”

This change, which apparently empowers and is liberating, actually becomes a boomerang that soon beats us with all its strength because it hides a great psychological risk of which we are not aware.

The violence of the society over its members has not disappeared, but has been camouflaged and is now based on the self-exploitation of the subject: “This is much more effective than the exploitation by the others, because it is accompanied by a feeling of freedom. The exploiter is the same exploited. Victim and executioner can no longer differentiate. This self-referentiality generates a paradoxical freedom, which, because of the structures of obligation immanent to it, becomes violence […] In this society of obligation, each one carries with him his forced labor field”.

Basically, our society would be the evolution of the disciplinary and controlling societies of the past, but in reality it does not imply more freedom, but continues to exert its power over each person through the introjection of the “duty”. This situation turns us into slaves of overproduction, super-performance (work, play and sex) or supercommunication.

The most emblematic example of the problems caused by this social pressure for performance is depression. This philosopher thinks that “In reality, what sickens is not the excess of responsibility and initiative, but the imperative of performance, as the new mandate of the late modern labor society.

“The depressive man is that working animal that exploits itself, that is: voluntarily, without external coercion. He is, at the same time, executioner and victim […] The depression is unleashed at the moment in which the subject of performance can no longer do anything […] The depressed is tired of the effort to become himself.”

The problem is that “The ‘I can’t do it anymore’ leads to a destructive self-reproach and self-aggression”. When we realize that we can not achieve everything we wanted to do, we feel frustrated, but we do not think that society has deceived us but we self-reproach, feeling that we are incapable.",False,l2nkvq,crewster94,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/l2nkvq/the_burnout_society_by_the_philosopher_byung_chul/,1,1

652,Why I support women being housewives and homemakers,"After reading all these posts I have to agree, working 5 days a week, week after week, sucks.

So this makes me like the idea of what the older generation did, which was that the men slaved away at the job, and women didnt have to work but just took care of the house, took care of the kids, focused on hobbies, making themselves pretty, socializing, travelling.

So one gender had to deal with the harshness of work, accepted it and embraced it, but the other got to enjoy life, and focus on higher pursuits, and retain that innocence kinda, and ideally a man's wife helped him relieve stress from the harshness of work.

I am not advocating for controlling women, but for doing this on a voluntary basis.

Like for myself, when I had a girlfriend in the past, I remember that her beauty, love,  support etc really helped me to push harder at work. And I would gladly, if I had the money, let my girlfriend or wife renounce work, or work less hours, or work at something she is more passionate about that makes less money

The way it is now, both genders (everybody) has to deal with the harshness of work. But if only one gender had to deal with that, and the other didnt, Im sure the world would take a step towards being a happier place

Please ask questions if I said something that seems off or doesnt make sense.

(In the older generation, there was a lot of male abuse of women. That is unfortunate and not ok)

666,I want to read your story. What led you to this anti work mentality.,"What led me to this sub you ask ? Well, dive in &amp; tell me your story too.

I was a truck driver. 1 year of driving around the greatest country in the world :). I just turned 21, had a license since 18. The only thing this company asked for was to have a license for 3 years &amp; be 21 or older. I did trucking school, blah blah. Anyway, that was miserable. I could go on in detail about that but not today. Today I want to rant about the job I had after that 1 year of driving ended. 

I end up driving for a company that sprays the fields by air for agricultural work. My job, to keep it short, was to drive to the location the pilot wanted me in, mix the chems, hook the hose up to the helicopter. There were many red flags I should have noticed. For example, how I got hired for a job that seems really important. The owner just met with me somewhere random, saw my license &amp; told me they would only pay me min wage. Whatever, I said. I'll be home every night with my family ! 

What an absolute buffoon I was. Complete idiot. Thinking the owner, manager &amp; upper staff would respect me like I thought they would. I end up working monday to saturday. No breaks. No benefits. Hours change. Even my pay went down because I was having a hard time getting used to everything. One day, I end up working around 15 hours on a saturday. Got in at 3 pm, left the job site to drive home at the next morning. 6 or 7 am. They wanted me to work that same day I got home. Sunday. Be back here at 3 pm ! No less ! I was told by the manager. The fucker kept me in his office for like 30 mins after we were done on that sunday morning lmao. I can't even remember what he was talking about. I was so fucking exhausted &amp; hungry. 

I endured that for 6 months. I got appendicitis. Told the bosses I had a medical emergency. Rest for about 2 to 3 weeks. Come back to work. Got fired that same day I came back. 

I didn't even mention the owner's house. It sat on top a hill. Looking down to the work area as if it were the medieval age. A castle looking down, making sure the peasants are working every damn minute. He had a huge garage where the owner threw a big party every year to show us gratitude. While he ate the whole cake, the workers fought for crumbs. Metaphorically, of course.

Now that's all fine, but I had a true ""What the hell are we all doing with ourselves?"" moment today. We use a specialized system to send these RFIs (we don't just email people who work at other banks), and the response I got was something along the lines of ""We cannot comply with your inquiry because your message is in a MT999 format. Please send your message again in an MT199 format or your inquiry will be closed.""

What? What the hell is this? I sent a bunch of questions that need a response, just respond to the damn questions! How much of our collective time is spent on worrying whether a list of simple questions is sent in an MT999 format or an MT199 format (which, as an AML professional for more than two years, I can safely say that I have no idea what those terms mean) when it could be spent relaxing, enjoying the company of family/friends, engaging in physical activity, working on our passion projects, or enjoying our hobbies. Or literally anything else.

People who come here and think we're just lazy and entitled have to understand that THIS is what ""anti-work"" means.

Times up for me as far as getting money to meet my basic needs. Ive happily lived on very little money, money I had saved up for this situation. Not having health insurance sucks, though. I hate being dependent on others to pay my bills and I genuinely do enjoy my career choice. I love the type of work I do but I've had a long string of abusive work places to the point I have flashbacks, anxiety, depression, and dread thinking about going back to my industry. I have C-PTSD from other stuff but my work history added to that. 

I see a doctor regularly,  twice a month and I'm on medications that I hope to one day learn how to function without. Ive got my mental health covered.

Anyways, this is probably the wrong sub to ask for encouragement and support but this place knows how I feel.

How do I overcome the dread? How do I fight my instinct to protect myself from an abusive job? How do I go back to work feeling the way I do about it?

I'd love to find something that doesn't fill me with dread but really I don't have that kind of time and luxury to be picky. Ive dreamt and planned for years now to eventually work for myself but that's a further off goal.

When I’m home relaxing in bed and scrolling Instagram, I come across videos or photos of people doing good for humanity.

Did you ever seen a happy IT guy? Neither did I. It's an awful job, which pays decently but gnaws at your soul, the ultimate golden cage in a county where you're either high-tech worker or you're condemned to be poor.  


Because the role is passive, and not active (you don't actually create something noticeable, but everyone notice when you don't do your work properly) people do no appreciate you, nor you time. Even worse, since the servers work 24/7, you're sometimes forced to work in unruly hours in addition to the usual 08:30-17:30, like 2-4 am even on weekends (with no extra pay, it's in the job description).   
My daily hell loop was waking up at 6 am, get the baby and wife ready with their breakfasts, get out of the house by 8 am, work my ass off, and get back to the house by 18:30, only to feed the baby and get him to sleep, and soon after my wife follows after she's exhausted from the day.   
I was basically a father-husband only for the weekends, and only assuming I won't be called from work.  


So I got a life insurance, 2M $. Specifically made sure it covers suicides. I was thinking that, well, I can't be present at home to be a proper father and husband, at least the money will make sure neither of them will ever have to work. My life are worthless, and are better off like that than keep feeding the cooperate on my family's expense.   


I was starting to plan it all of, but than covid hits so I got both more time with my family, and an investment I did turned our our need to work obsolete. Now I can finally be a stay-at-home dad, a house-husband, and that's the most fulfilling thing I've ever did. My time is invested for my family, in my family, and around my family.

705,Haven't applied for a job in years,"I'm 32 now. Everything was fine up until I graduated from university. I graduated with a BSc in physics and an MSc in nuclear science.

After graduating I applied to graduate schemes and I had no idea how difficult it would be to get a place and how many hoops there were to jump through (communication and numerical psychometric tests, usually 4x500 word answers, assessment centre and then a final interview). In the end I gave up and the last time I applied to a graduate scheme was 2018. I lost all belief in the hiring process.

I also applied to positions in the general jobs market and this was worse, because I was mostly met with silence, except for anything to do with teaching. With exception of a few temp roles I had no work. I haven't had a job since June 2019.

I live with my parents and don't pay rent. I go for a run most days, watch tv and spend hours on the internet.

Why have I stopped applying for jobs? Because I know the only way I can get hired is to retrain in a niche. I applied to graduate entry medicine last year, sat the GAMSAT and did work experience. You are allowed to apply to four universities - I was rejected from one and offered interviews for the other three. I had one interview last week.

If I get in then I will have security for life, if I don't then fuck knows what I am going to do. Maybe physio.

Insomnia is not a disease. Insomnia is a certain way of life.

“Man is made by nature to work hard for at least eight hours. Unless he works hard for eight hours he does not earn the right to have a deep sleep. And as a society grows richer, people are not working hard. There is no need; others can work for them. The whole day they are doing small things which they enjoy doing, but it is not hard work like that of a stonecutter or a woodcutter. The body is made so that after eight hours of hard work it naturally needs to fall into sleep to rejuvenate its energy. But it seems difficult…you have earned enough money and still you are chopping wood for eight hours? Then for what have you earned all that money? It seems stupid. You could have chopped wood even without becoming a millionaire.
So if fifty million people in America are suffering from insomnia, that simply means these are the people who are not earning the right to sleep.

Well when we schedule an appointment for the customer, we have a window of time, and that window of time can be broken down into 3 four-hour windows instead of say 8am to 8pm.

Well when I started, I always offered the four-hour windows after people commented they ""did not want to sit around for 12 hours"". I mean, can you blame them? I sure wouldn't.

Well after looking at my call feedback, they seem rather upset that I do this, because we are ""supposed to push the 12 hour window"", and only offer a shorter window ""if asked"".

This is one of several things that makes my call unnecessary long, because I know what the customer wants. They don't want a 12 hour window. Maybe some retirees or people who are disabled and house-bound. 

This extremely frustrates me. In all my years of retail and customer service jobs, ""do what is right for the customer"" is supposed to be pretty high up on business professionalism. 

There is no reason to offer such a large window at first, other than ""it's the rules"".

This is also not the only thing that they do similar to this. We have to ask questions, many of which are assumption based and thus a waste of time. For example, if someone is calling because they need a technician out due to signal loss, and they start off with ""Hello my name is Raspootin and I'm calling because the signal has gone out"", then obviously asking ""is the TV display a picture currently"" is a waste of time, because they wouldn't be calling in with signal loss, otherwise.

But we have to ask these questions anyway, and then they wonder why my calls take so long. I could literally address the customers concerns and cut the call time in half by skipping half the questions, but we are required to ask them, which often times upsets the customer because they are being asked questions with painfully obvious answers.",False,l1q6yn,_Raspootin_,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/l1q6yn/do_whats_good_for_the_company_not_the_customer/,2,2

729,Internet hiring ruined the job market,"I’m sure you have heard the stories about getting a job with a firm hand shake and a paper application. Applicant tracking systems have ruined that. They see if you match 70-90 percent of the job posting. Why is that a problem? You can’t learn a new skill or switch careers. Also if it’s a receptionist job and you were a secretary the Applicant tracking system may accidentally throw you out.  Employers know qualified people are thrown out using this system. This also leads to employers paying less and demanding more. They say they have 100-300 applications for a job when 5-10 are actually interested. This makes them demand weekends and pay you less. Stop applying to low paying jobs online, and stop undervaluing your time. If you have 15 years of management experience stop accepting minimum wage. I shouldn’t have to tell people this, respect yourself more. I’m tired of hearing “apply online” for a minimum wage job. Job searching shouldn’t be this complicated. Why is it? When you apply online you build their applicant pool. They will always be accepting applications because the current staff is replaceable. I don’t mind working but I’m done with group interviews. If you’re over qualified don’t apply. Demand more out of the employers, I shouldn’t be expected to have “open availability”for a 9.00 job with no benefits. I saw another job posting that said they need a babysitter. They wanted you for 3 hours and wanted to pay 15.00 a day.

745,An interesting story about work and priorities...,"I was recently reading Phillip Short's biography of Pol Pot. 

Hold your horses now, this isn't some diatribe about bringing back a Khmer Rouge, Year Zero style revolution.

Lots of the book examines Khmer/Cambodian society and how/why it works the way it does.

The great Angkor civilisation (builders of Angkor Wat) were so successful because they used irrigation to grow rice 3/4 times a year (rather than being locked into one seasonal harvest). The 20th century Cambodians pre Khmer Rouge revolution had regressed to just once per year. Leading colonists to deride them as 'lazy'

A famous phrase went 'The Vietnamese grow the rice, the Cambodians watch it grow, the Laotians listen to it grow'.

So, onto our main story. An American entrepreneur visited Cambodia post overthrow of Pol Pot to teach farming techniques to farmers who were still using quite medieval methods right until the 80s/90s. Using machinery, fertilizer and pesticides they were able to double their rice yields. Let's say from 40 tonnes to 80 tonnes. The Khmers were ecstatic. 

2 years later the American entrepreneur returned, to find the farmers were continuing you use his methods. However, they were now only working half as much land as they had before he'd instructed them. They had chosen to use the gift of efficiency to cut their work by 50%, continuing to grow 40 tonnes of rice, whilst only working half the land.

Short, the writer, tells this story as a sort of 'gotcha' moment, to illustrate that this society is in fact more concerned with leisure than work. Although he does concede that it's also due to essentially people being happy with what they have and what they need, rather than striving for 'more and more'.

I think the story has some pretty big lessons for us too. Over the last 30/40 years we've developed incredible technologies that have cut the time it takes to do things in half, or more! And yet, we continue to work (or be forced to work) a 9-5pm schedule, if not more. Working hours are going up, rather than down. Clearly we are doing more work/achieving more/producing more.

Yet, we are not earning double/triple what we were in the past. In fact, we've gone from a scenario where one breadwinner was able to provide for a family with children on a sole income, to working couples struggling to combine their incomes to cover the bare essentials, while home ownership and having children remain a distant dream or a seriously stress inducing risk.


TL;DR - Cambodian farmers worked out a way to do half as much work, while producing an equal quantity of product. Giving them more leisure and the same amount of wealth. Our society demands that we work more, produce more, while rewarding us with less and tying our happiness to greed.",False,l2fqsx,mankindmatt5,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/l2fqsx/an_interesting_story_about_work_and_priorities/,2,1

Very Business Over

123-4 hours drive from my apartment

Dear Capitalist Moneyperson,

With 20-40 hours’ experience every week writing cover letters, it should come as no surprise that |
am so sick of writing them, | now consider each new one the latest installment in my own
personal hell.

Looking over my employment history, as | am sure you are not, | can think of many notable
moments where | was demonstrable expelling at my positions. These included:

- Following basic instructions.

- Not saying anything about poor management.

- Hearing that thing that | am supposed to wear.

- Putting my valuable thoughts into a “Suggestion box”.

- Smiling.

‘Is you can see, | am reasonably qualified for the position offered, but as you are looking for an
entry level applicant with 5 years experience and a degree in a related field so you can pay
bottom dollar for them to do both jobs of the senior employees you are letting go, | can safely
assume this and my resume will end up on a digital shelf.

took forward to receiving the email about you receiving, viewing, and ultimately giving the
position to someone else in 3 month's time, long after | had forgotten | had applied. | award you
bonus points for using gentle terms like ""Careful consideration” and “He will keep your
information on file”.

Is | am sure | will be getting a call from you immediately upon one of the aforementioned
positions opening up, | will now spend the remainder of my life cycle hitting refresh on my into.
Thank you for this opportunity,

David

769,Once got an improvement period for calling off..,"Figured you guys would like this story..

Once upon a time I was a prison guard... Worked ungodly hours with the threat of violence for $10usd/hr.

Shifts were 7-7, but with oncoming shifts role call and things like that you didn’t get relieved until 7:30 at the earliest. Some days relief didn’t come at all, and you would get yelled at if you called someone in charge to ask what was going on. They were allowed to mandatorily keep you until 11 for any reason. 

Needless to say, in these conditions we were always short staffed. So, at one point for a few months we were working sometimes 7 days per week, often 16 hour days. During this time I called off several times just because I needed the rest. 8 hours between shifts is rough when you consider your drive home, trying to eat, sleep, get ready for work, then drive back all within 8 hours.  My annual performance evaluation was coming up around this time and they told me I was calling off too often and put me on an improvement period. Any call offs during the 6 month period would result in a write up.

My partner is headed into dentistry school next year. He will likely be earning upwards of $100k/year after he graduates. I will also be working in some capacity, and unless there are major global and economic changes in the next 10 years (which there very well may be and I truly hope there are) we'll be better off than most people. I only know one other dentist, he's about 30 years older than me and lives quite lavishly. I come from a 50k/year family of 4, so thinking about having enough to not worry about being able to pay our bills sounds amazing but I also feel really guilty. My dream was always to have just enough--i would feel uncomfortable in designer clothes and a nice car. I don't want a massive house in a rich neighborhood, I don't want to send my kids to private school. So more than likely, we'll have an excess of money. 
I always dreamed of having enough to redistribute lots of money and being able to help tons of people. Like I wanna tip my waitress $500 and sponsor poor college kids and stuff like that. Give money directly to the person. But I have a lot of health problems. At 22, I have a herniated disc in my back and high cholesterol (tons of heart disease on both mom and dad's side). My partner's family has a history of cancer. The American healthcare system is famous for draining people completely dry and I'm terrified of losing a loved one because they couldn't pay their bills. I don't want to hoard wealth, but I also don't want to get fucked by a lethal system if I can avoid it.

785,Ramblings of a disgruntled night shift factory slave,"This is mostly a rant, and the only way I could truly vent this because I could never express this to coworkers.

Glad I found this sub,

For a good portion of my life I could never really find the words to describe how I felt about work. I never vehemently opposed it, but I hate the mundane nature of most jobs. Whether it was working at a pizza place and being slaved by corporate policies, or working in a small business and being exploited there. I could never truly find a job where I felt like I wasn’t some mindless simian performing a task that could be done by anyone with basic motor functions.

I had just graduated from uni, thankfully it allowed me to avoid working anything full time or long term. However, now that I’m not doing anything and looking for an actual career, I took it upon myself to make fast cash in a local factory. I won’t mention the name of corporation I serve, but they’re a well known decoration chain in the US and Canada. 

My dad had asked me if I could handle nightshift. For those wondering, he worked in a factory for most of his life because he grew up fairly poor and didn’t have a choice. I told him “it can’t be that bad, right?”.

I could not have been more wrong in my presumptions about this job. I signed as a regular warehouse associate ie slave that can get moved around anytime any day. I work 11pm-7am every day except Saturday. We get 1 10 minute break then a 20 minute break throughout the 8 hr shift, but we often work “mandatory OT” every other week (we only get an extra 10 minute break for getting to work at 9pm).

The job is physically grueling, the one shift supervisor saw me on my first day and moved me from a relatively decent spot sorting boxes to manually loading an avg of 1000 box orders into a truck. So, I stand in a fairly dark box in 15 degree weather for 8 hours every night. I’ve seen about 10 people come and go since I arrived about a month ago, and that’s just in my department. The people I work with are all older men who have been reduced to limps (no seriously, all of them are limping and look visibly in pain during our shifts). They have cameras in front of every truck dock to nonstop monitor us, so if we sit down or go on our phone they’ll send an underling to yell at us for not working. 

I do the bare minimum, I function on a workflow of 50% efficiency nonstop. It’s mundane to work overly hard because they carefully made it so that boxes come down in certain intervals (so you basically work until the final minute of the shift). Apparently coworkers snitch on eachother all of the time for phones, falsely believing they’ll get some sort of handout or pat on the back by higher ups for rating out your coworker. The coaches and supervisors constantly preach about being a team and helping eachother, yet everyone is so cynical they won’t help eachother out regardless of if we’re busy or not.

I don’t exactly subscribe to the communist and capitalist bashing that’s prevalent in this sub. I get it though, the whole worker being exploited thing. I see higher ups who literally sit in their office playing YouTube videos and having a ball of a shift, meanwhile I’m over here trying not to get hypothermia at 4AM. I’m only at this job to save up enough money to last me into the summer so that I can find a decent (non physically demanding) job and move out of this god forsaken town. 

Does anyone know how to make the time go by faster? I feel like my days just sorta blend together now that I have no inherent free time for myself cause I have to catch up on sleep otherwise I’ll be a zombie for the next shift. It’s really soul crushing. I’m not sure how people do this for years on end.

I cannot fathom why anyone should give a shit about this, and why the hell am I supposed to answer them instead of telling them to fuck off and stop asking personal questions.



I would love to know the psychological and societal reasons behind it.


The only reasons I can guess are:  
- checking whether I have it better or worse than their kid, so they can measure penis size  
- checking whether a peer has it better or worse, so he can decide whether to hate them or patronize them.


I can only see it as a dick measuring contest. There is 0 chance that someone is asking so he can give you a better job in case you have a shitty one. It's disgusting, and it really messes with my self-esteem. Soo many people have asked me. It's like, they have no fucking question to ask me so they ask where I work. Like, go and fucking ask me about the game or the weather, instead of stabbing me every time so I have to get over the urge to tell you to fuck off and die, and meekly respond about my employment situation. 



It's doubly disgusting because I live in a town which is like a village and everyone knows everyone and likes to tattle and gossip about everyone.

808,My job at Pizza Hut was living hell.,"I feel like there's nowhere else I could post this without people thinking that I was exaggerating. Over a year after leaving this company and I still struggle with learned anxiety that has never left my body.


The worst part of my job was that I never got to leave on time. My shift was usually about 8 AM to 4 PM, but we had a list of prep every morning that we had to do. I'd make the doughs, sauce them, and cheese them, usually about 20-40 in every size and style, so most mornings about 120-200 pizzas (and yes, I have pictures of my prep lists left to me). But I had to cook those pizzas if anyone ordered them, and so after lunch rush I essentially would have to remake the prep from scratch, alone, as the only cook. Every day I was stressed out to no end just trying to get it done -- because I knew the managers wouldn't let me go home if I didn't.

And usually, even if I did. If we got busy, or if the person after my shift didn't come in (he was a teenager, so he missed often), they also would refuse to allow me to clock out. And then as the cook, I'd have to stay for the full dinner shift until it calmed down completely at around 7-8 PM. But some nights they forced me to stay until closing, said I couldn't leave until the store was cleaned up and everything was packed. So every day around 4 PM I would feel the most tremendous anxiety because... Either I got to go home... Or I might not for hours upon hours.

This also got in the way of my dates with my girlfriend. I remember getting yelled at for having to call her because they refused to let me clock out. I realize that this is completely illegal, yes, but if I had said no they would have fired me. And to put this kindly, at the time I was ""eating out of the trash""-- Me and another co-worker waiter would split untouched leftover slices people left on their table, or we'd salvage a burnt pizza later after throwing it away (in a cardboard box) in front of the boss.

There's more, too, if you're willing to hear it. The main manager that I worked under was an extremely loud, ridiculously aggressive woman who scared the absolute shit out of me (a 17 year old). She would brag about how her son threatened to call child control on her and say (in regards to it), ""I laughed in his face and told him to go ahead. See if he'll have anywhere to live."" I feel like she couldn't talk to anyone without screaming at them and it terrified me so badly that I'd freeze up. She thought that was even more funny and so she'd wait for me to do things like walk inside and would scream at me about how I was in trouble and then laugh when I got scared and flustered. 

And she was mean to me in other ways too... She'd shove her crotch in my face when I ever leaned down to take ingredients out of the fridge below the make table. 

There were some saving graces. Occasionally we would get a waiter that I'd become friends with, or a particularly motherly female employee that would step between me and that manager. But these were good people, so within weeks or months they'd have quit to find better jobs.

I described in some comment on here that I felt like I had low-grade PTSD from working. It seems fucked up to say that when it's a real disorder but I've never been the same since working there. Having people raise their voice at me or indications that I might leave somewhere late cause me such deep panic that they scramble me up really bad.

And I do feel like this is stupid and pathetic and I don't know why I'm putting it on the internet, but I feel like you guys would understand. When my parents put pressure on me that I'm lazy and need to find a job that they don't understand it but my head rationalizes it as them wanting me to go through all of those bad things again. 

As a cook I made no tips. I would be asked to come in early some mornings to cook ten, or fifteen, or twenty pizzas for a school or a local car dealership. They always worked me as an only cook, so I'd make the pizzas with dough I prepared, cook them through the oven, cut them and box them myself, and then the manager would get a big $20 tip for it by the company. That I couldn't have any of.

I couldn't go to my boss either.
Our strongest Pizza Hut managee was the Area Coach, but he despised me. He accused me of being a pothead (even though I was arguably the only one of the entire staff who didn't smoke weed) and threw similar insults at me. And I feel like I was a worthless piece of shit sometimes too because everytime he was near us I would hide. Or change stations.

824,The abusive relationships of the hierarchy,"I see a lot of articles about abusive partners in relationships, and I want to start by saying I think this practice is abhorrent.  This extends to physical, emotional, financial abuse. 

The advice in these situations is usually to cut off toxic relationships, not to reconcile differences and carry on. So, when similar abuses happen in the workplace (eg managers gaslighting for their own mistakes/inadequacies), it really riles me there's a large chunk of the population who will defend employment to the hilt. 

This abuse leaves scars too, but it's normalised across most workplaces.",False,l1883e,Craigj0812,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/l1883e/the_abusive_relationships_of_the_hierarchy/,3,1

829,Video resumes are the worst.,"There was this online job posting for a content editor / trainer. It was a purely home-based job, and they responded to my application saying they needed a 2-minute video of me ""introducing myself"" and mentioning what I can do for that position. They even provided a sample video of someone doing that.

So I asked them why a video would be necessary. My appearance, mannerisms, and accent are irrelevant to my performance, anyway. (Plus I thought it would just be a very easy way for them to discriminate against applicants)

They basically replied ""the video is for us to know you better. if you don't wanna do it then f\*\*\* off"" (not the exact words)

What in the world is this? I am a very privacy-conscious person and the idea of me sending a video of myself to some stranger, without knowing where it will end up sooner or later, disturbs me. I don't care if I'm a nobody in this world, I still value my privacy.

1. If you have plans to work less or not work a traditional job somehow:

&amp;#x200B;

2. If you are like me and don't have the motivation/personality to find a way to work less or not work a traditional job:

	Try your best to find a job/company that works for you and has a good work life balance. I tried becoming an electrician at 25 and absolutely hated it, I didn't like working anyway and then I had to do manual labor on top of that, I also had to work with a lot of people I didn't have a lot in common with and in an environment that didn't work for me (I'm a quiet sensitive person). I went back and did computer programming at college at age 27 and I'm very content with it. Yes I would rather not work at all but it's not feasible for me. I am used to having a certain lifestyle (house, car, 2 kids to support). For a long time I found it hard to accept that I will work for the rest of my life. For me anyway I found that the energy I used resisting the life I'm living wore me out. I try not to dwell on how much I hate work but how I can work my life around it to be as happy as I possibly can. I still dream of turning some of my hobbies in to money making activities but I think ultimately that would be more work and stress than I can handle to be honest. So for now I am going to be content working and count my blessings. Just my 2 cents and things I think about.

836,How am I supposed to get through an 8 hour shift with only a 30 minute break????,"Maybe this makes me sound pretentious or like I’m complaining but to be honest, idgaf. My boss just asked me if I wanted to take a Friday 4 hour shift or a Saturday 8 hour shift. I took the 4 hour shift and she pestered me for not taking the longer one. If it’s up to me, I’ll always choose shorter shifts 4-6 hours because at least I can push through and get a half hour break but what human being can work for 8 hours in a high sales environment on their feet for 8 hours and be expected to “rest” for 30 minutes??? Not even that, after I run to the bathroom and heat up my food, that’s 20 minutes of a break that I have left🙂.

847,Company starting new policy punishing employees for situations outside of our control LONG RANT,"I work for a huge multinational company in the UK who sent the work force to work from home since March. In the surveys that they've sent out the majority of the people had a very positive response.

Since then the offices have slowly and partially reopened, now with the people that cant/don't want to wfh working from the office. Currently at less than 5% capacity.

Of course with working from home there are some additional problems that can arise, Internet and electricity issues may not be common, but with several thousands of employees it wouldn't be weird that it happens.

**However** they will now roll out a new policy where any downtime will be taken out of your pay, or you will need to use PTO. Their reasoning for this was that there are apparently people who haven't worked at all since March and it's losing the company a lot of money.

Now the obvious question is why they wouldn't just do something about the people not working instead. 

But the worst part is that they brought up an example, where the city was doing maintenance on the fibre of her street, and knocked out the Internet of the whole street for 2 days. It could've been the ISP or whatever but the point still stands. A situation completely out of your control just caused you to lose 2 days pay. And you can't just drop into the office as that needs to be planned 7+ days in advance.

The even more interesting thing is that we have paid sick days, so if you get a power outage the most financially wise decision is to call in sick. 

They did however say that in extraordinary circumstances there may be exceptions. The example given was if there was a city wide power outage.

Now this may be understandable if internet/power issues were common. I can of course only speak of my team but I don't think anyone in my team in the past 9 months have had issues more than once.

857,Yes there is a serious problem with society.,"Indeed their is a problem with a capitalist society when mumble rappers make more than teachers and doctors. In it's most fundamental form, capitalism is about convincing not innovation. Let me explain, I was told when I was in school that Capitalism relied on innovation and cultivating new ideas. Although that may be true, lets be serious, most of the people who thrive in a capitalist society are not innovators but the manipulators. A successful product that actually works better than a competitor doesn't matter, what matters is if a certain celebrity is using that same product(even though technically they were paid to use it).

858,I got fired today for standing up for my morals and code of ethics. Fuck employers.,"I’m a barber, and this pandemic has been fucking awful for me. I’ve lost 70% of my clientele and new clients have been really hard to build. I worked at a shop that was recently bought by a new owner, and I started after they opened under the new name. Our cuts are $25 across the board, but I have had some clients come to me that either have a VERY simple haircut that takes less than 10 minutes, or are elderly and on social security/older vets that barely have income. I have 3-4 clients that I charge less than $25. Everyone else is $25. 

So now boss wants to raise the prices to $30 across the board. I’m not comfortable with that and I say so. I tell him that most of my clients are able to pay $30 and will do so gladly, but a very select few cannot pay that or shouldn’t. A cut on a 3 year old that takes me 15 minutes isn’t worth $30, and that is unethical in my opinion. Boss starts going off on me about discounting and making our shop seem cheap. No man, I just have empathy and actually care about my clients. One of the “discount” clients is a developmentally disabled man that’s living off of disability checks and lives with his elderly parents. He’s basically bald and does one guard size all over, and doesn’t even let me shave his neck. 5-9 minutes in and out. I charge him $15. Somehow that is worth $30 in my boss’ eyes. 

Today he called me and told me that I wasn’t pulling in enough money for them and that their “business ideals” aren’t congruent with mine. I know I’ve struggled to build a clientele, but I’ve brought in a couple dozen brand new clients in addition to the 40+ that followed me, I’ve had clients switch from their barber at that shop to me because I’m a way better barber (honestly top 2 working there) AND I clean the shop for free. Did I mention that I’m an independent contractor and I don’t get paid unless I’m doing a haircut? Fucking garbage. I’ve done so much unpaid labor for these people and they just fucking fire me because I’m not pulling in enough money during a fucking pandemic. 

They immediately signed me out of our booking service that has all of MY CLIENTS names and numbers (I have the vast majority saved to my phone thank god) and changed the lock code on the door. I’ve never proven myself untrustworthy and they immediately start treating me like a fucking criminal. All of this after “we just have to work together to get through this, if we all stay the course and wait it out it’ll be worth it!!” This is such a good lesson I’m never trusting a single employer again. Every job I’ve left is because of a terrible fucking boss. I’ve also never ever been fired in 7 years of working. I feel like fucking trash and like I got taken advantage of so hard. I’m humiliated and I’ve been anxious and nauseated all day. If you read this far, thank you. I’m gonna be doing everything in my power after this to get myself set up truly independently so that I don’t have to rely on greedy fucking assholes.",False,l0ak7a,wolfmoon222,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/l0ak7a/i_got_fired_today_for_standing_up_for_my_morals/,126,1

It barely makes $1000 a month but that's not much of an issue since I don't pay many bills (I help pay for things around the house for the most part but my gf's mom is okay with it because she wants me to save up for my future).

While I'm doing this I've been studying for my A+ certifications because frankly I miss being free and living in my own place (I was in college in the past and that was my first taste of freedom and I lost it due to financial problems) and I want to be able to afford a better life for myself. But I **DREAD** the thought of having to work 40 hours a week again, last time I had a job that asked 40 hours of me I had a breakdown and almost committed s**cide because I never had energy to do anything outside of work and felt like a shell

870,People who casually 'brag' about working 60 hour weeks...,"I'm curious about this because to me, the idea of working more than 60 hours a week just seems completely incompatible with my own physical or mental health in the long-term.  


Maybe there's something wrong with me, and I just don't have the stamina, the physiology, or the time management that other people have who are able to sustain that kind of work pattern. I need my 8-9 hours of sleep a night for one thing, or I suffer for it, my mind is really foggy, I get clumsy and feel a little nauseous.  


The longest work week I've ever done was 80 hours and that was brutal for me. Basically an entire week of 12 hour days with no day off. But that was just one week. I've also done month-long stretches of 50+ hours due to staff shortages and business needs. But I couldn't sustain that for longer periods of time without it wearing me down, it becomes a downward spiral; my sleep suffers, my diet suffers, I stop exercising, I fall behind on life admin, self-maintenance, my mental health falls to shit and that reinforces the negative feedback loop. I can't afford for that to happen again.  


But, fuck, it just seems that as time goes on, life is demanding more and more from us. Wages drop in real terms. Rent goes up.  


I've tried cutting back my needs, simplifying my life, appreciating the small pleasures. I'm an Epicurean who believes in creating a life as free from stress and suffering as much as is practical.   


I plan to up-skill, to make my labour more valuable so I can earn more for less labour and maybe, just maybe, do a job that doesn't fill me with dread when I wake up every morning. And maybe even get to a point where I have time and energy to use my skills pro-bono to help other people elevate themselves to a better quality of life.

Everyone is so caught up about their high and mighty status in their jobs and how high they are and all the professor bullshite masters and phd degrees they have. Recently got news of someone at my age who i knew (only 25) died unexpectedly. 

He had spent all of his life in “education” getting degrees and phds whilst working a minimum wage desk job in the hopes of promotion. Never even left the country to go travel or explore, never got his own place or anything all because he was too caught up in that corporate death trap. It’s made me so scared because of how much I see others doing exactly what he did in this world. 

Think about it, boom. You die unexpectedly. It’s all over. Everything you ever did for your high and mighty job and academics, now means entirely nothing. Just under 24 hours of mourning from those who knew you,  then the world just moves on if not sooner. Your job position is replaced within a matter of minutes. All turned to ash. 

And did you live your life? No, because you were too busy trying to be better than everyone else and not ever being content with what you had in life and just living. You were too busy chasing after a meaningless high paying job that takes many years out of your already short life and for what? A bit of praise at those fancy social gatherings you very occasionally have once every few years? Pfft, yeah because that was really worth it. 

Just remember my fellow anti-workers, you are replaceable, you are expendable, you are a number, you do not matter to those corporate companies. All the degrees in the world which take years of arduous work to complete won’t just magically land you a high paying job. I see it all too often on reddit in general, everyone is going for a masters in this that and the other just for a minor possibility of getting a slightly higher pay check all because they just cannot be content with anything in their life and always chase the corporate dragon without realising their time on this earth is finite. 

Enjoy your life, and remember that all the happiness doesn’t come from your job status or wealth. You may think everyone cares about it but they really don’t. We live in a selfish world where everyone is always out their to try and be “better than you” just be happy with what you have and live.

886,"This is a rant about my previous employers. It's been over a year since I worked for them, and I still laugh at all their bullshit when I think of it","So I worked as a breakfast line cook at this very prestigious, well known, 5 star hotel in a nice town in the Canadian Rockies. It was my job to get up at 4:30 in the morning, to make it into work for 5am and work breakfast service. The hotel has nearly 800 rooms, and in the summer we have almost 100% capacity most days. An average room runs for 300-400 CAD per night, just to give you a picture of how much money this place makes. Anyways, for an 800 room hotel the breakfast team consisted of 4-5 people. With a team that small, running breakfast for hundreds/thousands of people was beyond brutal. For my entire 8 hour shift I didn't have time to use the washroom, or even time to unscrew the lid on my water bottle and take a sip of water. Worst of all, they wouldn't allow us to work overtime, so we had approximately 2 hours after breakfast service to get rid of the breakfast buffet and do all our prep for the next day. Taking down the buffet took about half an hour, so our team of 4-5 people had 1.5 hours to cut literal buckets of various fruit, and prep anything we were going to be serving the next day. This was never enough time, so what the sous chef told us to do, was clock out, then come back and finish up the task. Every day I would put in at least an hour of unpaid work. 

6 weeks in I was totally drained and hated going to bed, knowing that my 4:30am alarm would go off just to wake me up for another day in hell. One day, after we were having a meeting in the dry storage, one of my co-workers raised her concern for the fact we do not have time to get anything done and constantly being yelled at did nothing for our productivity and she ended up breaking down in tears in front of our whole crew as she was as stressed as I was. The chefs reaction was to say something along the lines of ""you a Phillipa woman, you get emotional and dramatic over anything. Suck it up."" That comment pushed me over the edge to quit. After my shift I talked to my boss and told him I'm handing in my two weeks. My boss (not the misogynistic chef, but the man overseeing all the food and bev outlets in the hotel) asked why and I told him my reasons. I told him that I am working far too hard for minimum wage. The constant time pressure and being yelled at and called names by my chef was having a negative impact on my mental health. This job is not my life, nor is it my career, and I'm not willing to sacrifice my health over it. He then went on a rant about how my generation has no work ethic, that I should be expected to suffer (for minimum wage) if I ever wanted to be successful, and good luck finding a job that pays more than we do. 3 days later I found a job that payed 4$/hour more than they did. 

I hate that companies suck the souls out of people just to make more money. That could have been an amazing job if they just cared for the well being of their employees. but I guess making 1% more money per year is more important than peoples lives. The priorities of some people are totally fucked. How can some people become so detached from reality and consumed by greed? I've had good jobs and bad jobs, this being the latter. But even in a good job, I just want out from this rat race. I'm not a lazy person.

So, I was working on getting resources for financial support while waiting for any news on my SSDI case(just waiting for a call from the Social Security Office), and got a call back from one of the local charities. When asked if I had a job, I said ""No, I'm waiting for my SSDI to get approved, I can't work"" the person on the other line said ""I'll send you some resources for work""

Now I'm just wondering if she misheard me or what, but that did not sit well with me. My mental health is so bad that, in capitalist terms, it interferes with my ability to work(it is actually vice versa, work fucks with my mental health so much I can't function well), yet they shove the whole work thing in my face.

892,Few thoughts and questions on the responsibilities of the individual in the world.,"There is this notion that goes un-interrogated quite often about the purchasing power of the individual somehow being ultimately responsible for finding and funding the solutions to all the macro complex systemic problems of the age. All the wrongs in the world, at your feet and yours alone.

Don't like sweatshops? Then don't buy at H&amp;M.Don't want battery hens to die in misery? Then switch to plant-based.Don't like your carbon footprint? Then buy solar panels, etc.

Those things definitely matter, they really do. That is how cultures change - very slowly, and through the habits of discreet individuals.

But is the onus really entirely on you to fix the world? Through your wallet, only expressed through thousands of little transactional increments at a time, hoping for change?

It's not the responsibility of the actual people directly manning the levers of industry and government? Not anyone in positions of authority in a board room or an elected office to just stand up and do their job one day?

Nope, apparently It's entirely yours and the only way you can express this is to petition these people with money and prayer, like they're a minor god, on the off chance that maybe mcdonalds will start stocking a vegan patty or some paltry shit.

So you're the input and if you're 'strong' enough they're the mechanism for getting you what you want? That's how it is? Does anyone looking around today really, truly believe that is what is happening here?

This is what billions of people believe they are reduced to and accept. Does that not frighten you some?

907,Lack of appreciation at work / productivity is all that matters.,"The company I work at pretty much exclusively cares about productivity and we are project based. Every single project my manager asks me if I can find ways to raise my productivity or do more in less time bla bla bla.

Every time I get the usual bullshit remarks like ""Colleague X did it once, why can't you?"" or ""It really isn't that much work, just do it and make some overtime."".   
You know what, she's right. I could do it. I could run so fast my legs would outpace my ass and do overtime and be stressed the whole time.  
It's unhealthy though and they don't pay me nearly enough to endure that.  I work in a laboratory and one tiny mistake can ruin a whole days work. So the more I have to run, the more likely I'm to miss some small detail and that gives me anxiety.   
I'm not going to get a goddamn burnout for this shit.    
Especially with our company being way over profit targets ALL the time.  
Like, fuck that shit. They make way more profit than they anticipated and they're still cracking the whip? They can go to hell. 

And when I make extra effort on my own, I've made a couple of python scripts that automate parts of the job such as processing data, instead of appreciation I get shit for it.    
I did those things on the easy days where my workload was relatively small.    
I've happily shared it with my colleagues and shown the managers. You know what they told me?

""Where did you find the time to make this?"" ""Why didn't you spend that time on more productivity instead?""  ""Why didn't you come to me when your planning was finished?"" 

And now they think that I have all this extra time on my hands and are demanding even more productivity from me. What the hell?

And during my evaluation they ignored my extra efforts and went straight for the mistakes I made. Even showing me a list of aaaall the things I did wrong, like forgetting a signature, failing to add a couple of reports bla bla bla bla. All insignificant paperwork crap that can be solved in 5 minutes.    
""You made too many mistakes so we cannot give you a higher raise this year.""

I'm fucking sick of it. Next time I make something that makes work easier I will keep it to myself and the time it saves me will be my extra break time. Why would I bust my ass for this fucking crap?",False,l0e2jd,NiceResolution5458,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/l0e2jd/lack_of_appreciation_at_work_productivity_is_all/,0,1
908,I'm tired and feeling pretty depressed,"English is not my first language, so please bear with me. This is my rant because I have no other place to get it off my chest

I'm from Brazil and I didn't know this subreddit until today. It's good to see that it's not only me that think that this work culture and the corporate world sucks so much.

I'm a ""privileged"" software developer working 44h+/week making 48k Reais / year, just for comparison, a brand new 2020 Toyota Corolla (the cheapest model) costs 100k Reais. I have a master's degree in Computer Science and many of my friends with the same experience are making much less than me and I can't complain with people around me because ""I'm privileged"".

I've joined my current company in January of the last year, i.e., 1 year working there. This is the worst job I ever had. During this year the company earned more money than ever, increasing revenue by approximately 60%, and at the same time, 30% of the workers resigned complaining about high pressure and high workload (the company started the year with 100 employees). Today I complained about high pressure and the manager just said to me that they will hire more people and after they do this I'll probably stop feeling it. The problem is that the first person of these 30 people that resigned complained about it as well, so it doesn't matter how many workers there are, this high pressure is part of the company's culture. One of these people was earning 84k Reais/year and now that he left they are trying to find someone to replace him for 156k Reais/year. So they were basically paying him half of what he did to work more than 50 hours per week.

Before this job, I've worked for a company that has almost no pressure and with a better work-life balance, but only earning 31k Reais/year. Some ex-coworkers said to me that the salary has increased and considering that I'm f\*\*d I thought: ""maybe I could go back there with the same salary I'm earning now but with less pressure"".  Last month this old employer asked me if I wanted to come back and I said no. But now I'm considering accepting this request. I've messaged him today and he asked me how much I was thinking and I said 60k/year, but considering that now I've finished my master's degree and have more experience I thought it was fair. I also know that my ex-coworker that doesn't have as much experience as me and doesn't have a master's degree is earning 56k Reais there. So what he said to me is that he would see the ""step"" and the ""salary"" that was available and talk to me later, but he thought it is a little less than 60k/year.  He also said that they are ""increasing the pace"" there, so the pace is not the same as before. I think it will be much better than my current company or maybe it's a red flag. I'm just tired of this sh\*\*. He even said to me that if the company goes well and I'm being productive I can earn more in the future. WTF man, this company probably makes more than 50M/year in PROFIT.

I hate everything about this corporate world. You can't be sick, can't work less, can't have a bad day,  can't say anything wrong because your manager could not like.

But now that I’ve been on it for a good while, i still don’t really wanna live. Sometimes I think if I could just curl up into a ball until they locked me in a mental asylum, that would be okay.

So how the heck are all those tech, online services, financial services, pharmaceutical companies having record high stock prices? How is the market still doing so well? How are these companies reporting such good earnings?

Heck even a company like Walmart increased its stock price significantly and reported good earnings.

Get real. Poor people in the millions to billions are suffering. But the elites couldn't give a shit.

Do you think Elon Musk, Bezos or Bill Gates are crying right now as their net worth reaches record high?

Its really fucked up. They say the economy sucks ass and use it as an excuse to say why we have to accept now is shitty. Why we have to accept paycuts and shitty conditions or get fired. But it doesn't seem to apply to the elites with their record earnings and bonuses.

Even during a disaster like Covid, poor people suffer but the elites don't. In fact in this case the elites are far better off than ever. And you think they can understand our pain?

936,"Are we ""finding a way out"" or writing on the prison wall?","Title. I've joined a lot of leftist and anti-work communities because I want wage labor abolished as quickly as possible. Obviously everyone who has tried so far to do so, where wage labor has existed, has failed to abolish it. That said, many, many strides in human rights were gained in exchange.

That brings me to this question. Is this community for helping people free themselves from the obligations of work? Or is it for comfort when we're all in chains? If it's for the first, just point me where I need to go and I'll happily assist. If it's for the second, I understand, but I'm frustrated by that.

937,"Has anyone had the “my workload is too unmanageable, something has to change” talk with their boss and how did it go?","TL;DR sorry for the rant, basically same as anyone else in the US, overworked. 

To preface, I work for state government and an union covered so it is not easy at all to get fired but you can be put on work plans, etc. to get onto the level expected if you. It’s a small unit. 4/7 of my job duties fall short at all times because there’s just not enough time in the day and there’s too much work it isn’t possible. The pandemic didn’t help and we are months backlogged and still struggling to telework 50% of the time in a heavily paper and mail based environment.

For 10 months it’s been a promise of “it’ll get better” but it hasn’t. I get screamed at by parents multiple times a week. I feel like a failure. I can’t get enough done which now has made me lazy on my telework days and I just stare at my screen helplessly for two hours before I even start working.

I have too many job duties but the two lower level employees recently hired have already caught up on all they can do and have been doing busy work for another division for a month now. It isn’t easy to rewrite job descriptions. Months of auditing and HR paperwork and they wouldn’t even agree to it to begin with.

My old job was stressful but taking this promotion was not worth the 5k raise. It’s always “I know you have so much on your plate it’s okay if you have to drop the ball on XYZ job duty this week” and then next week another supervisor says “you can’t let this fall off the priority list”. I’m at my wits end. I know my one year review is coming up soon and I dread it.

Started making moves to hopefully be self employed in a year doing something I like. Just gotta survive until then..but the benefits and stable pay feels too good to leave. When jobs reopen I’ll probably try to transfer but I feel so stable here because I at least know the job well.",False,l1a0lf,bumblebe86,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/l1a0lf/has_anyone_had_the_my_workload_is_too/,6,1

We push to save an economy that should have been left to die, because it's taking us into social and climate collapse. We push to save people who rob us from our labour constantly, pay us less every year, and seek to reduce our rights at every turn. We compensate this psychopathic behavior with abundance and power, because we lack imagination and power ourselves and have already fallen into the ""job creation"" trap.

We could be doing so much better. We have so much productivity it's insane, yet we still can't feed, house, guarantee a decent existence for everyone. It's not even a problem of money, we have more than enough everywhere, it's a systemic problem, and now these sociopaths are not even investing into labour, so that unemployment and inequality rises. The stock market, the housing bubble, all ways to make quick money, because to make profit is the only thing that matters, their thrist for control and capital never stops. Yet, we are the crazy ones, not them, who are driving humanity towards collapse, but us, who ask the right questions and csrry the burden to become a slave or live miserable.

I'm so tired. It feels like a losing battle day to day.

Do market research on the job title you are applying for, have a printout of an average job description and pay scale, and compare it to what they're offering. obviously it could be off-putting if you get too intense about it, but there is no harm in doing research and advocating for yourself.

if you are chronically underpaid and you don't feel comfortable advocating for yourself in that way, your only option to break out of the cycle of underpayment may be to do the research ahead of time and give them a plausibly inflated rate of pay for your last job. It's dishonest, but you need to break that cycle!

I suspect that hiring managers would feel uncomfortable flat out asking a past employer about someone's rate of pay, unless it seemed suspicious. they mostly want to know that you exist and weren't a known thief, addict, sexual predator or psychopath (depending on the job)

Disagree with this, if the motivation for someone to click

the world about your company mission, your culture and
how you give the opportunity to shine to everyone.

Even if you put salaries on there, the best talent are
going to the firms that do showcase their mission and
culture.

Obviously the salary becomes part of an initial screening
call so really not much time should be lost. In my
experience, clients will work their packages for the
best talent and the best talent will have some flex for the
best role - this wouldn't happen if you put a salary on an
avert.

Salary is of course a consideration but pretty low down
in employee engagement.

After school, he somehow ended up in ultrasound. It was very new at the time so there weren’t any 2-year programs for it—he learned on the job. Fast forward 40 years...he is miserable. His job has turned him into a completely different person. My entire life, I feel like 90% of our conversations are about how much he hates working and how stressed he is. And 100% of our problems come from his work. For example, he’s an alcoholic (though he won’t admit it). He’s depressed, incredibly anxious, stressed all the time. He works on holidays. He takes call and has to go into work at 2 AM only to go back in at 7. 

He’s always said he wishes he could be an archaeologist, but he couldn’t go back to school at this point and the pay is far too low. Isn’t it terrible that we can’t do what we really want to do because of $$$? 

Anyways, for the last 40 years his life has been: wake up, work, get home late, answer calls from the hospital, go into work during the night if on call, repeat. &amp; now his time off is spent drinking. Sadly I have to set boundaries and cannot really interact much with him because of this. 

Today we had a really horrible falling out and it made me reflect on the way that work had completely changed him from a happy, laid-back, track-star jokester (as my mom would say), to an isolated, dishonest, grumpy, closed-off, moody, and sick (not in a mean way just being honest) person.

I have what one may call the ""perfect job"". Little hierarchical oversight, 100% remote which allows me to work from a small beachtown community in the Western US, paid 80k$ + benefits, and 7 weeks holidays every year (yes, I know). I choose my own hours and work basically whenever I want (still have to attend meetings etc.).   


Basically I don't see how I could fare better inside the system and I feel like I've hacked my way into the ultimate job. I never, ever complain to anyone because that would be so fucking insensitive to people who actually struggle financially and work long hours, having to be physically present at a job they hate.  


Yet, I really resent the insane pressure of a capitalist system on my shoulders. The need to manage, be managed, attend several meetings a day, constantly challenge my work and find new strategies, the fact that I have to pretend to agree to a set of values, smile during yearly reviews, be ""political"" inside the company, go to work and try to ace super ambitious objectives every week. 

&amp;#x200B;

Worst of all has to be staring at a screen for 8+ hours every day.

I feel like if I can't enjoy myself in these super golden conditions I'll just never enjoy work at all, unless I create my own or do something radically different that does not involve being trapped inside a computer until I retire.

994,Engagement of BIPOC: is using the term wage slave hurting more then it helps?,"My main concern here is how to engage BIPOC in the cause, not to discredit or minimize the pain and suffering endured by those under in capatilism...

I think that by using the term wage slave in present day america it encourages the listener/reader to compare it directly to the atrocities of american chattel slavery, and as a result people will want to focus on the differences between the two and take a stance on which is/was worse and this is completely unnecessary. And this can even extend to ""ranking"" oppression based on race v class, encouraging people to take sides and encouraging people to ignore how they are intertwined.

And if the comparison is involved, but the differences between the two are not dicussed
It will only disenfranchise and disengage BIPOC. 

If anything the differences speak more to how american chattel slavery went above and beyond the minimum threshold of what is required for something to be considered slavery. It reached into genocide, eugenics, forced medical expermination, physical torture, rape, stealing children and the dehumanization of people into literal animals.  I understand that some of these things happen under modern-day wage slavery, but it's akin the difference between coercion and duress, abuse and neglect, first-degree and second-degree murder. They're both awful and often the results are the same, but they are different. And there is no need to compare the two when each are individually reprehensible on their own merits.

1002,Giant Space Rocks,"Interstellar objects pass freely through a star system.

What should be done?

Developing a system to protect a planet from a collision should be the top priority for any civilization. This planetary protection system would require both detection and defensive capabilities in order to be effective.

Once a civilization has developed their planetary protection system, pursuing other goals becomes practical and desirable, such as space exploration, the search for other forms of life, etc.

*But what happened here on Earth?*

As soon as our ancestors developed an understanding of impact craters - which are clearly visible on the surface of Earth and especially on the Moon - they should have immediately recognized the threat of extinction and began planning a solution. So where is our planetary protection system?

*How did the conversations go?*

""Giant space rocks have hit the planet and killed most living things,"" said the person observing an impact crater.

""Yes, but, what about those people with different skin color? What about those people who worship different imaginary beings? What about those people who speak different languages? What about those people who govern differently?"" said almost everyone else.

""Giant space rocks *will* hit the planet *and* kill most living things,"" the crater-observer clarified.

""Yes, but what about controlling people? Controlling their appearances, hairstyles, clothing, and what they do with their genitalia? Controlling their beliefs, their hopes, their dreams? Controlling what they consume? And what about all the punishments? We need to punish people in order to control them,"" the masses clamored back at the crater-observer.

""None of that (all those bad ideas) will matter when a giant space rock hits the planet and kills most living things,"" the crater-know-it-all said.

""That crater looks really old. The planet doesn't get hit very often. We've probably got plenty of time. It won't be too bad. I've never met anyone that went extinct,"" humanity's near-consensus sang out in unison.

""All life as we know it will come to an end,"" the human-skeptic warned.

""Let's talk about money and how much it's going to cost. Giant space rocks are expensive. The damage they do *sounds* expensive. Can we really afford to spend money dealing with giant space rocks? What about the economy? What about the stock market? How will we fund this giant space rock program? Which social services should we cut from the budget?"" said a nation's government, the one best-equipped to deal with giant space rocks.

""We should devote all of our resources and efforts toward saving the planet. It's the only planet we have at the moment,"" the crater-propagandist opined.

""This planet is disposable! And so is the human race, because our brains cannot understand priorities. We forgot that our planet is our first priority. Instead we became obsessed with the concept of governance, obsessed with controlling human behavior, so we created these labyrinthine systems of laws and customs,"" the human conscience grumbled from its coffin, its raspy voice escaping as the hammer of capitalism took aim at the final nail, a nail forged from the skeletons of logic and reason.

""Imagine an alien planet,"" the crater-preacher proselytized. ""We, the human race, observe the aliens living on their planet happily doing their alien activities. One day, we notice a giant space rock hurdling toward the happy alien planet. To our surprise, rather than do anything about it, the happy aliens just keep going about their routine, busily conducting their alien business, practicing their alien traditions and so on. As the giant space rock gets closer, they start eating alien cakes.""

""How silly! Why would the aliens eat cake instead of blasting away that giant space rock?"" the dying breath of humanity chuckled.

""Because they *like* cake,"" the crater-fanatic proclaimed. ""The aliens enjoy cake and that's all they know. Their whole existence revolves around pursuing the things they enjoy, and their entire alien culture was designed to prioritize consumption.""

""So what happened to them? Did the aliens just eat cake all the way until the end?"" the ghost of humanity asked, wiping away the royal icing and belching methane into the atmosphere.

\*\*\*

We know giant space rocks enter the atmosphere. I've seen first-hand evidence of their treachery. I've visited their impact craters and watched those demons streak across the sky, both in person and through electronic representations of them. I also know I'm not the first to understand a little about their evil, world-ending quirkiness.

So it was a bit of a shock when I, as a child, started learning about our priorities on this planet. You see, we teach children *everything else* is of utmost concern, except giant space rocks. Sure, the GSRs could be mentioned at some point in a science class (if science education is available to the fortunate child), but they are certainly not prioritized ahead of everything else. And if they are actually ever taught, GSRs seem to only feature in relation to the dinosaurs.

Humans like dinosaurs. They like them so much they want to go extinct like them.

Is it an issue of time? It happened too long ago? It won't happen again in my lifetime?

Then I say, ""Tunguska"", and every near-miss since.

At around the same time I learned about the dinosaurs, I was also informed of a new version of mail that would replace traditional postal mail in the future. A good idea, I thought at the time, and I couldn't wait for the electronic version to take over so we could finally bring an end to the era of the papyrus scroll.

But, no, we decided to cling to bad ideas like we've clung to the papyrus scroll era. The disregard for our own survival is a death-wish, actually, and it thrives in all aspects of human endeavors outside of the science to stop GSRs. Surely, once humans developed an understanding of the cosmos and the threat of giant space rocks, they must have also had the potential to *at least* start preparing a plan? Is it still an issue of technological limitations?

Tycoons could have done more. The industrial magnates of the modern era could have focused on our survival, especially the ones dabbling in natural resources, but they chose to exploit an injured and dying planet rather than try to save it. Short-term thinking, for industrialists and for the human race. They could have become famous for building humanity's giant space rock defense system, humanity's *planetary* *survival system*, but instead they chose to build automobiles and railroads and sell products and trade resources and ...

Why are more people not upset about tycoons destroying the planet instead of saving it? We should have already had a head start on solving the giant space rock problem. And it is a huge problem, and always will be until we either build the planetary defense system or follow the dinosaurs. It is a problem that will *never* go away.

But we procrastinate. If the news broke that a planet-killing space rock would hit us in a century, I imagine several tycoons would get to work today saving the planet (or at least start developing actionable plans for the next generation). They might see it as an opportunity to exploit the burgeoning industry of space industrialization and colonization, but I suspect some minor progress would be made toward building a solution.

(It will most definitely need to be built, whatever the giant space rock defense system may ultimately turn out to be, and it will require abundant resources, technology, and engineering on a scale never attempted before. The ""device"", or whatever will actually redirect the giant space rocks away from the planet, will be the most important human technological development of all time, perhaps even the final product of the earth-based human era, whether we survive or not. So what are we waiting for?)

However, if the news broke that a GSR would strike in several millennia, I doubt much would change from our current state of inaction. We have plenty of time, they would say, since no one currently alive will need to worry about it. That's what we do: act like we have plenty of time.

But without a perfect detection system in place (able to detect all objects over a certain size at a certain distance), time is an unknown variable. It would be a good idea to proceed as if we have limited time to defend the planet because, *actually*, we have limited time to defend the planet. Everything is limited for humans, in our current state of existence. Limited time, limited resources, limited intelligence. We're down to just one single habitable planet (not that we ever had or deserved more than one), and we act as if everything is *un*\-limited.

Humans feel the same way about our closest star. ""Oh, sure, it'll blow up one day, but that's too far in the future for me to care about. Let's go back to hurting each other and fighting over nothing while we exploit our only home."" Exploding stars and giant space rocks are not part of the current human agenda, but there may be more interest in the future, one can never truly know for sure what ideas may captivate the masses.

Survival became too easy and commonplace for certain groups. Those groups became so successful at the game of resource acquisition that they also became lazy and forgot about the difficulties of planetary survival. Their forgetfulness and complacency lulled them into a false sense of security. Belief in an afterlife didn't help.

I often return to this idea of giant space rocks whenever life seems absurd, because nothing is more absurd than humanity continuing without a planetary defense system. Are other analogies helpful?

For those still living in the *Wild-West*: imagine an infinite number of bullets being fired at your home from all directions, for the entire time that your home exists. You'll never know when a bullet will hit you, and it could the size of a .22 or .50 BMG. It could even be the size of a cannonball and kill everyone in your home, since huge caliber ammunition has killed almost all of the previous inhabitants.

Would you try to detect the bullets before they hit your home? Knowing about the bullet may be helpful, especially where and when the bullet will hit, and whether it will be a flesh wound or a bull's eye.

Would you try to stop the bullets in some way? Preventing the bullets from hitting your home will help you and your family survive.

(""Wild-Westerners"" respond: 'Your analogy means everyone on Earth is my family, and I'm not entirely comfortable with that. In fact, I'm downright offended. Are you even legal in this country? You-people are the reason I carry guns.')

Does anyone else need an analogy?

\*\*\*

How grotesque and absurd is it that we don't already have a planetary defense system? How is it not a global human effort to stop the giant space rocks from killing us all? Find any headline from the news and re-contextualize it by adding ""... and in other news, another giant world-killer was successfully diverted, humanity will continue after all.""

Our little stupid priorities. Our stupid money. Our stupid governments. Our stupid religions. We're so accustomed to killing people ourselves we can't fathom a real entity that will do it for us. Instead we invent imaginary beings who exterminate humanity with silly floods (and other things that frightened ancient people). But while stupid people made up their silly stories, the real humanity-killer was always out there, on its course, careening through space and time, a speeding bullet with our name on it.

Who wouldn't want to contribute to the global human effort to save the planet? Anti-globalists? If an extinction-hungry space rock has us in its sights, is there another job someone would rather do?

""You guys can go stop the planet-killer. I'm fine staying here, sticking with the wage-slaving. People gotta eat, you know, while the giant space rock is being diverted.""

Sure, yes, life and commerce would continue in some form while humanity dealt with the GSRs, but how long would capitalism and the labor-consumption cycle persist after humanity successful dodged a space bullet?

Cynics, and perhaps everyone, would say profiteering would be commonplace after a near-apocalypse, with industries and commercial interests taking over the maintenance of the planetary defense program. Others would say the militarization of the space defensive system is inevitable.

*I say the threat of a giant space rock would cancel capitalism.*

Would an industry or an individual business refuse to supply the anti-GSR effort? How would that play out on Earth?

If the global effort to build a defense system against giant space rocks required, for example, an enormous amount of natural resources that were scarce on Earth, capitalistic interests would attempt to control and profit from the demand for those resources. If capitalists were allowed to do so, a scenario might occur where humanity could not afford to save itself.

Apologists would say it could never happen, that if the planetary defense system truly needed a specific resource to be successful, then the people who control that resource would acquiesce and ""donate"" it to save humanity, instead of demanding payment. Why should we assume capitalists will resort to charity when the world is about to end? Do we want to take that chance, that Mr Moneybags Tycoon will give away his resources for free?

Tell me how a stubborn individual - who happens to control a rare commodity and also wants to watch the world burn - will be convinced to donate their resources to the global protection effort? Or a rogue nation that is the sole producer of a specific resource - how will they be convinced?

Capitalism allows resources to be controlled by individuals. It also allows and in many ways encourages the hoarding of resources. What are we to do if the planetary defense system requires a rare element and only one individual (or corporation or nation-state) owns the lot of it? Sorry, world, we can't afford to buy the last bit of pure promethium off the Florida-man hoarding it. I guess we can't finish building Earth's Meteor Defender.

If not promethium, then some other element. For historical reference, think of it as oil, or diamonds, or gold, or spices, or any of the other multitude of *possessions* humans have killed each other over. We are experts at fighting and killing each other for resources. Perhaps that will be the plan? To negate capitalism and simply exterminate those hoarding the elements and utilize them on the planetary defense system? Does property still exist when the world is about to end?

It is entirely a possibility that humanity will continue to produce individuals who will encourage our own extinction. Will capitalism become associated with suicidal tendencies in the future? Is anything more misanthropic than our *labor-consumption cycle*?

I imagine a tycoon sitting on his golden throne, watching the world burn because we couldn't afford his fancy space lasers. Or more realistically, perhaps he's watching Earth burn from the comfort of another planet, or moon, or space craft, because NASA couldn't afford his SRCT (space rock capture technology). Perhaps that will be the philosophy of the future space tycoons: exploit the planet of its resources to ensure *their own* survival, while simultaneously bringing about the extinction of everyone else. Perhaps the future planet-killers will actually be just resource-hungry space tycoons, sailing from planet to planet, stripping them of resources and bombarding them with space rocks on their way out. Who needs evil aliens?

Can we afford to save the planet? The question itself is absurd, yet how many people read it with a straight face? Let's examine the costs.

Giant space rocks are located in the void, so our technology will have to travel in the void as well, but luckily we have experience in that arena. We know the rockets in the Apollo program used several tons of fuel *per second* to achieve escape velocity and reach orbit. Now, taking into consideration the duration of the flight, the weight of the payload and the cost of kerosene, we can calculate the enormous cost with an average of twenty tons per second and ... See how easy it is to become absurd under capitalism? To begin saving the planet, we would need to calculate the cost of fuel!

Is saving the planet too expensive? Is there a more complicated question that capitalism *cannot* answer? What are our alternatives?

*Start sharing resources now, so when our survival truly depends on it, we'll be ready to pool everything together and succeed.*

I don't believe a single space agency is capable of building and maintaining the planetary defense system, and even a collaboration of agencies may not be enough. Private business interests may surpass and dominate government space programs, but this is an even worse idea than allowing capitalism to exist in lieu of a planetary defense system. Can you imagine a hostile space corporation allowing a small space rock to hit their competitor's headquarters?

Or one nation's space program letting a few village-killers land in their enemy's territory? Not every country will be able to contribute financially (or at all) to the planetary defense program, so perhaps we should let them get wiped out by a tiny meteor? Cut out the middlemen between the resources buried in their ground and the planetary defense system in orbit above them. They were just getting in the way. And then the mind wanders to the other side of the equation and ponders the concept of using space rocks as offensive weapons ... no human would consider such a thing? That's not in our immediate future, right?

What are we going to do? Who has a better plan than what were currently doing (which seems like almost nothing)? Will we just keep killing each other arbitrarily over nothing until we all get wiped out ourselves?

*'Oumuamua.*

All of these interstellar objects that seem to just magically appear in the vicinity of Earth need to stop. And by vicinity, I mean within any distance of our star where the object can be given a name by the media. The speculation about where they originate is neat and everything, but the fact that they zip through here in the first place should have alarmed everyone into action.

Oh, look, another mysterious interstellar visitor we knew nothing about! Hey, wait, it's already left our star system? It's moving that fast? Came out of nowhere! Barely knew it passed through! More importantly, what are we going to name it?

Wild-Westerners, imagine a bullet whizzing past a person, but instead of trying to figure out who shot at them, they're more concerned with everything else they falsely believe is a priority. Hey, buddy, there are many more space bullets on the way, so you better stop what you're doing and figure it out before its too late.

As a child, I assumed adulthood meant working on the planetary defense system, in some capacity or another, perhaps employed in the electronic post office, delivering electronic mail to the meteor-hunting robots in space. But, no, let's not get ahead of ourselves! The papyrus scroll tech *was* a good idea, right?

Good ideas are the most limited resource on a planet without a defense system.

Just think of all the things we prioritize instead of the safety of our planet. How are we not overwhelmed by our collective shame?

\*\*\*

Perhaps it's too late for humanity to change its course, so I like to imagine plans for other emerging civilizations who might fare better than we did. What would this plan look like?

First, before you do anything else, develop the technology to defend your planet from giant space rock impacts. Keep your planet clean until you can find another one, which leads to the second part of the plan: find another planet (or moon, or figure out how to live permanently in space). All of this requires resources, so make sure you've *optimized* your utilization and *allocation* of those resources (see the first step: keeping your planet clean).

By all means, don't waste resources and, whatever you do, don't allow anyone to hoard them. Don't let the idea of ""ownership"" or ""property"" evolve on your planet. If capitalistic ideas do take hold in your civilization, find a way to educate your people and move past that stage of greed and selfishness (it is merely a phase of early development of civilizations). Constantly remind everyone of the giant space rocks looming above. Giant space rocks!

Every time a person says something belongs to them, correct them by gently informing them of the needs of the planetary defense system. We may need that particular resource to save the planet, so it cannot *belong* to you personally. Property is a myth ... when a giant space rock is going to end life as we know it.

Ask a capitalist, ""Who owns the giant space rock that will exterminate the human race?"" An absurd question, you may think, as it's just a lump of detritus floating in space. But at the same time, humans claim ownership of this lump of detritus floating in space that we call home. We believe we *possess* something when, in fact, it is the other way around: the planet possesses us and we are most certainly its temporary, disposable possessions. We are beholden to the planet - it owns us. We are the planet's servants until we can become its custodians.

Until we reach a different realm of existence (if that's even possible), there are no other decent alternatives to having a place to live, whether it's on a planet, moon, space station or spacecraft. We are delusional and falsely believe we still have options or time.

You can't ask the dinosaurs what is more important than the threat of giant space rocks, but you can ask yourself: What have I done to protect humanity from giant space rocks?

\*\*\*

Imagine, if you will, Mr Moneybags Tycoon, with his infinite wisdom and bottomless coffers, proceeding to undertake the business of saving the planet from the giant space rocks. He uses his own business to facilitate the construction of the detection system in orbit, utilizing corporate partnerships in various industries to supply the materials and labor. For the defensive component, he partners with the military of certain governments (but not others). The planet is saved by his business ... but what happens after that? Is his business accused of monopolization? Is the tycoon himself deified? Is there any dimension in the multiverse where this actually happens?

I suspect there is not. It seems logical to me that giant space rocks exterminate most civilizations in the universe, especially the civilizations stuck in the labor-consumption cycle. Perhaps most civilizations never progress beyond that stage, the era when they thought they had the *luxury to choose* to ignore the threat. Perhaps the labor-consumption cycle is the greatest filter.

Suppose they are not such a big deal, these giant space rocks, and dealing with them is actually easier than we think. The technology may be less resource-demanding than we assume in our doomsday, worst-case scenarios. But as I type these words, there is not a single thing happening in the entire world that convinces me people are ready to undertake *any* of this. The senseless deaths during an avoidable pandemic are just an example of how ill-prepared governments and humanity in general will be when dealing with the magnitude of giant space rocks.

Giant space rocks? We couldn't handle face masks.

The extinction of the human race? We executed people during a global pandemic. (Instead of executing people, why not declare them ""essential workers"" and sacrifice them that way?)

We are simply not ready. Half of a country joined an anti-reality, fascist death-cult during a global pandemic. Some of them even died *still in denial* of what was killing them ...

""Giant space rocks are an alien hoax.""

""Less than one percent of civilizations get struck by giant space rocks. Young civilizations are immune from giant space rocks.""

""I don't trust your planetary defense vaccine, it's unnatural. The atmosphere has enough natural immunity from giant space rocks.""

""We believe these two things simultaneously: 1) the planetary defense system will suffocate us and, 2) giant space rocks will pass right through the planetary defense system. So what's the point? Clearly alien mind control propaganda, right?""

Never forget: Many millions of people voted against their own interests, like healthcare during a pandemic. These same people would vote to dismantle the planetary defense system if they could, something that (like healthcare) is in everyone's interest, always.

What are your priorities? How will your life change when they discover a giant space rock will strike the planet during your lifetime? In ten years? In five? Next week? Tomorrow?

What will our excuses be? We were busy? We had other priorities?

They love to refer to certain eras and the people from those eras as ""great"" generations, but what will they call the generation that builds the first planetary defense system? The generation that actually saves the planet?

Some people ponder the ""reason"" or ""purpose"" or ""meaning"" of life. Those people could use a job working for the global effort to develop our planetary defense system! Once that's taken care of, they may experience a brief lull in their quest for meaning but, I can assure you, finding another habitable planet will be a top priority for every future generation. Why? Because that's the other ""meaning"" they are searching for ... *finding other forms of life in the universe*.

Yes, another great, long-term goal after surviving the giant space rocks is obviously to find other life forms in the universe. Need more reason? More purpose? Figuring out why most of the universe is invisible to us is another great long-term goal. Surely, we must pursue an understanding of dark matter and dark energy. Advanced civilizations will have answers for most of our questions. What else does anyone need to know?

Surviving giant space rocks, leaving Earth and finding other civilizations (or their compendiums) to teach us about dark matter and dark energy are admirable and achievable goals for humanity.

But who actually supports giant space rocks in their quest to destroy us?

Bad Ideas: Religion (science denialism, the spreading of delusions).

Capitalism (in all its forms, valuing property and commerce over human life).

Politics (the death-cults, the obsession with governance and control, the perpetuation of the labor-consumption cycle).

Please join me in redirecting humanity's priorities toward creating a planetary defense system. It is how we save the planet from ...

Giant. Space. Rocks.

2020 was a rough year for a lot of us. Hell let's just say it's been a rough life. Nothing seems fair, everything works backwards, and the only logical option to win this game we play is to kill yourself when you turn 18! 

What the hell is this world that we live in driven by money. We grow up with these crazy ideas about how amazing the world is, but as we age and experience things we see that all this really is just a fantasy.  The fantasy of another man's creation who really wants this thing to be this way, and hey there's money to be made doing it! So another man goes and gets a whole bunch of money to turn that into a whole bunch more money, and business owner needs your help to make that happen. 

You're told that you can make some really good money, but when does it ever feel good? It's always a struggle and previous generations keep telling you that this is good. 

I'm tired of point systems, cheap flimsy vests designed for ""safety"", production quotas, and most of all I'm tired of working away my 20's with nothing to show for it, in the name of preserving the system in place.

I left uni and went straight into working retail for 2 years in a sales position. That was boring and unfulfilling (to be expected).

Then I was made redundant from the first lockdown and I was off work for 2 months. Total Bliss. 

Then I was running out of money and needed a job to pay bills and eat food, so I got a job as an accountant. Eh, sounds good on paper but very boring and day was mostly spent staring out the window.

Was made redundant from there in second lockdown and had another month off. Total bliss again, I could do my hobbies.

Now I work from home for a call centre. Another arguable worse job title along with retail and burger flipping.

This is a rollercoaster. I've begun taking the first steps to remove myself from my 8-5 work day by using my skills as a video editor to go freelance, but it all takes time unfortunately.

I want to spend the next six months preparing to finish two more years to get my Bachelors, but if I quit working I won’t have enough money to cover my first year’s tuition (out of state school, yay!) 

I just feel so angry with the fact that I spent five years getting an Associates and working overnight at Walmart to now work 50-60 hour weeks, 10 hours a day, not being allowed to sit, and using outdated equipment to produce sub-standard and utterly rigged, half-ass products, for only 2.62 more an hour!

Also the bank is supposed to be ""socially conscious"" and progressive meanwhile they appear to be driving their employees like cattle at least from what I see.

This culture seems to have gotten him so much that even when his gf who has a high paying job and much less hours came into our lives, and offered to help with his debts/bills, my dad feels wrong for being a ""mooch"" like goddamn.

1044,Modern jobs and management are an absolute joke.,"I recently started a new job because my old one was *the worst* - maybe one day I'll make a post about how much of a joke that was. Y'all will love it. They made me work while I had Corona, refused to pay me, and regularly guilted me into doing illegal shit.

Just started at this new place and they have all sorts of unnecessary policies that scream ""we don't trust our employees"". You have to log in to this monitoring software at the start of your shift, when you go on lunch you have to set up your monitoring bs to show ""lunch"" - just this morning I was about three minutes late logging in and my manager called me on my mobile asking why I wasn't working yet (monitoring software had frozen on startup). Every day there's some mention from the manager about this that's phrased as a joke - ""we're watching you so don't run away from your desk!"" They repeatedly say they can't wait until everyone is working in the office so they can keep an eye on them, giving me babysitter vibes.

The icing on the cake was about two weeks ago. Everyone is working from home, which some people love and some people hate. I don't mind it too much - it's mentally exhausting, but not the worst thing in the world. For other people that have kids it can obviously be *horrible*, especially those that have to answer the phone and deal with customers 8 hours a day. Management said in the weekly meeting that they were no longer going to allow people with kids liberties on their tracking software, and that they can't keep taking twenty/thirty minute breaks in the afternoon to handle the kids. If they did, this would be reflected in their performance reviews and they could suffer HR meetings or pay freezes.
I hated this. There are only two people with kids on the team, and targeting them like that for having **reasonable problems with their children while everyone is home during a pandemic** in front of everyone made me feel filthy.

The job is advertised as ""flexible working hours"" - as in, you can start and finish any time you like between set hours provided you hit your 40 hours a week. I thought this was great - my job is very data heavy and not dependent on other people being around, so I thought I could essentially work from 8AM to 7PM two or three days a week and finish earlier on Friday (provided I had finished everything I need to do), or take an early finish one day to run errands and catch up later in the week. The managers made this very clear on day one that this isn't the case: I start any time before 9 and finish any time after 4:30, but I **have** to work at least 7 and a half hours every day, and hit that 40 hours every week. How does that help me? How is that flexible? 
Oh, and management is also fishing for people to work overtime, but won't offer anything other than the standard hourly rate. For context, every other job I've worked in has offered at least 1.5x pay for working nights and weekends (and from the sounds of it, lots of other people I work with hold this standard too). Fucking hell, I got 2.5x pay working bank holidays, Christmas Eve, and NYE working in a shitty independent restaurant when I was 18.

I recently offered to handle some data management for my team (if you can call it that) as everyone seems pretty computer illiterate. The task was basically to move data from an old server up to a new cloud server so it could be accessed across the board by everyone in our organisation. It was basically a drag and drop process but took like two days, mostly because I had to fight for the permissions to access the right folders, but I eventually got the data over and let my manager know that the job was done and the procedure could be rolled out to the rest of the team. I didn't get a thank you or even an acknowledgement of ""oh you finished that thing"": instead, I was asked if I could build a database for some other task other people were struggling with. I don't want a medal, but a thank you for something that everyone else seemed incapable of doing would have been pleasant.

I was already disillusioned with the corporate life before I came here. My best case scenario is to work in a field I love, but COVID makes new jobs so tough to find, and don't see that instantaneously changing post-covid. 
My frustration is that I show up, I do my job, I don't cause problems and I don't bring problems to management unless I can't solve them. I have gone beyond my job role multiple times and my two performance reviews I've had so far are marked at 100%. I still feel like managers don't trust me and won't leave me alone despite my on-point performance. Adults can do their jobs *gasp* without someone breathing down their necks.

It's also been a shitty week for me for other reasons, but I really needed to get this off my chest here. It's hard when everyone is locked away and there's nobody around.",False,kzt1wz,nahtn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kzt1wz/modern_jobs_and_management_are_an_absolute_joke/,6,1

1046,You’re just making excuses!,"This phrase is the bane of my existence. It’s why I’m so terrified to call out sick or for a family emergency or really any valid excuse to call out of work. Even during the Covid-19 pandemic where it’s 100% selfish to go to work when you are sick, I’m just always so scared of what my bosses reaction would be, or worse what my family and friends reaction would be if they found out. My hands literally shake when dialing the number. 

I know I’m being a bit irrational but I feel I do have valid justifications for my fear. I remember once after a long 9.5 hour shift I casually said to a co-worker “whew, I’m tired. I’m ready to go home” and he barked back at me “stop complaining! I’ve been working over 120+ hours per week for years to provide for my wife and kids! I literally wake up eat, go to work, go to my other job, then sleep. So shut up!” 

So I guess what I want to ask you all is, how do you overcome this fear of people saying this to you, or worse, just not believing your legitimate reason for not going into work.",False,kyndbz,Truegamerdude,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kyndbz/youre_just_making_excuses/,12,2

[Calculations need to be made based on his data, which already takes into account transfers and government services, but not taxes.](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/taxsimulator2.xlsx)

Calculations based on this underestimation of income at the top reveal that the Gini coefficient of income in the United States is over 0.525, even ignoring within-group income differences.

&amp;#x200B;

0.6+?

*Processing img 0aiop4rn3ub61...*

&gt;The key question is, to whom did this income from wealth accrue? We employ the 1989–2007 Surveys of Consumer Finances (SCF) to develop new estimates of “More Complete Income” (MCI), meaning income accrued from the ownership of wealth as well as labor income.

This approach still uses survey data and assumes that the poor and the rich have the same profit margin of their investments. It is well known that survey data always underestimates the income/wealth of the (ultra-rich)\*, not to mention the higher profit margin offered to the (ultra-)rich by tax havens home\*\* and abroad, insider trading and ""professional financial management services"".

\*[Looking for the missing rich: tracing the top tail of the wealth distribution](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10797-019-09578-1)

&gt;Based on our preferred specification, relying on national rich lists, we find the following: For Germany, the top wealth imputation leads to an increase of the top 1% wealth share from 24 to 34% in the first wave and from 24 to 35% in the second wave. For France (first wave) and Spain, we find smaller effects of the wealth imputation since rich households are better represented in the survey data. The Spanish top 1% wealth share increases by 8 (6) percentage points to 23% (22%) in the first (second) wave of the HFCS. In France, the top 1% wealth share increases from 18 to 25% in the first wave. In the second wave, however, the top 1% owns 31% of total wealth after the top wealth imputation, which is 12 percentage points more than in the original HFCS.

\*\*US is actually the bigger tax heaven for the ultra-rich. They have to store their money to avoid taxes before 1980 as well.

[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United\_States\_as\_a\_tax\_haven](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_as_a_tax_haven)

&gt;The United States has been popular as a destination for offshore funds for Chinese investors, said Canadian financial crimes expert Bill Majcher, because investors think it will resist pressure from China.\[5\] Andrew Penney from Rothschild &amp; Co described the US as ""effectively the biggest tax haven in the world""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The United States, which has for decades hosted vast stocks of financial and other wealth under conditions of considerable secrecy, has moved up from sixth to third place in our index. It is more of a cause for concern than any other individual country – because of both the size of its offshore sector, and also its rather recalcitrant attitude to international co-operation and reform. Though the U.S. has been a pioneer in defending itself from foreign secrecy jurisdictions, aggressively taking on the Swiss banking establishment and setting up its technically quite strong Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) – it provides little information in return to other countries, making it a formidable, harmful and irresponsible secrecy jurisdiction at both the Federal and state levels."" Tax Justice Network\[3\]\[4\]

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Mark Hays of Global Witness said ""the US is one of the easiest places to set up so-called anonymous shell companies"",\[2\] and Stefanie Ostfeld from the same organization said that ""the US is just as big a secrecy jurisdiction as so many of these Caribbean countries and Panama"".\[10\] More than 1.1 million live legal entities were incorporated in Delaware at the end of 2014. An increasing number – more than 70% – of those were LLC.\[11\] The Delaware Division of Corporations said in August 2015 that ""an LLC entices all types of people since it is easy to operate and oversee"", and Delaware is currently one of the few states without sales tax.\[12\] Delaware does not tax companies which operate there, nor their royalty income. However, the LLC is more popular and often less expensive in states such as Wyoming, Nevada and Oregon. Approximately 668,000 anonymous LLCs are registered just in those three states.\[11\]

The coworkers started to gossip amongst themselves being all pissed off like: “he said no?! How can he do that??”. They did not understand that you can say no.

I've hated working hard making a rich dude richer for as long as I can remember and so I recently started looking around for bank loans to start a workers co-op's. In my country, Sweden, there's a state finance thingy called Almi that gives loans to people wanting to start businesses. I want the co-op because the workers should reap the benefits, not shareholders, and only work MAX 6 hrs a day.

What is the equivalent in your country in terms of loan institutions?

1082,You should only take PTO if you can be productive at work during that time...,"I work a very high stress job in social services where l’art of our performance is measured by “client hours”, AKA the time we spend face to face with clients. Our many hours of paperwork, meetings, and collaboration with other organizations do not count toward this. 

I  had only used one of my PTO days during last year, so I took a week and a half off during Christmas and New Years. 

I come back from break with a request to meet with my manager who was concerned that my client hours took a dip at the end of 2020. I reminded her that I was on vacation and only used a half of the PTO days i accrued throughout the year (mind you I had gotten permission to take these days off months before the holidays).

The conversation was so frustratingly mind blowing.

Management: we are concerned about the decrease in client hours for the last two weeks of December. Reminder that they should be at 45% percent of total working hours.

Me: Yes, well my client hours of course went down to zero since I was not working...

Management: Of course we want you to use your PTO, you deserved that time off. But we are concerned about the lack of hours that were reported during that period. To average things out, we are suggesting the client hours increase for the next few weeks. 

Me: But...that means I would have to wake significantly more hours the next few weeks.

Management: I really hope you had time to practice self care over the break!

I never had a ""dream job"" growing up. I still can't answer what I want in 5 years, because if I'm honest it's be to be not existing. but over time I developed an ""ideal job"", which was doing something I'm somewhat alright at and interested in, good pay, and the ability to work remote so I wasn't locked down anywhere and didn't have the stress of a commute or being in an office or anything.

Well I've been here for a week. The job is pretty easy too. I'm not coding anything right now. It's with an agency and all I do is update website plugins and run speed tests and search engine result reports to send to the clients. 

I get paid $45k/yr to do this. I have the pay I want. I have a house now. I have nice cars for commuting, and every material thing I could need or the ability to save for it now. I've optimized my expenses to have $1.5k of expendable income every month with this new job. 

But nothing means anything and I'm still not happy. I still can't answer that question of what I want to do in life. It always changes. Some days I like working on my cars, others I love doing house renovations. Other times I like coding, and some days I hate it and wish I worked at the old pizza place I used to work at instead.

One of the most consistent questions I have been asked on my ""entry"" level jobs in retail is ""Can you lift 50 lbs over your head"" or something to a similar degree.

Ive had several jobs that had this requirement, and none of them required me to move even half of that over my head. It seems pretty clear to me that this is just a way to weed out disabled people by asking them a loaded question that would allow the company to pass over them without even looking at them.

For example, when I was working at (grocery store chain) we alternated between front-end and hauling carts. We had an absolutely tiny woman there, maybe five feet, and there was absolutely no way she was going to be able to lift 50 lbs over her head, she could barely carry a case of water.

1149,I wrote a poem. “The next time you want to work full time.”,"The next time you want to work full-time, remember these feelings. 


 
Remember feeling guilty because you had a bad mood at work, so you would tell people “I’m just a little tired,” but then you found yourself saying that every day, and then you’d come home from work and tell your girlfriend and your dog, “I’m just a little tired,” and then you found yourself saying that every day, and then you felt guilty for that, too.


 
 
The next time you want to work five days a week, remember these moments.


 
Remember checking your temperature every morning, hoping you had a fever, wishing you had Covid so you could have two weeks off. Remember hoping you would twist your ankle while teaching. Remember daydreaming you’d get in a car crash every time you took a taxi.


 
The next time your four-day weekend feels a little bit too long, remember your past self.


 
Remember your caffeine addiction. Your addiction to energy drinks, but then your heart started feeling weird, so you switched to buying coffee, but then it was too expensive, so you started making your own coffee, but then you started making too much and your pee was the wrong color and then eventually you were too tired to make your own coffee, and then you started buying coffee, but then it was too expensive, so you were addicted to energy drinks again, and your heart started feeling weird.


 
The next time you’re bored or unfulfilled, remember when you had less time.


 
Remember when you wanted to learn Final Fantasy songs on piano, so you bought a piano, and then you wanted to learn Mountain Goats songs on a ukulele, so you borrowed a ukulele, and then you never touched them.  Too tired. Too little time. Much better to spend every hour before bed watching the same people play Mario on YouTube every night.


 
The next time working five days a week sounds doable again, remember what it really means.


 
Remember spending your weekend lesson-planning, responding to homework, and writing assessments. Remember how territorial you were about your free time. Remember being mad at your girlfriend for scheduling a maid to clean the apartment during your precious weekend morning, or being mad at your dog for needing to go to the vet during your precious weekend afternoon, or being mad at your friend for wanting to hang out during your precious weekend evening.


 
 
The next time you think you’re a loser for not working hard enough, remember when you thought you were a loser who wasn’t working hard enough, but still worked five days a week. Remember when you lashed out. Remember when you embarrassed yourself and hurt others because you couldn’t handle it.

1155,"Efficiency, EFFICIENCY, EFFICIENCY!!! Thoughts on company all of a sudden scaling up.","I went from full-time, to being ""let go"" and rehired as a contractor for my job in which I applied for x position and due to my  ""skill set"" aka not being socially inept and working at a software development company was pushed into a more client facing role even though that's not what I wanted.

&amp;#x200B;

2 years later I now work 10 hours a week for them from home meeting prospective clients in what I would deem is a pointless fashion.

&amp;#x200B;

A few days ago we had a monthly meeting in which I attended. The company has gone from 10-12 staff over the last 5 years to all of a sudden 25 in the space of a few months. The director has hired a bunch of new more sales facing people as well as business analysts in order to triple the companies profit every year for the foreseeable future. He's a nice man but for someone who has always been about the client first,  changing to a profits first sort of mindset is strange and he seems to be hiding behind these analysts he's hired.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway in the meeting the entirety that we spoke about was what is the company and how do we become more efficient, because *apparently* if we're more efficient somehow everyone is happier? I did all I could to bite my tongue because, how is more efficiency beneficial for anyone but the employers? They twisted it in a way that if you're more efficient you'll have more time.. yes... time for more work. We spoke about how great the company culture is, and yes it's good but that's because we worked on a client first model and since that's changing and efficiency and profit is now the goal, how can that *not* have a negative impact on culture?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm ranting and apologise but has anyone else been through similar where the small cosy company you work for all of a sudden isn't happy with profit and wants MORE all of a sudden, goes through a period of rapid growth and kills the company culture?

&amp;#x200B;

I also feel like I'm being squeezed out and being a contractor will simply not be offered any more hours. I've worked there for 2 years being the face of the company, being reviewed, had my bosses talk to people about how I represent the company etc and everyone gave glowing reviews. However I didn't bring in a huge amount of work due to not pushing people into contracts + what we offer being a hugely niche and expensive offering. New sales guy comes in, twice my age, in your face I don't give a fuck type, and signs a few clients up quickly and basically says I'm shit at my job. This might be the case but it's not the job I ever wanted.

Some people attempt to make the case that making the rich richer leads to job creation but it simply doesn't, companies try to hire as few people as they can in reality.

Corporate America wants to squeeze every last ounce out of every employee they have. Our jobs would be better if there were adequate staff to assist with the demand, but NO. Instead, every company is trying to be as lean as possible. This is another reason why unemployment is higher - they will not hire enough people to do the work, they'd rather work their small staff like animals.

These companies could hire more people, lowering unemployment numbers, and they could make the workload more manageable by doing so. But they don't. THEY are the reason why we are all so miserable.

1227,Perspective of a 16-year-old,"For the past week, near all of my free time I have been engrossed in the reality of the world of corporate America, poverty, increasing unemployment, increasing job dissatisfaction, and the seeming impossibility of a healthy work-life balance. As someone who has never really worked a full 8 hour shift in their life, and whose parents don’t work up to as many hours as the typical 40, this reality is quite foreign and incredibly terrifying.

Of course I am a dumbass when it comes to the complexities of these topics (and any real world topics)

Just a list of some of my thoughts:

- A universal basic income is absolutely necessary. The fact that cost of living is so high that minimum wage workers often can’t get by is absolutely ridiculous to me. We should be provided basic needs and have to work for wants. 

- Rich people don’t have to be so rich. Like seriously? Why the fuck are they allowed to hoard so much? If we go off the (probably quite incorrect in many ways) data that Jeff Bezos makes about 9 million an hour, then that means he makes 600,000 more than his employees. He certainly hasn’t worked 600,000 harder than them.

- Office culture seems like cancer. 

- The average person shouldn’t have 5 8 hour shifts a week. From what I’ve heard that extra time is never needed. If science says that 32 hour work weeks make people more productive than 40 hour, why not do that and save money on office upkeep?

- The standards for hiring seem ridiculous. People used to be able to buy a house with a carpentry job from working straight after high school. Why are bachelors degrees considered so worthless?

- Life should be measured by happiness. The idea that more money equals more happiness is stupid. Though I would like to say that everyone can be happy even with poor financial situations, the fact that access to basic necessity isn’t always available can kill a person’s soul

- Hustle culture is so toxic and keeps the mindset that you have to impress other people to be happy

- The fact that many people are made to feel guilty for not doing overtime or having a side hustle is so unbelievably sad.

- Automation might cut about half of my ages potential careers

- Working enough, not the hardest to make the most of your free time shouldn’t be shamed

- I want to volunteer really badly but covid has stopped that. I had a previous weekly position at a kid’s church program that was cancelled and it sucks to not see the kids and the other volunteers just as it felt I was starting to be a part of a community. Volunteering right now seems really important to get experience and learn what I like, but that has been taken from me while I have the most time to pursue it as a high schooler

- I already know I’m going to have to live with my parents for a long time compared to how they went about it

- Going to university is seen as an expectation at my school, but I don’t see it being worth it for a lot of my schoolmates

- Though I am impressed by their motivation, it is sad seeing my schoolmates be so focused on making every moment of their time an opportunity to study more or fill out college applications. I feel like so many will burn out and regret not reaping the rewards of being a kid.

1229,"Will probably delete this later, had to rant a little","This probably sounds pathetic, but I have never felt anxiety like this before and I hate every minute of it. I'm a very laid back person, nothing bothers me, but at this job I sweat constantly, my heart races, and I shake so bad to the point I feel like throwing up. When I'm trying to go sleep, so I'm ""well rested"" for tomorrow, it starts back up again and I shake 'til I fall asleep lol. Three months ago I broke down crying for five minutes, and I've been feeling low ever since. I think they're starting to catch on that I hate it here because whenever I speak it's in a low, disinterested voice and I don't bother partaking in their long and very dragged out conversations anymore.

I can't even relax after work either because the type of work I do requires continuous study to build knowledge and keep up with all the updates. I just want to clock off, and catch up on my books and webtoons instead of studying. I made a massive mistake majoring in the course I did and an even bigger one choosing this job.

I've started looking for a new job recently and hope I find something soon. I honestly don't know how long I can bullshit my way through this. I can't just up and quit, bills need be paid. I wish I could, I really wish I could. I can't fall back on my parents either because then they'll view me as some disappointment, too, since my older sibling has been jobless for years and that annoys them to no end. 

I feel really awful and stuck, and I'm just trying to get myself out of this situation.  I'm sure this whole post sounds whiny, but I just had to say this to someone.

1232,What is your opinion on refusing tasks at work?,"Although I am anti work, I feel I try to have a decent attitude towards it and I have never refused a task before, sometimes meaning I take on more than I should. 

I work in a bank and my role is a mix between doing cash at the tellers and opening accounts/maintenance etc. in an office. One of the tellers is taking more time off than usual as she needs to babysit her kids on school holidays which means she has been working around me and when I can cover the tellers.. this obviously means I am falling behind on my ‘office based’ targets. Which I feel is out of my control and there’s been increased pressure on me lately to ‘catch up’. 

So, yesterday was an extremely busy day.. I had half finished tasks that I needed to complete and I also hadn’t had my lunch break. I have family stuff going on and my mental health isn’t as great as it usually is so when my manager approached me and told me he had 2+ account openings for me to do 15 minutes before we shut (this would take me at least 45 minutes, 30 if I am lucky.) I calmly said
‘Look, I am feeling really overwhelmed with my work load at the moment, I also have stuff going on at home, didn’t have my lunch break and I’m not feeling it. I don’t refuse stuff very often but I am not taking this on, the customer can come back tomorrow and I’ll do it then.’
My manager stood at my desk and questioned what I had to do, he also said 
‘This will be good for you. You need to reach your targets.’ 
After him standing at my desk for a few more minutes he walked away. 

This morning I came to work and had my first panic attack in several years. When I approached him about needing to go home he was at first supportive but then said 
‘You can’t keep refusing customers when you have a target to reach.’

I guess the reason that I am asking this question is because I was made to feel like I was being unreasonable and in the wrong when I at first thought I was being perfectly reasonable and I guess I need reassurance on that. 

I am at home now and after an appointment with my psychologist I have decided to book a doctors appointment tomorrow and have a sick day tomorrow too. I am genuinely upset by this as I have more important things to worry about at the moment and the passive comments and unnecessary pressure is not needed. 

I would also love tips on how I can approach my manager about this as I don’t think I did anything wrong.

1245,4 steps to escape wage slavery without being rich.,"

1) leech. Get in shape, sort yourself out and land a boyfriend/girlfriend you can leech off. Leech off your parents if you can. Leech of welfare if you can. Just leech as much as you can.

2) Now you need an easy part time job that pays a good hourly rate but you need to work low hours say 10-20 per week. Find something you don't hate, you don't have to like it because you won't be doing it for that long you just have to be okay with it. If you know a second language working as a freelance translator seems to be an easy option. But there are many options out there.

3) Cut back on useless spending. Spending $4 on a Starbucks coffee a day is dumb when you can make it at home for like $0.50. saving $3.50 per working day is like $892.50 per year. Look for any useless spending and just cut it out. 

4) Don't have kids, kids are a waste of money and why the hell would you want to rope a kid into this shit system anyways. If you want kids that badly then get paid to foster or adopt kids. 

By doing this I've left the rat race at 22 and now at 24 I'm living better than most wage slaves who work full time and have no money left over at the end of the month. I work 20 hours a week and easily save &gt;$1000 per month.",False,kxduzl,Rich_Chad,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kxduzl/4_steps_to_escape_wage_slavery_without_being_rich/,21,0
1246,Working at a Home Shopping Channel,"I feel like if I don't vent I'm going to lose it one day soon.

I have worked a lot of shitty jobs and I'm gonna start with it's redeeming qualities before I dump on it. 

1. It's work from home
2. The pay WAS reasonable for the workload.
3. It saved me a huge amount of expenses from commuting.

Now to elaborate.

I think I work for the single most incompotent company on earth.

We are perpetually short staffed, we have absolutely zero heads up about price changes on major products and many times the live demonstrations are confusing or set unreasonable expectations of product quality (it's all cheap Chinese crap)

Our support team will not answer any questions and takes multiple minutes to respond to even basic requests like price overrides.

Our management never communicates any changes until the last moment and is slow to respond to any requests.

Many of customers beat even the worst I met at brick and mortar. (I guess not having to face me helps their courage) Last night for instance I was called stupid for not being able to locate the product a customer wanted. They could not provide the product number and no product we'd had on in the past 2 hours was within $10 of the price they thought it was.

Our shipping system is horrific and it's impossible to get updates on why things haven't been shipped and you can't cancel an order even if the item hasn't been picked yet. 

The postal service (bless them cause they got some shit going on too) loses probably 5% of what we ship.

But what really started raising my ire is the crosstraining.

I was hired to work sales only.
New orders.

I have since been crosstrained to
-Check Orders
-File claims
-Submit requests for updates on shipping
-Re-order customer orders that have been lost
-Take monthly payments
-Update customer accounts
-Add an entire program of record keeping despite us not supposedly being allowed any after-call work.

All for no additional pay despite all these added duties.

In a meeting today, we'd hope to hear some good news about our pay. It was a 20% cut then they added another 10%. We agreed to this and signed the papers last year because the company has really good benefits to compare with other companies in the market. What we didnt realised was that the cut was permanent.

1256,Humble brag post: reached the laziness goal I didn't know I could ever achieve,"Not sure posts like this are allowed or if there's a better subreddit for this since I do work a bit but here it goes. Feel free to delete.

Over the last few months, I've been putting in less than 8 hours a week at work (from home). I'm still getting an average (but nowhere near Google-level) software engineer salary. I've read stories similar to this in the past but never imagined I'd be in this kinda situation.

Wish I could help ya'll find a situation like this but for me this happened out of privilege, laziness, and a lot of luck. Laziness for the obvious reasons but also because I was too lazy to get a new, better job. This job wasn't always like this. I've wanted to leave for over a year but I was just too lazy to interview. And then covid happened, people got laid off, priorities switched, management got shuffled around multiple times, salaries got reduced. So I started slacking off a bit here and there and wow that was a slippery slope. Now here I am doing a few hours of work a week.

One reason this has worked so well is that my manager isn't technical at all. This is probably why they have been super happy with my work over the last few months and I'm not sure but I guess their boss is as well. Whenever I finish something, they're like omg I can't believe this is done already thanks so much ::confetti emoji::

The rest of my ""team"" is only 3 other technical people and they're working on different products since everyone else got laid off due to covid. They don't even work in the same programming language and they're not exactly producing much either. To top it off they've all heard horror stories about the projects I'm responsible for. Some things are not easy to accomplish and people have quit due to burnout back when the workload was more intense. So that gives me a decent out if something is taking a while longer than it seems like it should. Overall, not really worried about them getting me fired.

Sometimes I've been feeling a little bad about slacking off so much but I have to remind myself they're not exactly helping to cure cancer here. They're mostly salesmen making huge commissions because they (or their dad) are rich or know someone rich.

1267,Knowing this is how it has to be is debilitating.,"Found this sub a week ago and I am now going to let off some steam- I hope that’s okay. 

I’ve suffered with mental illness for a long time now, and having the responsibility of working is just too much in itself. I had to move back home after giving up my job because covid would have left me homeless in the city. I was on the edge for months, and in that time where I wished to recover, the guilt creeps in- “you need a job or you’re worthless”.

Ever since high school the idea of working most of my life away terrified me, and now I’m here I still feel that way. My partner reached radical acceptance with that and isn’t too bothered about it- but it shakes me to my core. I can’t accept it and I don’t think I ever will. That’s equally terrifying- being forced to live this nightmare until you physically can’t anymore. 

My eyes opened wider with an old coworker at my job I had to give up. Working for 40 years and still does not make a living wage. She lives alone. No children. The only reason she has a roof over her head is because she’s continued a beneficial affair with a married man all this time- she can’t quit that because she’d be homeless. I became so angry at my boss then- he goes out golfing with his doctor friends and rich clients, gets gifts of thanks and offers for free stuff for his job. He pays us minimum wage and we do most of the job. My old coworker is worth so much more than she gets- her life has been so tough. She’s so underpaid it upsets me so much. If I ever got lucky with money, the first thing I would do is show up at her door with more money than she knows what to do with. That maladaptive daydream gets me through the bad times. 

I got that job I needed to feel worthy. And I hate working it. It’s a worthwhile job but I just wish I was doing something else. I’ve been sick for almost two weeks now, and they’re not happy and overwhelmed because of my absence. I feel so guilty. Guilty that I am sick and that I left them. But, I am also doing nothing and I love it. I feel dizzy and my head hurts, but I’d rather wake up knowing I didn’t have to go to work than feel better. It’s sad admitting that.

My dream would be to be my own boss, but the creative market is over saturated and I don’t have any new or sought after talents. 
Or maybe wake up a millionaire and spend my time volunteering and making the dreams come true of the people I love. 

I wish I didn’t feel like such a burden not wanting to be a part of this bullshit society that cares not for my health at all. It doesn’t deserve my time, but without being another cog in the machine, I’d have not even a roof over my head.

1273,One of my favorite childhood book series gave me my ideal of how the world should function.,"L. Frank Baum's well known Oz series was a treasured favorite in my childhood. On the subject for this subreddit though this post pertains to how the economy of land of Oz functioned and how it has affected me throughout my life.



I unfortunately cant remember which book it was, but I remember it being explained that no one worked for money in Oz, everyone did their own thing, and if someone needed something then a trade was done. 



Something like: Ok you need a house built, well you're a blacksmith and I need shoes for my horses, if you make me the horseshoes then I'll build your house.



I always thought that this was ideal, unfortunately at large the world doesn't support this. You cant get groceries through trade of service or goods -like art, or crafts, or produce from your garden-, you cant get a car or go to an amusement park for those either.




It's just depressing knowing that there are better ways of running the world and yet humans have to remain slaves because those in power wont let the world be better. 



I want to travel the world, I want to improve myself in certain ways that need money and thus work in order to obtain, and it's not right and makes me so angry and feel such despair .",False,kxvzrb,Fennily,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kxvzrb/one_of_my_favorite_childhood_book_series_gave_me/,5,1

1282,I quit my job in Sept. And I am happy!,"I want to preface this by saying I have been anti-work for a long time, and have known for that workers mean nothing to employers, for just as long.   
I only work as a means to an end, but would gladly not work again my entire life.. if possible. That does not mean, however, that when I do work, I don't put in effort. If I am doing something, I like to do it well, in all aspects of my life.  


I was employed at a major hotel company up until a few months back, working nights from 11pm to 7am, technically on a 0 hour contract, on minimum wage.  


I was there a year, and did well. Got employee of the month straight out of the probation period. Helped them cover my managers role for a while. And I was put forward again for employee of the month, just before lock-down happened.  
 The team consisted of me, the assistant manager, and manager.. with others coming and going, as it wasn't the best hours, or best wage. Never more than 4 on the team though.  
Towards the end, the 3 of us were getting annoyed with everything. We were all looking for other jobs, as this one was not good.  
Nights increasingly had more work piled on us, while the Days literally stood around, or sat in the office, for most of their shift. The GM and DGM (2 males in their 30's) were extremely biased towards the day staff, who were all women/girls. We were regularly understaffed. And when covid hit, we were made to clean dirty rooms, without even leaving them the required amount, as well as shitty pay and shitty hours.  
The assistant manager had accepted a job offer, and put in his notice, which was about 1 month.

The General Manager asked if I wanted to apply for the position of Assistant Night Manager. Already knowing what the current assistant manager was on, I asked how much it would be.   
The salary would have been a WHOPPING 3 pence higher than minimum wage. And because I would be salaried, I would not be able to get overtime.  
I later looked online, as I knew they usually post for those positions. They were advertising more online, than for what I got offered.

I decided right then that it was my time to leave too. I waited until the night before the assistant manager was leaving, and handed in my resignation, effective immediately.  
Best choice I felt I could make. And it was.  


Right now, I don't really do much. I take each day as it is.. but because of lock-downs, Covid, etc., I am mostly in the house, playing games, talking to people, watching whatever I want, cooking, and all around generally happy.  
Thankfully, I had money saved, so I have been spending the last few months riding on that. It has been the best time ever. 

But I'm getting towards the end of my savings I had allocated.. and I REALLLLLY don't want to work again. Work makes me anxious, and depressed. I feel I have no life, and work just to survive. I have never found any job that i even like, let alone love. And this realisation that I will have to start looking for another job, and signing on (UK unemployment) soon is killing me.

A couple weeks ago they both got, as a 'thank you' for putting their health at risk in the middle of a pandemic, 10 dollar gift cards to McDonalds, and some dice and a deck of cards. The filthy rich bastards who own the company also made videos of them sitting in their million dollar homes thanking the wageslaves of their company for putting their lives on the line for laughable amount of money they make. 

So, I sent customer service an email:


Good evening,

My brother and his girlfriend both work for _____ and I'd just like to say that I think it is incredibly insulting that _____'s 'thank you' to them, and the other employees there, was a 10 dollar gift card to McDonalds, playing cards, and a video of the billionaires who run it sitting in their cozy mansions; safe from this virus, thanking them for risking their health and potentially their lives, for the measly paycheck they get. I understand whoever receives this is not at fault, and to whoever does read it I hope you stay safe during these times.

I had worked for them, but was laid off right as the pandemic started, was told by my manager that I WASN'T and that this was happening to everyone at the store and to be patient, then found out  later through a co-worker that I was actually laid off. No call from my manager, no text, nothing. I'm 22 years old and I am honestly tired of being told to accept shit like this. I got written up once for not noticing a fork behind a garbage can, told I wasn't 'professional', told that when I asked if I could switch to pet care that I would be 'someone elses problem' if they did (I have ADD and was in the middle of getting new meds, which I made sure they were aware of. Funny considering how the first day of my job I was sat down to watch training videos and do quizzes and one of their first guidelines is that employees who might need accommodation are not only entitled to it, but encouraged to seek it out if needed.) All I was asking for was a bit of understanding while I was getting my meds sorted out: not to be treated like royalty. Not only did I not get understanding, but my manager took to hiding things under shelves for me to find to make sure I was ""cleaning properly."" She also got mad when I would miss pee stains somewhere in the store (it is one of the bigger stores, and I KNOW I did my best keeping up with it.) and went on about how it would turn pet parents away, but would LEAVE IT THERE FOR DAYS TO SHOW ME WHEN I WAS SCHEDULED NEXT? So it was okay for the pee to be left then, but not when I missed it?? One of the real kickers was when it was December of last year, 5am I'm waiting outside the store to be let in for my shift. It's snowing, freezing cold and nothing is open. My manager showed up TWO HOURS late and was snarky the entire shift. Last but not least, the shit show that was petcare. There were a few good people there, but not good enough apparently because animals was consistently escaping from the room behind petcare. Three times in one month it was a python that I FOUND when I was cleaning under the isles. Another time it was a robo hamster on the brink of death because it had escaped and had been gone for who knows how long. A majority of the time the bottles in the cages were set up WAY too high and the hamsters couldn't reach them. You'd think a PET store would actually take better care of their animals. 

All in all, I have no hope for the future right now. This pandemic, the fact that money rules EVERYTHING, and the fact that the system works to create mindless wage slaves as opposed to enlightened and free people, makes me feel so sick I want to throw up.

Remember feeling guilty because you had a bad mood at work, so you would tell people “I’m just a little tired,” but then you found yourself saying that every day, and then you’d come home from work and tell your girlfriend and your dog, “I’m just a little tired,” and then you found yourself saying that every day, and then you felt guilty for that, too.
 
 
The next time you want to work five days a week, remember these moments.
 
Remember checking your temperature every morning, hoping you had a fever, wishing you had Covid so you could have two weeks off. Remember hoping you would twist your ankle while teaching. Remember daydreaming you’d get in a car crash every time you took a taxi.
 
The next time your four-day weekend feels a little bit too long, remember your past self.
 
Remember your caffeine addiction. Your addiction to energy drinks, but then your heart started feeling weird, so you switched to buying coffee, but then it was too expensive, so you started making your own coffee, but then you started making too much and your pee was the wrong color and then eventually you were too tired to make your own coffee, and then you started buying coffee, but then it was too expensive, so you were addicted to energy drinks again, and your heart started feeling weird.
 
The next time you’re bored or unfulfilled, remember when you had less time.
 
Remember when you wanted to learn Final Fantasy songs on piano, so you bought a piano, and then you wanted to learn Mountain Goats songs on a ukulele, so you borrowed a ukulele, and then you never touched them.  Too tired. Too little time. Much better to spend every hour before bed watching the same people play Mario on YouTube every night.
 
The next time working five days a week sounds doable again, remember what it really means.
 
Remember spending your weekend lesson-planning, responding to homework, and writing assessments. Remember how territorial you were about your free time. Remember being mad at your girlfriend for scheduling a maid to clean the apartment during your precious weekend morning, or being mad at your dog for needing to go to the vet during your precious weekend afternoon, or being mad at your friend for wanting to hang out during your precious weekend evening.
 
 
The next time you think you’re a loser for not working hard enough, remember when you thought you were a loser who wasn’t working hard enough, but still worked five days a week. Remember when you lashed out. Remember when you embarrassed yourself and hurt others because you couldn’t handle it.

So I decided rather than go back to a dead end job right away agian I'm going to take some time off. While looking these things up I learned that a sabbatical and or a career break can't just be time off for fun and a break from work. Apparently you are supposed to improve yourself and get more skills etc. I love how our society can't even give us a decent work break without work being the focus. It kills me. Why can't a break from work be about taking an actual break from anything work related? Why is that so evil?

I have a year's income saved up. My bills are low. Just let me take the break damn it. I'm tired of dead end soulless minimum wage jobs. I want some alone time.

We assume, and validated by professors, that the current economic model is optimal when in reality has led to a dystopian nightmare. To make it worse, we are forced by threat of starvation and homeless to aquire jobs from wealthy persons. Clearly, this is a fascistic system. 

The system is only concerned with profit and not environmental concern or public health. We gotta stop it. We must become educated. More educated than anyone predicted. We all gotta pick up the textbooks on science and math and history.
 
The more we actually know about reality the better society will course correct it's repeated mistakes.

1307,Work-Life Balance Is A Lie,"""Work life Balance"" is among the dumbest of corporate slogans that has been created.

It is an attempt to brainwash people into thinking such a thing could even possibly exist when you work from sunrise to sunset and use ALL YOUR ENERGY before you are let to go home and rest to repeat it again tomorrow. There is NO ""work-life balance"" in this slave system. Corporations use up your productive hours of the day, and leave you to go home once you've been milked for the day.

Imagine this - doing 8 hours of one activity, every single fucking day. Do you take 8 hour showers everyday? Do you eat 8 hour long meals? How about when you watch a movie, do you like them 8 hours long?

How about you give me true ""work life balance"" and have me work every other day rather than 5 on followed by 2 off? That sounds a little more ""balanced"", doesn't it?

If I have ""work-life balance"" then the amount of time I spend working should be fairly shared with the activity time I spend not working. It isn't. I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Just another dumb HR driven, brainless concept that rather exposes the corporate world as the actual opposite of what they are trying to be seen as.

You can't enjoy spending time with your family because you're so mentally drained from everything you are required to do on a day to day basis. Sometimes they may even notice you're more irritable than usual.

You and your friends don't ever get to see each other anymore because everyone's priority is getting money to make sure all the bills are paid and all the little free time you have left you're inclined to spend it on yourself because its literally all you have left.

Many of us wake up every day just to make breakfast, shower, get dressed and then go take our daily commute (unless you work from home) just to spend time at a place that we really do not care about at all for 8-12 hours a day 5-6 days a week. What makes all of this worse is when you are surrounded by a bunch of overly optimistic people who might snitch on you because you're ""not in the mood"", or how about the obsession with working overtime that many people romanticize and brag about how they worked like 58 hours last week? Or having a boss who acts like this place is their second home and expects everyone else to have the same mindset?

None of that is enough to save me from burnout. It’s all just inherent to the system modern life has trapped us in.

1352,I’m on bereavement leave and I’m having trouble balancing grieving with anxiety about going back to work. I feel like a piece of shit.,"A close family member of mine passed away due to Covid this past Thursday. My company offers five days of fully paid bereavement so I’m due to go back to work on Friday. I had to leave halfway through the day on Thursday unexpectedly (when I found out) so I didn’t have time to organize anything for a week’s absence and had to leave a clusterfuck behind for my coworkers and manager to take care of since I’m super behind on my work right now. 

This weekend I was obviously preoccupied and super busy with all the family that came into town. They left this morning and things are settling down and now I remember...I have work on Friday. Fuck. 

I feel like a horrible person. I should be focusing on grieving for my grandmother. And I was and still am. And my grandpa is still admitted and no one can see him and he’s all alone in the Covid ward. But now I have this creeping feeling, like the feeling of a Sunday evening, that feeling of dread. I shouldn’t be fucking thinking of my stupid ass job but I am. Not only that, but I’ve been appreciating the time this leave has been giving me to get together with family who I haven’t seen for a while precisely because of Covid, and it’s been giving me more time to de-compress from how stressful the job has been (though now I’m under a different type of stress).

I need to quit, mainly because of the covid thing. But I'm genuinely scared. I know that as soon as I put in my two weeks my boss will make my life a living hell. She already does, and I haven't even given her a reason to believe I'd quit. She doesn't know that we all know about her hiding the fact that my manager should have been quarantining but she told her to come in anyway to keep up production. 

I hate that I feel *guilty* for leaving them short-staffed. I hate that she makes me feel *scared* to call off when I feel sick *during a pandemic*. I don't know what to do. I can't go back to work tomorrow. I called off today and I know I'll be punished tomorrow. I know my coworkers are sitting around talking shit about me. It makes me physically ill.

Don't get me wrong, even the worst jobs and the scummiest of management can be ignored with great coworkers. I just couldn't handle the workload, and more people were leaving because of that AND management. 

As of recent days, I had to job hunt again. I didn't want to work service or retail because most places are notorious for underpaying their employees severely. I found a warehouse production job that pays 13.50 an hour. Significantly better, even if it isn't the minimum wage. I thought I could suck it up and make it work. I only plan on staying for 6 months give or take, until I go back to school in the fall. I was getting desperate, and needed to save funds for school anyway. Hopefully things go well while I'm there. I plan to just clock in and out, and keep my head down. I wanted to avoid working for a while longer but couldn't.

1395,Being a dedicated hard worker means nothing.,"I've been working in the veterinary field.  Got fucked over in late October by the corporate-bootlicking pm at a clinic owned by a fucking candy company.  Lost my health insurance which could have covered the medical testing delayed by the pandemic.  As an additional kick in the ass, I was denied unemployment benefits (it appears that the Oregon EDD doesn't take the worker's side; who knew? /s)
 
Started working again in Dec. for lower pay but what I hoped could mean better prospects at a less-corporate place.  I wanted to belong, they actually did seem like more of a family.  In the end, it doesn't truly  include me.   
  
I deal with chronic depression, anxiety, and adhd.  I was let go without warning, as my social anxiety impaired my doctor-client communication. While people were presumably talking *about* me behind my back up until this point, no one actually sat down with me to *discuss* this until my last day.  

I still don't have the bandwidth for recent national 'events'. Were it not for my partner and cats, I'd seriously consider opting out of the whole shitshow that is the US, planet earth in 2021.  
  
With every dismissal, I feel betrayed, and want to deal with people less and less.  Why jump in and try to put roots down anywhere only to be yanked out again?  
  
Being a ""hard worker"" means never being quite good enough; all the love and genuine care and effort to be there for people and patients means nothing in the end, or at least, not enough to be deemed worthwhile enough to keep.  
  
No wonder about the suicide rate in this field, and the attrition rate in general. A person can only stand this for so long before saying, ""fuck it, I'm out"".

I felt bad about not working but only because I was comparing myself. Today I just realized it’s nice not worrying about work.

I hated it. I never fit in with my coworkers because I’m soo awkward. Not cute awkward, the “wtf is wrong with her” awkward. I feel so out of place in work settings. I’m so glad I don’t have to deal with them or that environment anymore. Every day I came home I felt embarrassed and ashamed about something, I wanted to relapse almost everyday.

I used to get such bad panic anxiety at work, my heart would pound like crazy.. I frequently took beta blockers to look calm at work. My heart pounding happened so much that it caused pain in my chest but at the time I didn’t know why I had chest pain.

1411,My manager told me to work even though i had been hit by a car minutes before,"This happened a while back. I was walking to work and a car hit me when i was using a crosswalk and they drove away without seeing if i was okay. I didn't know what to do because I'm an 18 year old kid who just graduated high school and don't know shit about anything

Went in and told my manager that i got hit by a car. He asked if i was okay. I said that i was feeling relatively okay but i thought it would be a good idea to just go back to my college dorm and rest (a 20 minute walk back)

He told me that they were understaffed so it would be my fault if things got rough for my coworkers, etc. Guilted me into clocking in. As i worked my shift (food runner at a mexican salsa bar) i started to feel more severe pain in my hip where i had been hit, and was limping pretty bad. 

I'm pretty sure working my 8 hour shift made it much worse, but it doesnt even matter anymore because i ended up getting fired because my boss said i wasn't learning the menu fast enough bc I'm a college student trying to focus on her studies and have a learning disability (ADHD) so paying attention long enough to memorize it is difficult for me.

1415,Employer not giving a single flying f**k about Covid.,"Alright, this is gonna be a long one so I apologise, TL:DR at the bottom, I just need to get this off my chest. I'm based in the UK doing sales for a company that claims to have values that promote employees working with each other, helping each other and keeping employees safe.

However, during the time that the part of the UK that I am in was placed in Tier 4, basically government advice was to work from home when you can, the company decided that we should all come into work, sit at desks that are within touching distance of the person next to us, and answer the phones all day, which are as busy as before Covid so no reduction in staffing levels, instead of allowing us to work from home.
 
When asked about this, they said that it was because of the phone system that they use not being flexible enough to allow working from home, essentially meaning that a YEAR into the pandemic they hadn't planned ahead at all. This isn't a small company, this is a company that has sales figures in the millions each week. 

They then gave employee of the month to a colleague who came into work for two and a half days with all the symptoms of Covid, before announcing at lunch on the third day that he felt ill and wanted to go home, meaning that everyone in the office had to isolate and a couple of members of staff have since tested positive. 

When we raised concerns with management, we were told that they would be unhappy if someone caught Covid in the office, as they had apparently taken all' reasonable steps' to ensure employee safety, yet did absolutely nothing when their 'reasonable' steps were proven to not work. That quote above was from a manager who has been working from home since March, so hasn't been into the office in about a year. 

Just to clarify, the employee of the month thing happened several months ago, at the end of the first UK lockdown, I've only just got reddit tho so didn't have somewhere to rant about this until now. 

TL:DR I'm sick of employers claiming to care about employees health yet not doing anything to actually keep them safe.

Boss 2: ""Don't you know that when you work on your birthday you might get a cupcake?""

1420,"Rant on work, from a teenanger's perspective","Please excuse errors or maybe even this post in general. I am young and not a native speaker. 

Sometimes i wish it was still the 1950s and i was supposed to be a housewife. I feel like saying that is like saying you're a n*zi but honestly i really do feel like that. I know women deserve to be treated equal to men and have the opportunity to educate themselves and work. In fact from what I've seen women/girls outperform men/boys quite often. But the right to education and the right to work is not the freedom for women as some people think it is and society makes it out to be in my opinion. V awkward because I've always considered myself a feminist.

For me, eventhough as a child i was labeled smart i cannot help but wish my life was different. Again, it feels weird to say that because i am a woman living in a first world country in the 21st century- how could i possibly complain? Well, i always thought of the ability to work as freedom. But as I've grown up i realized i have little. A job is what you need to feed yourself and your family. An education is a requirement and a completely soulsucking experience that will also leave you with not only the wish you were struck by lighting or hit by a bus every once in a while but a nice debt.


Speaking of family, i wish I could have one but how am i gonna combine that without impacting my career and in this economy? I dream of having a big family sometimes but can't imagine having more than 2. A child is so incredibly expensive and time consuming from what I've heard. Daycare costs alone... it makes me sad. i also feel like getting a house is gonna be so hard. I am nineteen and already constantly thinking about money. I still live at home and don't lend money because i don't wanna fucking go into debt when all my pimples haven't even disappeared yet lol.

My dreams of becoming an astronaut or hockey player or whatever the fuck i soon realized were completely  unrealistic. I am but my competences and weaknesses and there will unfortunately always be too many that outperform me at every fucking thing i do. Didn't choose the right subjects when you were 15 and had no clue how important it would be? Sorry, you're fucked now. 

Futhermore, with every major I'm reading on (im switching majors) i get extremely worried about the job market and how people are gonna perceive my major and job. I am sorry society, but i prefer history and english over math and psychics. People around me tell me, don't worry. But how can i not worry? Every major i like gets ridiculed and I hear stories about ppl studying it and not getting a job. Psychology? ""After you finish that you stil got nothing."" X? ""You should just learn how to get on benefits in the mean time."" Also, many people here are highly educated. Meaning that a bachelors that used to be considered impressive is now a requirement. I feel so much pressure to not be an embarrassment and do a prestigous major (eventhough I truly want to do something most people think is riduclous) and have a successful career. I look at my female friends who were smarter than me and do prestigous majors and feel like a failure. I long for a simpler life with less stress. Honestly i am a total homebody and love cooking etc.. and i despise the idea of having to go to a soulsucking 9 to 5 job with a boss that dictates me around. Think I'm too pessimistic? It's just reality for many people. I will try to get a job i like and a major i like, but at the end of the day we all need to pay our bills. But all society does is tell me to suck it up and think of the people in third world countries that have it worse. 

The parttime jobs I've had were hell and make me pretty scared for the future. I could write about them for hours. Mistreatment when you weren't your boss' BFF, having to stand for 8 hours behind the cash register with less than 1 hour break, being the only one on the floor while it was busy and i had worked there for 3 months bc my boss and coworkers wanted to get lunch. Being paid scraps. Not being paid for more than 30 minutes everytime i worked, but 5 minutes late qnd you commited a war crime. Hearing the music from the store and feeling like i was on a boat at the end of the day in bed. I cannot imagine what is must like to be poor and not be able to quit a job. At least i have something to fall back on, somewhat of a choice, some freedom. But god i cannot wait to be financially independent and god am i jealous of people like Kylie Jenner.

1445,"Look at this ridiculous job posting where the ceo brags about how much money he’s made, tells you you need to go above and beyond, but the job pays $15 an hour 🤣","I think [this](http://careers.funnel.llc/technical-and-executive-assistant-remote-31196/) is one of the funniest job postings I’ve ever seen. 

- “A tad bit about me... I'm The Funnel Genius, Hawk Mikado - I'm the co-founder of multiple 6+ &amp; 7+ Figure companies including this one, Funnel LLC (aka Funnel Magazine). In my former agency, we helped 12+ Companies create 7+ Figure Funnels, and taught 11,973+ how to Add 6+ Figures to their business...”

- “BONUS TIP #2 - As a member of any company your ""job"" is not whatever you got hired for... it's to make the company a profit... that means you make the company more money than they spend for all expenses related to your role...
E.g. You must make us a 3x Profit within your first 90 days, and a 10x profit within 12 months to continue to have a position with us
""but some of the stuff I do doesn't make money?"" - that may be true... but you can save us money - e.g. If someone in the company who makes more than you needs something done - and you can ultimately do it for less than they can... that increases profits for our company.”

- “BONUS TIP #3 - I'm a marketer, so basically everything comes in 3 parts &amp; the rest of are bonuses... and damn it if I don't create the best possible offer stack imaginable... LOL”

- “If we wanted mediocracy we would look for something mediocre, but we're working with you because you're a Market Maker™.”

- “I'm looking for people who love a challenge and are willing to go above and beyond in their work. I work on an accelerated schedule and I expect things done right in sometime unimaginable short periods of time...”

- “Basically being a 2nd me... which is frankly driven a lot of people out of their minds... So be warned - but then again, you already read the above... So let's skip all that and get to the meat of it...
I want you to help me by doing the things that aren't a good use of my time. As my Executive assistant you're in charge of making sure I'm focused on the tasks that need to get done first, help me find vendors and manage communicate with other team members to off load work I don't want to do (or is more profitable to have someone else do) and ultimately, if you're performing well, you can help us increase profits because we'll be running more efficiently. Just as an example - today (as of writing this post) I worked on something that I use to pay $5/hr to someone in the Philippines for, it was basically copy &amp; paste - so in my mind I wasted 2 hours working on something that could have been done by someone else and I could have spent those 2 hours on sales calls or building the slides for an upcoming sales presentation or done something that could have generated a large profit OR I could have spent that time with my daughter. In the beginning you'll probably end up doing some of these tasks, but ultimately I want you to help find others to take on these types of roles. (if you're wondering why I didn't have someone else do that... I'll answer it in the FAQs)”

- “From a day to day perspective, you'll be running meetings, calling leads to book sales calls, managing my calendar, helping do the technical work (build funnels, run ads, update zapier, fix automations, etc) and keeping track of projects to ensure they stay on track - acting in a supportive and administrative role when necessary to keep projects going.”

- “How much can I earn in this position?
To start...
US - $15/hr USD more likely, but I'm willing to pay up to $20/hr USD
CA - $20/hr CAD more likely, but willing to pay up to $26/hr CAD
UK - £12/hr more likely, but willing to pay up to £15/hr
AU - $21/hr AUD more likely, but willing to pay up to $28/hr AUD
$5-7/hr ($750-$1,200/mo) more likely, but I'm willing to pay up to $10/hr ($1,500/mo) - Everywhere else”",False,kvw9yx,fancyyypantsyyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kvw9yx/look_at_this_ridiculous_job_posting_where_the_ceo/,11,3

One thing I was told to NEVER do was to burn a bridge because you may have to cross it back some day or the new prospective employers will know how you left your last job, But it truly doesn't matter. Make a new bridge rather than cross the old one and more times than not, the new employers hate their competition and love that you're not respecting them.

I used to leave 2 weeks notice and would get shorted on my last check anyways. Also,  I found that doing so leads to being treated like complete shit for those two weeks as well as being treated to such phrases as ""you'll never find better than this""

1454,Overcoming Guilt,"I've been slowly collecting straws since the start of the pandemic, and I think I picked up my last one. I am constantly tired, I don't do anything with my life but sit in my room, I've had this gut infection for a couple of months now which I put off seeing the doctor for due to being stressed from work, I can barely eat resulting in me sleeping 12-13 hours a night, which leaves me only a few hours a day to myself. My job isn't fun, it's frustrating and unfulfilling, and I don't think I can handle some of the more stressful aspects of it anymore due to my anxiety disorder. Despite the events in Washington DC (where we are) in the past week, everyone is just going on as if nothing happened. On top of that, I am trans and not out at work which is starting to wear me down, but I also do not have the mental capacity to go through another wave of coming out.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I can quit. I applied for grad school last month, and assuming I get in I have enough money saved to last me until then. If I don't, I have half a year to look for another job, and otherwise my parents said they will gladly house me after my lease ends. And somehow I feel incredibly guilty for wanting to quit and feel like I failed as an adult. This is my first job out of college and I guess I took a lot of pride in my independence and felt like I was finally ""doing it right"". I also keep thinking about all of the people who lost their jobs in the pandemic, and how my job is allowing us to work from home indefinitely and that my job does pay pretty well, and how I need to feel grateful for what I have.  I've discussed wanting to leave with my friends and family, and they're all supportive of me doing what's best for me, and I know that quitting will not be the end of the world.

i’ve been a temp this entire time, so i haven’t been accruing pto or getting holiday pay of any sort. i don’t even get benefits like health insurance. the checks are nice, but my mental health has taken an absurd downturn to detailed suicidal ideation in the first time in years. 

i don’t know how much longer i can live like this because i’ve already made plans to kill myself multiple times just so i don’t have to deal with this anymore. i even thought about ODing during my break so i can get sick and go home early. 

my manager knows about my mental health and just said to quit if i can’t handle it. i can’t afford to quit. we’re in the middle of a fucking pandemic. 

i don’t know what to do and this might just be me venting but if anyone has any advice for me other than “toughen up and stick it out” like every other person i’ve talked to, i would greatly appreciate it and it might literally save my life.

(Rant)

I worked as a delivery driver for a major fast food joint. I had been working for more than 3 months doing deliveries using the company’s car and helping customers in the restaurant endlessly 40 hours a week. 

 Today in the morning before I could clock in to start my shift one of the managers called me back in to have a talk. The owner of the franchise was there as well. The inconsiderate bastard broke the news to me that I’m being terminated. I was extremely shocked by this because I have never felt I did anything to deserve this. 

He told me the reason I’m being fired is because of an incident that took place 3 days prior where I almost got hit by a car in the parking lot driving the company car, I had slammed on the car horn to prevent getting hit, apparently THIS is the reason I’m getting fired! I somehow tarnished the company’s imagine by slamming on the horn when a car is backing in to me. 

This was a major wake up call for me. I now know that I am just a dispensable worker ant. I had provided my restaurant with 10s of thousands of dollars in revenue delivering food, never being late to a single delivery, treating customers well, being on time.

I'm currently 24 years old and a part time master's student. I would normally work retail part time also but I've been on furlough since March. 

I've come to realise over the last few months that I need way more than an average amount of sleep to feel properly rested and able to function in daily life. Realistically, between 10-12 hours a night. I don't think this is due to a health problem since I've always struggled with tiredness, I just think I'm on the extreme end of a spectrum of what is ""normal"".

I've always struggled with the capitalist bollocks of feeling ""lazy"" when unproductive, especially when prioritising sleep and always wished to be someone who can function of 6 hours a night. I've always felt guilty when I've been unable to concentrate and get on with things due to being too exhausted throughout the day when sleeping less than I need. 

I'm probably going to be starting full time work at the end of this year and I'm honestly terrified at how I'm gonna cope. I've never properly worked full time before. I did about 9 months working average 30-35 hours a week and spent the entire time utterly exhausted with my mental health in the toilet. Not getting a full time job when I finish my studies isn't an option for me financially. How the fuck am I supposed to survive???

1478,Going back to work this week and I'm scared,"I was working my corporate desk job for the past year but got to the point where waking up consistently was challenging. Everyday I felt exhausted and like my heart was pounding, with this intense chest pain. I would literally just sit on my desk, and after a few hours, my chest would tighten extremely. Usually I'd reach for a benzo, but at this point that has stopped working and I'm dependent, and trying to wean off those drugs. 

I went on medical leave and am going through a few tests with doctors but have not gotten a firm diagnosis.

My FMLA is running out soon and I feel so sick thinking about ""having"" to go back to work. I don't think I can do it. I don't think I can physically handle waking up and going to work 5 days a week. I feel so fatigued even after walking 1 mile outside. My heart will race middle of the day for no reason. I now have a (small) benzo dependence. I don't know what's happened to me, but I think I reached a point of no return.

My cardiologist is giving me a heart monitor and a sleep doctor wants me to do an at-home test to rule out sleep apnea or delayed phase shift disorder.

As for work itself, well it sucks. It's one of those ""wear all hats"" jobs, the pays well but grinds you out. My first manager and I did not get along at all, and for strange reasons I was switched to a second manager. While I having chest pain and insomnia my work performance deteriorated and I was put on ""performance review"" shortly before taking the medical leave. I.e. ""Do Better soon or you're fired""

So I dread going back not only because I'm not sure if I can physically handle it but also seeing the same people (who I let down) and just the nature of the work itself is so monotonous. 

So why don't I quit? I'm stuck in a hard place. I'm living with my parents. They don't believe there's anything physically wrong with me, my dad yells at me often and calls me ""bipolar"" and says I need to take psych medication (which I've tried before for anxiety and didn't like). My dad almost punched once because he was so upset I extended my medical leave at one point. They say if I don't work, they'll kick me out, which is fine with me in theory. 

I have enough money to move out and rent a place for a little while but it's NYC and roommates usually expect you to have a job. It's also covid, there's a pandemic, and I consider myself high-risk. I've been quarantined since March, basically. 

I also need the health insurance obviously. And if I'm not working because I quit I would need to go on COBRA which is the full cost my employer isn't subsidizing which I'm guessing is $10k/year vs. my current $2.5k/year, borderline unaffordable for me. I can make it work for a while but it would suck. 

So that's where I am. I'm scared if I go back to work I'll drop dead of a heart attack. I feel palpitations even when I'm not working and sitting on my desk. I'm dreading seeing my coworkers since they hate me. I live with my parents who are awful people that have gotten physical, and will kick me out the moment they hear I lose the job.

1490,Waking up to an alarm clock seems so unnatural to me.,"I hope it's okay if I post this here, but I see it as quite an important issue to me, as someone that requires 10h of sleep.  

I just hate it. Everything about it. Food, sleep &amp; health are the basics we need to live and school+work has always affected me in these matters. All. My. Life. (I had a burnout 1,5 years ago and I'm still recovering from it)

Having to get up forcefully is plain and simple unnatural. We are supposed to sleep until we are fully rested. That's just how our body works. Of course it is up to ourselves to adjust our sleeping schedule, but it isn't always as easy as it sounds, especially if we don't have the time to get all these hours of sleep. Some people have a hard time to fall asleep, some have family, others are just exhausted...

And besides that I don't want my workplace to have all this control over me. I want to be free to choose when I want to rest and when I want to be productive. We are no different than animals. They sleep when they're tired, go get food when they're hungry and fuck when they're horny ... why is everything so complicated...

1500,Did an interview for a university,"I think I've exposed the fraud of the interview format. Last week, a day before the Capitol Hill riots I basically predicted something like this would happen when asked about my own research. I really despise interviews as I find myself always inadvertently saying something that will upset them. For example I asked where they saw the department going with online teaching in light of COVID and their course development in general outside of that context. They immediately took me up as saying I just wanted to teach online, I clarified that wasn't the entire content of my question, that I also meant in general but nope, in one ear and out the other. 

Anyway at no point did they tell me anything about the position, just asked me questions about how I would teach and my research projects. When I mentioned that my future research project explores the limitations of neoliberal policy and its corrosive effects on civic institutions leading to collapse, I could see the micro winces on their faces (academic departments really have been defanged).

For 12 years I have been applying for positions in VFX or academia that would lead to some semblance of security and career progression. I never get them. Maybe it's because I may be partially autistic (not diagnosed but I have trouble relating to people), maybe it's because I'm not intelligent enough to think on my feet when posed with an unexpected question or maybe I'm just not good enough overall..I mean I was interviewed twice by the same VFX studio and never got work with them. 

However I think it reveals something: namely that the interview format is a lie, they say they want the ""creme de la creme"" but they usually have someone already picked (which I think was the case in this instance) or it devolves into a high school popularity contest where you get to join their clique (the majority of adults are mostly babies in their behaviour). I found the experience humiliating, they were aloof and rude. Given 12 years of failure which has condemned me to future economic poverty, I'm walking away from this shell game.

1505,"working in a ""leftist"" music label","Hey people of this sub,I just need to vent a little and wanted to hear your opinion:

&amp;#x200B;

I joined this sub a few weeks before i was let go due to covid on my last (and first) job. I was sort of happy with the employment, because i would get payed sick and off days. Also it really fitted my ""lifestyle"" meaning I could take time off at short notice to go touring with my band. (this was quite regular, like every 2 weeks, but my band also released their records on this label, so I as still kind of working for them?) 

The longer I am unemployed I realise how much I was exploited at this musiclabel. I was making nearly no money with my regular contract (less than people registering at stores in my contry) and let's not talk about the cut Hours due to covid. I made like 70 € more than unemployment from the state.

I know it is sort of a ideological thing to work with this musicians (I enjoyed the music of a few of them) and this label and it was a huge opportunity for me to meet people in the music industry, but I cant help holding a grudge against my boss and the collegues supporting his sort of leadership. I think we were all underpayed and no one really made a lot of money not even the boss of the label, but the day to day operation heavily relied on kids just wanting to be a part of it all and doing work for little to no money. 

I think if the Boss really was the leftist he claims to be, he should turn the company into a collective where everyone can decide in a democratic way and not letting people go out of the blue. (I mean, I suspected it, because everythign wasn't running smoothly due to covid, and I had a hard time getting used to home office and working efffectively) But What the fuck.

I'm surrounded by sycophants at work. Even when I try to very tactfully, diplomatically and discretely start a conversation on an antiwork topic (even in a very round-about way), I'm shunned, rejected, and generally feel ostracised. Joining a union is not an option.

I find people incapable of critical thinking or voicing their opinion, perhaps because they actually do not have any, I'm starting to suspect. I used to think that they're just afraid, but years of acute observation has convinced me the contrary. They are really oblivious/unintelligent/incapable of seeing the truth. 

Moreover, I have few to none antiwork friends who are capable to discern the exploitation and subjugation they are subjected to. They all seem to subscribe to the capitalist myth of working hard and ""making it"" in life. I'm also of a generation (42) when this was the only way of thinking apart from some marginalised groups and fringe opinions.

1. Your worth is your productivity
2. You cannot trust your own feelings and needs. 
3. There is always more that you could be doing. 

The Laziness Lie has its origins in Puritanical beliefs about motivation being a sign a person was blessed by God, as well as the indoctrination that was used to justify enslavement and keep working-class people separated along racial lines in the wake of abolition. 

Today, hatred of Laziness is used to justify all manner of biases and systems of oppression -- everything from how onerous we make it to access disability benefits, to the constant pressure we feel to ""stay informed"" by jamming our heads full of social media junk data, to white nationalist sentiments that the country is being stolen from them by lazy ""degenerates,"" and so much more. 

The book's listed as self-help, and does have some prescriptions for readers on how to set better work-life boundaries and unlearn the Laziness Lie where they can, but it ultimately advances the idea that we need way more systemic change to fully ensure that everyone has the freedom to stop working/overcommitting/being exploited.

If however I decide to do something myself, without anyone asking me to do it, I do it as fast and as good as I can.

It's like walking towards the kitchen, thinking ""I'm going to do the dishes"" (I mean these things need to happen) only to hear someone else say ""you're going to do the dishes, yes?"" It kills all motivation and mood and if you're like me, you simply don't do it anymore.

When there's money involved, people *think* they can control you. ""I give you $100 for this task. I need it by the end of the day.""

1528,"Now, even WFH has me feeling done with the whole thing","
TLDR: I had already been antiwork until I got a  temporary position in my field from home--which has been awesome. I may have fucked up and cost me the chance to stay employed and I'm back to being glum about everything again



I've been a member of this sub for awhile, and I guess I just need to vent to some who would understand where I'm at right now.

I recently rejoined the workforce after having a kid, feeling ambivalent about the state of my career and then ultimately the pandemic had kept me away for a total of 2 and a half years.

Then out of the blue I got kind of lucky and stumbled on to this opportunity to do something in my really specialized field remotely and completely online--which I had considered rare to impossible to find. The only caveat is that they were recruiting only temporarily for seasonal help as their volume would greatly increase over the holidays. They couldn't guarantee any opportunity to stay working with them after the first of the year, but also asked if I was looking for something long term, so it seemed like a possibility. They are also giving us seasonals a sprinkling of work right now even though it's after the 1st--keeping us dangling on in hope. Of course the 2 dozen or so others that were recruited withme are just as hungry as me to get this opportunity and I can tell that they all see this like I do--a rare find and something to fight for the chance to keep.

Them hiring me got me really motivated to work again and figured I would do my damndest to stand out and show that I was worthy of a permanent position. Also, working from home is amazing. Compared to the last decade or so in my field, it's a freaking cake walk. I had always needed to be on site for years and my past jobs had been physically, mentally and emotionally demanding. Usually fast paced with a good amount of stress. No work / life balance. 

Again, this online job has been an absolute breeze and a breath of fresh air. It doesn't pay quite as much as I had made before but in these times, I wasn't going to complain too much. $20 an hour is something I know a lot of people wish they had. It's using my defined skill set without the crappy face to face interactions with customers, co workers or management. No being told to smile. No having to worry about having a certain type clothes to wear to work. No long commute with transportation delays fucking up your arrival time. You get the picture. It really opened my eyes to the nature of work itself and firmed my belief that we have been whoring ourselves and our precious time out for corporations' benefit. For a measly income good enough to just live for working.

So here I am doing the most bang up job I can possibly do and hoping I stand out when I made a fatal mistake today. Last night as I was signing off from a shift I briefly checked my schedule to verify my in time today and saw that it was 1-6 pm. Cool. Shut my laptop and headed to bed. Well I'm an idiot because I had actually glanced at next week's schedule instead not realizing. I was really supposed to work from 8am to 1pm today and didn't realize it until an hour or two into working when I wanted to check my break schedule.

 I think the new schedule for the following week had just come out and the last time I accessed the app I was checking that and when I reopened to check my schedule I didn't take careful note of the week or actual date I was viewing. Stupid mistake I know but given everything going on these past few days maybe my mind has been a little distracted. Whatever not here to excuse my momentary stupidity. 

What really bothers me though is how much I fear what comes next for me now. I've been feeling physically sick about it all day and almost shaking. How stupid is that? Sure they could overlook this one infraction but I am not even fully employed there. 

They keep talking about how they are in the process of ""making decisions"" about their staffing needs for 2021.This could be a deciding factor in whether they decide to keep me among their permanent staff. I could have ruined my chance with this one stupid mistake. Seems dramatic I know but that's a potential reality.

Perhaps I'm just carrying over a little residual emotion  from when my previous job a couple of years ago terminated my employment right when I was about to go on maternity leave for some stupid technicality and it completely traumatized me. The termination caused me to lose my stored vacation pay and disability pay I was going to use to cover living expenses during maternity leave and it completely screwed me. I had to take out Cobra insurance and I was super stressed about the whole thing I ended up getting induced early because my blood pressure was high from the stress of being fired. 

Now I'm just sitting here today sick to my stomach about looking at my schedule wrong. I feel like I'm back in that place I was 2 years ago feeling the absolute terror of being jobless again.

 I decided to be forthcoming about it as soon as I realized I was working the wrong shift and immediately messaged my lead person on Microsoft Teams to tell them I screwed up. No one had even seemed to notice that I showed up 5 hours late when I made my sign on greeting--maybe I could have just kept working acting none the wiser and maybe no one would have even noticed on their end. But I felt that was way more risky and could get construed as me being sneaky so I told on myself lol. I even said that I wouldn't mind staying on to 6pm to take clients like I had originally thought i was scheduled. The lead was very matter of fact that we were just too slow to have extra people on and that I needed to clock out.

If this is it for me with this company at least I can say I have my integrity and I didn't try to hide my mistake. But again, why am I beating myself up so much about this one mistake! It doesn't define me as a professional. People do shit like this all the time. Send the wrong email. Show up to the wrong day for a meeting. Send out a false nuclear missile warning to an entire island of people causing a major shit storm. People make mistakes and this wasn't some huge thing that screwed the whole company over. I can't believe how physically ill this has made me all day. I can't even get up the nerve yet to write an apology email to my manager. I will leave that for the morning with a fresh cup of coffee.

My boss is American and no one from the team covers my scope.

I know this can sound like a brag for American folks, but my country by law has 30 days of mandatory vacations per year, which I get punished for if I don’t request 45 days before and/or if I don’t take 30 days inside a 12 month period beginning at the admission date. I can break it up until 3 leaves of 10 days each. 

Yet since I’m the only one who can do my job, I have to pretty much try to advance a full fucking month of work beforehand because I have no one to cover for me. And this is not the kind of work where nothing happens during my leave, so I have to exhaust every single scenario in a document file and hope my colleagues help, otherwise I get bad reviews if the objectives aren’t met.

As my American boss hasn’t taken this into account in his expectations of workload of me, I basically end up doing overtime “illegally”, as my company simply has a bank of hours per year overtime policy and it has to be 0 by may every year, so instead of being compensated financially I just get extra days off, for which I’d have to do the exact same fucking extra amount to work to be able to not work and still achieve my goals.

1560,Employers... suck. I was fired.,"I started working for my (ex) employer 3 days after I graduated from school a few years ago.

I always gave 110% and received great feedback on my performance reviews every year.

This past year I asked my boss for a $5K raise, which would still be $5,000/year LESS than my coworker who has the same title as me - although she has less experience in the field as me/has a degree irrelevant to the field of work... BUT she has more ""work"" experience. (She is 7 years older than me).

For more insight - I am 3 years out of school with 3 years of work experience (My degree was in accounting, and I worked 3 years as an accountant) ... my coworker is 11 years out of school, with a degree in Psychology and has 2 years of accounting work experience and various other non-related work experience prior to that.

My boss scoffed at the idea of giving me a $5K raise because ""people with your amount of experience do not get paid that much"".

My boss further insisted that, if I wanted a higher-paying job, I should seek for other employment opportunities... So I did.

Less than 1 month after receiving a perfect annual review from my employer - I was terminated. Immediately. The reason? My employer found out I was seeking other jobs...following her advise. (A company I interviewed with must have called and reference checked me, although I have no way of knowing as she refused to tell me how she knew.)

She also must have given me a poor reference because all jobs that I interviewed with sent me an automated ""Thank you for applying but you were not chosen... etc.""

Now I am sitting here with no job and nothing lined up.

The icing on the cake - she had me work an entire day and then told me I was fired at 4:00pm... after finishing my boss' reports for her that day.

He had no college diploma or past experience when he got the job. He just knew the right people. 

Half of my workplace tested positive for Covid the other day, and I was in direct contact with many of them. I was told that I still had to go to work, and I frequently have to pull double shifts because we are understaffed. I work 2 jobs, so I’m pulling well over 40-50 hours a week. I ranted to my friend about it, and she told me to “just get a better job.” To me this sounds like she’s putting the blame on me, instead of my corrupt workplace. Obviously I am trying to find a better job, but in the meantime I need to work to pay my bills. She used herself as a martyr and told me “Look at my jobs. They treat me great. Look at my husbands jobs. They treat him great. Not all jobs are terrible. You need to want it.”

1575,Studying while working and getting a degree to 'escape' wage slavery - tips?,"Hi, fellow haters of capitalism.

Feel free to skip this paragraph

Basically right now I'm doing some boring-ass factory job that a trained monkey could do in a week. There are some upsides though - I'm working completely by myself so I can go an entire shift without talking to anyone if I so desire. Also two to four 30 minute breaks per shift (that's not a typo). Doesn't sound that bad, right? Maybe, but that job is fucking mental torture. All I do is essentially walk around and push a button every 10 minutes or so, I then write down at what time I pushed the button, then I wait another 10 minutes, rinse and repeat. It perplexes me how can people do this shit for YEARS!!! I've been here for 2 months and I want to fucking shoot myself.

Anyways, I was lucky to be born in a country with free education, which means I can go to university as long as I pass the admissions in June (IT degree, the scope of the admission exam is all of High school math). The thing is, it's been so long since I last studied and work just leaves me so fucking drained. I can barely muster the energy to study for 30 minutes/day and I just feel so guilty for not doing more with the limited free time I have. I'm a little worried I'm not gonna make it. Also I have ADHD which doesn't really help.

Now you might be thinking - How does this help you escape wage slavery? Well, it doesn't, but I'd rather be a wage slave in an air conditioned office than in a noisy factory pushing buttons. And I might even get a chance to freelance or maybe just save faster so I can live off saving for longer.

I'm having troubles with my sleep schedule, especially morning shift. Waking up at 5AM is just not fucking normal and when I get home, I'm too sleepy to do anything. Anything I can do to better my

1579,"I loved not working during the pandemic, but I feel guilty af for several reasons.","2015 - 2019 - Completed my Arts Degree

Mid 2019 - Mid 2020 - My Gap Year (ruined by Coronavirus)

Ever since I finished my degree, I had no clue what to do. I looked for jobs related to my degree but I wasn't interested. I loved doing my degree but it had no real prospects. Anyway, I worked hard in two retail jobs (I genuinely gave my all in those ungrateful places), I wanted to save as much as I can for a trip somewhere in 2020. I had told my parents (who were hellbent on me getting a proper job and securing my future) that the Gap Year will allow me to think about what I really wanted to do. Before the pandemic hit, during my Gap Year, I considered 2 different courses. But I didn't end up continuing either of them.

Then the pandemic hit and the lockdown came into force when I was 3/4 into my Gap Year.

My parents pressured me to leave Main Job as it was dangerous (Side Job closed due to the pandemic). I had enough cash to spare to survive months. I really enjoyed being at home, waking up when I wanted, watching so much TV, doing my hobbies, listening to music etc. At times my mental health was bad but overall I really liked it.

Anyway, by Mid 2020 my Gap Year ended, if everything had gone to plan I would have solidified on a course to pursue after my Trip. In reality, I still hadn't found anything to do, the lockdown was still in place and the world - a mess. I also lost my Side Job who let me go after reopening. My parents were still asking me every week if I found anything, I kept saying I'm looking. I researched for several weeks before I found something. It was just an okay course. It was a bit boring in fact. But the job that I could get at the end, pays alright so I decided to go for it. It's a self-paced course that takes most students 9 months however you have 2 years to finish it and I would receive tutor advice for 2 years. I aimed to complete it in 9 months (lol).

It has now been 6 months and I've barely halfway through 1/8 modules.

I have been procrastinating and I feel like shit. I've been watching so much stuff, just chilling out, that I didn't want to do any work. My parents regularly ask for updates and I say I'm progressing well (I wasn't) and lie which module I was on. It's come to the point now where they think I'm halfway through the course, now.

Thinking back, I liked working at my two jobs because I was there to achieve a goal (make money for the trip) and I dreading dealing with customers and just being there. I realised I didn't really like working, it was just something to do I guess. I just want to sit at home, chill and exist.

Both me and my friend have mental problems and suffer from general fatigue and low energy. Despite this, he seems to be constantly working on something. He's in school taking some advanced science course in hopes of getting a dream job in the future. He's also keeping up a job way below minimum wage for his state. He gets mountains of homework and seems to be doing it continuously, even during winter break and even while at work. Me and another friend wanna hang out with him but he generally tries to do homework at the same time as hanging out. He drinks lots of caffeine and has prexisting problems with caffeine addiction and overdose.

Understandably this is bad for his mental health. Less importantly, it's sad to see him working constantly even when he's supposed to be taking breaks. But despite me asking him repeatedly, he doesn't want to stop or even attempt to streamline or reprioritise. He's determined to keep working hard for perhaps ten+ years to get this dream job. I don't want to tell him to abandon his dreams, but I also deeply care for this person and I feel useless just watching him work himself to death. He vents about the stress frequently (the stress is causing him to have muscle tension problems that require medicine to cope with). 

His mother isn't a great help as she encourages this workaholic behaviour. His dad is also a typical narcissistic dogshit money hoarder manager who lives in another state makes $300k+ a year (which he doesn't give a cent of to his wife or son).

On 2 different occasions, I left a job for a better position, more experience, and in this case now, better pay. I enjoy the work I do, but my company abuses me by overloading me with work (2 years now) and underpaying me. We've had numerous discussions regarding pay and it's always empty promises. 

I have now decided to switch careers, higher pay, less hours. Also a field I think I would enjoy. However, suddenly my current job situation seems better, manager is suddenly starting to make (empty) promises again and trying to encourage me to stay, talking of all the opportunities. Workload seems lighter (maybe its in my mind). 

I think he gets the feeling that I'm thinking of moving on, and is trying to talk me into staying before I make decisions.

I feel a lot of anxiety about not working, I was wondering if you guys could help me cement my decision.

1608,It’s not (just) about making capitalists rich.,"Sure, some people get rich (e.g., Jeff Bezos) by paying their workers a low wage that generates several multiples of income and stock value to the owners of the business.  And yes, this is all made possible by a system that concentrates power at the top and leaves individuals in the middle and bottom without the leverage and resources needed to improve their situation.  But there is something else going on here; it’s not just about capitalism or evil rich people.  

Modern society is built on careers, jobs, and work. We, as a whole, are riding a high speed train to nowhere and don’t know how to stop it.  Does the world really need Red Robin, Olive Garden, Applebee’s, Chili’s, and Fridays?  How about Acer, Asus, HP, Dell, and Lenovo.  There are so many useless, redundant, products and business out there.  Why? The answer is that our system forces people to compete for jobs or start a business because that’s what it takes to eat food and sleep indoors. These jobs are as phony and unnecessary as most businesses except for this artificial construct of ""earning a living.""

The modern system of business and employment is obsolete, however, shifting to a model befitting today’s technology and societal needs would shock the world and challenge everything we know about life.  People make a choice everyday to perpetuate this ridiculous rat race with winners and losers (mostly losers) scrounging for crumbs because change is scary.  

Let’s face facts, the world has been running at 25% capacity for the last 9 months and, other than the public health issues of COVID, unemployment and business struggles are what causes the most heartache.

I’m not lazy, I just know there’s more to life than paychecks.","I’m so relieved to have finally found a community of people who feel the same, since most of the people in my life probably think of me as lazy, dispassionate, etc. 

After I graduated college, I realized the field that I had chosen was held together by overworked and underpaid (or unpaid) interns, so I got the hell out of there. 

I taught myself graphic design with the intention of building a career as a freelancer since that’s what all my friends were doing, and it appeared to be the most self sufficient way of living. 

Boy was I wrong. I spiraled into depression and anxiety around having to constantly turn myself, my personality, into something marketable in order to gain new clients and put food on the table. I side-hustled as a delivery driver and worked 60+ hr weeks between driving and designing just to barely cover my rent. 

So, I got the hell out of there too. I went to therapy and worked for years on unlearning the “I’m just too lazy and unmotivated narrative” that not being able to get freelance design client hammered into me. 

I’m now fortunate enough to have had a W2 job for almost two years now that pays just enough for me to live, and is just undemanding enough to let me pursue my personal goals and hobbies in my free time.

I wouldn’t say I have good work/life balance, but rather I have good life/work balance. Why does work have to come first? Why does career have to be everyone’s main focus? Why can’t we simply exist as humans? (Rhetorical questions, since we all know the answer here)

It's so miserable. It's mind-numbing, soul crushing, physically exhausting work. I keep telling myself that I just need to stick with it for a while, and keep applying to other jobs, and I'll be able to get out soon. 

I started feeling more and more miserable every day. I was crying before work more and more often. I started to panic daily just thinking about returning to work. I can't enjoy my days off anymore, there is just a constant cloud of misery and anger hanging over me. I started having panic attacks. 

Today I had a panic attack during the beginning of my shift. I hid in the bathroom for a while to try and calm down. When I returned to work, a manager started grilling me about where I'd been. I was incredibly shaken up &amp; I was just keeping my mouth shut, nodding along with tears coming out of my eyes. She wouldn't leave me alone - she started berating me, condescendingly treating me like a child, pulling up my metrics and saying I was ""committing wage theft"" and not working fast enough. She said if I didn't complete x amount of orders within an hour, then I'd be ""in trouble"".

I tried. I did. I can't afford to lose the job. But after half an hour, I saw that it was impossible to finish in time.

1628,"Job tried to fire me for No Call No Show, even though I did indeed email the attendance inbox.","I work for a call center. We are currently working from home and the policy for call offs is to email the attendance department and cc your direct supervisor. I was taking calls when I got an email from the department manager telling me to stop my calls and get on a zoom with them. They proceeded to tell me that I was being terminated for a no call no show. I asked them to provide me with the date of the supposed infraction as I always follow the protocol. They provided me with the date and I searched through my emails to find that I had indeed sent an email that day before my shift start time indicating that I would not be in that day. Manager asked me to forward that email to them and got an attitude with me, saying ""well it does look like you followed the proper protocols I'm not sure how that got marked as ncns so we'll get that removed."" Watching that manager have to eat their words was so satisfying. So here's a lesson kiddos, NEVER delete your work emails, you never know when they'll come in handy. I would have been fired had I not saved that email, even though they were 100% wrong.

of 5 January at 06:21 - A for Android

For anyone who isn't on Tiktok, | wanted to share a
story.

1 week ago, a Tiktok user with Parkinsons posted a
video expressing anger over how tiny the pills for
treating Parkinsons are because it makes them really
difficult to pick up when someone has something like,
you know, Atkinson's.

4 days ago a guy who directs country music video
for a living, and was previously most famous on
Tiktok for knowing obscure facts about Snappple,
taught himself how to use Fusion 360 (a design and
modeling tool) so he could design a pill bottle that
solved the problem.

Problem was though that he didn't own a Of printer so
he posted a video of his design and offered to share
schematics with anyone who wanted to test it and or
improve upon it. All schematics are open source.

3 days ago, dozens of engineers and Of printer
enthusiast had begun working on the project and
started refining and taking to get tolerances where
they needed to be and ensuring that it actually met
the needs of those it was being designed for.

13 hours ago, there is a working prototype, it has ""less
plastic than your average McDonald's toy, and should
be prices as such"". The original designer has gotten a
patent attorney to ensure it remains open source and
the patent itself will be donate to the Michael J. Box
Foundation.

   

In the mean time, for daytime who needs one now and
doesn't want to wait until the manufacturing in scale
begins, they can get one at cost from the engineers
printing them at home.

(Edit: | have put a link to the link tree for Brian
Alldridge, the guy who first designed the bottle, in the
comments. The first 2 entries are links to into on the
bottle.)

If no one is willing to work to grow food we'll all stave and have no dignity, so how does that work?  Therefore, because we must work for food, and we need food to sutvive, work is a fundamental part of existence not some chore you bear.

I think you can still be against higher levels of work, or miserable work like in a boring factory, but understand that someone needs to work to grow your food, thus you are not owed a life without any work just for being born.  The minimum work is acquiring food.  Everyone must do this, even if it is just a baby crying, that baby is putting in work to acquire food.

I am an office secretary, the other 2 people who come into the office are the manager and his wife, they also bring their child at the moment because schools are shut.

Wow oh my gosh it’s been amazing, literally so chilled out and I’ve learned so much. Being treated like an actual human being while working 9-5 is something that has never happened before. I can go to the bathroom when I need, snack whenever I want to, as long as I’m working I can have my phone on me and make those lengthy personal phone calls to my car insurance and things I’ve been putting off because I never had the time. 

I get an hour paid lunch, something I’ve never had before. And it’s actually a full hour, if I come back early they say “you’re early you still have another 5 minutes” or whatever but because they are so respectful it makes me want to keep getting on with the work?! 

It’s just such a breath of fresh air. I use my paid lunch hour to sometimes take a walk, see my boyfriend who lives nearby, catch up on animal crossing, eat etc. There’s a Tesco up the road so I could do my food shopping during the day.

I always was set as working as a children’s entertainer which I still do on the weekends!! And I can use my paid holiday or unpaid days off to take shifts doing character performing too. 

Working for my dad was never an option for me as I thought it sounded boring and I wouldn’t be good at it having dyspraxia and stuff but it’s actually been a dream come true.

Before this, I was at a small factory 9-4:30 on minimum wage Monday - Friday which was awful. So I told dad I’d rather work for him and I’m so glad I did.

I am aware of my privilege that I had a job handed to me and I am playing the system a bit but I think we can all agree you have to do what you can to survive in this world. I probably could’ve per-suede my career in character performing but I couldn’t afford my bus to college and had to drop out early.  Things might actually work out now I’ve taken the easy route.

1664,I'm not a slave.,"I'm immunocompromised, I have Crohn's disease. My girlfriend has health issues as well. My doctor ordered me to stay home back in April. Well, recently we discovered my girlfriend is pregnant. Three months as of this posting. 
My job is at a grocery store. They said as long as I keep sending doctor's notes in, my job is safe. Every couple months I meet with my doctor remotely, and she extends my time off. My job hasn't replied to any of my emails since probably September. I'm assuming I still have the job, but it would be nice if they'd reply.

After roughly eight months off of work, I found a job at a factory. With the pregnancy and the worry of my job just dropping my health insurance, I went back to work. 

I started this past Monday at a factory. So many people not wearing masks, or wearing them incorrectly. But I need a job to help take care of my family. Sure there's unemployment. But that won't last forever.

Tuesday I heard rumors we'd have to work ten hours a day every weekend now. I was already doing nine hours a day. Sure enough. Thursday morning, we're told, every day for the foreseeable future. Ten hours a day. No days off.

I left. I quit on the spot. I'm not a slave. I hope I made the right decision. I'm still waiting to hear from my state on what to do with the unemployment extension. But I refuse to be a slave.",False,kuonyq,SaintAnarchist,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kuonyq/im_not_a_slave/,19,7

Work takes even longer!","I remember one of the reasons I started being depressed at 13 is knowing I'd be a wageslave, spending my days hating so many hours of the day, just like at school but for even more hours at work.

And it's been like more than 12 years since then and that feeling only got worse.

I honestly don't understand how people aren't absolutely terrified and crushed by this situation. I literally would be less scared of a serial killer alien bear trying to capture me and torture me than the very crushing fact that I'll spend \~8 hours a day (+commute and time to get ready), 5 days a week for the rest of my life being a wageslave. 8 hours a day when I'm actively miserable, doing things I hate, taking orders from assholes. All for a pittance of a paycheck, just enough so I can come crawling back another day. Just enough so people can tell me that others have it worse, at least I have a job!

Hell, it doesn't even resume to those 8 hours, I hate this existence so much that even Saturday I'm anxious and depressed about having to work on Monday.

1669,"For those spreading around ""learn to code"", be very careful.","For about half of 2020, I was spending some time studying web development in the hopes of a better life. I ended up leaving partly due to a developing disinterest in the field and my own ineptitude, but there was another reason: the work culture seemed extremely toxic

I was using a free online resource called The Odin Project. The curriculum is excellent and is maintained quite well by a passionate volunteer community. The issue is, the community. Elitism seems to be the norm in this field (as you can see in places like r/cscareerquestions), and that was no exception for this community. 

I was in the Discord for it for the longest time, and I went to them for help with various things like setting up Linux dual boot, understanding some quirks of Javascript, etc. and they were good there, but whenever you started a conversation about working in the field, that's when it got concerning. 

There was a time when this guy got his first job in the field and he was excited. He mentioned that it paid pretty low comparatively (about $31k a year), but he wasn't complaining because it was his first one and that salary was enough for him in his situation. Instead of being happy for him, some of the people who work in the field started belittling him for settling so badly, saying he should have negotiated harder, saying that working for such a low salary is going to screw himself in the future because other employers will think he was paid low because he wasn't a good worker, etc. 

I defended this guy, saying that I personally would be ecstatic to make $31k a year because that's double what I make now. I mean shit I could probably live on that for life since I don't want to have kids. It ended up started an entire debate about how they said that you should see more worth in yourself, where I responded ""why does one's salary judge your worth? How does he even know how much he's worth as an employee if he's never worked in the field before?"" and they responded ""you studying the subject and making projects shows your worth. Short selling yourself for such a low salary is damaging because you need to see that you are worth more than that.

Idk, it came across as EXTREMELY ""better than thou"" coming from somebody who claims to make six figures after 2 years in the industry. I know this is just one instance but I warn all of you to be cautious, it seems that programmers are extremely judgmental over things like that.

Just so I can be free and the endless pressure stops. Bigger picture, I wait for and countdown to weekends and above all PTO. Obviously PTO is limited but I try always book some as soon as my last pto finished. I.e. when I got back after the Christmas holidays I immediately booked more time ofr but I have to wait 3 months for it. It's all I think about now. 

Any way it's gotten to the point where this feeling of waiting is inextricably linked to work. So during my time ofr evenings and weekends I refuse to do anything that involves waiting. I won't even order nice things for myself because then I get the feeling I'm waiting for them to arrive. 

If someone ""ruins"" my pto I literally can't take it. Like when I spent some pto with my mil who threw a tantrum all I could think was ""but I waited so long for this. Now you're making me wait to go home"" so I just left because I can't abide waiting for time to feel nice. The pto is the nice time.

1678,I didn't even know this sub existed.. I dread retail.,"Its like the title says. I generally dread someone calling me telling me someone needs help in some aisle or that some disgruntled customer needs help and I have to diffuse the situation and figure out how to help them ""to ensure we don't lose a customer"" even though they treat my coworkers and I like shit.

I just wanted a simple part time job with minimum wage and it just grew into this thing where I feel stuck in and even I see it in some of my managers' eyes how tiring these days are. I don't want to be in their position just cuz I need more money, I was already offered ""a full time position and better benefits"" 

They were asking with this half-assed (for lack of a better word) humor. As if it was some sort of bargain. When I respectfully declined the manager just sighed a deep sigh, looked down for second, looked back to the computer and said, ""Now I have to look for someone"". 

I like my coworkers and managers, most of them are cool peeps. I don't like the company and all the corny corporate talk that I think binds everyone. I try but.. along with the customers, the retail life isn't really well for me. Its kind of embarrassing to point out I struggle with Bipolar and some days can be a struggle to keep stable and make sure I'm not agitated enough to feel like I'd blow a fuse if someone even spoke to me the wrong way.

I have been late so much I feel anytime they call me into the manager's office I'll be fired (which I expect will happen soon) but most times turns out its just a corporate thank you note for working these hard times and a mint or something.

I don't know that there's something else I can do without a degree that doesn't drain me. I've thought about going back to college and get some general degree so I can take an easy office job but... this goes against the grain of what I want to do for my future and I'm afraid college isn't for me.

If not you get the sweet ass deal (/s) of taking a “2 for 1 or a 3 for 1” which means of a Dr wrote you out for 3 days. You can take all 3 and you will “only” be written up for missing one day. All scenarios are unpaid. 

3: There are no windows in the building. You have no clue what the day looks like until you leave. 

4: The plant is so big that you cant even make it to your car for a lunch break to sit in peace and solitude. It takes &gt;10 minutes to get out to the parking lot

5: They schedule weekends and make it mandatory with zero time to prepare and their asses are covered in the employee handbook citing that as “business needs”

1700,My colleague and my company showed me why I will always be antiwork,"I'm sharing this to show that dedicating your life to your job just isn't worth it. 

So I used to work with a guy called 'M'. M had been at the company 20 years and was waaaay over dedicated. He would come in at 6am, leave at 6/7pm and go home and do more work (he told us this very proudly). Most of us did 8am to 4pm. He always put work first, to the detriment of his marriage, so now not having his family to go home to his work became his everything. 

He'd scoff at any of us leaving early or having a sick day and moan about the lazy younger generation. His manager would have to force him to take holidays because he'd refuse to take them, he'd panic SO MUCH at the thought of other people covering his work.

 I ended up being the person covering his work plus my own duties which I didn't mind, but I never put in his hours. He was brilliantly intelligent and excellent at what he did but he was so detailed driven that a job that would take anyone else an hour would take him three. So actually it didn't require all the hours he did. 

He specialised in a specific part of the job while I was lower down and more of a generalist, but I made sure I learned enough to cover other people's work if I had to, plus there's one part of my job that for now only I can do (it's easy enough but it just so happens that the only other person who could do it left before covid hit).

So covid comes, and M is put on furlough while I'm not. Fine, I cover his stuff for now, I definitely can't do the work to his high standards but it gets done and this goes on for months. Eventually the company realise they don't need M, yes he's the most dedicated, the most knowledgeable, the hardest worker - but he can be covered for and having been there 20 years he's expensive. Whereas I'm lower down the ranks, my salary is considerably lower, and I can cover more areas plus one that currently no one else can do. So I'm still here, and he was made redundant from job he dedicated his life to. It's kind of fucked up isn't it?

I seriously hope M realises that life outside of work is way more important, and I hope he's spending his enormous redundancy package living the high life (of as high as you can in these times).",False,kuepog,crumblingchoccookies,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kuepog/my_colleague_and_my_company_showed_me_why_i_will/,22,1

   * shortens workdays
   * saves energy
   * reduces traffic and makes roads safer for biking/walking
* 24-hour week
   * flexible hours, can be spread across any day or time if possible
   * 6x4h days, 4x6h days, 3x8h days, 2x12h days, uneven mix
   * the extra 16 hours per week (about 2.3 hours per day) not spent at work can be used for all the things you really want to do
* The same amount of work would likely get done
   * People often finish early and waste time at their shift instead of enjoying themselves
   * Automation can fill some jobs and people won't need to work as much anyway
* Minimum wage of $26 (minimum salary of $32k per year). 
   * It won't hurt the corporations, with CEOs making hundreds of times more than employees.
   * $20k per year for the unemployed (equivalent to $16 an hour for 24 hours a week)
* Tax the rich
   * money toward free college and healthcare
   * improvement in pretty much everything paid for by taxes
* No, people would not get bored
   * socialization, art, education, hobbies, helping the community, relaxation, travel, exercise, parenting, organizing for change
   * who said you're not allowed to work more if that's your thing (but *why though* lol)

1728,Finally got fired and wanted to share how I exploited my employer,"**Hey all, most people think I’m a bum for my actions, but I think I’m pretty cool with how I treated my most recent job, I hope you feel the same.** 

**I got to my most recent job in 2018, and a month into the job they flew me out to California for a week for some conference. I had a fun time with some people there and saw California for the first time. I miss walking to In-N-Out and getting a milkshake every couple of nights. A few months later I went on vacation to Japan and Singapore for 3 weeks, and I still received paychecks during those weeks lol. It had been a dream of mine to visit those countries and I did so on company dime.** 

**I got back from the trips and it was time to work. My work had me going to cities and looking at buildings. After I finished my work for the day I would usually chill in the city I was at or hangout with friends if they were near. Fast forward to March and quarantine hit, so I started working from home. I worked from home for a few weeks before I was furloughed. I took this as time to focus on myself and get back into some hobbies.** 

**Trading and investing have been hobbies of mine since high school but I never had the time to fully put some time into it. I finally started a Roth IRA in April and it’s up to $23k now. I learned a lot about trading and such and designed a trading model that has given me my weekly salary (or more) from options consistently for a few months. In May I was off furloughed and set to return again. I slacked off completely from May to just now lol. I would go to the supermarket with my family, play video games, trade, build LEGO, continue learning Japanese, and study Python, all on company dime.** 

**A typical “work day” for me would be 9-5 if I cared about the job, but I woke up at 9:25 to see how the stock market was doing, trade for a bit, and then nap from 10 to 11. I would work on my interests and eat from 11 to 3pm, and then I would work for an hour or two before going to the gym. I eventually built some cool programs that would go on my resume, and I made a Twitter account for my trading that has paid me already and I hope to make it an actual company one day.** 

**Earlier in the week I was skipping work and went to do some errands. I was at the doctor’s office and my manager called me to say I was fired. My reaction showed that I didn’t care at all and I was so proud of myself. In the time that I was focused on myself while I had this job I found out how to get paid a good living while doing things that are actually interesting to me. I hated that job and what I was forced to do. I cried driving one time when I had to drive 10 hours in a day twice in one week. No more will I do things I don't like. I’m currently looking for a job with programming or stocks that’ll actually interest me, and using my options model to help pay bills while I find a job. Until then, I hope you can all find my story interesting.

Just found out recently that my boss knowingly and willingly exposed me and my coworkers to covid. My manager lives with her mother, who had covid, and my boss still asked her to come to work and covered up and lied about the fact that she did this. My manager never got a covid test, we weren't told to get tested, and no attempt at quarantine was made by my manager.

I've been looking for a new job for two months now and haven't gotten a single interview. I begged my last job to take me back and they shot me down. I'm grasping, applying to jobs I have no interest or experience in. I have to pay rent but I can't stay at this job. I've given up trying to find a job with benefits, I've moved onto survival mode.

1734,Failing my first semester of university. Don't know what to do.,"I'm in the UK, 19-years old, First year in Uni.

Before the lockdown started in March, I was in my last year of Sixth Form. I was severely depressed for two years prior, but would numb myself because i've never been able to open up to anyone about my feelings. I never handed in any assignments in my final year, used to fake sick to stay home, would cry in the bathroom at school, always had my earphones in underneath a beanie during my classes because I needed stimulation. 

I never wanted to go to university, my parents forced me into my course. I started the semester in September, and haven't had any motivation to attend a single online class. I've skipped since September, haven't handed in any assignments so I have 0s. I haven't done any homework, quizzes or lab work. I have a big project due in 14 days worth 70% of my grade, and an oral exam due in two-days  also worth 70% of my grade. I'm fucked for both units because i've done jackshit since September. 

On top of that I haven't even told my parents that i'm failing. I've just been lying to them, telling them that i'm up-to-date with my assignments, and studying even though i'm using video games and entertainment to escape my life because those are the only things that keep me sane. I'm suicidal without a plan, and unable to do anything because I have zero motivation. 

It's not laziness. This affects every aspect of my life. I'm not even able to do the things that I want to do. I just don't see the future consequences of my inaction. I used to be able to get through sixth form and secondary school with pressure from deadlines, but depression has killed that. I feel nothing when deadlines pass now.

I believe that i'm struggling with ADHD-C, Autism, Depression and Anxiety. My anxiety is crippling. I have Asian parents who don't understand mental illness, so I have no clue how to explain ADHD, Autism, Depression and Anxiety to them without them just assuming that i'm lazy because I play video games instead of studying when one thing is clearly more fun than the other. I feel guilty for wasting £9,000, and because i've not received any diagnosis and i'm not on any form of medication I don't know what to do. Especially because I live in a tier-4 area and i'm in lockdown.

I never wanted to go to university in the first place, I have zero interest in my course and i'm so far behind. I wouldn't mind working a dead-end job for minimum wage and working on my dreams even though I have zero work experience. However, that isn't realistic in this shit world that requires you to be a robot just to survive. 

I'm an INFP btw, don't know if you really care. I hate the entire concept of working and school, and I really don't understand how people are motivated by it and actually enjoy it. I wouldn't mind working, but the whole concept of work and school makes me want to kill myself. 

I have dreams of being a YouTuber or Singer, but those are unrealistic pipe dreams. So I see no other option other than killing myself (I don't have a plan to, just telling myself that gives me peace). 

I'm sure that I don't have a neurotypical brain, and it sucks that we're in a global pandemic right now. I don't know if my parents would let me drop out since they're paying for it, or if they would let me take a gap year so I can sort myself out mentally.

I'm not saying they don't, I'm saying that they, like everyone, deserve the basics of human life no matter what. I understand that piracy under our current, outdated economic system hurts them, but this is not a good reason to be against piracy as a whole. 

The ability to share the worlds information to one another is a beautiful thing and should be defended at all costs. The fact that we're letting Capitalism prevent us from sharing knowledge and happiness to one another is *putrid*. Nobody is ever going to stop piracy, regardless of how many fuck wits want to pretend that sharing is the wrong thing to do. Digital files no longer have quantitative value. No one has to like it. It's not subjective. You *can* copy digital files, and people are definitely going to. This fact destroys the entire concept of Capitalism, and that is a beautiful thing.

I can labor and genuinely enjoy it when I am laboring for myself and my small community. I enjoy growing food, chopping wood, tending to my chickens, and even building my cabin that I am in the process of building. I love it, and all of this is extremely rewarding. However, every time I've ever had a 'regular job' in a waged or salaried position at a corporation or any job of the sorts within the system where I am a mere cog in a gigantic machine performing incredibly alienating and specialized labor and then having the majority of the value that my labor produces extracted from me, I get extremely suicidal after a matter of weeks. 

I do not care about money, and I do not wish to have an income so I can buy things. Im very privileged to own land and already have the money to pay property tax on it for the rest of my life, so I will not have to work for another man again. If I do make money, it will be through the occasional freelance film or photography, but I will not be dependant on it to avoid homelessness and starvation. 

If you are looking for a way out of this soul crushing rat race, I highly urge you to consider homesteading.

I'd be applying for a job with an actual benefit to society and it would even pay better than the job I have now.

Of course, I still have to go through the motions of investing my own time into drafting a letter to explain why they should give the job to me, showcasing that I stand out from all the other applicants like I'm in a fucking talent show in which the winner gets to work to ensure rent payments.

The deadline for the application was the 14th. I was working on my letter when I pull up the website to check the listing, just to make sure that my highlighted competencies correspond to the demands in the listing and it's... closed. They just fucking closed the listing. No explanation. It just says 'closed'.

I've now invested hours of my own time on something that is instantly completely irrelevant because of this bullshit system in which a worker has to invest their own time and resources to show an employer that they are worthy of providing value to them and the realization's just hit me hard.

1765,Asked for a raise recently [rant],"I’ve been working at the same job on and off for about three years. When I come home from college for winter or summer break, I’m put back on the schedule to make a little extra cash between semesters. I’m a trusted, valued employee and my boss often reminds me of as much, and I am one of four out of twelve employees at this location trusted with a store key despite the fact that I only work there for a month to three at a time. 

For brief backstory, the coffee shop I work at is very understaffed. Where we used to be open until 9 pm, we’re now only open until 7 pm and, before I came back, hours were reduced to being open until 1 pm with a staff of just four people. The management of the coffee shop is, in my opinion, sloppy and, in the states opinion, illegal. 

Among many other past offenses, my boss has forbidden us from discussing our wages (illegal), discouraged us from taking breaks (illegal) by telling us that ‘Oh, we just don’t take breaks here!’ and only scheduling two baristas for any given shift so we can’t leave the store without abandoning the other, and disallowed us from sitting in the cafe area while not providing any seating in the back and disciplining us when she finds us sitting on the tables or floor in the kitchen where the customers can’t see us during our eight hour shifts (probably illegal?).

When I came back in the beginning of December, I immediately knew someone had reported her behavior. Within the first fifteen minutes of my first shift back, my boss informed me that we are required to take our (federally mandated) breaks because she ‘had no idea you guys weren’t taking breaks!’ and, suddenly, enough people were scheduled for us to do so. Because of Covid, our cafe is closed and she said that the couches were treated as a place to sit when we weren’t working. Everything seemed a lot better. 

Maybe it’s the rise of communist ideologies in my brain or my general discontent with capitalism, but I quickly realized that I was being asked to do *much* more work than I was being compensated for. On top of me training the mostly new staff on tasks they should have learned during their actual training with our boss, I was given the title of Senior Barista, making me responsible for my and the other employees side work being completed while i was on shift and locking up and opening the store when I worked.

I know being a barista is a relatively cushy job, but I get paid minimum wage ($7.25/hour in my state) and my back has been in constant pain for a month straight from standing all day. In addition, our boss told other employees that business has never been better because the Starbucks near us has shut down for a quarantine period. I also am often closing, because other baristas have time commitments at night, where I walk away with $5-$10 in tips as opposed to the morning shift’s $30-$40. 

So, about a week ago I asked my boss for a raise. My boss, we’ll call her Sarah, owns the franchise location I work at of a small chain of coffee shops. The following is basically how the conversation went with me having memorized the first thing I said to reduce my anxiety about talking to her about it. 

Me: I’ve been thinking a lot lately about my worth to Company, and between being a Senior Barista, training new employees, functioning as a manager when you’re not in the store, I my labor is worth more than I’m being paid. Last night, I closed the store alone and not only was it done well, I completed it earlier than most other employees could. While I have no issue with the fact that I closed the store alone, the fact that I did and that you trusted me to do so shows how valuable my labor is to Company. These are just a few of the reasons that, after three years of hard work, I am asking for a raise to reflect this. 

Sarah: I agree that your labor is valuable to Company, and I appreciate everything you do, but we just don’t have a structure set up for giving raises. When we formally establish a title that comes with a raise, we can talk. 

Me: I thought that was the function of Senior Barista? To show that we’re the more experienced team members who have more responsibility. 

Sarah: Well, we’ve also had issues in the past of some employees getting paid more than others and discussing that, leading to employees asking for a raise and quitting when I tell them they don’t work hard/well enough to play one. 

(I started to get what she was saying and played along.)

Me: I don’t plan on discussing my wage with other employees. 

Sarah: Well, I know you would t do something like that and of course I would never ask that of you (haha), but so close to the holidays is such a stressful time for me and my family and I’m sure understand. 

Me: I understand that you’re busy, but I’ve put in a lot of hard work for Company and I think you know I would only talk to you about this if it was something I really believed in. 

Sarah: Well, how about we talk about it the next time you come back? I’m sure we’ll have something figured out by then! (I had already told her I most likely wouldn’t be returning because I’ll be graduating from college soon)

So, I took the hint, thanked her for her time, and hung up. Recently, one of my coworkers who worked at a franchise location owned by someone different told me that at their old store, the title of Senior Barista always comes with a $1/hour raise. 

So, now I don’t really know what to do. I’ve been trying to discipline myself into only doing minimum wage level work, but that just fucks over my coworkers who are also making minimum wage. I guess I’m just frustrated and wanted to rant to likeminded people? idk",False,kre943,caraknowsbest,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kre943/asked_for_a_raise_recently_rant/,1,1

1767,How to build a voluntary safety net,"I'll be upfront and say I don't believe in the inherent goodness of people - if a voluntary safety net was created, it would largely attract those who are looking to do as little as possible &amp; have more potential takers than givers. 

I think it would be a good idea to give $$$ to people who are stuck in a bad system (like minimum wage in America that doesn't pay enough to live) so they could get a basic qualification &amp; climb up the ladder a few rungs. I live in Australia so we already have a decent safety net, if people want to rise through effort they can do it. But in third world countries &amp; America it seems like people at the bottom are trapped. 

Even with democracy there's no party that wants to fix a broken system so being politically active seems like a waste of time, that's why solutions like a voluntary safety net that bypasses government seem attractive - but it has to be designed in a way that works with human nature. If it was just something like everyone working contributes 10% of their income &amp; this is split between those who currently don't have jobs, this scheme would be finished within a couple of months. Mostly due to freeloaders wrecking it for everyone else, those people who had no intention of ever getting work. So if you had a voluntary safety net it would have to exclude those who only wanted to take &amp; not give - it would have to be exclusive. And there are some people who aren't freeloaders but have disabilities &amp; are just not able to work - would anyone be happy to support them if they weren't family (I'd like to say yes but they'd have to make up a small % of the network else again people wouldn't want to join). 

One idea for a network is that to join everyone puts in 5% of their annual income to start with - this will attract those who aren't living a hand to mouth existence, those who are in a position to contribute. Then people who are currently trapped but can see a way out of it can make their case to the network for $ to improve their lives. The network votes on how to divvy the cash. If the person given the $ successfully pulls themself out of poverty then they are given an invitation to join the network &amp; are expected to contribute a portion of their salary. If members get into financial strife they will have priority over non network members - but all money will be allocated by voting, but eventually the voting could be replaced via a computer algorithm. Members could also vote on how much to donate to those with disabilities.

The thing I don't like about the above is how complicated it is. If you were to design a voluntary safety net, how would you do it?",False,krem1d,Park_Disastrous,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/krem1d/how_to_build_a_voluntary_safety_net/,2,1

1770,"Work culture and ""Overtime"" in some blue collar jobs","This is just a rant. I used to be a truck driver but quit due to the bulls**t of the industry. It is not a healthy, happy, nor conductive industry for happiness. The driving is the easy and fun part. Everything else sucks. Sure the money can be good sometimes,  but you sell your SOUL to this job. 

I saw this post, about a guy saying that he was done trucking, stating his reasons. 

Well someone pulled up this post history and found his rantings about having a local job saying 

""OP was complaining in earlier posts about having to work 12 hours a day 5 days a week doing a local job. I think OP clearly wasn't cut out for it because that doesn't sound too fucking bad if you ask me.""

Someone followed up quoting the responder
""-12 hours a day 5 days a week doing a local job.

On what planet is that a bad deal""

This is standard in the industry. I worked some days 14 hours over the road, since that's the cap. When I worked for a local beverage company, I worked 12-14 hours a lot of days, unloading heavy merchandise(think lifting 20 lbs of beverages for hours). I hated that. Sure $$$ but also, anger, depression, etc. 

It seems to me, that in a lot of companies with blue collar labor, that overtime is a ""luxury"" and is something that's praised. All you do when you get off is eat, maybe exercise,  and if you're getting a full night's sleep, then sleep. Back again tomorrow.

1771,"Charles Bukowski, on the debilitating reality of work.","...what hurts is the steadily diminishing humanity of those fighting to hold jobs they don’t want but fear the alternative worse. People simply empty out. They are bodies with fearful and obedient minds. The color leaves the eye. The voice becomes ugly. And the body. The hair. The fingernails. The shoes. Everything does.

As a young man I could not believe that people could give their lives over to those conditions. As an old man, I still can’t believe it. What do they do it for? Sex? TV? An automobile on monthly payments? Or children? Children who are just going to do the same things that they did?

Early on, when I was quite young and going from job to job I was foolish enough to sometimes speak to my fellow workers: “Hey, the boss can come in here at any moment and lay all of us off, just like that, don’t you realize that?”

They would just look at me. I was posing something that they didn’t want to enter their minds.

Now in industry, there are vast layoffs (steel mills dead, technical changes in other factors of the work place). They are layed off by the hundreds of thousands and their faces are stunned:

“I put in 35 years…”

“It ain’t right…”

“I don’t know what to do…”

They never pay the slaves enough so they can get free, just enough so they can stay alive and come back to work. I could see all this. Why couldn’t they?

I had two jobs over the summer and I am a dedicated student, I haven't had a break longer than three days since July. Two weeks ago, I told my boss the next semester starts the 11th, a week early, so I wouldn't be haggled with over how long of a break I actually need. For some reason, this motherfucker looked up the start date for my semester and called me on it, asked me to come in the 11th and 12th on the 7th. Exactly why I lied to him. 

I was caught off guard when he called, so I was like ""... Sure, I am free?"" And he hung up. I called back an hour later to tell him I'm not doing that, and my mother has been up my ass about it since. She says that I'm 19, an adult, so I should have a full time job (I work 50 hours a week). That I should have more respect for my employer than to switch on him, that she raised me better and is disappointed by my laziness. Why do I need a whole week off anyway? Isn't that a little much? She's going to lose her job and I'm turning down work for no reason. 

And now I can't enjoy my break because I feel guilty as fuck. I just want a week to not think about school or work. I'm at my wit's end, I've been cutting myself and crying every night. She pressured me into working weekends this semester too and I seriously don't know what I'm going to do.

1783,This is Mike Rowe's Sweat Pledge. It makes me nauseous.," 

 

“The S.W.E.A.T. Pledge”
(Kill & Work This Aren’t Labor)

1. [believe that I have won the greatest lottery of all time. I am alive. I walk the Earth. I live in
America. Above all things, I am grateful.

2. I believe that I am entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Nothing more. | also
understand that “happiness” and the “pursuit of happiness” are not the same thing.

3. I believe there is no such thing as a “bad job.” I believe that all jobs are opportunities, and it’s
up to me to make the best of them.

4. Do not “follow my passion.” I bring it with me. I believe that any job can be done with
passion and enthusiasm.

5. I deplored debt, and do all I can to avoid it. I would rather live in a tent and eat beans than
borrow money to pay for a lifestyle I can’t afford.

6. I believe that my safety is my responsibility. I understand that being in “compliance” does not
necessarily mean I’m out of danger.

7. [believe the best way to distinguish myself at work is to show up early, stay late, and
cheerfully volunteer for every happy task there is.

8. I believe the most annoying sounds in the world are whining and complaining. I will never
make them. Of 1 am unhappy in my work, I will either find a new job, or find a way to be happy.

9. I believe that my education is my responsibility, and absolutely critical to my success. I am
resolved to learn as much as I can from whatever source is available to me. I will never stop
learning, and understand that library cards are free.

10. I believe that I am a product of my choice — not my circumstances. I will never blame anyone
for my shortcomings or the challenges I face. And I will never accept the credit for something I
didn’t do.

ll. I understand the world is not fair, and I’m of with that. I do not resent the success of others.

12. I believe that all people are created equal. I also believe that all people make choice. Some
choose to be lazy. Some choose to sleep in. I choose to work my butt off.

In my honor, I hereby affirm the above statements to be an accurate summation of my personal
worldview. I promise to live by them.

Currently I work for Law Enforcement in Memphis Tn. It’s ok. But obviously it’s extremely dangerous and we get paid around $800 a week. Which is nothing in comparison to risking your life everyday. I work night shift, and then sleep till 3 or so. I’ve grown extremely fed up with this life.   

I do music and everyone tells me to chase it. I am learning a lot about the foreign exchange market and also trade stocks and options. I am getting ready to start a podcast as well on YouTube. So I have a few things going. And I have about 6k saved up through options, crypto, and savings.

My girlfriend is a hairstylist and she absolutely loves her life. She makes about a thousand a week.  She encourages me everyday how I can leave that job and start an independent life. She even said she wants to take care of me while I get my things off the ground.

I was getting ready to take a Law enforcement job in Tampa, Fl to start Anew and be closer to my first son.

My gf has been telling me she thinks I should take music, forex/trading, and the podcast serious. And when we get to Florida not join law enforcement there either as the pay is only a few hundred dollars more..

also I am learning how to design websites etc. and I designed hers and am helping her turn her hobby into a legit business. EIN, taxes, business cards. Also getting her a hairstylist YouTube VLOG going..

Everyday i inch closer to saying fuxk it. It’s January and we plan to leave in April. What do you entrepreneurs and such say?

on the other hand, i think anti-work people are only thinking of themselves and what they really want is for me &amp; other blue collar workers to start working 140hrs/week so they don't have to work at all.

personally, i think having a job is psychologically important. what is bad is our current work system. i think rather than anti-work, we should be ""pro-fair work"". less hours, more pay, more vacation, etc.

i've thought about this a lot and i truly cannot see any long term positive outcome to anti-work.

taken to it's extreme logical conclusion, we are all replaced with robots and virtually no one works and we all survive on a UBI. some people still need to work though! would we accept robot teachers? doctors? psychiatrists?

what about the military? you can't use robots in the military because the parts required to build a robot could come from regions we are at war with. if we wanted to start building more robots here, we would need to force people to work again to at least get new factories &amp; mines set up for production. these factories still need a human to look over it &amp; repair the robots too. very few people will join the military if there is no money/college incentive. so soldiers would need to be paid *very* well. you will end up with a corrupt militarized country,

there will still be people who own companies, and the few people that work, will all be ultra wealthy compared to the rest of us who can't work &amp; survive on UBI. this can only lead to a corrupt corporate country. the only way to fix this imbalance is for the government to control all means of production (communism) and distribute the profit evenly among its people. but some people will still need to work, they will want more than people who don't work right? very very few people will be okay working for free, so we will still end up with a higher class and a lower class and only the high class has the money to influence the direction of the country.

additionally, communism sounds bad in general. some people like expensive things or traveling and if they want to work their butts off to get it, that's fair but in an anti-work society, that will be impossible. the available jobs will be so few &amp; will be highly specialized.

everyone on UBI will only be able to afford the exact same things. UBI would probably only cover basic necessities as well.

I keep getting more and more to do. I like being librarian. I like the library work. I now have like an hour a day doing that. Instead I was just switched to being a 1 on 1 (which I HATE), a while ago I was given 3 recess duties, I also have a library time I cover (with covid it is done in rooms instead of them all coming to the lib, so I am leaving there to cover in a class), and a tech time. Not to mention how lib works is that I have to deliver books and pick them up which is a time suck as well. Time I don’t get anymore. And when I do there ends up being people using the lib space that I don’t want to disturb. Oh and I’m one of like three people that can work the copier in there because no one can read or retain the tricks to it despite me showing them countless times. 

I have immunocompromised people in my life and told my boss I want as little contact with classes as possible. Instead I am one of the most in contact people. And it’s not entirely his fault. We are severely understaffed because, shocker, it’s a shit job with no benefits so people bounce ASAP. And we are a poor town so we haven’t been able to pass a contract that gives us help. And we are getting covid spikes, and are in and out of remote learning constantly. 

I’m just... so tired, and there are zero jobs nearby that aren’t retail. I see my life stretching out before me, and it is hard to get out of bed. I get no fulfillment out of this and have no prospects.

No tl;dr pls read

Can someone please explain to me the true focus behind this subreddit? I've lurked in and out, enjoyed some posts, and questioned others for a couple months and wanted to ask. 

Genuinely looking for a real opinion here. This *is* reddit however so I'm going to expect the hive mind to take over and tell me I'm wrong.

I understand that living to work is tedious, and can be unnecessarily stressful, especially when people compare themselves to others who do less work for more (to which I say that 'comparing yourself to others will never bring you happiness', just a mental stability thing for me).

But if there is no work.. then where is there any contribution to society? On that, if those who don't contribute to the society they live in then why do those who do contribute have responsibility over them? 

I am going to keep it a buck fifty with everyone, I grew up poor (like we used to make Christmas trees off the biggest straight stick we could find. I worked concrete construction at 10 years old to help my dad), but thankfully the efforts of my family helped me get to where I am. (currently an Engineer, and am wayyy better off than I would be in my parent's country) I worked on farms to get my education, and everyone might say 'oh so cliché!' but I shit you not my route to classes was uphill *both ways*', and yup! You guessed it. It was also snowy in the winter. And before anyone asks, I graduated college in the last couple years, I ain't old.

I know, I know, I ranted, but what is the driving focus behind r/antiwork? Is there some hope that the future will give everyone the luxuries they desire without having to put some effort towards it? Am I missing something?

Even had time to try and pursue my pipe dream of becoming a writer.  Money has been incredibly tight and we've dwindled much of our savings.

Soon, I'll be faced with full time hours again.  And I've done nothing but feel sick for the last week.  I've been stuck in a depression and I can't even enjoy what time I've got left.

I was ""supposed"" to go back to work on Tuesday but I told my boss and HR that I still had symptoms. As per the company guidelines, I can only return when I'm symptom-free for 24 hours before I'm due to return. So I let them know. The thing is, I'm ***still*** not 100 percent. I still have a fever and fatigue as well as a mild cough that comes and goes. I emailed HR and my boss and HR told me not to come back...

but my coworker texted me and asked how I was doing and that she heard I'm not coming back tomorrow. I feel guilty! Like I'm letting them down.. and that they don't believe that I'm still sick..

But covid isn't just a respiratory sickness and even though I've had a mild/moderate case.. It's affected my mental health as well. I had so much anxiety when I was diagnosed and throughout this illness. I tracked my symptoms. I woke up every day and wondered when I would feel normal again.

&amp;#x200B;

The goddamn Log-Ins

I'm not sure if I'm just an idiot or what but the complex log-in systems that all these company websites have is really fucking annoying.

I try to apply for a job but it's done through brassring, apparently, brassring got rid of its universal log-in system so every time I make a username and password for one company website via brassring, it overrides a previous username and password I made for another company website that also used brassring so I'm constantly having to either make new logins or reset my logins for every single job I apply for and the ridiculous login requirements for these job websites are unnecessarily difficult to meet.

If I do manage to login I have to look forward to the job applications asking me to upload my resume and doing absolutely nothing with the uploaded resume as it proceeds to ask me to fill out everything manually, then I have to deal with those goddamn personality assessments that take 30 minutes to an hour to complete.

I am susceptible to sensory overloads and these goddamn job applications are like the number one thing that triggers them.

Why can't I can just apply over email? Why do I need to go through a digital kafka maze to get a Job? Are companies doing this intentionally? Is it some massive scheme to just demotivate American workers so jobs can be moved overseas or do they just want to be cruel for shits and giggles?

I used to drive an hour each way to work, often in crawling traffic. It was so boring that I would always find myself getting sleepy, especially at 7am when I was barely awake anyway. It was funny how I would drive to work thinking casual thoughts like “I could kill someone/myself if I lose concentration right now.”

I would get so worried about being tired or distracted whilst commuting that I would plan my whole day around it, for example if the late evening came and I hadn’t had time to work out or prep my meals, I would have to just skip it because I needed to get to bed on time. So I would just skip that stuff and eat shit. 

Now it’s like... so I miss an hour or two of  sleep, what’s the worst that can happen, I fall asleep on my couch and get a numb arm? I just do what I want when I want because one of my normal human functions (namely tiredness) is no longer potentially deadly. 

Just looked out of interest and fatigue plays a role in 20% of car accidents. So the irony is that trying to fit in our lives around work leaves us so exhausted that in some cases we are literally killing ourselves to get there.

1880,“You should feel lucky you get two breaks”,"Something my old manager told me that lately has been needling at me every time I see this sub. 

Basically I work an office job and my old manager was ex-retail manager.. meaning she was basically clueless, but I’m not part of her team anymore so whatever. But I remember during a meeting we had some new hires coming in and we were doing our “welcome to the team, these are your coworkers you’re not allowed to talk to cuz we have a no socializing on the work floor rule atm” thing. One of the new hires asked about lunches and breaks and asked if she could go whenever, which lead into the long talk about how **on paper** we had the ability to go whenever, but were expected to work 2 hours between each break before the next. 

This lead to my team lead basically arguing she thinks it’s some bs, that as long as production is high it shouldn’t matter when we went, and a lot of us agreed. Cue my manager getting huffy, puffing out her chest, tying her hair back like she’s getting ready for a fight, and sneering “well, at my old job you were lucky to get a break OR a lunch. I was expected to still help customers while I was on break and if I couldn’t take one, I didn’t get one”

I freaking hate managers and higher ups who think they are being so benevolent for giving us a whole **hour and a half** (or less in se places) which is still spent AT work for a majority of people, and the biggest chunk of that isn’t even paid. Not to mention my job counted the time it took me to walk off/on the floor as my break, so my breaks were in reality MAYBE 7 minutes long. 

Plus I WFH now, I don’t even need or want a lunch break. Just let me log off early so I can do things that actually matter, and screw anyone who thinks giving employees the minimum time away from their shitty jobs should be a luxury, double for any who think it’s a positive if that employee sacrifices that time for “the customer” or “production”.

I'd rather die than succeed under a system that thinks only people who take part in Capitalism deserve to be treated like a human. I want to be as much of a failure at this system as possible. I don't think that defending the way things work is a sign of maturity, but rather a sign of immorality and selfishness. There is no way I can ever feel like a winner as long as I know society is treating other people so fucking badly. I would be horrified if people who defend this system thought I was good at it.

Bizarrely our manager gives the final approval but makes us agree the leave amongst ourselves. I dunno how to feel about it. It ends up with my coworker begging me to cancel my booked leave and guilt tripping about wanting to be with her family. Like, I have family too? Am I really gonna tell a coworker/peer they can't book leave when they want to? It's so awkward.

1903,"did you ever stop to think of your master—your poor, dear, overworked, tired master?","***Oh, the capitalist has his anxieties too. And the worker has often a good time.***

Sure: Say, where were you for the holidays?

\* \* \*

Were you tempted to go abroad? Did you visit Europe? Did you riot, in all the abandonment of a wage slave let loose, among the pleasure haunts of the world?

Perhaps you went to the Riviera; perhaps you luxuriated in ecstatic worship of that glorious bit of nature’s handiwork where the blue waters of the Mediterranean roll in all their entrancing splendor against the shores of classic Italy.

\* \* \*

Perhaps you rambled among the vine-clad hills of sunny France, and visited the spots hallowed by the hand of that country’s glorious history.

\* \* \*

Perhaps you sailed up the castellated Rhine, toasted the eyes of bewitching German frauleins in frothy German beer, explored the recesses of the legend haunted Hartz mountains, and established a nodding acquaintance with the Spirit of the Brocken.

Perhaps you traversed the lakes and fjords of Norway, sat down in awe before the neglected magnificence of the Alhambra, had a cup of coffee with Menelik of Abyssinia, smelt afar off the odors of the streets of Morocco, climbed the Pyramids of Egypt, shared the hospitable tent of the Bedouin, visited Cyprus, looked in at Constantinople, ogled the dark-eyed beauties of Circassia, rubbed up against the Cossack in his Ural mountains, or…

Perhaps you lay in bed all day in order to save a meal, and listened to your wife wondering how she could make ends meet with a day’s pay short in the weekly wages.

And whilst you thus squandered your substance in riotous living, did you ever stop to think of your master—your poor, dear, overworked, tired master?

\* \* \*

Did you ever stop to reflect upon the pitiable condition of that individual who so kindly provides you with employment, and does no useful work himself in order that you may get plenty of it?

\* \* \*

When you consider how hard a task it was for you to decide in what manner you should spend your Holiday; where you should go for that ONE DAY, then you must perceive how hard it is for your masters to find a way in which to spend the practically perpetual holiday which you force upon them by your love for work.

\* \* \*

Ah, yes, that large section of our masters who have realised that ideal of complete idleness after which all our masters strive, those men who do not work, never did work, and with the help of God and the ignorance of the people—never intend to work, how terrible must be their lot in life!

\* \* \*

We, who toil from early morn till late at night, from January till December, from childhood to old age, have no care or trouble or mental anxiety to cross our mind—except the landlord, the fear of loss of employment, the danger of sickness, the lack of common necessities, to say nothing of luxuries, for our children, the insolence of our superiors, the unhealthy condition of our homes, the exhausting nature of our toil, the lack of all opportunities of mental cultivation, and the ever-present question whether we shall shuffle off this mortal coil in a miserable garret, be killed by hard work, or die in the Poorhouse.

With these trifling exceptions we have nothing to bother us; but the boss, ah, the poor, poor boss!

He has everything to bother him. Whilst we are amusing ourselves in the hold of a ship shoveling coal, swinging a hammer in front of a forge, toiling up a ladder with bricks, stitching until our eyes grow dim at the board, gaily riding up and down for twelve hours per day, seven days per week, on a trolley car, riding around the city in all weather with teams or swinging by the skin of our teeth on the iron framework of a skyscraper, standing at our ease OUTSIDE the printing office door listening to the musical click of the linotype as it performs the work we used to do INSIDE, telling each other comforting stories about the new machinery which takes our places as carpenters, harness-makers, tinplate-workers, labourers, etc., in short whilst we are enjoying ourselves, free from all mental worry.

Our unselfish tired-out bosses are sitting at home, with their feet on the table, softly patting the bottom button of their vests.

Working with their brains.

Poor bosses! Mighty brains!

Without our toil they would never get the education necessary to develop their brains; if we were not defrauded by their class of the fruits of our toil we could provide for education enough to develop the mental powers of all, and so deprive the ruling class of the last vestige of an excuse for clinging to mastership, viz., their assumed intellectual superiority.

I say “assumed,” because the greater part of the brainwork of industry today is performed by men taken from the ranks of the workers, and paid high salaries in proportion as they develop expertness as slave-drivers.

As education spreads among the people the workers will want to enjoy life more; they will assert their right to the full fruits of their labour, and by that act of self-assertion lay the foundation of that Socialist Republic in which labour will be so easy, and the reward so great, that life will seem a perpetual holiday.

1932,It sucks trying to have a meaningful conversation with anyone because how deep the propaganda runs.,"Wealth is an illusion and it's a carrot on a stick to keep the illusion up that hard work pays off. 

Only 7% of households are officially millionaires and even today with inflation, being a millionaire isn't anywhere near as prestigious as it was 30+ years ago. 

Most people who are ""wealthy"" are in reality up to debt in their eyeballs. Capitalism peddles consumerism hard and people who increase their income increase their home size, number of cars or MSRP of cars, clothing choices, etc. So while they make more money, they spend so much that they still don't have much money. People justify this endless keeping up with the Jonse's lifestyle and binge watch shows like *Keeping up with the Kardashians.* 

My sister makes probably around $100,000 per year and is constantly stating she ""doesn't have much money"". I make less than a quarter of that and rarely run my checking account into the red. 

In fact is has it's own term, it's called ""lifestyle inflation"". 

Anyway to stay on topic, as people have mentioned before, the poor see themselves as temporarily embarrassed millionaires. 

You have a 1 in 3,000 chance of being struck by lightning in your lifetime. 1 in 500,000 in one year. 

You statistically have a better chance of being struck by lightning this year than EVER becoming a billionaire. 

Hard work pays off is an outdated concept. Sure working your ass off can bring in more money, but only to a point. Jeff Bezos makes $2,500 PER SECOND and I highly doubt he works 625,000 times harder than anyone else. 

I also think the brains limited understanding of numbers plays a role in this lie. If I were to give you $180,000 per DAY. Not per year, but per DAY, since the birth of Jesus, it would currently take you 76 more years on top of that to match Bezos's net worth.",False,kq02wb,_Raspootin_,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kq02wb/it_sucks_trying_to_have_a_meaningful_conversation/,12,1

The job works like this: The supervisors give you a set amount of time to pick certain items for pallets that you are stacking your items onto. If you have 60 minutes to do it, then you have 60 minutes to reach 100 percent of the ""goal"". They will fire you after 1 month, if you do not reach 70 percent of production and will fire you, if you do not reach 100 percent 9 months later. But here's the thing, the times are unreasonable as fuck. I am fast walking/light running the entire time on my shift. I am stacking as fast as I humanly can (I lift weights, am in good shape, and used to working physically intense jobs, but this job still kills me). I also have plenty of experience operating equipment and working fast paced my entire life. I am a very hard worker and guess what?  I only got 60 percent of production this last day...Plus in addition to wearing a mask the entire shift, which makes it harder to breathe. If you even use the bathroom, drink your drink, or take a slight breather, it fucks your time up and you will not get anywhere near their standards. And then there are variables out of your control, such as having to wait on other pickers in the aisles getting done, waiting for forklift operators to get out of the way, having to climb to reach product which slows your time down, etc. 

 I see people working as hard as they possibly can, and failing to meet their ""production"" standards. These people are damn near running their entire shifts. They are also wrecklessly operating their equipment, and they have no regard for anybody's safety in the warehouse. You have successful people, but again, they are literally slaving the entire times on their shift.

1965,Work hard Play hard as a life philosophy,"This is one of the worst concepts invented to keep the exploitation of the masses that unfortunately so many people subscribe to gladly.

I live in a culture where this concept is venerated. Literally. Like, it's perfectly ok to work long hours (without adequate compensation) as long as you have the promise of a fun weekend. It's perfectly ok to endure humiliation at work regularly and experience hopelessness as long as you can count and see Friday coming. 

People spend enormous amount of money on entertainment on the weekend, which includes heavy drinking and recreational drugs among other things. This is pretty much everyone I know. 

The sad thing is that most people like to forget how sad and meaningless their lives are by overcompensating on the weekend. But they are not obviously aware of the problem, because it is very common to hear someone proudly say that their life philosophy is ""work hard, play hard"". They are oblivious to the dangers of this type of thinking and who it benefits in the end.

This is of course encouraged by the capitalist system because (1) you know people are more likely to endure any form of exploitation and shit as long as they can count days and have the promise of a weekend to look forward to, and (2) the enormous spending capacity these individuals have - not because they are wealthy in most cases, but because they are willing to spend whatever they can on entertainment and making themselves feeling good, feeding into the consumption economy and the capitalists' wealth.

Please be aware of how delusional people who subscribe to this concept as a life philosophy are in most cases and be prepared to challenge them on their beliefs and values.

What is the situation where you live? As I said, where I live this concept is literally a substitute for religion and people gladly and proudly subscribe to it. And speak about it as a way of life. 

I went on a date with someone who told me that their life philosophy is 'work hard play hard' and I knew immediately that we have next to nothing in common. This motivated me to think about the subject and share my thoughts.

1979,"Unfulfilled by my cushy 9-5, what to do?","It was a happy accident that I happened to discover this sub on the eve of my first day back in the office this year, so I thought I'd get some feedback from you all on my situation.

I work an office job in IT that pays well, has decent benefits, my co-workers are great, and my boss treats me well. Good work-life balance (i.e., no contact on my free time), never any questions if I ask for time off or a sick day, and my boss genuinely seems to care about my well-being. Most people would be grateful to have this job (which makes me feel guilty), but it simply isn't cutting it for me.

Despite being a near ""slam dunk"" for me, I dread going into work each day because I find it so unfulfilling. I'm so unmotivated that I have to make a VERY conscious effort to be productive or else I'll spend my days browsing the web or chatting with co-workers on our corporate chat application, and fear having my boss ask me what I did that day only for me to have to lie or stretch the truth.

It's getting so bad that I've even begun taking sick days just to get a day off.

I would look for other work since I'm clearly unhappy, but I have a mortgage and bills to pay that were all undertaken under the assumption I'd be making the salary I do now, so I feel kind of handcuffed to this job.

Outside of work I enjoy watching movies, playing video games, playing and listening to music, and reading. I've considered starting streaming on Twitch in my free time to see if I can get that to take off. A lofty goal, I know, but it's the only thing I can think of doing for ""work"" that I'd actually enjoy.

Has anyone here been in a similar situation? What did you do?

Well, either way, I could deal with that if I just had a job. But I *hate* having to beg for it. If I could just shotgun-spread applications, it wouldn't be so bad. But for every shitty, low-level entry job (remember, I'm looking for a *student job,* not a leading CEO position) I have to fucking sell myself, write customized cover motivational letters, and all for a job that thousands of others are applying for too, so it's always in vain. I'm struggling with anxiety and depression, so my energy budget is limited. And I'm wasting it all on writing letters to *beg* for jobs. In any *sane* system, if you want help from someone, you ask them. But the job market is so utterly broken, you have to ask people on your knees to do work for them. It's so completely insane and yet, I seem to be the only person in my social environment that sees anything wrong with it, like everyone else sees something else than I do. Because how else could an intelligent, sane person look at this and be like ""Of course you should beg humbly to be exploited as a wage slave, that's only fair.""

I'm sorry for the rant-y wall of text. But this insanity is driving me, well, insane and I don't know what to do anymore.

1991,"I wrote something to try and describe my feelings about being a part of the rat race. I have no idea what more I want to do with it, or what I want it all to mean. But I'd like to hear what you think.","**“Every normal man must be tempted, at times, to spit upon his hands, hoist the black flag, and begin slitting throats.”
 --HL Mencken**

Helen Keller once said “Not everything that can be counted, counts. And not everything that counts can be counted.” This is where we live our lives. In the immeasurable yet inexorably definable states of our being. Our emotions live and die in ways that are immensely consequential but entirely immeasurable. As an addict, I’ve come to believe that the inside of our heads ought to be treated like a bad neighborhood: Never go alone, and never go at night. That having been said, perhaps you won’t mind accompanying me.

Plato says only the dead have seen the end of war, and Jesus says blessed are the peacemakers. Pahluniak said that it’s hard to forget pain, but even harder to remember sweetness. We have no scar to show for happiness. We learn so little from peace. Hubbard says if you take life too seriously you’ll never get out alive, and Elmo says if you’re happy and you know it you should clap your hands.

They don’t say what you should do when someone stops loving you, or if you’ve stopped loving them. And they don’t say what love is or means. I’m beginning to think they don’t know. 

 They don’t teach you how to mend a broken ego, or nurture an emotional bruise. They teach you how to measure, but they don’t teach you the distance between two people in bed when one of them wants to be someplace else. And they definitely don’t teach you how to stitch the massive, gaping hole we all carry around day in and day out, pretending we’re OK. I suspect much of that has to do with the fact that we are not, in actuality, OK at all. To quote Al Pacino’s character in Scent of a Woman, “There is nothing like the sight of an amputated spirit. There is no prosthetic for that.” 

The purpose of all this isn’t to fill in those gaps. I couldn’t if I tried. But the simple fact it is that damn near everything that matters defies description. 

We are “Jack’s complete lack of surprise” just as much as we’re the “all singing, all dancing crap of the world.” And we are one, and we are love, and we are Spartacus.

What we’re not, generally speaking, is satisfied.

I once heard a common story called “The Mayonnaise Jar and the Cup of Coffee.” It goes like this: 

*A professor stood before his class, and produced a large mayonnaise jar. He proceeded to fill it with golf balls. He then asked the class if the jar was full. “Yes, it is,” answered the class. “So you don’t think I can get anything else in this jar,” the professor asked? He then produced a small bag of pebbles. He emptied it into the jar. The pebbles rolled around and filled the spaces between the golf balls. He then asked the class if the jar was full. They again answered, “Yes.” Then the professor brought out a bag of sand. He poured it into the jar. It filled in all the spaces between the golf balls and the pebbles. The class laughed. He asked them if the jar was full. They weren’t sure, but they mostly agreed that it was. Then the professor pulled out 2 mugs of coffee, and poured them into the jar.*

*“This jar represents your life,” the professor said. “And the golf balls represent the important things in life. Your family, your friends, your passions, your faith. Things that, if everything else was gone and only they remained, your life would still be full. The pebbles are the other, slightly less important things. Your job, your car, your portfolio. The sand is everything else.”*

*“If we put the sand into the jar first, we have no room for the golf balls. Likewise with the pebbles. Our lives are like this. If we fill it with things that have less meaning, we will find we run out of space for the things that truly matter.”*

*A student raised their hand and asked “But what about the coffee?” The professor smiled and replied, “I’m glad you asked. It just goes to show that no matter how full your life may seem, there’s always room for a cup of coffee with a friend.”*

As I type this, I’m sitting in my office. I should be working. “Should be working” is not an uncommon state to find myself in whilst in my office. Why do I do this? It’s not that I dislike my employer. Hardly. In fact, they’re the best employer I’ve ever worked for. They’re kind, generous, and fair. They take care of and respect their employees in ways many workers crave. I’m lucky to be here.

And yet this job does not define me even a little. To say that I want more out of life than to manage operations and finance for 40 hours a week is an understatement to say the least. So why do we do this? Is capitalism a lie? Should we all just become migrant hippies? Obviously the answer to many of these questions revolves around our relatively consistent need for food and shelter, but doesn’t that then just leave us living our lives in the cracks between the golf balls? Are we living at an impasse in culture? One where we’re sophisticated enough to reject the cogs of the machine and demand fulfillment, yet chained to our fleshy prisons that demand the fruits of labor?

I once asked my Brother-in-law, a man whom I admire greatly, how he could stand to work a job that (from my perspective) was the epitome of desk surfing (not that my job is any less mundane). His reply was simple: “I have your sister, and I have our daughter. Everything I do is a means to provide for them and be happy and comfortable with them.” His sincerity and affection brought tears to my eyes. It still does, when I think about it. I tear up like that a lot. Mostly when I dwell on things like that. I think that’s natural. A lot of people probably do. Maybe it’s because we’re sad that so many things that matter so much only end up existing with any real regularity in our thoughts. But I digress.

The lesson from my Brother-in-law is simple: We simply must determine what makes us tick, or we will live the lives of quiet desperation that the masses of men are said to lead. But even my wise Brother-in-law is spending at least 40 hours a week performing a means to an end. I’m simply not convinced we’ve discovered the optimal way to thrive as emotionally vibrant people.

So how did we get here? Why do we do this? Well, as I said before, much of it seems to revolve around our pesky dependence on food and shelter. A man’s gotta eat. I can’t live my best life by starving because I wanted to be an idealist. But that can’t be the only way to answer that. There’s thousands of monks and ascetics of varying levels who would all argue they’re vastly closer to anything resembling nirvana than your average working Joe.

It would seem to me that your average first-world person (for lack of a better categorization) is living a life of great compromise. We sell our time, the only commodity any of us really has, to the highest bidder. In exchange, we are offered the ability to do more with our leisure time, which really ends up just being a few hours per evening and 2 days per weekend at most. Are we all mostly destined to spend the majority of our waking hours doing something we’d rather not be doing and that which is not particularly essential to our living ethos?",False,kq8pq6,MyOfficeAlt,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kq8pq6/i_wrote_something_to_try_and_describe_my_feelings/,11,1

1994,"Seriously, why is it so frowned upon to follow your passions as a career?","I can't count how many people have told me that I'm supposed to hate my job, and just see it as a way to make money to use in my time off. Before getting into my current career, I was straight up laughed at and told to grow up over and over whenever I said that I wanted to do something that's genuinely enjoyable and makes me want to get up in the mornings. And it's not like the thing in question was some pipe dream tutti fruity idealistic career either.

Thankfully I ignored all those people and went back to school. Spoiler alert: life is better when you don't dread getting up in the morning to get screamed at by a boss who thinks you're their slave. I love what I do now, and it literally feels like I'm getting paid to do my hobby all day, not like I'm having the life squeezed out of me.

As an added bonus, I now mainly work for myself, which despite being high pressure has been a hugely freeing experience. Even when I'm not though, the jobs I've had have been respectful of my needs as an employee, and very much treated me like a human, not a bottom line - which was a completely new experience for me. 

I hope anyone reading this and feeling stuck in a shitty job with shitty people and no options can get some encouragement from my experience. You don't have to conform to the path people want you to, it's okay to think outside the box and make decisions that directly benefit you, not someone else.

1997,My shitty work story and how I turned the situation around.,"So first of all, I'm very happy that I found this sub and want to wish everyone the best for this year! This is gonna be a long rant so buckle up haha. 

Now to get to the story, I'm 22 years old and had a couple jobs as a cook in different restaurants. But I also have ptss from a shitty childhood and have little difficulty learning/ adapting in new situations. I always got the feeling bosses took advantage of me because of this. If I'm a good place I can work good enough and handle a kitchen in rush hour on my own without having a struggle. 

Last August I started this new job in a kitchen of a really nice restaurant and it went very well for the first 2 months. My boss started this restaurant 2 years ago and covid has a big impact on it, so a lot of times I got told I'm ""expensive"" (minimum wage) and need to work a little faster, and stressing me out while giving every order out of order. Not really a problem until I got less and less hours every month. It went from 15 a week to 2 evenings every month (if I'm lucky I get 80€ at this point on my monthly salary)

So in November she text me to tell about the last cut in my hours and starts to ask about if I want to work  a couple days from 24 till 27 December. I tell her I wanted to work the 24th but not the rest of the holiday because I got it planned with my family. She gets mad and puts it on me that I have to work on Christmas because it's the only good time to make some money for the business and this pandemic.

This wouldn't be a problem for me if she didn't screw me over with my hours through a freaking text.

So now it's December 23rd and she text me again, now to let my know I don't have to work the 24th because her family dinner got canceled, BUT she still needs me on one of the Christmas days. I got mad and told her I'm really not working on the holidays and how disappointing her way of handling her business is. She eventually started to guilt trip me on this covid shit and how everybody is struggling. (what I totally understand) even later that night a colleague comes to my house for a drink and asks me if I really can't come to work. NOPE, not gonna happen.

So now I haven't heard a single thing from my boss since that day, but I know one of my colleagues who is 17 and gets maybe 4€ an hour and some 30 year old chick are being replaced on my work hours. Note, she probably also gets minimal wage or even more.

 She totally fucked me over because I didn't come work at her demand,  not caring about the fact I live together with my boyfriend and his daughter and I still got bills to pay. Didn't even wish us happy holidays or something, and I really did a lot for her, even to the point of writing down less hours and my boyfriend fixing stuff in the restaurant for free. 

So in the mean time I just started my own online business and resell second hand clothing, already making triple the amount of what I would make with that one evening working for her. It's still not a lot but at least I can handle my own business and don't need to have extra stress and feel depressed about her restaurant. I almost broke because of all this pressure on my shoulders but realized on time this isn't my problem and I did the best I could. 

For now I'm just waiting for her text asking me to come to work because other colleagues can't and I'm telling her to fuck off and that Im quitting :)",False,kqmgya,Anonymous1312x,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kqmgya/my_shitty_work_story_and_how_i_turned_the/,2,1

Also I worked out, worked in the garden and did some yoga. Nice. 

Until Sunday my head was clear from any fog. Then it hit me - the realization that I would need to work again the next day. I felt that realization crawling through my body. I got nervous, my thoughts were all over the place and I actually started shaking. 

Now I am at my desk again and have to sit infront of my screen for 8 hours a day. I feel tense, my thoughts are rather negative and in the morning I feel tired(despite enough sleep).

I feel like my personal life is on pause again until the weekend arrives.

This is no fun. Abyone can relate? How can I work and enjoy life at the same time?",False,kquh5m,xxXKingPinXxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kquh5m/cant_focus_on_my_life/,3,1

2004,I just discovered this sub,"And I just wanted to say it feels good to have people that feel the same as I do. Most of my friend hate their jobs but they get some personal gain from it (being a teacher, ect). 

Though when it comes to my job, other than it paying well and good benefits this office is a toxic hellscape. 

Let me outline it quick:
-Family run business so this makes for the line between work and personal life blurred, doesn’t help both my bosses are absolute workaholics.

-No personal connections between coworkers. All my past jobs I have either had people I for the most part got along with or I had people that still to this day are friends. Here, if you are not talking about work my boss will get pissed. 

-High turnover rate, which makes for shitty, lazy employees being the ones left behind. Every else besides me has been here 10+ years or more. 

-My boss is very emotionally immature, they are selfish and has no empathy. If I say I am stressed (as there are three people in the office so it can get chaotic) they will always say they have it worse, or with COVID we are down so there is nothing to be stressed about. 

-I have to hear my boss almost daily, scream at employees, their spouse, children or even their own mother. There is no in between with them  and if you do anything that they take as a personal slight, they will hold it against you. 

-There are no procedures or plans in place, everything is as needed and almost always a rush to complete, which drives me insane. 

I am trying to find another job, as my parents instilled in me that you have to have another job before you leave one. Though after 11 days off around the holiday I got a taste of the good life. I have an Etsy and am an artist, I wish I could just focus on that instead of spending all day in this place. I know this place is sucking my creativity and drive to do anything other than drink and watch tv after work as I am mentally exhausted after some days.

Wake up at 7AM to get ready. Start the car cause it's frozen all around with what seems like ice that has become one with the car.

Freeze, buss, freeze some more, buss, 1 hour drive home. 4 hours of fucking travelling. Get home, motion sickness, too tired to do shit.

2015,I work in a sweatshop,"I've made a plan to quit work and look for a real job full time. Wait till I have three months wages saved up and quit. The problem is I have a broken back. 

My employer is a sweatshop in Northern Indiana making wire-harnesses. Once decided was the lowest paid employer in the county, including McDonalds and Wal-Mart. I'm a supervisor there, but if you watched me all day, you wouldn't know it. I run ALL of the production in the cell I ""lead."" The supervisor title is what I call a weasel promotion. The kind of promotion a weaselly person would give, a title, all responsibilities but no authority. 

We've been perpetually behind since the guy who started the company retired. The people running it are running it into the ground, and I think it's intentional. They do the dumbest things like take orders that are to go out when we're supposed to be off. They also move stuff around the schedule without updating it so we end up late on orders. My boss was promoted to her position straight from production not because of her skill and experience but because she would be easy to control. This was her first job after a 25 year stint in prison, and within a year she was already manager. 

We are perpetually behind, the company blames the workers of course. We talk too much so we are not allowed to speak a word to each other on the floor. If you are caught talking, you are written up. Since we're behind and it's *our fault,* they've taken away things like the Christmas bonus, the quarterly raises so now it's 25 cents once a year but you have to be absolutely perfect to get it, and awards for working hard that would be given out during monthly meetings. Because of us being behind, I've been doing 12hr a day, 7 days a week shifts since the middle of November. Regular overtime started in September, 10 hours 5 days a week. This is going to be going on till July at the soonest. 

We used to have a radio, but they took it away after a co-worker asked why the volume changes day to day. 

If we are caught with our phone on the premises, it's taken away, even if we're using it on break. Can't keep phones in our cars because people have had their cars broken into several times. 

All the work I've been doing has prompted me to demand raises. I want to make as much as the other supervisors, but according to my boss the supervisors don't make as much as I think. I dunno, they are salary and exempt from overtime. In the state of Indiana, you have to make more than $681 salary to be exempt from OT. I'm only making $490 a week. My boss said she doesn't even clear $500 a week. Either she's lying or the supervisors are being screwed...both are likely. 

They promised me an IT position because I am certified. They gave it to the son of the lady who works in HR. Zero experience. The server got nuked quickly and he's been doing nothing ever since. Doesn't even change the paper in printers. When I brought it up that I was promised the job, they said they never made such a promise or even brought it up to me.

2023,This is the saddest day of the year :(,"The first work day in the new year is like the moment you get on the treadmill with a commitment to run for an hour.  You’re in decent shape, but this you know this will be a challenge. The music starts randomly playing in your headphones and it’s Don’t Stop Believin’ by Journey.  You think, ""oh this is a great song, I love Steve Perry"" and you sing along.  

You quickly turn up the pace on the treadmill and begin to sweat.  The novelty of the song wears off as you realize that you have heard the line, “a smell of wine and cheap perfume” no less than 1000 times.  You hit fast forward and Love Shack by the B-52s starts playing.  You quickly kill that one and hit fast forward again.  Every Breath You Take by the Police starts playing.  You realize you know every song and have no choice but to just roll with it because it’s too much work to keep adjusting the music and run at the same time.  Besides, if you try to do keep tapping your phone, your more likely to fall off the treadmill and break your neck than get a good workout. You look down at the treadmill timer and see that you have only been running for 15 seconds.  Ugh. 

For those of us fortunate enough to have office jobs, the last two weeks of the year represent the one time where you can take a day off and not get killed for it.

2032,Professional sports are a part of the problem.,"One thing I've been thinking a lot about while watching the NFL especially is the constant talk about ""sacrifice"" and ""hard work"" and countless other ""manly"" and ""strong"" values that are repeated ad nauseam and the mindset this feeds into.  There's very much a strong association with the NFL and the blue-collar working man, but that has been completely done away with since the 70s.  The days of NFL players having two jobs because they used to be paid nothing is long-gone, and in as much as these athletes work hard, they're going into practice a handful of times a week, getting paid millions and millions of dollars, breaking covid procedures with literally no consequences (missing games doesn't mean not getting paid for most of them), and having one hard day of actual work / game-time a week.

What furthers this is the idea that they \*should\* be out there sacrificing their bodies for the entertainment of the masses and that somehow this makes them, and by extension the ""blue collar worker"" tougher than everyone else.  As a result, the person putting in 60-80 hours a week or breaking their backs is somehow the better person in society.  This plays into the corporate idea that people are there to be cogs and should give everything they have to a company that gives an absolute rat fuck about them.  If we're not out there ""sacrificing"" and not having a strong work-ethic, we're clearly not walking the company line.

What we should be doing is taking the approach of professional sports through the idea of only having to work or ""practice"" for just a few hours a day, and have one day a week to really burn through some of it.  You'll get better performance out of people, have less churn, and have people who are excited to come to work because they're not being ham-fisted into a way of existing that quite frankly doesn't suit them.

2035,I could be fired because I “don’t fit in with the culture”,"At a virtual meeting my boss had us go around and each say one good thing that happened to us in 2020. Everyone’s answers were superficial. When it came to my turn, I was still struggling to think of one good thing. My depression worsened significantly since I had to stay shut in to my apartment for months on end without seeing my friends. My best friend’s little sister died tragically after having a baby girl only a few months prior. I had to take on a second job to make ends meet and working 60+ hours a week has me perpetually exhausted. I don’t have the time or energy to do the things I used to be passionate about. I spend all my free time sleeping. 

I took too long to answer, but ended up saying something like “I read a lot of good books this year” (which was a lie). My boss didn’t like that at all.

That toxic masculinity part was just how Tyler treated Marla, so at the end of the movie it changes, it's like ""Kill The Buddha"" type of moment.  
If you assume that Tyler Durden is just 100% bad then we should be the opposite of him. We should believe that we're special, that we matter and that we will become rockstars and millionaires one day. That modern way of life is great and consumerism is normal. That we should ""self improve"" our lives as much as possible because that definitely will make us complete. That we should respect our boss and care about our work. That what define us is how much money we have in a bank. That obviously doesn't make sense to me at all.

I don't even see what's so wrong with the idea of ""fight club"" itself, maybe except that it's men only group. It's consensual and it makes people feel better about themselves/their lives, so isn't that good? Everyday life is just way too mundane, so it's not surprising that some of us feel good while doing extreme things.

But then creators say it's just all satire and you shouldn't be like these characters, so is this ""anti-work"" or ""pro-work""?

2043,I'm done,"Hi,

I know you've just come back from Winter break but you need to update your timesheet immediately. We need to know how long you just spent getting a glass of water and using the bathroom. We need to know why you spent 6 extra minutes reading emails three Tuesdays ago. HR needs to know, this is all relevant for your performance reviews. 

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking of which, did you get a chance to submit feedback on your coworkers? I know you haven't known them very long but we expect regular feedback to be given on all employees, including yourself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Don't forget about your trainings! We consistently ping you with notifications reminding you to look at our irrelevant and pointless documents just to distract you from doing any real work. 

&amp;#x200B;

And of course, any lapse in performance will be seriously scrutinised. We expect nothing short of perfect performance when turning in deliverables and anything short of this will result in a sit down between us to discuss what can be done to keep you at your best. We know people have been struggling outside of work recently but don't bring that into the workplace. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, hope you had a nice Christmas. Welcome back.

2045,The End of the Holiday,"I return to work tomorrow.

I've had 12 days off, although admittedly holidays are never as restful as they could be. I feel good. I have energy. I've gotten to indulge in some movies and TV that I have put off for months, I have gotten to cook some fun meals, I have gotten to sleep without an alarm.

And I know my first week back will be a good one. Its the second week back that will kill any of the good that the holiday did. 

In October, I had extra vacation days, so I took off every single Friday for a month. Three day weekends every week. It was the most happy and productive I have ever been at work. And it has also made me acutely aware of how insufficient a two day weekend is. 

Now I know, I am going to be tired, drained, and stressed until my next vacation, probably in May. I am sort of dreading it.

And I have a good job! I like my boss and my coworkers, my company and HR have had a relatively strong response to Covid, I am good at what I do and relatively secure in my position, and I even enjoy my work pretty often.

But I am not passionate about working. I don't work because it fills me with a sense of accomplishment. I work for a paycheck, so I can afford to have a life I enjoy outside of work. I just wish I could have the time to enjoy that time outside of work as well. But I know that many of my coworkers have drank the Kool aid and would be calling for my immediate dismissal if I tried to work from home or if I worked out an alternative schedule. Because workers have been manipulated to believe that if you aren't passionate about your work, you are the enemy. If you don't live to be productive, you are lazy. If you don't sacrifice for your career, you are evil.

So, I will go back to work tomorrow. I will be tired until my next vacation. The cycle will continue until my student loans are paid off, and I have enough money saved to tell my capitalist overlords to fuck off and I can retire to a small house away from people and do what makes me happy.

Probably when I am 80.

2051,Looking for solutions? You might want to start here,"https://anticapital0.wordpress.com/announcing-the-school-of-marxist-fundamentals/

I’m a member of a Discord server that has the intention of teaching newly-minted leftists about the theory, history, and practice of Marxism. We are currently set to read Trotsky’s History of the Russian Revolution, but there is a cycling curriculum that covers philosophy, economics, as well as history. You can find out more about the specific texts in the link above.

A common question I see here is a way to end the current paradigm of work, and no one seems to have good answers. I believe that Marxism is that answer, but learning what exactly Marxism is can be difficult, especially on your own. The server has weekly discussions, as well as more than a few members who have a strong understanding of the theory and practice of socialism. Although the founder and (primary) teacher is a Marxist, we welcome all left tendencies and denominations, in the hope of strengthening the working class’ understanding of the task that confronts it, and using the existing history and theory of class struggle to bring about a better world.

If you’re interested, check out the link above, which has a link to the Discord server.

2071,Is marriage and having children a way to keep you trapped in the system?,"One of my friends who is in his 30s just had his second child recently. Despite him being ecstatic about it, I can't help but to feel sorry for him for not ever being able to live freely probably for his entire life. Of course unless he won some big lottery money or run his own business, but none of these are likely to happen in the foreseeable future. (he barely have time to sleep looking after the kids)

Then I started to get suspicious about the whole idea of romance and relationship and having a family.  Like 90% of the movies and tv shows and books and all the other forms of media is covered with finding love, getting married and having children. Like these topics are constantly non-stoppingly shoveled in your face, oh and sex, like everything is sexualised on media nowadays. I kinda start to think it's all looking too much like it's intentionally promoted to you, to have more babies. Then I see my friend having his second child, all I see is him working 9-5 forever and still living a financially burdened life cuz of the two kids. So could romance and having children be their strategy to keep you trapped in the system? Cuz the only way I see that have the slightest possibility to break free is to stay single, save money n side hustle, then start your own business somehow before you are too old. That's the only way I could see to gain financial freedom so free from 9-5.   

So in other words, if you wanna become financially free from the 9-5, not having children would be a good way to help achieve this goal? (and not producing slave labors for the ruling class as a plus)

2073,A Worker's Tale,"[TW suicidal ideation]

I spent about 6 months working on the production floor of a food flavor company. Prior to then I had only worked desk jobs and retail. After losing my soul crushing, minding numbing call center job in humiliation, I decided to try something radically different. 

I had recently lost a lot of weight, gotten more physically active. I was also eager to feel like a good, honest worker. A true member of proletariat. To produce something for a change. I was excited. I had no idea what I was getting into. 

I could draw this out for dramatic effect but there's no point. It was a nightmare. I realized it was a nightmare almost immediately but out of a terror of unemployment, further humiliation, and stupid, toxic masculinity. 

Every day there were hours of manditory overtime, 6 days a week to meet the absurd production quotas. At times they made it manditory sundays too. No way of making plans or having a real life outside of the factory. Just hours on hours on your feet. Moving endless pallets of products, with the constant pounding of heavy machinery in your ears. You weren't allowed to sit down unless you were on a fork lift. 

We had a nightly meeting that was supposed to lead into the last break of the day, during which time the floor workets were supposed to be given a chance to shower and change before clocking out. In the entire time I was there I never once had this happen, the nightshift manager seeming to take glee in forcing us to stay on the floor through our legally required time off the floor.

It wasn't all the company. Yes they were a paternalistic, blood sucking bunch of capitalist scumbags, but it's nit as though I was a model employee. I was in over my head. I was a soft, desk jockey playing at factory worker. I was a danger to myself and others. And my coworkers knew it and made it clear to me. I broke down weeping so many time I lost count.

Finally, driving home in the dead of night, knowing I'd only get a few hours of sleep before heading back into hell, I began to picture my car sailing off the side of the road, into the dark beyond...and I wouldn't have to go into work again.

I told my wife this. She begged me to quit. I did.

Post Script:

2074,A cult of personality at work,"Where I work, you are expected to obey blindly and put the job ahead of you. Your health, your life, your family, all of it comes second to the job. 

You are expected to come in sick. They don't explicitly say it, but the fact that you are given absence points for all absences, including Vacation time (which they call CC days. They operate like unlimited vacation time, but it's limited). Pointed for not going in so you can see a doctor if you are very ill. 

You have to put the job ahead of your family. The company hand book states that we get 3 days off for bereavement. The past few times I've needed it, it's been denied. My brother in 2015, my paternal grandma in 2019, and maternal grandpa in 2020. I was told the job was more important each time. Also told no company has bereavement. 

My mother had a tumor removed from her neck in 2018. She needed someone afterwards to help take care of her as she would be unable to do anything and she lives alone. I'm the only one she can count on. My boss called me a mama's boy for requesting the time off. 

My wife had a Covid scare and I was told I would be mandated to come in even if quarantined. Eventually I did get Covid and had to work. 

Since I was lied to about the it position, I have not been happy about overtime, especially since I will not benefit. No raises since I am at the cap, and no promotions since I am the only one who can do my job. Why do the extra work when I could spend the time bettering my skillset and land a better job? Before the overtime, I started to learn python as a potential employer said it would be a good skill for me to learn, but have had zero time to continue as I have two hours of time after getting home before having to go to bed. Dinner takes up a bit of time.

This doesn't happen to everyone. Those who obey blindly and are the boss' friends get special treatment. She bends over backwards for them. A cult of personality.

There’s so much to see in coastlines, as well as forests, lakes, mountains, grasslands...even certain “ugly” industrial sites often have a strange and almost otherworldly quality about them. 

Then I’d write a book, maybe more, and actually do something I want to for a change.

But instead I have to stare at a computer screen for hours on end looking at symbols on a page. Exciting and stimulating stuff. And apparently, if I say I want to do the things above ( walk for hours on end and write) instead of sitting down, staring at a screen and looking at said symbols, this makes me “lazy”.

2088,"Becoming a NEET (Not in educaiton, employment or training) will be my last option if everything else fails","What the title says, frens. How did you guys come to that path in life? Or maybe lack thereof? Did it scare you at first? Was it a difficult descision? How did the people around you react? What is the thing keeping you going? For me, the possible paths I may take are these:

1. Very odd job. Very uncommon. Most people may or may not be aware it exists in the first place. Requires tons of travelling, so I will get to see the world and do stuff I love with unique diverse people around me. I don't really wanna name it, cause I will need a whole book to explain it or why and how it became one of my possible paths, and how I even discovered it was an option, but I do not know how my family will react if I reveal it to them. It is a perfectly achievable job, a lot of times though not always with good work - life balance, and my past sports backgrounds give me an advantage as to doing it. It is not sex work, but it does require selling your body technically. It may or may not be more physically demanding and/or bad for your health as working in mines or in construction, and I guess it may or may not be considered ''back breaking labor''. The reason why I am not explaining it, is because it will either make me look like a poser/attention seeker and because I will have to type ten paragraphs to explain myself. But you get the idea. My family will call me insane if I choose to pursue it, and they already give me weird looks when I talk about it or show them stuff on my phone related to it, but my sister says she will support me no matter which path I follow, and that I am a very talented girl and that she is mind blown by the fact that ''I already learnt so much without a coach/teacher''. I do not consider myself talented, nor ''natural'' at it as many of the people in this field are stereotyped, I just think I started at a point in time where it was 10000000000000 times easy, so now I come off as I have some type of magical superpower. But I love and forgive my sister, because she has a kind heart and has faith in me, and she is all I have left in the world.
2. Also a quite odd job, but it is not God-forgotten or forgotten even by the secretary of God like the above one. I have a lot fo creative ideas about it, but I doubt I will find success in the mainstream since creativity and passion these days is sacrificed for the shake of sex appeal, outward appearance and it is pretty much a dead field, in the sense that there is little creative, passionate, joyful work put out there now. It is highly unlikely that I will follow that path for that reason, although in my country a non-mainstream marker in experimental/folk stuff is there too, but I have zero clue if that is my style. And also, I am not sure if this is a path I want to follow yet even as a hobby, though I have soooooo much inspiration inside me.
3. Teacher. It sounds beautiful. In theory. More specifically, primary/elementary teacher. Giving children knowlegde, forming deep loving relationships with your students, and helping them become happy, functional adults. It sounds really appealing to me. It is the only ''normal'' job I have ever dreamed of, and actually liked. Anything else was either very artsy, very athletic, or both. At first I chose teacher as my first option, because... Well, I may had had repressed dreams. That may have been there since I was 7, that I was never allowed to pursue all and all because my family tried to protect me from the slightest inconvenience. Helicopter parenting has completely ruined my view of life lowkey, and it has also made me afraid to pursue some of my goals that will require me to put effort and fail a lot of times to do them. In theory, it is such a beautiful profession, and it offers so much, both to the teacher and the student. I just do not know if my mental issues will allow me something like that and I mighty simply be drawn to the idea of being a teacher and not the profession it self because of them, so I am not sure if this is my path.
4. Full time author. Highly unlikely, hard to achieve, and while I do love literature and can not live without it, it is a very lonely, escapist profession and I do not trust myself with it because I do not wanna end up like James Joyce or Lovecraft. I call this one, the ''best worst case scenario'' for the above reasons. I know I probably won't be like J.K Rowling or Steven King, but just in case everything else fails or ain't for me, I like to hope this will be possible.
5. Glossology. Hard to get into, hard to study, time consuming, probably will have to become a professor if I wanna use it somehow, but it seems appealing, and interesting compared to any normal office job. There are just too many languages I wanna learn before I die, and they do not even have a greek or latin alphabet.
6. Theology/religious studies. Highly unlikely. Might not find a job. Again, though same applies to glossology, I ain't passionate about teaching adults, but in my country you can teach middle schoolers general knowledge about world religions (not indoctrination, there is a difference) so there is that.
7. Part time job + Youtube. It gives me the wrong vibes because again, it is a very isolating profession just like writer, and it takes time to build a channel anyway.
8. NEET. I saved it as my last option. No idea what I will do all day, no idea if I will develop a feeling of aimlessness or not (hopefully this is not an insult to all of you in this subreddit, I respect your choices), but in case everything else fails, and I develop crippling depression from the manlfunctions in my brains reward system/trauma (????), I will be a NEET. Will all my family hate me? Yes. Will I loose the few people that love me and want the best for me? Yes. Will I remind my caregiver of her son who became a drug addict, and eventualy may have killed himself overdosing? Yes. Will she think she has failed and has no other joy in life? Yes. Will I eventually end up like her son? Maybe, hopefully not. Will it fullfill me? No. Do I have any optimism for life and for a future? Absoloutely not, but... Maybe. Just maybe. Do I have a small hope? Yes. Yes I do.

By brother died this year. About three months ago | got a phone call that broke me.
It has been very painful. Painful to think about. Painful to talk about. Painful for the
many many people that loved him. It was sudden, unexpected, and we'll likely never
know why it happened. | don't know how life is supposed to work but it has felt
unusually cruel as of late. He was kind, inclusive, insanely hard working, equally as
hilarious, and deserved every ounce of success he found in life.

By brother is the reason I've experienced so many incredible adventures. He took
me on my first backpacking trip. He took my wife on her first backpacking trip.
When | moved out west he took me shopping for all the appropriate outdoor gear,
and we set out on a four day backcountry trip that included submitting my first
mountain, It. Reward. In the coming years we summoned It. Good & South Sister
as well.

By brother was a scientist and approached life with a natural curiosity. He loved to
learn, to test, to teach, and to explore. He was easily the smartest due in our family.
His the on circassian clock-controlled scent emission genet was published as a
cover story of PNAS journal. His latest research involved invasion agricultural species
as well as unique bee behavior adapting to changing environmental conditions.

By brother loved good food, good drinks, and silly jokes (often too related, he
expelled at not taking things too seriously, wipe for photo). Hanging out with him,
you'd likely never know how hard he worked. He could seem (and be) frustratingly
laid back, but he was always down. Whatever it was, he's in, and he gave me some
of the best memories I'll ever have.

| don't want to force advice on anyone, but social media can be an incredibly
difficult mental environment. You never, ever fully know what someone is going
through, so just be kind. And enjoy the simple things. Take pictures and record
video with the people you love. By brother died at the age of 32, but for my own
vanity | choose to believe he lived a life that took advantage of every moment. | love
you Eyes. I'll miss you forever.

2109,"Work isn’t fun. Work is one of these burdens, that you will carry your whole life.","I just had a little talk with my parents, and I cannot really see myself ever working fulltime 40hours a week on this planet, even part time would be such a pain for me. At this moment I will write my final exams for a better degree in a few months. Actually because, my parents forced me to get a better degree. So at this moment I’m working around 2 days a week for 3-5 hours. 

But I’m just doing this, because I don’t really know how my future will look like, and I wanna survive later on. I’m not working for buying a new iPhone or something like that I just wanna survive later on. And on top of that, if I would like to I could do that as a part time job which would be an option, but I don’t wanna work part time or full time, such a pain!

I mean, why do you have to work everyday 8 hours in order to survive, imagine even if you have a part time job, you nearly spend your whole day at the workplace. 3-5 hours two days a week, I’m okay with that nothing against that.
But it’s such a mindfuck that, you can’t even survive with that capacity. You will get paid yes, but not enough to survive.

But the fact, that I told this my parents and my mum immediately said that I should look for something which I do enjoy and which does make me fun. And I just left and nearly cried because, that’s something like the majority of people does think. They just say oh just look for something what you would enjoy.

Why do we even exist? I mean, at this moment I think just for work. I cannot enjoy other things, because it just fucks my mind. But I will not let me brainwash from the government or other people. But the system as it is, is programmed that you’re trapped.

I mean, you got thrown into this world, maybe you got made by accident, and now every human being has to work the whole day in order to survive, who the fuck thinks that this is okay

She has been told that she has to go into work, as does every other member of staff even though her work and that of many others, is both inessential and can be completed from home. 

This stupidity (which contradicts the governments rules that only essential or those who can’t work from home should be in work) is essentially a mirage of “solidarity” and “community resilience” in order to extract work and observe and have power over them. The school wishes to promote an image at risk of the wellbeing of their staff. 

I want to to write a letter to the school trust and the head explaining how their actions here are morally reprehensible and a real community decision would allow people to work at home. Which, would result in an increased level of safety for both those who are essential and those who aren’t. 

I have researched the values and policies of the school and have found and can illustrate how this is in direct opposition to these very policies. 
I also want to make clear I’m aware of the difficulty of their position, but explain that by accepting the job and the wage they (who we must note are able to work from home) are responsible for the well-being of the staff. 

This post is essentially asking for any more points I could make, and asking whether this is a worthwhile use of my time. I feel unless I stress the moral responsibility incumbent upon them they won’t get the gravity of the situation and really grasp it. However, I’m also aware they will be under some stress and feel guilty pressing guilt on people in already difficult position.

2130,I don’t want to end up like my dad for 40 years.,"My dad studied in India for his bachelors, and then he came to the US for his masters and phd in Engineering way back in 1980. 

He grinded his way working from 1990 to 1997 where he quit his job because he hated it. Decided to open a company, where it flopped. I was born around this time. He went back to the wage slavery grind for the next 20 years and finally retired this year at age 63. He has severe arthritis and now he just spends his time watching Fox News.

The only thing the man has to show for the last 40 years is his money. The man is loaded with cash. Growing up I had a comfortable lifestyle but he is really abusive. I guess that was the price I had to pay for growing up the way I did not having to worry about money.

My dad took out his work stress on us - as kids, all we wanted to do was play with our dad. He would come home and yell at us, and promptly sit on the couch with a beer to watch TV. My self esteem is destroyed because of this man, I reported him to child abuse authorities back in the day, and he gaslighted me into believing he did not hit me. After this, he never hit me but has verbally abused me and terrorized me.
He treats my mom like a slave, he never looks at her and does not even talk to her. He yells at her to do things very specifically and faps off to porn at night. He used to beat her.

My mom and I are leaving in a few weeks. We got a tidy little apartment and she got a full time job. She will be applying for divorce and will drain half of what he has. We will both have to worry about expenses for a while. Who knows? Could take up to 5 years if he drags it out. I love my mom and tbh, she’s all I got. I will be cutting off my dad completely.

Look at my dad. Grinds 40+ years to study and be a wage slave at a subject he hated to earn massive bucks, only to lose half of it plus his wife and kids. He will be alone and will have lost half of his life’s savings. Quite sad, really. Don’t know what my career will be right now (really worried about it) and even if I have to be a wage slave, I just really hope it’s something I enjoy.

One of the main arguments I hear against UBI is ""oh, well some people just won't work then."" First of all, lots of people have non-laziness-related reasons not to work, like new parents, people in school, and disabled people. Second of all, why the fuck should I care if someone doesn't want to work? Why does that mean they should be punished? Like, if you don't want to work, maybe you don't get an enormous mansion or crazy spending habits, but why shouldn't you get to live under a nice roof and eat every day? I don't understand why so many basic human rights are considered to be only for people who work. Like I understand where people are coming from when they say, ""Nobody who works full time should be in poverty!"" Like yes, that is a good point, but we can do better! Nobody should be in poverty at all!! 

&amp;#x200B;

It's also like, there is nobody alive who doesn't do some type of work, it's just that the work they do might not generate material wealth. Stay at home parents, for example, do tons of work that they don't get paid for! Fuck it, maybe I want to live in a commune and do housework! What is so wrong with that?

But now that I'm a little bit older and I see work with a much more critical eye I'm having second thoughts! For example many of the places I volunteered had a lot of sponsor, others like Marathon's had a generous fee from every participant and sponsors. Action Aid, Amnesty International etc take a lot of money from people for their work and have some employees but they are depending on volunteers to do the shity work! The worst was when I was volunteering for an organisation about women and children Fellow by accident that EU paid a small ""salary"" for every volunteer working there which we knew nothing about and we had to ask for it many times to resieve afterwards.

2141,Capitalism and effeciency: What the fuck are we doing.,"Listing some ways in which capitalism creates inefficiency, and how efficiency when it does happen, never benefits workers:

**Preface:** I understand that some of this wasted work has value. Competition can lead to good things in some sense. I am merely pointing out inefficiency, not saying another system would do everything better.

**Bullshit jobs:** beginning with the most simple and widely known inefficiency in capitalism. There is a large subset of jobs which involve checking boxes, confirming things in other ways, or nothing at all. Jobs which essentually involve no labour, but force the laborer to pretend they do something. Of course made popular by the book bullshit jobs by David Graeber. Probably this concept is connected to many of our awakenings to the nonsense of work culture. 

**Bullshit sectors:** I would expand on the concept of bullshit jobs and add that many whole sectors of work exist without the creation of anything. Examples of this are the finance sector, law, government, and marketing. I am not saying these sectors don't DO anything. I'm saying they create nothing; They produce nothing. They are essentually management of society. They are Band-Aids on a wound.

**Competition is wasteful:** All competition, where sellers are vying for the money of a limited-demand service or good, actually reduces efficiency. Imagine you are selling haircuts, and someone moves in beside you and also sells haircuts. (this is basically the case where I live, so many barbers). Any time one of you is open for business, but not cutting hair, while the other is cutting hair, is wasted time on the job. Similarly, if you spend a year making a video game but a similar video game comes out and there is no longer a market for your game, all the time the studio spent making that game is wasted because of competition rather than cooperation with other studios. In fact if you look at the video game industry you see blatantly how many games have no player base because there are just way more people making games then necessary. 

**Low income inefficiency:** Imagine I need a haircut but I have no money. I don't get a haircut, because of this, the barber doesn't get paid as much, and doesn't buy as much for himself. This cycle in our society encourages not just the poor, but everyone to spend less, meaning demand less in an economic sense. This is why the ONLY way to make money in society, outside of the arts, is to do work that people CANNOT refuse. Such as healthcare, law, and finance. Nobody can bargain a low price with a doctor, people can't represent themselves in court, and nobody can give themselves a loan for a house. They have to deal with these people, and so they can charge whatever they want. 

**Money makes money:** Anyone who spends money in our society is losing. So we only do it when we have to or we really want something. Any money saved can be multiplied in many ways, especially if you have a lot of it. This means that not just poor people, but everyone is incentivized not to pay for goods and services, which artificially reduces demand for everything, except what can’t be avoided, as previously stated. If society was based on demand, rather than money, many things would be done that arent now. I could open a business selling ice cream and anyone who wants ice cream would ask for some, thereby creating more product than our system. 

**Conclusion:** Which is more efficient, a man who cuts down 10 trees in an hour, but only works 4 hours a day, or a man who cuts 6 trees an hour, but works 8 hours a day? The answer is quite obvious, it's the first man. But our society would view this man as being low on work, less productive per day, a part time worker, an under employed person. Society would much rather see us all work 8 hours a day, then see us truly improve the efficiency of our system and improve the lives of everyone. The fact is, society is already quite efficient, we make a lot of food and transport it around the world. We could all work 3 or 4 hours a day if we would stop doing jobs that don't need to be done and give enough money to everyone so we can afford to buy things, and create a cycle of demand, rather than incentivizing non spending. 

There is a postal service union in my area. They fought against making community mailboxes. Why? Because they represent the letter carriers and this improved efficiency would have led to layoffs. The real question is: Why would it lead to layoffs? Why would we as a society deliberately make ourselves less efficient because we CANNOT comprehend the idea of efficiency benefiting the worker instead of the businesses bottom line (In a crown corperation no less, Canada). That's truly broken. We live in fear of improved efficiency in our society. We are worried about robots taking jobs. Why? Because we can't just agree to pay people the same to work less.

Because of this, wanting efficiency, which we all should, should be the same as wanting reduced work, or higher pay for workers, or both. For that reason being anti-work and being anti-capitalist are fundamentally linked. Any leftist should be fighting for increased efficiency and reduced labour as a consequence. If all truckers become unnecessary then great, what freedom we have created. Pay them anyway. The laughable idea that we cannot afford to pay people when the reason they're out of work is because we are making things more efficiently then ever, is so absurd. We paid them befor, but now we can't because we are making the same thing without them? It makes no sense. 

**Side note:** I won't go into it that much but we should also just reduce our production. We need to be sustainable on this planet. This is also a reason for less work.

**Final question:** Does anyone know people who are talking about this in a similar way? Am I missing something here or is the discourse in leftist circles just letting people claim that capitalism is effecient without rebutal?",False,kp2kwr,timmytissue,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kp2kwr/capitalism_and_effeciency_what_the_fuck_are_we/,8,1
2142,I graduate at the end of this year and don't see a way I can ever be happy in life because I wasn't born rich enough to avoid full time wage slavery.,"Basically what the title says.

Will be finishing up my Master's degree in November which will have been a nice 2 year break from wage slavery. I know I am preaching to the choir, but I don't know how I will ever have happiness in life having to be a full time wage slave for the next 40 years. It is almost impossible to get part time work here unless you want to be in poverty and dealing with customer service jobs. 5 days just sucks up your life and leaves you too tired to even enjoy the weekends. I'm already on the highest possible safe dose of anti depressants and it isn't enough.

I don't really know what else to say, but it is so soul crushing to know I have no real choice but to do something that makes me desperately unhappy because the world has been set up to force us to participate in wage slavery or end up on the streets. The worst part is when my mother says ""that's life"". Why the fuck did you have me if you knew life was shit? Both my parents had cancer in their 50s, my father died from it, so basically my fate is either 40+ years of wage slavery and maybe getting to retire or wage slaving until 55 and then dying of cancer. 

Fuck everything. I just want to be able to work part time but it's basically impossible in my country and I have no choice but to revolve my life around a job I don't even want and barely see my family and friends and never have time for my hobbies. I will have to give up my hobby of learning Korean, sleep when my body doesn't want to sleep (my natural clock is 2am-10am) and be a miserable rat in the race until I die.

2149,Point-less,"For the longest time, I struggled in looking for a point to my life. The utter meaninglessness of everything was overwhelming and so it felt appropriate to ask this question.

What is the point?

My life has probably been lived like many of you. I've had a few brief moments of happiness, but the vast amount of this has been just mindless drudgery. I went to college like I was supposed to, worked hard to get the degree like everyone else, and accepted a slave wage job in which I feel perpetually miserable. Waking up every day to hammer out 8 hours of boring, mindless work, causing me to feel bitter and frustrated with everything, day in and day out. I live at home with my mom at 29 because I am not interested in paying the extremely high rent fees for shitty one bedroom apartments in my area. I've only amounted to the money I've been able to save up.

At the end of the day, nothing is happening. I chase little simple pleasures when I can but feel like most of my time is spent working and depressed and tired. I'm not working towards anything, nothing is really interesting to me, it's just existing. I obviously don't want kids, I don't want marriage, my life isn't heading in any direction other than more of the same. It's not like I'm really doing anything significant in any way or amounting to something bigger.

So, we come back to the same old question, what's the point?

The closest that I have to an answer, is that there is no point. As humans we ask that question BECAUSE we are often feeling a sense of pointlessness and boredom with our lives. In other words, we who are looking for a point to life is often because our lives feel pointless to us.

But asking for a point is viewing our world though a human perspective which seeks meaning. At the end of the day, I don't offer meaning to this world. I am a disposable person like the many who have lived and died before me. I seek meaning in a meaningless world.

So, what is the point of all this?

In my 20’s I managed to get myself Into the music scene shooting bands playing around Los Angeles and eventually working for record labels shooting music videos and album art. I grew out of that after a few years and found myself in an incredibly lucrative but small niche, Hotel photography. I’ve spent the last decade traveling the world l, quite literally the dream job.

Fast forward to about a year into the Covid pandemic. I can’t travel for obvious reasons but to make matters worse, all of my beloved clients in the marketing departments for all the hotels I worked for have been fired, quit or laid off. At this point in time I have zero possibilities to get back to where I was. It was sheer luck, the oth I took to get there to begin, even if the world opens up I’d be starting from quite one trying to get clients again. I don’t even know where to begin...

2165,34 m discusses his dystopian predicament.,"I've had two jobs this year both paying around the £30k mark.

Corporate psychopathy made me resign from both.

I am a truth teller and I can't abide bs. I'm not going to sit around and let myself be manipulated or controlled. Turned into a version of myself that they want me to be.

The 1st one I was loving my life and really enjoying the role until new external management came in. Under-qualified, sexist, egotistical alcoholics with no technical knowledge. Brought in to do corps bidding and take away our teams autonomy. We had no need for them. I got targeted more and more, progressively lost the plot, got set up by equally sociopathic colleagues to the point where I had no opportunity but to resign. I loved many aspects of that role as I was the best on my team. C'est la vie. 

The 2nd one I got I was a manager on less than a standard IT analyst like I was previously. They wanted me to manage 2 teams while the other 'team leaders' had 1. I was also required to be on call 24/7. It was at that point I realised I would either need to accept the fact I would be exploited by work in terms of making me do multiple job roles, or over working me; or I would have to let them convert and brainwash me to their philosophy of greed, one-upmanship and sociopathy. 

I barely survived on those salaries believe it or not, while being behind on bills and council tax. (don't think I will ever be able to pay it and will probably go to court)

The stress, torment of the jobs and some of the disgusting ""people"" I worked with on top of 3 or 4 previous traumatic experiences, meant that I would often just waste all of my money on alcohol and drugs to cope.

I don't have anything material to show for that work apart from a big TV I don't even use. Now I am unemployed and on benefits I am far more content living off 1x beans on toast a day.

Can anybody with more experience in this field elaborate this phenomenon as I find it hard to believe that half of the population living in the US are financially struggling due to their own mistakes. It would also be interesting to see someone’s monthly cash-flow or hear a story about financial hardships in the US.

I am sick of being subject to the world of the corporation, capitalism, greed and focus on money at the cost of lack of focus on the environment, humanity and climate change. But I don’t know what I can do.

Everything that I have, everything that I need is/was produced by this system. I feel that I need money and resources to break out of this system. I don’t want to and don’t believe humans should work their life away for a corporation and shareholder profit, but I’m scared of being without the main product of the system, which I believe is money. 

I want to become as independent of this system as possible – my goal is to live sustainably on an eco-friendly property leaving as little footprint on the earth as possible and to do as little harm as possible. I recycle, I reuse, I buy as few ‘things’ as possible, I research where I buy from, I make conscious decisions and am lucky enough to be able to do so. 

But it feels impossible. I want to effect change but where can I even start when all the control and power seems to come back to the Amazons, the News Corps, the Googles etc. 

I’m sure it’s been asked before but what can I do to:

1. Effect meaningful change on “the system”?
2. Reduce my dependency from the system (as much as possible)?
3. Use my education, knowledge, skills and resources to improve the world for others?

But on a personal level, I’m sad that things will go back to normal regarding the work situations.
I work in an office and we are able to work from home. It has been an absolute blessing in 2020. My days were filled with calm and my productivity hit the roof because I wasn’t a slave to the 9-5 (more than that..) anymore. I was free to be at home, cook myself breakfast, take a nice break and go for a walk etc. There were no commutes, no chatter in a busy massive office space, no anxiety or being self conscious about how I look or what I’m wearing. It was just... calm. Calm in my home, quietness and comfortable.

And now with the amazing progress in vaccines, I can already see the office, smell it, hear the noises and the talking and phones ringing.

Are you serious? You have never taken PTO in three years, your house just burned down, and
you are questioning on Edit if it's ok, to take time off from work? Please see a counselor
immediately. Your employer will probably have one for you it's called employee assistance

(he’s alcoholic and we knew this was coming but had no idea when) i went in today and apologized for not showing up and told them why, and that i was so upset work did not even cross my mind that day. i told them i had to take a leave because i do not know if my father is going to pass or what is going on as of now. they told me since it happened twice i’m being fired. they straight up lied and told me i didn’t call out tuesday when i did. it was only wednesday i didnt call and they knew that. so then they switched it to “you didnt call out monday” when i was there monday and both managers saw me working. they then berated me, told me i didn’t learn fast enough when the job was “so easy” when THEY DIDN’T EVEN TRAIN ME PROPERLY OR GIVE ME ENOUGH TRAINING DAYS. they told me i was rude to guests when i have never been rude at all. so now i’m out of a job, my dad’s sick and i still never got my tips i earned. this job has been the worst experience of my life, and my mental health has deteriorated so much since starting about a month ago. i’ve heard similar stories from people that worked at this shit company. today, they showed me absolutely no humanity. i was in tears telling them my dad could pass and both managers just went off on me. i’ve heard my coworkers are being the same way by the managers and that other locations are the same way. please, don’t support this restaurant if you know which one i’m talking about. support a local Italian eatery instead. support a place that doesn’t abuse their employees.",False,kok6sy,standragula-,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kok6sy/well_i_just_got_fired_from_the_famous_italian/,14,1

2198,A megacorp is not your dream job,"This is a blog post I read this morning that rings true extensively. ""megacorp"" could be replaced by ""capitalist cooperation"" , and everything else explained would remain true.

**Source:** https://drewdevault.com/2021/01/01/Megacorps-are-not-your-dream-job.html

&gt; Megacorporations do not care about you. You’re worth nothing to them. Google made $66 billion in 2014 — even if you made an exorbitant $500K salary, you only cost them .00075% of that revenue. They are not invested in you. Why should you invest in them? Why should you give a company that isn’t invested in you 40+ hours of your week, half your waking life, the only life you get?

&gt; You will have little to no meaningful autonomy, impact, or influence. Your manager’s manager’s manager’s manager (1) will exist, and (2) will not know your name, and probably not your manager’s name either. The company will be good at advertising their jobs, especially to fresh grads, and you will no doubt have dozens of cool project in mind that you’re itching to get involved with. You won’t be assigned any of them — all vacancies are already filled by tenured staff and nepotism. You’re more likely to work on a product you have hardly ever heard of or used, doing work that doesn’t interest you or meaningfully impact anyone you know.

&gt; A business doesn’t get a billion-dollar valuation (or… ugh… a trillion-dollar valuation) by having a productive team which takes good care of its employees, rewarding them with interesting projects, or quickly correcting toxic work environments. A business might get millions of dollars, at most, with that approach. The megacorps got their 10th figure with another strategy: ruthlessness. They create and exploit monopolies, and bribe regulators to look the other way. They acquire and dismantle competitors. They hire H1B’s and subject them to payroll fraud and workplace abuse, confident that they can’t quit without risking their visa. Megacorps are a faceless machine which is interested only in making as much money as possible with any resources at their disposal, among those being a budget which exceeds most national GDPs.1

&gt; If anything goes wrong in this heartless environment, you’re going to be in a very weak position. If you go to HR2 for almost any dispute, they are unlikely to help. If you quit, remember that they will have forced you to sign an NDA and a non-compete. You’re rolling the dice on whether or not they’ll decide that you’ve overstepped (and they can decide that — the terms are virtually impossible not to breach). That .00075% of their annual revenue you took home? They could easily spend 100x that on lawyers without breaking a sweat, and money is justice in the United States. You will likely have no recourse if they wrong you.

&gt; They may hurt you, but even worse, they will make you hurt others. You will be complicit in their ruthlessness. Privacy dragnets, union busting, monopolistic behavior and lobbying, faux-slavery of gig workers in domestic warehouses and actual-slavery of workers in foreign factories, answering to nations committing actual ongoing genocide — this is only possible because highly skilled individuals like yourself chose to work for them, build their war chest, or even directly contribute to these efforts. Your salary may be a drop in the bucket to them, but consider how much that figure means to you. If you make that $500K, they spend 1.5× that after overhead, and they’d only do it if they expect a return on that investment. Would you give a corporation with this much blood on its hands $750K of your worth? Pocket change to them, maybe, but a lot of value to you, value that you could be adding somewhere else.

&gt; They won’t care about you. They won’t be invested in you. They won’t give you interesting work. You will have no recourse if things go wrong, and things are primed to go wrong. They could hurt you, and they could make you hurt others. Don’t fall for their propaganda.

&gt; Megacorps are, in fact, in the minority. There are tens of thousands of other tech companies that could use your help. Tech workers are in high demand — you have choices! You will probably be much happier at a small to mid-size company. The “dream job” megacorps have sold you on is just good marketing.

&gt; Political side thought: Amazon’s revenue in 2019 alone exceeds the GDP of 150 sovereign nations. Is undemocratic ownership of resources and power on that scale just?

&gt; Quick reminder that HR’s job is to protect the company, not you. This applies to any company, not just megacorps. If you have a problem that you need to bring to HR, you should have a lawyer draft that letter, and you should polish up your resume first.",False,komdfm,ComprehensiveAddict,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/komdfm/a_megacorp_is_not_your_dream_job/,3,1

On a welfare payment called 'jobseeker', as the name implies, you are meant to look for any work you are physically capable of doing while on it. I just don't want to work really. The thought of it sucks. I'd never enjoy it. The only 'work' I ever enjoyed doing was volunteer work. Soon I intend to get off this welfare payment and leave my mum to pay for most things, although I'll pay for other things out of my savings. She's elderly so she gets paid for that. 

I used to do paid online surveys, unless you put hours into that, you'll make hardly anything. Very very small pocket change. But I mean, you don't have to deal with people at least. It's extremely boring though. 

I liked volunteer work because it didn't feel like work and it just felt like helping others out. No pressure, no nagging, no deadlines. Had to deal with people of course but nearly everyone was alright. 

But as long as I can live off her and off my savings (I've got 10k but I can live really cheaply if I'm not paying rent lol). Yeah that makes me feel a bit bad. But I am also her carer as well and help her with a few aspects of her life. We usually get along which is nice. And yeah, as long as there is enough to sustain us both then I'm not working. I'm willing to do volunteer work for now and that's all.

I am indeed sick of the unemployed being treated badly. Why should anyone have to slave their days away for an employer? Unemployed called lazy and things like that. I figure since I'm a carer I'm not really subjected to the bad treatment that some other unemployed might receive (dirty looks, comments).

You have so much more value and worth. It shouldn't be determined by how many hours you work at a job for. A job shouldn't be what defines you... Sadly in this society, one of the first questions new people tend to ask is 'What do you do for a living'?

2213,How do you respond to the “billionaires worked hard for their money” and Printing Money debate,"Whenever I am enjoying content about “eat the rich” and other light hearted fun I see a lot of discussions in the comments from people defending billionaires.  The argument that they worked hard for their money and that why should they just give it away? “It’s their money they get to do what they want with it.” However when you have people out here like Bezos who can giveaway/spend $200 million dollars a day and still be the richest man alive and other people who don’t even have a $1 to their name... something isn’t right. 

Some people say a way we could help out those in need is by printing more money because money is literally just a concept we made up. But here comes the billionaire Simps saying it would cause inflation but why can we just.. not let it?? Like I don’t know id love to hear how everyone feels about this situation and how do you personally respond to people who make these statements",False,kpo23z,insomniacaesthetic,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kpo23z/how_do_you_respond_to_the_billionaires_worked/,34,1
