2,The Bee Movie is antiwork,i was thinking about the bee movie the other day  it shows how the bees' labor is necessary for the entire planet's ecosystem to function  but the culty hypercapitalist system that they live in is exploitative  as one of the human villains says   they make the honey and we make the money  and it also shows how bees are arbitrarily assigned a single job that they have zero passion for  they're brainwashed into thinking working that job for their whole lives is their purpose of living  they work until they die and get easily replaced by newly graduated bees  and many of them aren't paid enough  in the end  they solve problems by collectively working together  not with a profit motive for a large monopoly  but with the motive to make the world a better place  because their labor makes a real difference   one scene goes like this    and you'll be happy to know that bees as a species haven't had one day off in 27 million years    so you'll just work us to death    we'll sure try    everyone else laughs ,oaigw9

10,Help me build the support networks for a general strike:,look  i know  i know  you've all grown tired of hearing about unactualized general strikes  so have i    however  i think most of us believe in the need for such an action  if not only to raise our depressed wages  then also for healthcare  our environment  our kids  for the members of our extended families in  not only the first world but also  the third   for the immigrant children who've experienced prison even before puberty  for the untold numbers of adults who have and still are wasting away in prison  for those who've been prayed upon by rehabs and insurance companies and those who've needlessly suffered the world over for some oligarch's profits    i could write a book but it wouldn't bring to light anything you don't already know   specifically  what is it we know  we know that behind this myriad of issues lays one relatively small group of people  and this is true for not just one country but the world over   our issues may be so numerous that it seems too daunting to tackle the issues  fair enough  let's treat the cause not the symptoms    eventually we strike  we demand justice and equality  we demand accountability for those who've let our loved ones die with treatable diseases  who let us suffer mental health issues while we toil away for unlivable wages and we demand accountability to those who've suppressed science and who've worked to corrupt our governments   but to begin i propose we start crunching the numbers    how many people can a certain population  nashville  tn for instance  expect to participate in a general strike    how long might we expect that to last    how much money would we need to support ourselves throughout such an event    how long might we expect it to take to raise those funds in advance    i want to begin working this out  by labor day  and with your help  i hope to begin opening individual kickstarter accounts for each participating area  so a kickstart for nashville  for birmingham  for omaha for denver  for la  etc and that's only here in the u s   we need to extrapolate on this idea and implement it world wide  for if we only strike in the u s  these multinationals will only redirect profits from the rest of the world to subvert our efforts    we need to stand with honk kong again  we need to support chile  peru and iran and we need them to support us  not so much support us with money but with solidarity and we need to support them  we are in this together ,ob0dww

17,What should I do with my life?,i don't know if this is the right subreddit but i saw it going through popular and i wanted to share this for some time   i've been feeling like there's something wrong with me for a few months because i don't want to work anymore  it's not about my company  coworkers  salary or career  is just that i really don't want to work  i don't feel like life should be this way of working 9-5 for 50 years or more just to pay bills and buy shit   i already suffer from anxiety and this is giving me a lot lately    i didn't work for most of 2020 because of covid and i was happy  but since i couldn't do anything at all i kind of felt like yeah  working would be good  but it's been completely the opposite  and i changed careers to a better one  got a better job and better pay but i still feel so unhappy every single day that i don't know what i'm going to do with my life but i am 100  sure that working is not what i want to do   everyday and more and more unmotivated  i procrastinate a lot  have problems focusing myself  those things i had them before but now i feel them even more   and i know that a new job  or more money won't make happy  if anything less miserable  and i can't find the mental energy to do anything to make a change in my life  and of course then there's money which unfortunately we need to survive in this extreme capitalism system ,ob65mr

20,How do you make money without a job?,i'm not sure if this is the right place for this  and it's probably a stupid question anyway  but i thought it would be worth a shot anyway   i hate that society revolves around money  but here we are  i'm thinking the best way to destroy capitalism is to rot from from inside out  anybody have any ideas - or better yet  proven methods - to generate consistent income hacks in order to generate money without forfeiting your time and dignity to an employer who doesn't give a shit about you    if there was  everyone would be doing it   i don't necessarily think so  people are married to their jobs for many reasons  routine  consistency  benefits  pessimism  etc   anyway  i figured it was about time we start putting our heads together about it ,ob0chn

37,What I realized recently about my life, this is my story of working life    since i left school i worked in different jobs like retail and call centers for some years now    i had motivation for my first call center job and tried hard to show my best for my girlfriends sake since she demanded more money  at some point i didnt feel like myself anymore  i felt like some kind of robot who would do and say the same things every day without an ending in sight    the stress of the job by dealing with customers who would insult  scream and threaten me was really bad for my health  my heart beat quickly  my body was stinging so much that i thought i would die and my hands were sweating so much that my clothes would be all wet where my hands were placed  i even went to a doctor regarding that pain  but he didnt care about it much and didnt seem to want to even take time for me  he only said that im young and thats normal    amp x200b    some time went by and i ended the relationship with my girlfriend  amp  with my job when i finally realized that it was the same as my parents relationship where my mother is only together with my father because of money  never understood why people are in relationships when its only for having an advantage and not about love    - dad was working the whole time for money  was rarely at home and missed seeing his children growing up completely    - mother was buying much unnecessary stuff with the money and instead of love there was verbal  amp  physical abuse at home      at that time i didnt know what was right or wrong since noone told me  i was new to this world and i just thought  what did i do wrong  why am i so bad  all the time when i was crying myself to sleep or had suicide thoughts after experiencing abuse    when i grew a little older i realized i never want to end up like  adults  who are causing pain and are two faced   once i visited my grandmas house and found randomly a piece of paper which said  human rights  opened the paper and read the articles  where i started smiling and just thought what kind of world is that  i was sure its not the world i experienced so far    amp x200b    i was completely alone again  searched for another job since i had no money for paying rent and landed in retail  didnt have much motivation  when u got noone the motivation is really bad  but i still tried to do a good job  people were complaining like usual about things i cant change and sometimes they were expecting me to do things where i thought  im not getting paid for doing that    after some time in this job i realized no matter how hard i try to do a good job it actually doesnt matter and started thinking  every time i tried hard to do something the best i can in the past it always ended really bad for myself    without a single break time and being up on my feet the whole time at a eight to ten hour shift in the job my feet got really painful and it got worse over time  decided this isnt worth it  that my health is more important and i quit this job who only paid minimum wage anyways    amp x200b    on the advice of my colleague from the retail job  i applied for unemployment benefits  to get it  however  you had to write applications on job advertisements  so i applied for jobs that are possible where i meet the requirements  retail  amp  call center  with hope to get a job without experiencing pain  the unemployment benefit i received was below the poverty line but it was enough to survive    amp x200b    got a new job in a call center  which i only did for a month before quitting  every single day that month i had severe headaches and could hardly concentrate  i thought the whole time while at work  why am i doing this  going to the doctor was no option for me from my past experience so i quit after a month  and with the day of the termination of the job  the headaches have disappeared     amp x200b    i decided to take a few months off with my savings now  without an income  since i don't know what to do anymore  somehow i dont care much about money or a job  mostly giving the money i earned to charitys to help abuse victims  if i had to decide between a job which causes me pain and unemplyoment benefits without pain i would always choose the latter though ,oalpds

58,Gen Xer here with a few ideas for ya'll,hi i just bumped into this sub and wanted to throw out a few ideas for those who feel like cogs  meaningless under paid workers    apologies for the length of this post  and lack of links  but i hope someone out there finds this useful    have you heard of   intentional living    and  alternative  things like co-housing   google intentional living   in these arrangements  you can trade  say 20 hours of work a week on a communal project  whatever your talent might be  from gardening to help prepare meals to planning and then n return for being part a community all housing and other basic  needs are taken care of  but goes beyond just basic needs     i like the ecological communities built around sustainable living - i'm looking into a few of them now    these communities exist all over the world  including two in nyc    i'm assuming a younger crowd here  so this is what i tell my 16 year old nephew who's working part time at subway  he's a talented drummer and wants to be a jazz musician  i tell him to go for it but there's things that pay a lot of money that don't involve korporate america that can pay the bills until he reaches carnegie hall  heh     1  painting interiors and or exteriors  i needed a painter a few years ago and couldn't find an affordable one that did decent work and didn't whine about doing some drywall  this wasn't a huge job but the prices were surreal  if you live in or near a city make up cards and get to know management companies that manage condos  co-ops  apartment buildings  and building supers  the management of our 5 story condo paid something like  40k to have the freakin halls painted   hard to believe isn't it  two 5 story sister buildings just the halls      2  electrician - interesting work and no one's going to outsource electricians  i need a kitchen monorail light fixed and the going rate to troubleshoot it is  175 hr   from past experiences it's really hard to find a good electrician  so when word gets out these guys are all booked  i can't afford to have it looked at so i'm just  going to replace this light    my brother's a small time builder  he's had projects on hold for weeks waiting for the electrician to have time to show up     3  farrier someone who shoes horses  - don't laugh  about 20 years ago i was assigned a land line number that had belonged to a local farrier  my phone rang all day long 7 days a week   all these people were scrambling to find another farrier  there's a real shortage and farriers make a lot of money  sure it's hard work but not any harder than working for a general contractor  besides  horse people are generally nice  very appreciative of the farrier  and working around horses beats working in retail  overhead is low  just have to learn the trade     4  it you're a creative type open an etsy store    back in the day i knew this couple who sold sporting memorabilia on ebay  it started as a hobby  they got so busy they had to both quit their korporate jobs  i don't know where they sourced the products i think they had to drive around a bit  but they had fun and made more money than their old jobs     5  many of you probably live in areas where you can find deals on mid century modern furniture and related items  teach yourself about mid century  modern design  drive around to wherever it's found in your area  then haul it to a city flea market  the prices this stuff goes for boggles my mind   example  gt  i knew these two guys living the beach life in ft lauderdale  fl  apparently south florida is loaded with mid century modern furniture  they started buying it for cheap  then they'd make runs about 3 times a year and unload this stuff at the clelsea flea market in nyc   i don't know how much they made but they sure weren't slumming it and had loads of time   this hot trend doesn't show signs of going anywhere even after 20 years     6  grow mosses for the aquarium trade  look up the prices of various mosses on any site that sells plants for fish tanks  a little 3  x 3  piece of moss goes for a fortune and the biggest joke is  it's not hard to cultivate  if i had an extra room that's what i'd be doing  speaking of the aquarium trade  look at how much driftwood and various rocks sell for  some woods can't be used in fish tanks but plenty can  look at the prices  of pieces of wood and rocks used in aqua scaping  you won't believe how much money people pay for rocks and wood  read up how to treat wood yourself it's not hard   if i had an extra room that's what i'd be doing    especially smaller pieces like for 10 gallon betta tanks  a couple of small pieces of spider wood at the pet store or aquarium shop are probably around  30 00  haven't looked in a while   i know some states have laws against taking rocks from streams so pay attention to local ordinances  look on ebay if you want to get an idea of how much rocks are worth lol    just a few ideas for housing and getting off the treadmill - all the best        i really want to move and get into the moss business lol ,oan7zg

61,FMLA is going to make things interesting at my job,specifically me going on fmla for a chronic health condition   i work at a retail store where we are pretty much always short one person   that's how they like to run it   now i've gone on fmla before when i was younger but it was at a big call center so it didn't make much difference if i was there or not   however  at this job it will hit them hard if they don't hire another person   for those not familiar with fmla  it gives 60 days off a year   these days are without pay  but it makes sure someone doesn't lose their job because of a health condition they're dealing with or taking care of a loved one and a couple other scenarios   i've been able to work there so far without much trouble of having to call in sick etc   i'm planning to go off a specific medication and i know there will be withdrawal and there could even be weeks where i don't come in   the interesting thing about fmla is i don't have to give notice really   and i can even show up late and leave early at my discretion  as i'm doing my best with a chronic condition     the reason i'm making this post is because i have a feeling i am going to be the one to blame when the store is short handed   certain coworkers won't like it  and management won't like it either if the company decides to not hire another person   we have a store manager but in many ways he doesn't make decisions for the store  he doesn't decide how many people work there  he doesn't advocate for his employees to the higher ups   he is seen as doing a good job by keeping the least amount of employees with the least amount of pay and keeping the store running   it's a pathetic way to live your life in my opinion     various coworkers won't understand what fmla is and i'm definitely going to be somewhat hated on   as far as i know the store management has never had an employee on fmla and it will be new for them too   i can come in every other day   give myself three or four day weekends  pretty much anything i want and they can't do a thing about it    i'm not being paid for when i'm not working so it's not like they're losing money   but with how they designed the work schedule and amount of employees it's going to kill them if they don't hire another person at least part time   there will be more pressure on staff to not take their vacation days etc   i know the simplest solution will be to hire another person full time  and there's room for another person with me working there full time right now   but i know how things work there and they would rather everyone suffer for as long as possible before they decide to bring someone else on   i'll definitely post an update when this all goes down   now remember i'm not doing this to fuck with them   i need money i need to work  i just don't want to be in danger of losing my job because i ran out of sick days or endanger myself and others by trying to work while in withdrawal or without having slept   but i bet you i'm going to be looked at as the bad guy   the guy with the chronic health conditions  that works when he can  yeah that's the guy who is making it so hard on everyone else ,oaoqmi

64,Eager to quit the job that’s forcing me to return to in-person. Mistake?,while some might argue i have a good job and that i am  lucky  to hold  i am very eager to find a new one  i did a calculation today that if i come in at the number of hours they want me to after they force us to return to the office  4 days per week minimum  i would spend 384 hours every year commuting  and it makes me really mad  despite the security and fairly good salary  and decent benefits  this does not seem to be worth it to me    i have two options   1  i tell my supervisors that coming in 4-days a week is a deal-breaker  and that  i will need to look for another job  this will undoubtedly piss them off    2  i do it behind their back  which will piss them off even more  loyalty is a big thing in their view  and i also run the risk of finding something with less benefits  potentially less stimulating for my brain  and also likely less secure in terms of job security long-term    what experience are people having looking for remote jobs currently  is the market for those actually as abundant as the internet makes it seem  i ve been doing a bit of digging  and it seems like a lot of the good remote jobs are in engineering and it  am i just looking in the wrong places  i am specifically looking for administrative communications grant admin leadership hr positions   looking for your helpful comments  my antiwork warriors  am i making a mistake thinking the grass is greener on the other side  one day maybe we will be free after decades of killing ourselves to reach financial independence ,oalesa

Hear me out...,i have to go back to a job soon  sadly  and i feel completely empty  i don't feel like a human  i feel like an empty shell full of dread and despair   i am a robot whose sole existence is to provide labor for his employer  and i will do so until the day i die  sacrificing family time  holidays  and my time and passions and interests and my very soul  in exchange for slips of paper and be happy for the opportunity to do so   i always get told that i have a god complex or that i think i'm better than anyone else whenever i suggest that humans are inherently evil and stupid  or  even better  their response is  you're human too  yeah  obviously i am  what  do you expect me to slowly turn to you  look at you with wide eyes  and realize in that moment that  holy shit  i am human 111  no  i realize i'm a human  and that i'm no better than anyone else  that doesn't mean i shouldn't be able to have an opinion about the human race as a whole  it's possible to step away from yourself and look around and see just why they're stupid   well  for starters  we're the only living species that passes around green slips of paper that at some point was collectively agreed upon to be a method of trade although it's value is completely imaginary  we pass around these green slips of paper to be able to have shelter  food  and water  which are basic human necessities   we essentially decided to be the only living species to pay to live on their planet   1  we  in a greatly exaggerated sense  at some point decided to pass around green slips of paper to be able to drink out of a lake after watching deer drinking out of it freely  2  we  in a greatly exaggerated sense  decided to watch dolphins swim around in the water happily  living a simple  enjoyable life  and decided to make our lives about worrying over numbers on a computer screen in a thing called a  bank account  dropping below a value of zero  3  we  in a greatly exaggerated sense  saw the beauty in nature  and decided to tear it all down  destroying and murdering for the sake of a system valuing infinite profit over human life on a planet with finite resources  earth was essentially a paradise  and we tore it down  making asphalt roads  pollution machines of all kinds  and treating it like a giant trash can    a green slip of paper that we call a  bill  is not going to stop a bear from attacking you    a green slip of paper that we call a  bill  is not going to magically make the water stop drowning you   a green slip of paper that we call a  bill  is not going to stop that tornado from changing course and barreling over your house  why does money matter   money makes things soulless   get a job doing what you love  is capitalist bullshit  you should not have to monetize and profit off of the few things that make you wholeheartedly happy  when you apply money to something  you will soon hate it  you may love to have sex a lot  but once you're stuck on a strict schedule of sex 8 hours a day  you may only want to have sex for 4 hours a day  but have to continue doing it for 8  and if you don't you get kicked out  you may love to bake cakes  but once you're doing it 10 hours a day on a strict schedule for an ungodly amount of customers every single day  you'll soon dread it  work is a neverending vicious cycle  it feels like you're being drowned 5 days a week  and your two days off are your attempts to gasp for breath as your head is temporarily pulled out of the water bucket  for 40 years  until you die  or if you survive  maybe you'll get 12 years of freedom  but you won't have the youth or energy to truly enjoy it  and with the way things are going  my generation can't retire  my generation's retirement plan  as a general rule  is to just wait for societal collapse   and politics  fuck them  i hate politics  i've started to realize more and more that there is no  left vs right  it's a tactic to make citizens break apart and fight against each other rather than uniting their minds and realizing the true problems  each side just wants to brainwash you into accepting their ideals and beliefs instead of being independent and seeing the world's biggest problems  originally  it was supposed to be one side having different ways of tackling issues as opposed to the other side  nowadays  it's  oh  fuck the right  they're so brainwashed   the left are so brainwashed and nobody wants to go back to work  politics are rigged  the people in power stay in power  there's a whole system they've created to keep the general population brainwashed  or at the very least distracted or chained down  to keep them from overthrowing them  we could have a world that's fair and just  with no chance of corrupt individuals rising to power  and instead we have a world where everyone has been brainwashed to believe slavery no longer exists  stop limiting yourself to thinking of chatel slavery - it's what they want  slavery still exists  it's just been sugarcoated and the rules have changed  it's better than what we had before  but it's still there   capitalism runs on the threat of poverty  and the man who bakes a loaf of bread to earn the money to buy a slice of bread is not free   why does everything have to be so complicated  we look at dolphins and think we're more intelligent than them because we've achieved the wheel  new york  wars  and so on  while all the dolphins ever do is swim in the water having a good time  conversely  the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man for precisely the same reasons  hitchhikers guide to the galaxy   how am i supposed to be hopeful and cheerful looking towards my future  besides my girlfriend  all i see in the future are terrible bosses  low wages  rising inflation  a worsening housing market  criminalizing the homeless  rich getting richer  poor getting poorer  and a world  not  on the brink of collapse  but rather already  in the midst  of collapse   i see wars coming  i see fascism spreading outside of workplaces  i see a greater hell than we're already in ,ob8q7f

74,Working is Pain - gonna take a Break now,since i left school i worked in different jobs like retail and call centers for some years now   i had motivation for my first call center job and tried hard to show my best for my girlfriends sake since she demanded more money  at some point i didnt feel like myself anymore  i felt like some kind of robot who would do and say the same things every day without an ending in sight   the stress of the job by dealing with customers who would insult  scream and threaten me was really bad for my health  my heart beat quickly  my body was stinging so much that i thought i would die and my hands were sweating so much that my clothes would be all wet where my hands were placed  i even went to a doctor regarding that pain  but he didnt care about it much and didnt seem to want to even take time for me  he only said that im young and thats normal   some time went by and i ended the relationship with my girlfriend  amp  with my job when i finally realized that it was the same as my parents relationship where my mother is only together with my father because of money  never understood why people are in relationships when its only for having an advantage and not about love    - dad was working the whole time for money  was rarely at home and missed seeing his children growing up completely    - mother was buying much unnecessary stuff with the money and instead of love there was verbal  amp  physical abuse at home   at that time i didnt know what was right or wrong since noone told me  i was new to this world and i just thought  what did i do wrong  why am i so bad  all the time when i was crying myself to sleep or had suicide thoughts after experiencing abuse   when i grew a little older i realized i never want to end up like  adults  who are causing pain and are two faced   once i visited my grandmas house and found randomly a piece of paper which said  human rights  opened the paper and read the articles  where i started smiling and just thought what kind of world is that  i was sure its not the world i experienced so far   i was completely alone again  searched for another job since i had no money for paying rent and landed in retail  didnt have much motivation  when u got noone the motivation is really bad  but i still tried to do a good job  people were complaining like usual about things i cant change and sometimes they were expecting me to do things where i thought  im not getting paid for doing that  after some time in this job i realized no matter how hard i try to do a good job it actually doesnt matter and started thinking  every time i tried hard to do something the best i can in the past it always ended really bad for myself  without a single break time and being up on my feet the whole time at a eight to ten hour shift in the job my feet got really painful and it got worse over time  decided this isnt worth it  that my health is more important and i quit this job who only paid minimum wage anyways   on the advice of my colleague from the retail job  i applied for unemployment benefits  to get it  however  you had to write applications on job advertisements  so i applied for jobs that are possible where i meet the requirements  retail  amp  call center  with hope to get a job without experiencing pain  the unemployment benefit i received was below the poverty line but it was enough to survive   got a new job in a call center  which i only did for a month before quitting  every single day that month i had severe headaches and could hardly concentrate  i thought the whole time while at work  why am i doing this  going to the doctor was no option for me from my past experience so i quit after a month  and with the day of the termination of the job  the headaches have disappeared   i decided to take a few months off with my savings now  without an income  since i don't know what to do anymore  somehow i dont care much about money or a job  mostly giving the money i earned to charitys to help abuse victims   if i had to decide between a job which causes me pain and unemplyoment benefits without pain i would always choose the latter though ,oatpgf
75,"It seems hypocritical to ban Dan Price tweets but continue to allow Bernie Sanders, AOC, Squad etc. tweets.",dan price is a  literal  capitalist who writes tweets highlighting the problems of capitalism with the underlying assumption that these problems could be corrected from within the system if only people behaved more morally   how are bernie  aoc  et al  any different   i have found their tweets to be even more disingenuous than dan price's  we're talking about people who literally voted in favor of the cares act  the single largest upward transfer of wealth in history  and somehow they have the high ground over some tech entrepreneur when they presided over and without objection supported the fly-by-night passage of the single most stark looting of the proletariat class by the bourgeoisie that has ever happened   this isn't to say that i disagree with the decision to remove dan price's tweets -- but to the same token  it seems very hypocritical to do so while continuing to allow content from people who insidiously do more to undermine our cause while actually being in a position of real power  dan price is small potatoes next to the audacious mendacity i see coming from bernie and aoc ,oaxkq1

77,I'm So Tired,i thought my job was going so well because my superiors always made sure to tell me i was doing a great job and showed their appreciation and even gave me a raise a little while ago before i had even asked for one  but the culture has changed so much since i was hired  it used to be so much more relaxed  but now my coworkers are skipping their lunch breaks and working late and i look like the asshole for refusing to do those things   now i just feel like the compliments and the raise were a trick to try to get me to work more harder  a raise should be a reward for work you're already doing  whether it's because you've been there for a certain amount of time or you've picked up more responsibilities  not as a wink wink nudge nudge to make you feel like now you need to bust your ass harder to feel like you deserved the extra money   the way i see it  i come in 5 days a week  do 8 hours of work  and i leave  if the work doesn't get done in that amount of time  it was too much to ask of me  i do not slack off  not that slacking off on your corporate office job is bad  it's just not in my nature  there is literally no more for them to ask of me  and yet every day i feel like i'm not doing as much as they want me to  and every day i go home with a headache from grinding my teeth  never in my life have i wanted to destroy capitalism more ,ob7fmf
78,What would you do all day if you didn’t have a job?,i don t know maybe play guitar  go for a hike  play a round of golf  travel  go for a swim  read a book  go for a swim  watch a movie  meditate  go out for lunch  stay up late  sleep in  watch the sunrise  watch the sunset  go to the beach  go camping  listen to music  go to the gym  talk with a friend  walk a dog  play with a cat  feed a fish  play video games  lay in in hammock   why is so hard to accept that your life doesn t have to revolve around your job ,oaf211

84,"Opinion: Older generations simply don't understand how much work affects your mental health and the type of work we do today is nothing like what was available 20,30,40,50 years ago.",i'm 24  nearly 25 in a couple of months and i'm literally at the worst point in my life when i'm being told by everyone 'your 20's are the best years of your life enjoy 'em while you can'    no one payed attention to me during school  college or work  i was being abused at home daily and didn't even know  just taking it to be the norm and coming from a family that has 0 communication  made me talk and open up to no one even to this day   no one knows what's really happened to me  no one knows how deep the past 20 years of my life has been affecting me  my first visual memory of my parents i can still remember is them fighting with my 4 year old brother in the middle being tossed around  we were underfed  unclothed  unclean and had to support ourselves from a very young age  stealing food and money to get by and fit in with friends and peers to appear normal   there were times that i would try and open up and explain just how i'm feeling inside  which is nothing  i feel empty and unmotivated and lacking any sense of self worth  my parents  school  college all knew i have various degrees of mental difficultly but no one really wanted to help  a family that's disconnected  a history of violence  a christian school that i don't remember once even mentioning mental health through the 5 years i was there and an underfunded college treating adults like children still  put your hand up to go to the toilet  put your phone in a box at the start of class  like i'm 18 fucking years old when will this stop   i was then told at the ripe age of 'adulthood' i need to get a job or get out  i hit the age where college funding of  30 a week or whatever wasn't paid to students now  and since the child benefits stopped  i was no longer 'paying my way'  i dropped college  left home  moved in with someone that turned into a 4 year relationship of lies  cheating and a whole other slurry of issues  and worked my ass off trying to earn money to get by    i had no one showing me what to do growing up  all i had was boomers spewing capitalist nonsense and everyone everywhere telling me work will sort me out  tv shows  throws themselves into work and fixes every life problem  i'd grown up on the idea that work leads to a better life  so i did   i took any work i could get  just proud to go out and earn  i started cleaning at a cinema chain which i loved as growing up in a dirty household led to many ocd issues as well  i was getting up at 4am and going to work  cleaning doing my thing and would be home by 12pm having the time of my life  feeling shit but feeling motivated  then i got into retail  fucked me up ever since  i was used by management  had no mental health support  quit education and never dealt with any of my childhood issues  they told me i didn't matter and was replaceable within a week  that i should be lucky to have a job as it 'wasn't so easy back in the day'    they think now we can sit on our arse through education and university  get a degree and a high paying job without lifting a finger while they all cry about coal mines and factories and landlines  i'm sorry i was born into a generation of technology and things are different but it wasn't our generation that built what we have today or asked for it in the first place  were used as punching bags for the failure our families before have caused and as we're just newer extensions of them we should be able to have the same capacity they did when the world has changed completely   boomers posting about how we don't work hard anymore  we play on our phones and videos games  and sit of social media all day gossiping  we watch netflix instead of the stock market and we watch youtube instead of reading scientific publications  they make us feel like we're worthless and unuseful from the start so we keep turning the cogs with low paying  unmotivating and grueling work  not telling us about their failures and how they did pretty much every we did but we're a mistake where they are a lesson  you worked physically for 8 hours a day or pushed papers  walked into work as demand wasn't so much higher than supply  any overtime or extra work that was done was for your personal benefit and success  where our extra work and overtime is another  21 in the wage with 40  taken off and being screamed at on the phone in person by entitled karen's and ian's    were treated like slaves and told differently because we now have 'basic human rights'  i don't have a basic right to any land or property  i don't have basic human rights to water as i need a property to get the water  i don't have access to the healthcare i so desperately need  i don't have access to any work that will get me out of a horrendous situation because of a situation i had no control over  there are thousands of homeless people literally entitled to nothing and people walk by everyday without a care in the world    our world is at a fine breaking point where a while generation is just going to be taken down by mental health  suicide  self harm  a amp e admissions  hotlines  charities are all on the brink unable to cope with the huge demand of all walks of life and ages being treated so unworthy and inhumane  there's so much evil in the world hidden behind a silver veil that is soon going to fall when the generations running no longer can  no one lives forever  and the horrors will be revealed very shortly  seeing nearly 3 generations banding together saying 'this world isn't right this isn't what a perfect life we need change' is the only thing keeping me going right now  and i'm sure it's the same for a lot of others    we need complete change  and we need it soon ,oaflsb
85,Had an interesting day today.,i don't align with everything in this sub  but i get most of it  i really do  i do understand that there's a lot of our work ways that need to be changed  i've worked in the same mechanic shop through the pandemic  we never once stopped  never got hazard pay  none of that   long story short  i've heard my boss say multiple times  that's the way we've done it for 75years  we're not gonna change it to suit you  this has always irked me when he's said it   i recently went from flat rate to hourly pay  for those that don't know  flat rate means i get paid by a fixed time per job  if i can get it done faster great  i make more money  i've had 80  hr weeks while only working 40  but ran into the issue of getting fed up with them wasting my time demanding i'm in the shop open to close even when we were slow  i make less now  but they pay me to waste my time  or send me home so they don't pay for me doing nothing    got into it with the boss today about a repair that can be done many ways  but because i didn't do it  the way they have done it for 75 years  i was wrong  got pulled into the office and got told to go home before my attitude got me fired  dared him to fire me on the spot  no go  just got sent home  i really hate anal retentive managers   rant over  sorry ,ob11on

128,Voicing my anti work opinions,is it so bad that i as a person don't want to spend 90  of my time working at job where i have to deal with people all the time and it is mentally and physically draining everyday and when i mean that i work 90  of time i mean that i work from monday-saturday and only get sunday off    i tried to tell my coworkers that i quit because i am exhausted and i don't like taking over people shifts almost having to do a double shift and  having to be called in on my days off to come into work and they going to basically compare their personal life to mines basically like how people say well they are other people who have problems but they still pushed through  while i'm not like other people who want to keep working shitty understaffed jobs and i know that being an adult is about working  when you barely have any flexible work schedule you can't schedule anything properly around this one job that you spend most of your time on    i know what having a work balance life is and it is certainly not working at this one job that needs people who aren't doing anything  it's just bad when your whole body and mind just doesn't have time to really recover so all you can do is  try to push through  when you can barely get up  to me if a job is affect my life outside of working and my well-being it is worth staying long term no matter the matter  how i see it is if most people are okay with working themselves to death  i honestly don't know how they don't get depressed or some shit  then that is them but i personally don't want that for my lifestyle  so my question is that is it really bad that i would prefer working 4 days for 6 hours rather than 6 days for 6 hours does this idea make me look lazy and not like i don't want to work ,oaszya

150,What is happening?,    is anyone tired of not being paid their worth  i graduated and worked myself to the absolute bone to be the best in computer science  i got my first job at a fortune 25 company and i am basically monkey that no longer codes  i am constantly barraged with after hours calls and emails  i maintain a major system of distribution that maintains the company yet none of it is difficult  i work 10 hours a week while pretending to work 45-50  i've come to realize all the hard work i've put in is pointless  i've seen nepotism push people who know zero go on to make 3-10x my salary  with productivity decoupling from pay since the 70's it s clear my work has no value  i personally consider it corporate welfare  i pretend to work  and they pretend to pay me  statistics show in real purchasing power the generations before me made 3x as much presumably doing 33  of the work  i cannot afford a home  i cannot afford a family and yet i must smile  i must go to work acting as if it is a good thing to be  busy  yet even if i were to make myself busy i would reap none of the benefits and follow none of my passions  i cannot fathom the absolute euphoria the generations that proceeded me must have felt  unknowingly  i understand not everyone has the same opportunity and even regardless of the generational differences we all for the most part should feel scammed  i am so tired of pretending that all my hard work was worth living in a box alone scrimping pennies to save for a retirement that continuously gets pushed further and further out with each passing generation  why is it in real purchasing power generations before me made 3x as much  why does 40  of my salary go to rent when generations before me spent  lt 10  everyone thinks because we live in the age of advanced technology were blessed  we live in an age where automation is right around the corner  the jones act destroying national commerce for the benefit of one singular big business via lobbying bribery  why do we live in an age where this is acceptable  why are people so heavily indoctrinated to believe we are a country for the people  it is clear lobbying is to keep corporatism in the forefront of all governmental progress because it boosts gdp  look at every nation outside the us  the party is quickly coming to an end  every single generation borrows from the success of the next one  look at the diminishing returns on generational wealth amongst boomers millennials zooomers and tell me we aren't flat lining in prosperity  how long can this torment go on where corporate welfare continues to make useless jobs out of explosive productivity pay less and less  why is it that things get harder every generation yet when critical thinking says it should be the opposite  we live in a post scarcity society and yet we have zero autonomy  i was excited that the pandemic gave individual autonomy to work from home yet big business wants to hold us down to protect their bottom line  god forbid we didn't have to pretend to work  why is it that me sitting in a cubicle doing nothing makes more than the average tradesman in my city  why is it that time and time again we see movements to in-fight rather than form a front against what is this corporate slavery  i do not understand why human productivity skyrockets and yet we are stunted by greed  what giant is behind the curtain utilizing us as cattle  what happened to the days where people were not worked 24 hours a day without due compensation  i constantly see so much infighting distract us from what really matters  has nobody thought about the fact that all of the world s major guidelines are utilized to keep the poor  poor  everyone thinks platforms such as robinhood are some form of an escape from the working class yet 99  of traders fail  why is it that individuals en mass are throwing their life savings at iou's on a coupon for a dog coin  we are so desperate as a society to escape the chains that bind us that we forget most fail by design  look at the statistics and the whole market shut down over gme  you are a vehicle to be taxed by the government and you enter into a casino unknowingly to change your life while 99 9  fail thinking you'll be the exception  all of these structures are in place to separate the haves from the have not's and 99 9 percent of everyone reading this will be able to agree in some case  do you not want freedom  why has everything become so unattainable in real terms  why is the success of one generation extracted from the next  how is it that we statistically as the 99  become so abysmally poor  look at the fed statistics and who owns 50  of all assets  the 99  have plummeted and we are siphoned ever more through every catastrophe  when will it end  once everything is mostly automated and corporate welfare willingly comes to an end due to a mass influx of population what is left  who will be standing atop the ivory tower looking down at the plebs begging for a little freedom and sustenance ,o9yxsb

160,"There Is No Such Thing As ""Lazy""",i think its time for us as a society to get rid of the word  lazy  or any related vocabulary with the same concept    what makes you not do something  the feeling of being blocked  this can be for many reasons  like lack of physical or emotional energy  lack of enthusiasm  motivation  anxiety or fear  mental illness  physical incapabilities and others    the word  lazy  comes prepackaged with shame  and shame hurts us psychologically  causing us to blame ourselves for the lack of progression  this word turns us away from the real answers of the source  so lets call being  lazy  being  blocked  instead    for example  you work 40 hours  5 days a week  and can't keep up with house chores  sure  on the surface  you have enough time to clean while not working  but you don't  because of feeling blocked   what is causing this feeling  i don't personally believe anybody wants to live in a messy household  so its most likely the absence of emotional or physical energy  why are you feeling drained  probably emotional and physical stress of working  so why is it that we come home tired  and not do the dishes  you aren't  lazy  for working  and not being able to keep everything else up   the same goes for the rich  they aren't being  lazy  about helping society getting better  or doing any internal work to change  they just straight up don't do that  because they don't want to  they are sociopaths who actively avoid any betterment of society  they are exploitative  we need to start calling things as they really are     we all come prepackaged with different energy levels  that change due to circumstance  the work culture in this society wants us to internalize that we are either achievers or lazy  nothing in between  and that is simply not the truth  we are organisms just trying to get by with what we can    i'd really like to hear everyone else's opinions on this  and help me expand this thought more  also  if you think any other word is just false  and just product of this exploitative society to shame us  please comment ,oacoz4

165,Steal Back Your Life,economy   the domination of survival over life   is essential for the maintenance of all other forms of domination  without the threat of scarcity  it would be difficult to coerce people into obedience to the daily routine of work and pay  we were born into an economized world  the social institution of property has made scarcity a daily threat  property  whether private or communal  separates the individual from the world  creating a situation in which  rather than simply taking what one wants or needs  one is supposed to ask permission  a permission generally only granted in the form of economic exchange  in this way  different levels of poverty are guaranteed to everyone  even the rich  because under the rule of social property what one is not permitted to have far exceeds what one is permitted to have  the domination of survival over life is maintained    those of us who desire to create our lives as our own recognize that this domination  so essential to the maintenance of society  is an enemy we must attack and destroy  with this understanding  theft and squatting can take on significance as part of an insurgent life project  welfare scamming  eating at charity feeds  dumpster diving and begging may allow one to survive without a regular job  but they do not in any way attack the economy  they are within the economy  theft and squatting are also often merely survival tactics  squatters who demand the  right to a home  or try to legalize their squats  thieves who work their  jobs  like any other worker  only in order to accumulate more worthless commodities   these people have no interest in destroying the economy they merely want a fair share of its goods  but those who squat and steal as part of an insurgent life  do so in defiance of the logic of economic property  refusing to accept the scarcity imposed by this logic or to bow to the demands of a world they did not create  such insurgents take what they desire without asking anyone s permission whenever the possibility arises  in this defiance of society s economic rule  one takes back the abundance of the world as one s own   and this is an act of insurrection  in order to maintain social control  the lives of individuals have to be stolen away  in their place  we received economic survival  the tedious existence of work and pay  we cannot buy our lives back  nor can we beg them back  our lives will only be our own when we steal them back   and that means taking what we want without asking permission     willful disobedience https theanarchistlibrary org library various-authors-essays-from-willful-disobedience-volume-1-2 toc23 ,oa5mf1
166,Technology and Class Struggle,the developments in technology over the past sixty years   the nuclear industry  cybernetics and related information techniques  biotechnology and genetic engineering   have produced fundamental changes in the social terrain  the methods of exploitation and domination have changed  and for this reason old ideas about the nature of class and class struggle are not adequate for understanding the present situation  the workerism of the marxists and syndicalists can no longer even be imagined to offer anything useful in developing a revolutionary practise  but simply rejecting the concept of class is not a useful response to this situation either  because in so doing one loses an essential tool for understanding the present reality and how to attack it    exploitation not only continues  but has  intensified  sharply in the wake of the new technology  cybernetics has permitted the decentralization of production  spreading small units of production across the social terrain  automation has drastically reduced the number of production workers necessary for any particular manufacturing process  cybernetics further creates methods for making money without producing anything real  thus allowing capital to expand itself without the expense of labor    furthermore  the new technology demands a specialized knowledge that is not available for most people  this knowledge has come to be the real wealth of the ruling class in the present era  under the old industrial system  one could look at class struggle as the struggle between workers and owners over the means of production  this no longer makes sense  as the new technology advances  the exploited find themselves driven into increasingly precarious positions  the old life-long skilled factory position has been replaced by day labor  service sector jobs  temporary work  unemployment  the black market  illegality  homelessness and prison  this precariousness guarantees that the wall created by the new technology between the exploiters and the exploited remains unbreachable    but the nature of the technology itself places it beyond the reach of the exploited  earlier industrial development had as its primary focus the invention of techniques for the mass manufacturing of standardized goods at low cost for high profit  these new technological developments are not so much aimed at the manufacturing of goods as at the development of means for increasingly thorough and widespread social control and for freeing profit from production  the nuclear industry requires not only specialized knowledge  but also high levels of security that place its development squarely under the control of the state and lead to a military structuring in keeping with its extreme usefulness to the military  cybernetic technology s ability to process  record  gather and send information nearly instantaneously serves the needs of the state to document and monitor its subjects as well as its need to reduce the real knowledge of those it rules to bits of information-data-hoping  thus  to reduce the real capabilities for understanding of the exploited  biotechnology gives the state and capital control over the most fundamental processes of life itself   allowing them to decide what sort of plants  animals and   in time   even human beings can exist    because these technologies require specialized knowledge and are developed for the purpose of increasing the control of the masters over the rest of humanity even in our daily lives  the exploited class can now best be understood as those excluded from this specialized knowledge and thus from real participation in the functioning of power  the master class is  thus  made up of those included in participation in the functioning of power and the real use of the specialized technological knowledge  of course these are processes in course  and the borderlines between the included and excluded can  in some cases  be elusive as increasing numbers of people are proletarianized   losing whatever decision-making power over their own conditions of existence they may have had    it is important to point out that although these new technologies are intended to give the masters control over the excluded and over the material wealth of the earth  they are themselves beyond any human beings control  their vastness and the specialization they require combine with the unpredictability of the materials they act upon atomic and sub-atomic particles  light waves  genes and chromosomes  etc    to guarantee that no single human being can actually understand completely how they work  this adds a technological aspect to the already existing economic precariousness that most of us suffer from  however  this threat of technological disaster beyond any one s control also serves power in controlling the exploited   the fear of more chernobyls  genetically engineered monsters or escaped laboratory   made diseases and the like move people to accept the rule of so-called experts who have proven their own limits over and over again  furthermore  the state   that is responsible for every one of these technological developments through its military   is able to present itself as a check against rampant corporate  abuse  of this technology    so this monstrous  lumbering  uncontrollable juggernaut serves the exploiters very well in maintaining their control over the rest of the population  and what need have they to worry about the possible disasters when their wealth and power has most certainly provided them with contingency plans for their own protection  thus  the new technology and the new conditions of exclusion and precariousness it imposes on the exploited undermine the old dream of expropriation of the means of production  this technology   controlling and out of control   cannot serve any truly human purpose and has no place in the development of a world of individuals free to create their lives as they desire  so the illusory utopias of the syndicalists and marxists are of no use to us now  but were they ever  the new technological developments specifically center around control  but all industrial development has taken the necessity of controlling the exploited into account  the factory was created in order to bring producers under one roof to better regulate their activities  the production line mechanized this regulation  every new technological advance in the workings of the factory brought the time and motions of the worker further under control  thus  the idea that workers could liberate themselves by taking over the means of production has always been a delusion  it was an understandable delusion when technological processes had the manufacture of goods as their primary aim    now that their primary aim is so clearly social control  the nature of our real struggle should be clear  the destruction of all systems of control   thus of the state  capital and their technological system  the end of our proletarianized condition and the creation of ourselves as free individuals capable of determining how we will live ourselves  against this technology our best weapon is that which the exploited have used since the beginning of the industrial era  sabotage      willful disobedience https theanarchistlibrary org library

178,Against the unfulfilling nature of work, i m not against work  work is energy moving  getting up  stretching  attending to the people who need you  the animals  your own body  your food  your life  life is work  life is suffering    i m not against work  what i m against is the unfulfilling nature of work  as i see it  this is how america literally operates  wake up every day  go to school for 5 days a week  8 hours a day every day  except summers  until you graduate  if you question this  you get told by your parents that you would be taken away from your family if you didn t attend school  ok  so far so good  i m not complaining yet    that s all fine and good because maybe some parents don t actually raise their children well  right  they should all be indoctrinated  idk  anyway  that s the way it is  next  upon graduation from school  you are expected by the entire world to continue the rigorous schedule that you ve waited your entire childhood to upend  and voluntarily continue wasting your time away until you are sixty five years old    and in my view  it is an utter waste of time  and life  it has no positive impact on the planet whether 80  of us are working  or 4  of us  in other words  it is  plain to see  that what is happening in america looks like this  if you don t prove that you have the social skills to mostly  seduce  the bosses  who hold the money from you  you don t deserve to be given any money  therefore you don t deserve to eat to remain alive    i m sorry  i cannot see it in any other light  this is the exact truth to me and i don t know how you can change my mind   also  come at me for using the word seduce  that s what you have to do to get a job  pretend like you enjoy it  and you have to mean it   food comes out of dirt  money is printed on cotton that grows from dirt  and the rich are clearly only in existence because they are riding on the backs of the poor  if you d like to argue with that  factual  statement  please start by telling me why  then  is money barred off from people like us  who have tried their hardest to make the world and our personal lives as good as we can  yet have been given nothing in return but a promise of the american dream    what is the moral reason to bar money off from us  there clearly isn t one  universal basic income is a necessity and should be a basic human right ,oa9vly

231,"I might actually like ""work"" (at least in theory) but I definitely hate jobs",i ve been struggling to reconcile the fact that i rail against  work-worship   and that this is my fave reddit ever  yet consider myself a  hard worker  and not entirely begrudgingly  yes  part of that comes from being conditioned to be a workaholic  something i m working hard to reverse  but often  i do genuinely like working   i tend to define work as anything that makes a change in your environment  internal or external  digging a hole is work  as is reading a book  since you know things you didn t know before reading it being paid or not doesn t factor into this definition  many things you do for fun would count  and that s the sense in which i m happy to  work hard if i m enthused about something  i m willing to put a lot of effort and time into it    what many of us usually think of when we think of  work   you re paid for it  it sucks  etc  i would define more strictly under the term  job   i d define a  job  as an arrangement between people around one doing work for another  almost by definition  jobs are paid  most often with monetary currency   it s possible to be in a job that involves work you'd do for fun  but it s much more common that the arrangement involves work no one would ever do if they didn t need the payment to survive   jobs strike me as coercive by nature  and enforced through survival anxiety and  ultimately  through shame--external shame from bosses customers  internal shame inculcated in most of us long ago   i think the problem is that we've been taught to only value work done in the context of jobs     we ve arbitrarily decided that work outside of a job arrangement is less worthy than work someone else is paying you for  for no good reason  we see gardening or writing a book on your own as less  character-building  than stocking shelves for 10 hours straight  just because the latter pays   of course  by  character  i suspect most people mean being amenable to being bossed around  shunning your other needs  and otherwise being  dependable  to do a task despite any challenges or indignities  i m not into that type of character any more       anyway  i'm still definitely down with the  antiwork  sentiment  but i guess if i had to nitpick  i'd define myself as more  antijob ,oabg0y

236,"I don't think it's normal for work to kill you this much, and I hate that you can't get a job you actually enjoy, rant time",hello  21f  got a list of da mental illnesses  bpd  mdd  gad  sad  cptsd  adhd  and i need someone to relate   work sucks ass  that's the general cencus  but people still do it obviously  i don't understand how that's even possible  if i'm working more than 20 25 hours a week it's as if my entire being shuts down and i am only work  before work i dread it  at work i dread it  i come home and dread it  on my days off i dread it  there's never a time i'm home from work  i even dream about working  i cannot escape it  i've had 4-5 jobs throughout my life and no matter how much i like the job itself of the people management  i still feel like i'm dying  so much so that i just fantasize about ways to kms or get fired just so i don't have to work  not suicidal but damn if it don't sound like a peaceful option  so i've started this new job  4 shifts in  and once again i feel like i'm dying  i can't sleep  i can't eat  i struggle to shower  i have no physical or mental energy to enjoy my time out of work  and even weed doesn't help me handle these feelings  i'm on stimulants and an snri and have been for a while  they work wonders and for the first time in my life i feel happy and capable and creative  but four days in and all of that has changed  i'm short tempered  i spiral easier and deeper  i can't handle any extra stress outside of work and i am always pissed off at the people i love  four days and my life is in ruins again  this isn't a coincidence  it's happened with every job i've had  and i've had to leave every job i had mainly due to mental health  it doesn't get better with age it gets worse   so as far as solutions go  i'm moving down to pt instead of 40 hrs a week  and i guess i need to fix the root issue  why do i feel this way  it's because i lack motivation entirely  the idea of a great future without money issues and the opportunity to live a full life and such is not motivation enough to feel this bad everyday  nothing is motivation enough  it hurts to much and takes to much out of me for any justification to motivate me through it  as everyone in this thread believes  the system is janked   to survive in a life you didn't choose to be in you have to pay money  to pay money you have to work  to get a job you enjoy or a career you have to go to school  which you have to pay for  so you have to get a job  i'm in canada  and nowadays it's a struggle to pay rent and bills and feed yourself off a ft entry level job  but i can't get any other jobs because i don't have experience  but to get experience i either need to get the job or go to school  interviews are a facade on both sides  you go to work at the time your told  do menial tasks and even when you want to go above and beyond you're not allowed to  if there's an idiotic problem at work because of dumb rules and you think of a solution it's shut down  if there's a part of your job you do find passion for  you can't explore it because it's further than your job scope  you are allowed to be i'll only a certain amount of days and you have to get permission to do anything outside of work  you're an owned slave to someone and your life is no longer your own   this whole problem i believe could be solved or atleast helped if i could get a job that sparks a little passion  i do not come by passion often  most times at all  so combine no passion with no motivation and a lot of mental struggle and you get someone who can't handle work  what coukd i find passion in  anything that does with pets  or kids  someone that means i can look forward to something in my day  but once again it's impossible to get those jobs without experience or training   so i'm here to ask 2 things  1  does anyone else feel like working crushes your soul and ruins your life to an unbearble point no matter where you work  2  does anyone have tips or advice in how to get a job without experience when experience is a requirement  i literally just want to walk a dog but noooooo i need three references for that  seriously fuck off   tldr - i'm mentally ill  the work system is horrid  i can't get a job that doesn't tear me to shreds  i need hell navigating this because no one has much of a choice on this earth and i'm dying inside  and will keep dying inside if i can't make a change ,o9osdg

241,Ignorant Companies?,today my workplace officially rolled out their return to office plan  starting next monday we are all expected to be back 3 days a week  starting september 1 we are all expected back full time    there was no consultation with employees  no department managers were consulted  it came directly from the executive staff   this comes a year after the majority of staff have been working remotely and having no loss of productivity  or profits from the companies side  in fact  our company just purchased a new company to expand their services  no doubt due to the huge boom in construction and development projects we have been working on for the past year    yet the optics of having employees back  and the large empty offices spaces are forcing us to return  regardless of the fact that everyone excelled for the past year  what gives   when does stuff like this end   most of my friends at other companies were presented with an option for having a very flexible in office schedule  we are given the option of maybe having 1 day work from home    i had to go back to the office today due to an unfathomable heat wave  and it s such a depressing  bland  sterile environment   at least i can job search in the air conditioning,o9r2jc

What do you think we’ve been doing?,i worked remotely the majority of the pandemic  i considered myself extremely fortunate to do so  even though i had a few 60-70 hour weeks at the beginning    our teams and company adjusted to remote work quite nicely for an organization that was so big on having an office presence    this company transitioned back to the office at the height of an infection wave during the fall of 2020  i didn t like that  so i sought a new job with remote opportunities    the company i transitioned to is now fully back onsite and i honestly resent the rhetoric more than the actual transition back    the wording of  return to work  communications annoy me  we aren t returning to work  we ve been successfully working from home for over a year  just because you don t have control over an hour of commuting  my lunch  and where i sit to complete my work  doesn t mean i wasn t working  the primary justification for the return was to increase collaboration and learning opportunities for newer staff    i m a newer staff and not one person has sat me down to teach me shit since we returned to the office    corporate america is emotionally and physically draining ,o9shdk

334,I have been voluntarily unemployed for three weeks now!,i had a decently paying director role at my last company so i was in the position to be able to save around a third of every paycheck  i did that for about five months  i realized i would be quitting in may  four months into my employment  i worked hard  did my job very very well  i gave them two months notice  they only spent the last two weeks of it looking for my replacement so i had no chance to train them  oh well  their fault     since leaving  i accompanied my brother on a camping trip to yellowstone  which was incredible  visited my boyfriend's family for a week  whom i love  visited my hometown to see my parents worked out every single day  i'm in the best shape i've been in for years right now  read three full books  it's amazing i've been able to rediscover reading  yesterday i read for like six hours straight  it was so nice  gone on night hikes with my friends and stayed up late without worrying about going to work the next day  i still get up early of my own accord and feel well rested   cooked  done art  and played age of empires every day    i am headed to a family reunion in two weeks and going out to my favorite camping spot later this week   my boyfriend and i have been doing this system for the past two years where we save up and then give each other a break for a few months  he just went back to work after we spent the last three weeks together  he was happy to get back to his old job after about five months  i'm so glad we both prioritize our freedom over having jobs or endless money  basically the only thing we spend money on is gas money  to travel  obviously bills  and food  it's a good simple life  we have very minimal responsibilities and it's great     my goal is not to brag but to let the community know how much my antiwork mindset has influenced these decisions  i recognize that my bf and i have the privilege of getting educations and acquiring well-paying jobs in fields we actually enjoy and this isn't possible for everyone  especially not for single people  less formally educated people  or people who may have the odds against them for other reasons  if i was single there would be a lot of stress  but it works well for us     love y'all ,o8vmky

338,Well that whole “work life balance” thing changed fast,i returned to my hospitality job after over a year of being furloughed due to covid   a big thing the company changed in that time for managers was going from 50 hour work weeks down to 40 hour work weeks  my boss specifically and compassionately said she  believes in work life balance and doesn t expect our job to be our life  great  fantastic  it made me like my job more   well now it s getting busier  and they don t want to bring back any more managers because we all know companies want to squeeze as much work out of people for as little pay as possible   i mentioned that i would not be able to make a 3pm meeting  because i work from 6am-2pm  8 hours  like we were told to do  and i was basically told that i have to stay because it is  my job to support the company  and actually  you should be working minimum 8 5 hour days with a 30 minute break  oh did i forget to mention that there is only 1 manager per shift  again  to save money  so a 30 minute break is impossible  and if they are going to force me to clock out  i will not be doing any work  which again  is impossible with only one manager here   she also said something like  just because you work your 8 hours doesn t mean you ll be able to just leave after 8 hours everyday  like wtf you ve got to be absolutely kidding me  they are just realizing that in this industry 8 hour work days are difficult to pull off when you don t have a full staff and they are too cheap to want to pay an additional manager ,o9lwse

396,Jobs and recruiters need to just post the damn hourly rate or salary in the job description and stop wasting everyone’s time,my wife is a paralegal and recently updated her indeed information  a recruiter for a temp agency reached out to her a few days ago to fill a  legal support  position for amazon  she looked up similar positions on glass door and didn t find exactly what the recruiter talked about but  from what she saw she was guessing she could potentially make about  10 more an hour  this was after spending a few hours researching  debating and us talking about how it might be worth the commute  an extra hour a day total travel time   she emailed back saying she was interested in talking about the position and received a phone interview invitation this morning  we recently had a baby and my wife is on maternity leave so she has the time available to do the interview during the day and on short notice  however  i knew she needed me to watch our daughter so i left work early so she could focus on the interview  during the phone interview i m taking care of our daughter and i m overhearing bits and pieces of the conversation  it sounds like the normal fake dribble you hear from recruiters and then the awkward moment of wage negotiations  i hear something about what kind of compensation my wife would want  she initially asks what is the rate they re hiring for  after a nonsensical response from the recruiter  my wife says she s looking for  15 more per hour in preparation to negotiate to the  10 or more mark  considering this is on track with what she researched  i didn t hear it at the time but this lady comes back with saying that the most they could do was basically give my wife  2 more an hour    obviously my wife said thanks but no thanks  it s just so irritating that this was time  energy and my work hours wasted on this bullshit  just post the fucking rate so we can say no right away and move on with our lives instead of wasting two days for a shitty offer  the way we believe is that we are just as good as the employer offering a job  the employer needs a job done  we both are good at what we do so  we don t settle for pennies  a job is just a transaction  just like buying food from a restaurant  no  i don t want to go to a restaurant to look at a menu with no prices and order something only to be charged 3 times what it s worth  the same with a job  i don t want to waste my time doing some interview trying to explain that i m a valuable asset that can generate profits to only be offered what an entry level person should be making  fuck your culture  fuck your growth  fuck your  family inclusiveness  fuck your yearly paid lunch  just pay us a wage that reflects how essential we are to the profits made and leave us to do the job as outlined in the job description with no expectation for more  we don t own the company  we don t get paid to run the company so don t expect us to act like an owner     i m not an english major so i apologize for spelling grammar mistakes ,o811ye

399,Working in sales has been... an experience,it's almost unbelievable  i took the job becausei needed one  and the pay was good  i'm decent at it  but i lack the drive to really push forward in this branch   why  because management  expects  you to be a slimy asshat  people's boundaries  wishes and opinions mean jack if they aren't a customer  we are only here to make money  that's pretty clear  we openly discuss how to get customers into situations where we make decisions for them  use their previous words against them  it's basically just planned-out peer pressure  our training manual literally stated that part of a well-executed sale is  creating a problem  for the customer   i just wish my coworkers could at least be honest about it  my manager presented a strategy to me  which i politely asked if he didn't think was a bit rude to a potential customer  and he simply diverted it into us employees being caring and doing good work for offering our company's services at all   he's a smart guy  so i almost can't believe he has deluded himself into actually thinking this way  but if it is the case  i can kind of see how  the whole business is built around making the individual employee push for the  next  sale  or the next 5  or 10  or 100  etc  it's possible he's just trying to keep selling me the job  but i would it's even more likely someone sold his job to him  and sold it good   corporate needs us to  care  about the process of accumulating wealth at the top  and they achieve it with commisions and trinkets  i can see how it works  giving small  pointless rewards to break up the monotony of a job that helps nobody  and does nothing besides encourage transferring of money  i definitely feel better going to work every day if the previous day went well  so i can see how people get stuck chasing the next high  but the job itself is just so  repulsive  that i definitely won't stick around   i'll admit that it has been interesting to see how many blatantly slimy strategies actually work and are even commended in the business world from an inside perspective  and i will also admit that being a successful salesman requires skill  the skill of having no shame  and no respect for the people you meet  even so  every day you don't get a sale  regardless of skill  is just a day of free advertising for the company   you can bet my resignation is on the table the day after my next paycheck arrives ,o7zs99

424,A Story of how I became to be antiwork.,  i have plenty of driver related horror stories  one incident i had was when i first came to georgia  i had some steering problems en route to atl from florida   contacted dispatch and explained the issue  was told to pull into the terminal  the mechanic there said it wasnt nothing he could do at the shop and i had to take the truck to kentucky to the main terminal  central kentucky   reluctantly i agreed and drove there  the steering was getting worse by the mile to the point of me not having any resistance in my steering  i'm scared at this point because im driving through mountains   luckily i made it to kentucky  pulled into the garage as they popped the hood and told me to turn the steering wheel  they screamed for me to stop  i hipped out and asked what was wrong the mechanic said my gear box and steering wheel manifolds were hanging on by a cotter pin   he said i was one of the luckiest people he's ever met because if it got worn out i would've instantly flipped the truck and killed everyone around me including myself   the ones in atlanta could've not only identified the problem but could've fixed it  it would've took a day or two  they refused to fix it because the load i had needed to be in kentucky   that load of recycled materials almost cost my life and a few hundred more   companies do not care about anyone  only profit and products   i got plenty of stories like this  what's yours ,o7rg87

How do you envision the ""antiwork"" world functioning?",i don't see  any  possible scenario in which we can continue to maintain anywhere  near  the same quality of life as many 1st world citizens now enjoy in anything but a capitalist system  we still need to produce  we still need to create and provide at least as much as we consume  that is the essence of what work is  it's production so we can consume  what possible alternative is there that would still give individuals autonomy ,o7ooli
426,We lost power!,what a fun start to the weekend  i was dreading working today and i lost power this morning for an hour  of course the tech came fast and the power was back on before i could full enjoy an hour of not working  when i got into work it was chaos and i can feel my stress levels rising  just as soon as i was at the top of the stress mountain  my bedroom light started flickering and my computer started acting weird and then everything went black  i had a call another technician to come out which took about an hour and he came back around from our backyard and said your landlord is going to have to call an electrician because this is more serious than what we are able to do  i don t know if this is divine intervention or my spirit guides giving me the day off but it felt like a major relief ,o7ruiu
427,Essential workers pay,at work today we had an engagement meeting and when asked what our grievences were  i voiced my opinion  as i always do  that all essential workers  in any department of any business in any industry should not be taking home any less than 25k  to which a colleague replied  so you're saying that shelf stackers at the supermarket should be getting paid 25k  erm  of course i am  they're more essential than my own work and we've been classed as essential when all we sell is literally a promise of protection  but to use that protection you then need to pay for it again  i don't know about you lot  but i think that making sure the country remains fed during a global pandemic is a lot more essential to everyone than providing a financial service    why is it that workers are so conditioned to think that other workers don't deserve a fair pay  and are happy to shoot down other workers cause they're so complacent with being underpaid and over worked    between oppressive employers  complacent class traitor staff  and biased media it feels like the fight for change is a loosing battle  but i'm hoping that i'm wrong and one day we will all see a fairer society where we don't exchange a 3rd of our adult life's in exchange for rock bottom pay that hardly covers living expenses whilst making those who do the least richer by the second    it's time for a universal basic income  workers would have time to develop  skills or passions in their life to find their calling and gain meaningful employment that benefits not only them as the worker  but society as a whole  if they don't choose to work  no harm done all that spare time can be used with loved ones  or by giving back the community as there would not be any worry of meeting cost just to live  i'm sure the world would be a much happier place  with wayyy less nasty  bitter and toxic people about if this was the case   we need change and we need it now ,o7uibz

439,The 3 things that happened before I lost my job.,so  before the pandemic i worked as a graphic design lecturer at a private college  i had been doing this for quite a few years and i was pretty good at my job  i was more than qualified  i had a high pass rate for my students  got along well with my fellow lecturers etc  i absolutely lived lecturing  thinking it was the best path the improving graphic design in my country as i would be working with young people just getting into the industry  now  the 3 things that happened the week before i lost my job   first my one work colleague quit and left to move to the uk  she was an older woman who kinda looked out for me and kinda made me feel safe their   second  i told the manager and the principal  2 different people  that i had been living with depression most of my life and just need help to keep my footing l  this was right after my colleague left  i didn't ask for time off  i asked to go see the company psychiatrist  who was actually a church leader working from a nearby mega church   last  i had to write a program evaluation where i had to go in depth with the courses we offer  specifically the ones i give  so when i wrote that we should not be teaching adobe animate in 2020  as it is really outdated  we claimed it was industry standard and used all over the country world  for those who don't know  adobe animate was literally just adobe flash renamed   education  especially private education  is so money hungry and driven that we as lecturers were encouraged to lie to students about the industry  and about what they needed to even get in  like the adobe international certifications are mandatory to get work  which we coincidentally also offered  one of the grossest things i ever heard  and often  was  first most  we are a business  i never want to hear that  especially not when education is involved    that week  i got my walking papers  i have not been able to find stable work in my field as graphic designer or lecturer since  it's been 1 5 years now pretty much  and thank goodness that i have a caring wife who studied while i worked and is now pretty much supporting me while i do what i can   just wanted to share ,o7ijq4

449,Feeling Depressed and working two understaffed jobs...help??,so since the covid pandemic my main job has had a hard time hiring employees  we hire people then they quit after one week or don't show up for the interview  etc  the consensus is that some people are doing that to a lot of places to stay on covid relief unemployment payments  don't know how true that is but     amp x200b   before this started happening i was only working the office job three days a week and did some house cleaning on the other days  i took on the cleaning as a second job around christmas to make extra money and lo and behold  the cleaning company started having problems hiring and keeping employees too     amp x200b   i have been the one who is called upon to fill in and cover for the past year after people quit  because i'm the only one who has stayed thus far  i have had to give up days off and cancel doctor appointments and other things so i could come to work on days i expected to have off at a moment's notice  i couldn't help but feel a little upset but i trudged through thinking it would just be temporary  my boss will hire someone soon  well  it has been a year and the situation has only gotten worse  we literally can't hire anybody anymore it seems  and i am bearing the blunt so my employers are not left high and dry     amp x200b   i am working upwards to 62 hours per week trying to balance working 5-6 days a week at my main job and cleaning at night at my other job  i don't get home until almost midnight wednesday and saturday night  i pack my cleaning clothes in my work bag so i can change into them and immediately go to that job after i get off my main job     amp x200b   this was never my plan  but i feel sorry for both of my bosses who keep losing people and can't seem to hire anyone who will stay  i would feel horrible if i left with without one more worker  it would be cruel almost  my friends keep telling me to quit but i don't think i could do that to them without feeling like a horrible person     amp x200b   i can count more than the digits on both hands the amount of people they have hired and then left high and dry with me to pick up the slack  i actually trained someone last month for a week and then they quit a few days later  i am not looking forward to having to go through the training process again with someone new who is just going to quit a week later  it's getting ridiculous  and i have had enough    amp x200b   the truth is i'm depressed  i feel stuck  i don't like working the hours i am working  i feel like i have no work-life balance anymore  i have anxiety and high functioning autism and just feel so burnt out and exhausted  the cleaning job is physically exhaustive and i dread having to do it after i get off from my main job  i recently lost one of my cats and i have not even had time to grieve him because i am constantly working and on the go  i have started to eat convenience junk and fast food because i never feel well enough or have time to cook a healthy meal or go grocery shopping and have started gaining weight again  i cry sometimes at night in bed because i look at the clock and know i have to get up at 7am and do it all over again    i cry when i think of how this is life and there is no getting out of it until i'm dead ,o7pv06

458,Employers are Ones who Want Something for Nothing,my dad always told me that the key to being successful is acquiring skills that make you valuable to your employer  well  i'm here to tell you that is all a bunch of horse shit  i am 36 years old  have been working since i was 15  and almost everyone of one of my employers have never compensated me for learning new skills outside of my work area  what they did was see that i could competently accomplish the new task and i was given more work to do   ironically the only place i worked for that had a written policy on pay increase was a mcalister's deli that would give you a  0 25 per station   i have been working at a automotive conveyor plant for the last 7 years  i was hired on as a temp worker in the shipping department with no experience and was just packaging parts  within a 4 months i was hired on and became the defacto manager because the other two people in the office quit  i was loading heavy machinery  organizing truck loads  ordering trucks  writing up international shipping paperwork and much more  after a year i told my foreman that i needed to be the official shipping manager since i was doing all of the work by myself and was only being paid  14 hr  he agreed and we had a meeting with upper management and they told me that there wasn't money in the budget and they were eliminating that position and my foreman would be absorbing that responsibility  so they fucked me and my foreman   i was pissed and quit  i was professional and gave a 2 weeks notice and trained my replacement  i got a sales job  turns out i am not a salesman  i talked to my old foreman and he got back on as a temp worker in the mechanical assembly department making  14 hr  guess what  i kicked ass in this department too  i learned mechanical print reading  mechanical assembly  mig welding  basic metal fitting  and pretty much how to make sure that the conveyor system works before it leaves the shop  and how was i rewarded  by keeping me a temp worker for 3 fucking years keeping me at  14 hr   i demanded that i get hired on permanent and a pay increase to  16 50 hr   i live in mississippi  asking for anything more than that would be like asking the plant superintendent if you could raw dog his daughter  my foreman goes to bat for me and makes it happen  but now that i had the audacity to demanded fair compensation they think they own me  they would constantly tell me to go the weld department and help prep steel for fit up and weld out  guess what happens next  i learn welding fitting  i'm building jigs and doing full fit work   i ask for more money and was flat out refused  they told me that the  0 30  cost of living  raise we get every year is all that they could give  that's an extra  48 a month  for perspective this is a mutli-national company  they have plants on almost every continent  they just bought a steel mill company and built a new facility to combine that new one and their old one    now i was just going to stick out as i was in the middle of school trying to finish up my bachelors degree  then mississippi revoked my wife's disability  a whooping  700 month   apparently having a brain tumor 1 2 the size of a golf ball removed and having your brain chemistry  irrevocably alter only takes a year to get over  we were barely making it with what i was making   17 40 hr  and her disability  so i said fuck it and joined the millwright union  better bargaining power  representation  and benefits  sucks that i had to stop school again   companies don't give a shit about you  you are nothing but numbers in a column to them waiting to get crossed out  they will milk every once of productivity out of you and say that you should be grateful for the little bread crumbs that they give you  they should be grateful for you  with out workers they have no product  they can't do all the work by themselves  you are selling 40 hours of your life to them  make sure you are getting what you feel you are worth ,o8aakk

477,"I am burned tf out, AMA.",this is pretty much just a rant  so  whatever  i guess  fuck everyone i'm here to talk about and fuck me for having to work with them    i am an electrical and data communications expert  and i fully mean expert  no arrogance  no hesitation  i am a motherfucking expert in the conveyance and configuration of electricity and data    which is  i promise you  not even a very high bar to achieve  99  of everyone i have ever worked around are blithering incompetents    i've seen electricians who couldn't make a data connection to save their lives and data men who wouldn't know the difference between phases if they fucking touched them together  even in their designated craft most can't even function enough between their drug of choice to be half competent some of the time  the individuals i have met in the  large scale  commercial and industrial jobs which i have been a part who know even 5  of what's going on can be counted on one hand  without a doubt  working with these people is the single  worst part of doing what i do   than there is the utter meaninglessness of the jobs of which i partake   i exclusively work in commercial industrial settings  huge megacorporations just hurl money at any random company they can find to do the most banal shit  i would say that money laundering would have to be the only explanation except that i get paid so much myself to do their bs   the two most common things i see in the data world that take up 95  of these jobs are   1-going into a building with existing wiring and replacing the wiring with the exact same fucking wiring   2-going into a building with a network of wireless access points and replacing them with different  not-any-better wireless access points   utterly pointless wastes of time and money  if i had a quarter for every building i've gone to with pre-existing cat5e just to replace them with new cat5e and nothing else i'd probably be a fucking millionaire  you want to replace this perfectly functional wireless access point with a different and in no way better one  sure  whatever  where do you want your old ones  left up in the fucking ceiling to rot because you don't give a shit since you have enough money to not care  the usual  then   at least with electricity i have a pretty good amount of power  lol  to tell someone to get fucked if they want to do stupid bs  which is funny  because it's like the opposite of the data world and i never need to   for some reason that i don't understand  there is this dichotomy in the business world that data services are the mystical gift of the gods that just  makes everything magically better  and they've  got to have it right now no matter the cost  meanwhile  warehouses full of product are lit with obsolete t12 fluorescent lighting with magnetic ballasts so fucking old and heavy that i'm afraid colonel mustard is going to use it to murder someone in the observatory    these same companies that shell out so much money for data product that they literally barely even use won't even spare anything other than a sideways glance when you tell them the 480v 2000amp federal pacific panel running all their machinery and heavy duty equipment is probably going to burn their entire operations down one day   and then there are the employers   i don't think i need to explain how employers are fucking garbage in this subreddit   most of what i have done is  essentially  gig work   what i mean by this is that  while i have only ever worked jobs which file me as a w2 employee  the turnover is so pathetically high that it's really and truly gig work   here's where my problem is  i've never been one to put up with bs at the best of times  but lately  i've been extra hardcore about not being a fucking slave  because  you know  that's what burning out does to you   i'm registered with a lot of agencies where the only thing i ever hear from them is  hey man we got this job over in   and they need you there tommorrow  except   is two states away and they want you to stay in a hotel room with 3 other dudes and no per diem  and the job is night work  so that the business can still run like normal during the day time   get fucked assholes  i'm not some thirsty fucking money virgin looking to ride your dick for a booty call  i live in a house with my wife and sleep in my own fucking bed at night  i've told them to not even bother contacting me if it's not in my city  and even then it's the same shit  they act like the stars and planets have to fucking align just to find work in my large  metropolitan city    and they still call me all the time for the jobs i've told them to get fucked for because they somehow don't have anyone else who can do it   i'm working a job right now that is  guess what  replacing a bunch of existing shit with the exact same shit  i get there and the jackoffs in charge are so ignorant and disorganized that they would rather have me  making  30 an hour to be there  stand around while they figure out how to make a coax connection   everyone thinks all they have to do is yell  money money money  and you'll jump all over them and than act surprised when they find someone who they can't buy away life happiness from   now for the most controversial part of this rant  unions   oh man  let me tell you about the unions    long  long ago in a galaxy far  far away i put in an application with the ibew for an electrical apprenticeship  back when i didn't know shit    i didn't even hear back from them for literal years  i went out and just made a career in the time it took for them to even acknowledge my existence  they called me for an interview just like a week ago    at this point  i would literally be taking a huge paycut to even bother doing it  but i went to the interview none-the-less   what  a  waste  of  time   the interview was like 5 questions long  had absolutely nothing to do with technical skill  and was obviously geared towards identifying know nothing greenhorns to wrangle in  questions like  name a time where you had a problem you couldn't solve and why couldn't you solve it   i worked in my obvious experiences and knowledge into everything they asked me and these two old elitist jack offs straight up said to me in the middle of me talking that  your answer doesn't have to pertain to the electrical trade   fuck you   doesn't have to pertain to the electrical trade  i wasn't aware that this was an interview for fucking walmart  i'd rather make no money than work for a bunch of assholes who would rather hire a know nothing nobody over someone    i can't speak for every union  but the ibew in my experience has been known to be  uhhh  pretty fucking corrupt  i can't say that my experiences around them have ever been very pleasant  that their people are particularly sociable  or that they don't look like a bunch of pyramid scheme scam artists    maybe if they weren't also a completely closed club of pick and choose racist yokels with zero pretension towards affordable work towards the common person i would view them more charitably    alas   that's the other emotionally draining part of what i do  btw  everyone bites like pirahna for big business hurling money at them  but if you're just some person in a house trying to get your electricity working or data runs   haha  nobody gives a shit about you  there's three facts of life  death  taxes  and that no tradesman within a hundred mile radius of where you live gives a flying fuck about you    ghosts are real  they just drive work vans and don't answer calls instead of haunting houses   i'm so fucking tired of it all  i mostly quit working altogether last year around novemeber and have just stayed at a home as a house husband  i've been growing a garden  i made my cats a bunch of bomb ass cat trees  it's been so peaceful and fulfilling  we've talked about it and my wife's been very supportive of me well above and beyond what i would have ever allowed for myself otherwise   but i obviously can't just live without making money  i've got it better than many  for sure  but i'm bot exemot from having to make money  so every so often i trudge out to deal with the same bs for gigantic companies who think i'm just some money receptacle to do whatever they want whenever they want it   it's all bs  everything and everyone  and i'm so tired of it ,o7zr65

515,Dear First Worlders..., warning  the world  ruled by the callous mentalities created by the global cult of capitalism and illusion of meritocracy  has taken me to the point of being a misanthrope  yes i m honest about it  that being said  i don t hate anyone as an individual and believe humanity doesn t have to be this way  though my hope for change dwindles every day  my misanthropy is multiplied by 10 toward privileged people because of their dehumanizing approach toward everyone else  this is a very passionate  angry rant directed at no one in this sub in particular  but directed at the general public in the first world at the same time  and this sub is the only place on the internet where i don t think the post will get 100  knee-jerk hate reactions  though i expect a lot of hate from bootlicker types  read at your own risk    to my  temporary  i m leaving soon  neighbors in the first world  never forget you are choosing to live like scum who support thousands of injustices with your daily actions and self-centered attitudes toward everything  you allow yourselves to be ruled by war criminals  both sides are the same corrupt bs  year in and year out while willfully turning a blind eye to the normalized genocide  forced poverty  and segregation your leaders perpetuate in all areas of the world  the only issues you pay attention to in current events and history are those that directly affect your self-interest or feed your biases  you also create an overinflated ego and sense of self-importance from your meaningless corporate jobs  most of which don t make the world a better place and actively make it worse by hurting the environment and making corrupt dark triad people even more prosperous  you are a useful pawn for these people and that is all they will ever see you as  imagine thinking you re some big shot credible person with authority for being just another obedient cog in a system of torture and death  many of you almost subconsciously look down on the working class  illegal  and low wage workers in your countries  even though they re literally the backbones of your infrastructure and the main force that allows you to go to that cushy office job every day and buy lunch with no worries of anything falling apart    then  in your free time  instead of studying things like sociology   spirituality and trying to progress the world toward one of love and equality  you get on the internet to bully strangers over trivial nonsense - looks  age  income  intellect  disabilities  mental health status  popularity  lifestyle  size  level of  success  choosing to stay single or a loner  how social they are  how many people they slept with or didn t sleep with  which religion   spiritual beliefs they have or lack thereof  and any personality traits   viewpoints that you ve been trained by toxic parents   society to hate and don t conform ad nauseam to your narrow comfort zone and worldview  you spend every waking hour online and irl being as callous  unempathetic  and dismissive toward people and their experiences   feelings as humanly possible  i ve seen so many instances of people who are genuinely struggling sharing their experiences online  only to be blamed for all their traumas by a bunch of privileged overgrown babies who are obviously out of touch with  global  reality and never faced any real adversity compared to others in those  shithole  countries they never think about  or even compared to people in those  rough  neighborhoods of their own country that they only bring up when the  poor people commit more crime  narrative is mentioned  never any mention of what causes the poverty though  just the blame   shame game left and right  and we all know how common fake friendships are in first-world countries  with so many people out there who want to know your deepest  darkest secrets just to use them against you or to take advantage  vultures  i ve talked to several people who are either from non-first world countries or lived in them extensively  they all say that friendships are not like this in other parts of the world  it s a problem of the west or at least more pronounced  here  people make frenemies instead of friends  regardless of gender  and it s nearly universal  i think the reason for the toxic nature of relationships here is that almost every damn pursuit in western culture devolves to a game of one-upsmanship and getting a leg up on somebody  ah  there s that good old capitalism-fueled competition rearing it s head again  patriarchy is another cultural disease that adds to the prevalence of hypercompetition as well   victim blaming  prejudiced criticisms under the guise of  tough love   advice  and casual gaslighting  of all kinds  in all situations  seems to be something people in your cultures do for amusement online  never thinking about the psychological harm that may have been done to the other person  it just shows how fragile your egos are and how they need to be preserved 24 7 against the slightest deviation  all of this insecurity despite the fact that you people go on and on about how you live in the  best countries in the world  if something doesn t align with your narrow scope of vision  you will refuse to consider or even hear a single word that the other person is saying and abuse them for expressing themselves in a way that you don t approve  all so you can pretend that the world is a-okay  that you re not complicit in thousands of injustices that occur everyday  and that anyone who gets mistreated  abused  or even killed brought it on themselves and  deserved  it  it s like you deliberately turn off any semblance of humanity and empathy that neoliberal capitalist culture hasn t already sucked out of you    i guess i understand  thinking this way makes it convenient to stay working mindlessly like an ant and only caring about your own lot in life  never truly questioning why it  has  to be this way  but really  why  we could literally have a global revolution tomorrow if people really wanted to unite  because you re afraid to lose your job  you have kids to feed  that s part of the problem  knowing everything going on in this world and continuing to bring children into inevitable suffering just because everyone else is popping out babies and you don t want to be an outcast  or a selfish desire for  legacy  or maybe you accept the status quo unconditionally because your parents told you  it s just the way it is  when you were children  bullshit  that s the first time they tried to kill the passion out of you and you let them  chances are that most of our parents   adults told their kids deflating things like this to perpetuate the just-world fallacy for themselves and avoid guilt about their own lack of action in making the world a better place  then they bring more children into the world and indoctrinate them with the same sick values  and the generational cycle of mass suffering continues  beautiful isn t it  but i know most people will probably say i should go to a shrink for this rant and that i m the crazy one for not seeing the value in humanity when this is how we choose  yes it s a choice  not  human nature  to live   there really isn t much of a difference between the mentality of today s neoliberal consumerist zombies and people like hitler s supporters  you neoliberals are just very slick with the way you do things  but it s all done under the same wicked intentions of oppression and dominance for the sake of dominance  we literally have more than enough resources globally to give every human being a house  keep them decently fed  etc  but no  the majority of you narcissistic chimpanzees keep insisting  competition   hyperindividualism is good  survival of the fittest  cooperation   collectivism and being kind is for the weak  same idiots that go around saying things like  respect must be earned  not given  and  telling it like it is  to justify their prejudices and discriminatory actions   no asshole  i m the one telling it like it is  and i know you don t like the actual truth because it puts you and your peers  everyday shortcomings on a big projector for you all to see    and before anyone complains  yes  i understand there are hundreds of millions of people in the first world and some  very few let s be honest  don t go along with the status quo and try to be part of the change they envision for the world  this is a rant directed at the  middle   bourgeois class  majority  honestly  so-called democracy has proven to be the biggest tyranny of all  in other systems  there was always a distinct group challenging the authorities at play and they weren t completely wiped into silence  if they were wiped via violence  it was later understood as a cruel act that shouldn t be mimicked  but because the word  democracy  is falsely used to describe this inhumane system and sounds good on paper  the masses shut down people who rightfully question how  free  this illusion truly is and think they re the real fascists  since they don t use violence and just shut these people out of the discussion via cultural power  those people have no viable way to make their point without looking like the bad guys  and while i don t believe we live in a meritocracy  the fact that most people believe we do and their justifications for mistreating the  lower end  people show me that the concept as a whole is inherently bad for humanity due to the callous mentality it perpetuates  we are all slaves to the judgments of the majority  no matter how delusional they become    at least with one central leadership figure  you have a chance of bringing in someone with a good head on their shoulders and high level of compassion  your odds of finding one admirable person to lead are much higher than getting the majority to love and respect one another regardless of differences  the majority will always keep an ignorant and inhumane mentality toward anyone not exactly like them  and therefore will maintain a cold  despicable value system in society   as a result  they fall for the lies and deceitful  charisma  of sadistic narcissists and propel them into positions of power   influence time and time again  good  pure-hearted people who mind their business and try not to judge others over personal characteristics are treated like the exact opposite  they don t participate in what most call  banter  so they re viewed by the majority as  lame   soft  or  too boring   sensitive  as a result  good people are usually targets of unprovoked bullying  abuse and   or isolation  why  because so-called civilized modern people have become so dumb and backward  that intending to be a good person from the beginning without having ulterior motives is viewed as  weakness  this world wants you to be manipulating and transactional in everything you do and everyone you deal with  when people who refuse to play the game are permanently othered and inevitably deemed losers and outcasts  the society then acts like it was their fault and they must be truly lacking something inside them to not be able to integrate  no  these less than 5  of people just couldn t allow themselves to be everyday sadistic sociopaths like the majority    it s funny how trump called africa a  shithole  when from a character standpoint  even with their own flaws  people there have more redeeming qualities in one finger than your average westerner has in their entire bloodline  especially westerners that make close to six figures or more  less wealthy people in this country at least try to help each other in limited ways sometimes and tend to have a lot more principles that they live by  for better or worse  there are many flawed principles but i can respect any principled person far more than the rich and middle class who push this  sell your soul and existence to the highest bidder  bootlicker mentality on everyone  if you refuse to be a part of bourgeois culture and play the game  you will be concern trolled and gaslighted by these people  they ll say  grow up  or  you ll never become successful thinking this way  to these people  growing up means relentlessly chasing arbitrary standards of prosperity and becoming a compliant worker bee who never questions any of society s authorities  well  i say fuck you and fuck your media-crafted definitions of success  happiness and prosperity  all three are treated like a zero-sum game where crabs in a bucket must prevent the others from getting enough for themselves  people want to avoid concepts like misanthropy and antinatalism because they re deemed as  negative and divisive  all the while deliberately ignoring the fact that even so-called  positive  concepts have been bastardized by the puppet-masters of this world to keep the masses controlling  hostile and hypercompetitive toward one another  humans want to continue living in strife despite the fact that true scarcity  meaning lack of enough physical resources to support everyone  does not exist and will only decrease as technology finds new ways to support sustainability and preserve life  at least misanthropy and antinatalism stemmed from concern for the greater environment and a desire to improve life for the people already here  people who buy into the  cult of individualistic positivity  seem to be primarily concerned with self-promotion and getting recognition above all else  even better if it s at someone s expense and they can feel like they knocked someone down a peg while pulling themselves up  the crazy part is that mentalities like this are promoted by society as  self-love  and  confidence  cultures of cutthroat scarcity are promoted as inevitable reality while cultures of abundance and compassion are quickly dismissed as childish na vet  it is all cultural  not based on the physical reality that is abundance    at this point  i m allergic to anyone this heinous society considers  successful  and want to keep at least three football fields of distance between me and those types of people  write me off as a deluded loser if you like  i stopped caring about petty bs like that a long time ago  i only care about one thing now  and that s knowing the true reality  things probably won t change  but i need to keep my eye out so i can at least avoid the madness myself  i m a second generation immigrant native born in the usa  and i m deliberately moving to a remote  third world  country to live on less money  and less stress  and to get away from this toxic  inhumane social darwinist culture  no matter how many people s lives are ruined by this system  the general public continues to go along with its twisted machiavellian values and sweep problems   victims under the rug  all to pretend  everything is positive and i am in control of everything that happens in my life  material difficulties aside  at least people elsewhere have a somewhat closer relationship with reality  they have to for survival  and treat each other more like human beings  i ll gladly deal with increased material inconveniences over this spiritually bankrupt cultural wasteland we call the west  in the first world  when people look at you  you are a walking currency amount  not a breathing human  never forget that ,o7aj4p
516,Society has always been a hunger games bloodbath,the rich have always exploited the poor in the name of greed  slavery has always existed  if you live in a first world country today its as good as its going to get    only difference is now the slaves in a capitalist system have access to comforts that have never been available before in history and opportunity to better themselves and improve their situation    is the system fair  no  but when has it ever been  lets be real  people are selfish and act in their own interests  not all but enough to ruin it for everyone    no one is going to hire you unless they can make profit off you  thats why people start businesses  to elevate themselves    someone has an idea and starts a business and if there is a demand then they hire people and pay them the least amount possible in order to make maximum profit    whether that business owner had rich parents and could have afforded to fail 10 times doesnt matter  life is not fair and never has been  we have always lived in a hunger games society  this is the most sanitized version of it ever  especially if you live in a first world country    what can we do  try to escape by moving up the platform  we live in a country that gives us opportunity to do that in so many ways    learning a skill or craft or pursuing higher education or starting a business or applying for promotions in the workplace    is everyone going to succeed  no  life is not fair  even under communism everyone is not equal  the ones at the top will have everything and everyone below nothing  and there is nothing they can do to improve their lot     its just reality  we are in a fucked up hell hole brethren  best thing u can do is not bring children into this world  work  brainstorm  and try to better yourself and maybe it will pay off and you will be elevated on the platform  or maybe downsize  work part time and be content to eat rations  i dunno the answers  god help us all ,o6sbz1

563,Dear First Worlders..., warning  i am a misanthrope who believes humanity doesn t have to be this way  though my hope for change dwindles every day  and my misanthropy is multiplied by 10 toward privileged people because of their dehumanizing approach toward everyone else  this is a very passionate  angry rant directed at no one in this sub in particular  but directed at the general public in the first world at the same time  and this sub is the only place on the internet where i don t think the post will get 100  knee-jerk hate reactions  though i expect a lot of hate from bootlicker types  read at your own risk    to my  temporary  i m leaving soon  neighbors in the first world  never forget you are choosing to live like scum who support thousands of injustices with your daily actions and self-centered attitudes toward everything  you allow yourselves to be ruled by war criminals  both sides are the same corrupt bs  year in and year out while willfully turning a blind eye to the normalized genocide  forced poverty  and segregation your leaders perpetuate in all areas of the world  the only issues you pay attention to in current events and history are those that directly affect your self-interest or feed your biases  you also create an overinflated ego and sense of self-importance from your meaningless corporate jobs  most of which don t make the world a better place and actively make it worse by hurting the environment and making corrupt dark triad people even more prosperous  you are a useful pawn for these people and that is all they will ever see you as  imagine thinking you re some big shot credible person with authority for being just another obedient cog in a system of torture and death  many of you almost subconsciously look down on the working class  illegal  and low wage workers in your countries  even though they re literally the backbones of your infrastructure and the main force that allows you to go to that cushy office job every day and buy lunch with no worries of anything falling apart    then  in your free time  instead of studying things like sociology   spirituality and trying to progress the world toward one of love and equality  you get on the internet to bully strangers over trivial nonsense - looks  age  income  intellect  disabilities  mental health status  popularity  lifestyle  size  level of  success  choosing to stay single or a loner  how social they are  how many people they slept with or didn t sleep with  which religion   spiritual beliefs they have or lack thereof  and any personality traits   viewpoints that you ve been trained by toxic parents   society to hate and don t conform ad nauseam to your narrow comfort zone and worldview  you spend every waking hour online and irl being as callous  unempathetic  and dismissive toward people and their experiences   feelings as humanly possible  i ve seen so many instances of people who are genuinely struggling sharing their experiences online  only to be blamed for all their traumas by a bunch of privileged overgrown babies who are obviously out of touch with  global  reality and never faced any real adversity compared to others in those  shithole  countries they never think about  or even compared to people in those  rough  neighborhoods of their own country that they only bring up when the  poor people commit more crime  narrative is mentioned  never any mention of what causes the poverty though  just the blame   shame game left and right  and we all know how common fake friendships are in first-world countries  with so many people out there who want to know your deepest  darkest secrets just to use them against you or to take advantage  vultures  i ve talked to several people who are either from non-first world countries or lived in them extensively  they all say that friendships are not like this in other parts of the world  it s a problem of the west or at least more pronounced  here  people make frenemies instead of friends  regardless of gender  and it s nearly universal  i think the reason for the toxic nature of relationships here is that almost every damn pursuit in western culture devolves to a game of one-upsmanship and getting a leg up on somebody  ah  there s that good old capitalism-fueled competition rearing it s head again  patriarchy is another cultural disease that adds to the prevalence of hypercompetition as well   victim blaming  prejudiced criticisms under the guise of  tough love   advice  and casual gaslighting  of all kinds  in all situations  seems to be something people in your cultures do for amusement online  never thinking about the psychological harm that may have been done to the other person  it just shows how fragile your egos are and how they need to be preserved 24 7 against the slightest deviation  all of this insecurity despite the fact that you people go on and on about how you live in the  best countries in the world  if something doesn t align with your narrow scope of vision  you will refuse to consider or even hear a single word that the other person is saying and abuse them for expressing themselves in a way that you don t approve  all so you can pretend that the world is a-okay  that you re not complicit in thousands of injustices that occur everyday  and that anyone who gets mistreated  abused  or even killed brought it on themselves and  deserved  it  it s like you deliberately turn off any semblance of humanity and empathy that neoliberal capitalist culture hasn t already sucked out of you    i guess i understand  thinking this way makes it convenient to stay working mindlessly like an ant and only caring about your own lot in life  never truly questioning why it  has  to be this way  but really  why  we could literally have a global revolution tomorrow if people really wanted to unite  because you re afraid to lose your job  you have kids to feed  that s part of the problem  knowing everything going on in this world and continuing to bring children into inevitable suffering just because everyone else is popping out babies and you don t want to be an outcast  or a selfish desire for  legacy  or maybe you accept the status quo unconditionally because your parents told you  it s just the way it is  when you were children  bullshit  that s the first time they tried to kill the passion out of you and you let them  chances are that most of our parents   adults told their kids deflating things like this to perpetuate the just-world fallacy for themselves and avoid guilt about their own lack of action in making the world a better place  then they bring more children into the world and indoctrinate them with the same sick values  and the generational cycle of mass suffering continues  beautiful isn t it  but i know most people will probably say i should go to a shrink for this rant and that i m the crazy one for not seeing the value in humanity when this is how we choose  yes it s a choice  not  human nature  to live   there really isn t much of a difference between the mentality of today s neoliberal consumerist zombies and people like hitler s supporters  you neoliberals are just very slick with the way you do things  but it s all done under the same wicked intentions of oppression and dominance for the sake of dominance  we literally have more than enough resources globally to give every human being a house  keep them decently fed  etc  but no  the majority of you narcissistic chimpanzees keep insisting  competition   hyperindividualism is good  survival of the fittest  cooperation   collectivism and being kind is for the weak  same idiots that go around saying things like  respect must be earned  not given  and  telling it like it is  to justify their prejudices and discriminatory actions   no asshole  i m the one telling it like it is  and i know you don t like the actual truth because it puts you and your peers  everyday shortcomings on a big projector for you all to see    and before anyone complains  yes  i understand there are hundreds of millions of people in the first world and some  very few let s be honest  don t go along with the status quo and try to be part of the change they envision for the world  this is a rant directed at the  middle   bourgeois class  majority  honestly  so-called democracy has proven to be the biggest tyranny of all  in other systems  there was always a distinct group challenging the authorities at play and they weren t completely wiped into silence  if they were wiped via violence  it was later understood as a cruel act that shouldn t be mimicked  but because the word  democracy  is falsely used to describe this inhumane system and sounds good on paper  the masses shut down people who rightfully question how  free  this illusion truly is and think they re the real fascists  since they don t use violence and just shut these people out of the discussion via cultural power  those people have no viable way to make their point without looking like the bad guys  and while i don t believe we live in a meritocracy  the fact that most people believe we do and their justifications for mistreating the  lower end  people show me that the concept as a whole is inherently bad for humanity due to the callous mentality it perpetuates  we are all slaves to the judgments of the majority  no matter how delusional they become    at least with one central leadership figure  you have a chance of bringing in someone with a good head on their shoulders and high level of compassion  your odds of finding one admirable person to lead are much higher than getting the majority to love and respect one another regardless of differences  the majority will always keep an ignorant and inhumane mentality toward anyone not exactly like them  and therefore will maintain a cold  despicable value system in society   as a result  they fall for the lies and deceitful  charisma  of sadistic narcissists and propel them into positions of power   influence time and time again  good  pure-hearted people who mind their business and try not to judge others over personal characteristics are treated like the exact opposite  they don t participate in what most call  banter  so they re viewed by the majority as  lame   soft  or  too boring   sensitive  as a result  good people are usually targets of unprovoked bullying  abuse and   or isolation  why  because so-called civilized modern people have become so dumb and backward  that intending to be a good person from the beginning without having ulterior motives is viewed as  weakness  this world wants you to be manipulating and transactional in everything you do and everyone you deal with  when people who refuse to play the game are permanently othered and inevitably deemed losers and outcasts  the society then acts like it was their fault and they must be truly lacking something inside them to not be able to integrate  no  these less than 5  of people just couldn t allow themselves to be everyday sadistic sociopaths like the majority    it s funny how trump called africa a  shithole  when from a character standpoint  even with their own flaws  people there have more redeeming qualities in one finger than your average westerner has in their entire bloodline  especially westerners that make close to six figures or more  less wealthy people in this country at least try to help each other in limited ways sometimes and tend to have a lot more principles that they live by  for better or worse  there are many flawed principles but i can respect any principled person far more than the rich and middle class who push this  sell your soul and existence to the highest bidder  bootlicker mentality on everyone  if you refuse to be a part of bourgeois culture and play the game  you will be concern trolled and gaslighted by these people  they ll say  grow up  or  you ll never become successful thinking this way  to these people  growing up means relentlessly chasing arbitrary standards of prosperity and becoming a compliant worker bee who never questions any of society s authorities  well  i say fuck you and fuck your media-crafted definitions of success  happiness and prosperity  all three are treated like a zero-sum game where crabs in a bucket must prevent the others from getting enough for themselves  people want to avoid concepts like misanthropy and antinatalism because they re deemed as  negative and divisive  all the while deliberately ignoring the fact that even so-called  positive  concepts have been bastardized by the puppet-masters of this world to keep the masses controlling  hostile and hypercompetitive toward one another  humans want to continue living in strife despite the fact that true scarcity  meaning lack of enough physical resources to support everyone  does not exist and will only decrease as technology finds new ways to support sustainability and preserve life  at least misanthropy and antinatalism stemmed from concern for the greater environment and a desire to improve life for the people already here  people who buy into the  cult of individualistic positivity  seem to be primarily concerned with self-promotion and getting recognition above all else  even better if it s at someone s expense and they can feel like they knocked someone down a peg while pulling themselves up  the crazy part is that mentalities like this are promoted by society as  self-love  and  confidence  cultures of cutthroat scarcity are promoted as inevitable reality while cultures of abundance and compassion are quickly dismissed as childish na vet  it is all cultural  not based on the physical reality that is abundance    at this point  i m allergic to anyone this heinous society considers  successful  and want to keep at least three football fields of distance between me and those types of people  write me off as a deluded loser if you like  i stopped caring about petty bs like that a long time ago  i only care about one thing now  and that s knowing the true reality  things probably won t change  but i need to keep my eye out so i can at least avoid the madness myself  i m a second generation immigrant native born in the usa  and i m deliberately moving to a remote  third world  country to live on less money  and less stress  and to get away from this toxic  inhumane social darwinist culture  no matter how many people s lives are ruined by this system  the general public continues to go along with its twisted machiavellian values and sweep problems   victims under the rug  all to pretend  everything is positive and i am in control of everything that happens in my life  material difficulties aside  at least people elsewhere have a somewhat closer relationship with reality  they have to for survival  and treat each other more like human beings  i ll gladly deal with increased material inconveniences over this spiritually bankrupt cultural wasteland we call the west  in the first world  when people look at you  you are a walking currency amount  not a breathing human  never forget that ,o7aj98

569,"The stupid, the unaware, the contrarians and the evil. These are the people that prevent progress.",antiwork principles should be obvious  yet in the real world they are less popular then you would think  i was surprised how few people even heard about these ideas  i thought alot about this in a more broader sense and now ive come to the conclusion that for the most part  progress as a whole is not constrained by realities of science  laws or economics like we are taught to believe  but rather by certain characteristics of people that have certain negative traits who combined constitute at least around  50-70  of the global population  this clash in values ultimately prevents a possible global consensus  i believe this global consensus is the basis of good and evil and to a large extent reality itself which is why in the lack of it you have alot of the chaos you do now  i've very broadly categorized this 50-70  into subgroups     the stupid  these people are simply incapable of seeing how they are getting robbed by employers  capitalists and companies and how the system is rigged against them  these are usually the  work hard grind hard  type of people who work 80 hours a week for 20 years at mcdonald's to  double their salary  without ever giving a thought to skilling up to higher hourly salaries or self employment  anecdotally  it also includes the relegious traditionalists types who dont question narratives and live according to the customs and traditioms of people around  it's not malice but some limitation in cognitive abilities to be able to fully understand and grasp antiwork  flaws of the system and socialist principles  there may be a little bit of a chance to change but unfortunately once their simple habits and ideas are set they will not change   the unaware and also the desperate  this constitutes the majority of the subsect of people discussed  these people are doing everything they can to survive  climb the corporate ladder  beat the system and secure a life for themselves  these are the purest and most distilled form of victims and cattle produced by the capitalist system  these are your average joe's who simply don't have the time or energy to read a book or go deeper into the philosophical principles  there view of the world is narrow not because they aren't smart  but because they simply didn't have the privilege  time or need to broaden their undeestanding of the world  after a certain period of time they become numb to the injustice inflicted against them and for entertainment go on blindly guzzling beers and rooting for the millionaire soccer player because he  represents him  learning this stuff also becomes difficult because their is so much depth go it that jts like learning calculus when you never done subtraction before  on the flip side it also includes the very comfortable privileged  the suburb kid who became a dentist with loving wife and 2 kids  he simply has no need to disrupt this and passively becomes unaware although he too at level is a victim and prisoner  just a very well fed one  these people i think are still within reach to understanding antiwork principles but they need time and an actual intrinsic interest and will to learn   the contrarians  these are the most annoying  spineless and vacuous group  at least with the evil you know where they stand  these are the ones commenting libtard and voting for trump to piss of the libs  they have no moral compass and will mould to fit any position as needed as long as it is contrary to the narrative they perceive as popular  if suddenly climate change denial will become a left position they will start accepting climate change  they will always bring the  both sides  arguement in blantly obvious cases of injustice  these are the dudes in your company saying you shouldn't have wfh just cause  despite his reasoning  it meets some emotional needs deep down  i guess its either hubris  wanting to feel special and climb the ladder  feel smart or whatever  i thought initlaly this was a phase people had in high school but turns out it's everywhere and these guys never really grow out of it  there's alot of them too as we see time and time again  these people are just too toxic to change and they have no interest in advancing progressive causes  unless ironically if progressivism becomes what anti progressivism is now  the only salvation i find is that  usually these people get exposed for the emotional basis of their position and they typically never get huge systematic support amongst the 50  because they don't stand for anything besides being a troll contrarian  for example if you ever browse far right wing forums you suprisngly see that trump of milo yiannopoulos  contrarians  never gets the respect that someone less popular yet more grounded and with more skin in the game like steve bannon evil  or lincoln rockewell evil  would get simply because they are contrarian shills   the evil  this would be too long if i went into detail but simply put these people possess all the negative traits that shape the anti progressive forces of the world  they are the complete polar opposite of what we would see as a moral person  also  unlike the others  these people are grounded in their ways of evil and have a crooked philosophical basis behind it so they aren't vacuous like contrarians  also generally the machiavelliansim that accompanies becoming evil also lends it self well to other societal valued traits such as intelligence  wealth and leadership that are all valuable in the capitalist system  these people are your bad bosses  who prevent work from home  micromanage and make you work 40  unpaid hours just to see you miserable  they are the fascist politicians who genuinely believe that those unlike them should be exterminated  and these are you billionaires who despite being aware of their burden  do not pay taxes or do enough to help  i think they genuinely enjoy that like you and i would enjoy sex or get some kind of warmth like a normal person does seeing a homeless person getting a home  beyond redemption  these people are your enemies and the architects of the system  one must do everything in their power and will to stop them  and treat them like an existential parasitic threat on humanity that they    anyways  this ultimately how i see the world now  at the core of it  it's a problem not of impracticality but of character  as long as these individuals exist and form a high   of the population antiwork ideas may not be popular  all you really can do in your lifetime is spread the word and fight agaisnt the evil  that's what i try my best to do anyways  i do genuinely hope that subreddits and ideas like this one day do lead to a great systematic change where these percentages will shift more and more over a long period of time  we probably won't live to see it but i still think it's worth the effort ,o73q1v

571,Dear First Worlders..., warning  the world  ruled by the callous mentalities created by the global cult of capitalism and illusion of meritocracy  has taken me to the point of being a misanthrope

multiplied by 10 toward privileged people because of their dehumanizing approach toward everyone else  this is a very passionate  angry rant directed at no one in this sub in particular  but directed

charisma  of sadistic narcissists and propel them into positions of power   influence time and time again  good  pure-hearted people who mind their business and try not to judge others over personal characteristics are treated like the exact opposite  they don t participate in what most call  banter  so they re viewed by the majority as  lame   soft  or  too boring   sensitive  as a result  good people are usually targets of unprovoked bullying  abuse and   or isolation  why  because so-called civilized modern people have become so dumb and backward  that intending to be a good person from the beginning without having ulterior motives is viewed as  weakness  this world wants you to be manipulating and transactional in everything you do and everyone you deal with  when people who refuse to play the game are permanently othered and inevitably deemed losers and outcasts  the society then acts like it was their fault and they must be truly lacking something inside them to not be able to integrate  no  these less than 5  of people just couldn t allow themselves to be everyday sadistic sociopaths like the majority    it s funny how trump called africa a  shithole  when from a character standpoint  even with their own flaws  people there have more redeeming qualities in one finger than your average westerner has in their entire bloodline  especially westerners that make close to six figures or more  less wealthy people in this country at least try to help each other in limited ways sometimes and tend to have a lot more principles that they live by  for better or worse  there are many flawed principles but i can respect any principled person far more than the rich and middle class who push this  sell your soul and existence to the highest bidder  bootlicker mentality on everyone  if you refuse to be a part of bourgeois culture and play the game  you will be concern trolled and gaslighted by these people  they ll say  grow up  or  you ll never become successful thinking this way  to these people  growing up means relentlessly chasing arbitrary standards of prosperity and becoming a compliant worker bee who never questions any of society s authorities  well  i say fuck you and fuck your media-crafted definitions of success  happiness and prosperity  all three are treated like a zero-sum game where crabs in a bucket must prevent the others from getting enough for themselves  people want to avoid concepts like misanthropy and antinatalism because they re deemed as  negative and divisive  all the while deliberately ignoring the fact that even so-called  positive  concepts have been bastardized by the puppet-masters of this world to keep the masses controlling  hostile and hypercompetitive toward one another  humans want to continue living in strife despite the fact that true scarcity  meaning lack of enough physical resources to support everyone  does not exist and will only decrease as technology finds new ways to support sustainability and preserve life  at least misanthropy and antinatalism stemmed from concern for the greater environment and a desire to improve life for the people already here  people who buy into the  cult of individualistic positivity  seem to be primarily concerned with self-promotion and getting recognition above all else  even better if it s at someone s expense and they can feel like they knocked someone down a peg while pulling themselves up  the crazy part is that mentalities like this are promoted by society as  self-love  and  confidence  cultures of cutthroat scarcity are promoted as inevitable reality while cultures of abundance and compassion are quickly dismissed as childish na vet  it is all cultural  not based on the physical reality that is abundance    at this point  i m allergic to anyone this heinous society considers  successful  and want to keep at least three football fields of distance between me and those types of people  write me off as a deluded loser if you like  i stopped caring about petty bs like that a long time ago  i only care about one thing now  and that s knowing the true reality  things probably won t change  but i need to keep my eye out so i can at least avoid the madness myself  i m a second generation immigrant native born in the usa  and i m deliberately moving to a remote  third world  country to live on less money  and less stress  and to get away from this toxic  inhumane social darwinist culture  no matter how many people s lives are ruined by this system  the general public continues to go along with its twisted machiavellian values and sweep problems   victims under the rug  all to pretend  everything is positive and i am in control of everything that happens in my life  material difficulties aside  at least people elsewhere have a somewhat closer relationship with reality  they have to for survival  and treat each other more like human beings  i ll gladly deal with increased material inconveniences over this spiritually bankrupt cultural wasteland we call the west  in the first world  when people look at you  you are a walking currency amount  not a breathing human  never forget that ,o7aj55

584,Japan proposes four-day working week to improve work-life balance, link to article https p dw com p 3vjbj maca en-reddit-sharing   japan's government proposes a 4-day work week  unfortunately  it is only a recommendation and not mandated  the government hopes to combat decline in birthrates by allowing young people more time to build relationships  it will also prevent employee illness from overwork and allow them to pursue further education to qualify for better jobs      i personally don't believe this proposal will have much impact because it is only a recommendation and the business culture in japan sets high expectations on employees  there is also a concern about potential pay cuts- employees won't opt into the 4-day work week if it means making less money  however  a part of me wishes to see this proposal come to fruition and put the spotlight on fewer working days globally ,o7065g

586,"If All Goes According To Plan, I Won't Have To Work Until At Least Next April and Will Still Get Paid",for the most part  i won't have to work    i'm on a leave of absence right now and stopped working in early may due to anxiety and depression and stress  the job i'm at is horrible but before i quit or hopped into another job  i decided to use them for their benefits   so i got denied for short term disability due to a pre existing condition clause and because i haven't been there at least a year but i did get approved for state disability  so i'm getting paid for the 4-6 weeks i've been off work  the only thing is state disability pay is a joke and pays less than unemployment  so i thought of another plan to get more money and not work   i'm  going to return within the next week or two and got my doctor to say i was ready to return  in my state  you can take paid family leave and get paid up to  1000 a week for 12 weeks  that's much lower than what i make but is enough to cover bills and to save extra money    so i get to apply for that after the 4th of july but i need to be  active  to apply so that's why i'm going back to work    as soon as i get back to work  i'm going to apply for paid family leave  i don't see a reason why i wouldn't get approved as my mother's health is fucked up and i'm going to have her doctor say that i'm going to be her caregiver    so this will allow me to be off for 3 months 12 weeks    if i don't go out right away  i'll begin the leave at the beginning of august    when i return to work  even if i'm there for july  they won't have me doing shit because it will take a while to get me back on board  meanwhile  since i have been out on leave  if they try to fire me for requesting a new leave  that will be clear retaliation and my state has a no retaliation policy for requesting paid family leave which is why i'm going to do it right when i return    so basically i won't have to do shit when i return to work anyway  then will be on leave again august-november    when i return in november  holidays will be approaching  again  i won't have to do shit but attend meetings  at the most run a shitty report    i will request vacation as much as i have available from november to december as well    once the first week of january gets here  i will actually qualify for 12 weeks of fmla for 12 weeks and up to 26 weeks of paid short term disability  i will at a minimum get paid vacation and sick time for fmla and will just tell my doctor i can't work anymore and have him sign off to go back on std    so basically i don't give a fuck about the company i work for  i am going to keep taking leave as much as fucking possible  come back for a few weeks  then fucking repeat    they can kiss my ass  i want to date  drink travel  and just enjoy my youth    hopefully all goes according to plan   fingers crossed ,o6rfz5
587,LinkedIn Stories,linkedin is full of narrow-minded  egotistical people who brags about their success to the point where they think being workaholic makes up their whole personality  they are brainwashed into thinking that working towards a  dream  a sheep under capitalism is the end all  more often they so engulfed in their own  work  that they feel the need to post cliched stories after stories  most often sob stories  about how their childhood is pitiful and how  hard  they worked to get where they are  the best part is when they brag about being the first generation to graduate even though college  tafe and universities have become more and more accessible  as a result  a lot of people hold degrees in different states  so i don t know why they think they re so special  the reality is that without work  these people have no personality  no stance  no nothing  because a toxic work culture is all they have ever known  they are too indulged  in their own bubble that they can t see the manipulation behind the phrase  chase your dreams and find career in something you love  how about being a friend  a partner  a caring and giving human being   how about having hobbies and doing things out of your free time  we have been bombarded with the same old 40hr week  9-5 job  wasting our majority of life on working and working until exhaustion and not being able to do things we love or spend time with those who we love dearly  the capitalists are creating a nation of robots that can t take a mental break because mental health is not taken seriously  and linkedin is further perpetuating this disgusting workaholic stance   what was meant to be inspiring has turned into a place for a group of smart asses who are indirectly promoting a toxic work culture due to the amount of hardships they faced ,o6zexx

601,Dear First Worlders..., warning  the world  ruled by the callous mentalities created by the global cult of capitalism and illusion of meritocracy  has taken me to the point of being a misanthrope  yes i m honest about it  that being said  i don t hate anyone as an individual and believe humanity doesn t have to be this way  though my hope for change dwindles every day  my misanthropy is multiplied by 10 toward privileged people because of their dehumanizing approach toward everyone else  this is a very passionate  angry rant directed at no one in this sub in particular  but directed at the general public in the first world at the same time  and this sub is the only place on the internet where i don t think the post will get 100  knee-jerk hate reactions  though i expect a lot of hate from bootlicker types  read at your own risk    to my  temporary  i m leaving soon  neighbors in the first world  never forget you are choosing to live like scum who support thousands of injustices with your daily actions and self-centered attitudes toward everything  you allow yourselves to be ruled by war criminals  both sides are the same corrupt bs  year in and year out while willfully turning a blind eye to the normalized genocide  forced poverty  and segregation your leaders perpetuate in all areas of the world  the only issues you pay attention to in current events and history are those that directly affect your self-interest or feed your biases  you also create an overinflated ego and sense of self-importance from your meaningless corporate jobs  most of which don t make the world a better place and actively make it worse by hurting the environment and making corrupt dark triad people even more prosperous  you are a useful pawn for these people and that is all they will ever see you as  imagine thinking you re some big shot credible person with authority for being just another obedient cog in a system of torture and death  many of you almost subconsciously look down on the working class  illegal  and low wage workers in your countries  even though they re literally the backbones of your infrastructure and the main force that allows you to go to that cushy office job every day and buy lunch with no worries of anything falling apart    then  in your free time  instead of studying things like sociology   spirituality and trying to progress the world toward one of love and equality  you get on the internet to bully strangers over trivial nonsense - looks  age  income  intellect  disabilities  mental health status  popularity  lifestyle  size  level of  success  choosing to stay single or a loner  how social they are  how many people they slept with or didn t sleep with  which religion   spiritual beliefs they have or lack thereof  and any personality traits   viewpoints that you ve been trained by toxic parents   society to hate and don t conform ad nauseam to your narrow comfort zone and worldview  you spend every waking hour online and irl being as callous  unempathetic  and dismissive toward people and their experiences   feelings as humanly possible  i ve seen so many instances of people who are genuinely struggling sharing their experiences online  only to be blamed for all their traumas by a bunch of privileged overgrown babies who are obviously out of touch with  global  reality and never faced any real adversity compared to others in those  shithole  countries they never think about  or even compared to people in those  rough  neighborhoods of their own country that they only bring up when the  poor people commit more crime  narrative is mentioned  never any mention of what causes the poverty though  just the blame   shame game left and right  and we all know how common fake friendships are in first-world countries  with so many people out there who want to know your deepest  darkest secrets just to use them against you or to take advantage  vultures  i ve talked to several people who are either from non-first world countries or lived in them extensively  they all say that friendships are not like this in other parts of the world  it s a problem of the west or at least more pronounced  here  people make frenemies instead of friends  regardless of gender  and it s nearly universal  i think the reason for the toxic nature of relationships here is that almost every damn pursuit in western culture devolves to a game of one-upsmanship and getting a leg up on somebody  ah  there s that good old capitalism-fueled competition rearing it s head again  patriarchy is another cultural disease that adds to the prevalence of hypercompetition as well   victim blaming  prejudiced criticisms under the guise of  tough love   advice  and casual gaslighting  of all kinds  in all situations  seems to be something people in your cultures do for amusement online  never thinking about the psychological harm that may have been done to the other person  it just shows how fragile your egos are and how they need to be preserved 24 7 against the slightest deviation  all of this insecurity despite the fact that you people go on and on about how you live in the  best countries in the world  if something doesn t align with your narrow scope of vision  you will refuse to consider or even hear a single word that the other person is saying and abuse them for expressing themselves in a way that you don t approve  all so you can pretend that the world is a-okay  that you re not complicit in thousands of injustices that occur everyday  and that anyone who gets mistreated  abused  or even killed brought it on themselves and  deserved  it  it s like you deliberately turn off any semblance of humanity and empathy that neoliberal capitalist culture hasn t already sucked out of you    i guess i understand  thinking this way makes it convenient to stay working mindlessly like an ant and only caring about your own lot in life  never truly questioning why it  has  to be this way  but really  why  we could literally have a global revolution tomorrow if people really wanted to unite  because you re afraid to lose your job  you have kids to feed  that s part of the problem  knowing everything going on in this world and continuing to bring children into inevitable suffering just because everyone else is popping out babies and you don t want to be an outcast  or a selfish desire for  legacy  or maybe you accept the status quo unconditionally because your parents told you  it s just the way it is  when you were children  bullshit  that s the first time they tried to kill the passion out of you and you let them  chances are that most of our parents   adults told their kids deflating things like this to perpetuate the just-world fallacy for themselves and avoid guilt about their own lack of action in making the world a better place  then they bring more children into the world and indoctrinate them with the same sick values  and the generational cycle of mass suffering continues  beautiful isn t it  but i know most people will probably say i should go to a shrink for this rant and that i m the crazy one for not seeing the value in humanity when this is how we choose  yes it s a choice  not  human nature  to live   there really isn t much of a difference between the mentality of today s neoliberal consumerist zombies and people like hitler s supporters  you neoliberals are just very slick with the way you do things  but it s all done under the same wicked intentions of oppression and dominance for the sake of dominance  we literally have more than enough resources globally to give every human being a house  keep them decently fed  etc  but no  the majority of you narcissistic chimpanzees keep insisting  competition   hyperindividualism is good  survival of the fittest  cooperation   collectivism and being kind is for the weak  same idiots that go around saying things like  respect must be earned  not given  and  telling it like it is  to justify their prejudices and discriminatory actions   no asshole  i m the one telling it like it is  and i know you don t like the actual truth because it puts you and your peers  everyday shortcomings on a big projector for you all to see    and before anyone complains  yes  i understand there are hundreds of millions of people in the first world and some  very few let s be honest  don t go along with the status quo and try to be part of the change they envision for the world  this is a rant directed at the  middle   bourgeois class  majority  honestly  so-called democracy has proven to be the biggest tyranny of all  in other systems  there was always a distinct group challenging the authorities at play and they weren t completely wiped into silence  if they were wiped via violence  it was later understood as a cruel act that shouldn t be mimicked  but because the word  democracy  is falsely used to describe this inhumane system and sounds good on paper  the masses shut down people who rightfully question how  free  this illusion truly is and think they re the real fascists  since they don t use violence and just shut these people out of the discussion via cultural power  those people have no viable way to make their point without looking like the bad guys  and while i don t believe we live in a meritocracy  the fact that most people believe we do and their justifications for mistreating the  lower end  people show me that the concept as a whole is inherently bad for humanity due to the callous mentality it perpetuates  we are all slaves to the judgments of the majority  no matter how delusional they become    at least with one central leadership figure  you have a chance of bringing in someone with a good head on their shoulders and high level of compassion  your odds of finding one admirable person to lead are much higher than getting the majority to love and respect one another regardless of differences  the majority will always keep an ignorant and inhumane mentality toward anyone not exactly like them  and therefore will maintain a cold  despicable value system in society   as a result  they fall for the lies and deceitful  charisma  of sadistic narcissists and propel them into positions of power   influence time and time again  good  pure-hearted people who mind their business and try not to judge others over personal characteristics are treated like the exact opposite  they don t participate in what most call  banter  so they re viewed by the majority as  lame   soft  or  too boring   sensitive  as a result  good people are usually targets of unprovoked bullying  abuse and   or isolation  why  because so-called civilized modern people have become so dumb and backward  that intending to be a good person from the beginning without having ulterior motives is viewed as  weakness  this world wants you to be manipulating and transactional in everything you do and everyone you deal with  when people who refuse to play the game are permanently othered and inevitably deemed losers and outcasts  the society then acts like it was their fault and they must be truly lacking something inside them to not be able to integrate  no  these less than 5  of people just couldn t allow themselves to be everyday sadistic sociopaths like the majority    it s funny how trump called africa a  shithole  when from a character standpoint  even with their own flaws  people there have more redeeming qualities in one finger than your average westerner has in their entire bloodline  especially westerners that make close to six figures or more  less wealthy people in this country at least try to help each other in limited ways sometimes and tend to have a lot more principles that they live by  for better or worse  there are many flawed principles but i can respect any principled person far more than the rich and middle class who push this  sell your soul and existence to the highest bidder  bootlicker mentality on everyone  if you refuse to be a part of bourgeois culture and play the game  you will be concern trolled and gaslighted by these people  they ll say  grow up  or  you ll never become successful thinking this way  to these people  growing up means relentlessly chasing arbitrary standards of prosperity and becoming a compliant worker bee who never questions any of society s authorities  well  i say fuck you and fuck your media-crafted definitions of success  happiness and prosperity  all three are treated like a zero-sum game where crabs in a bucket must prevent the others from getting enough for themselves  people want to avoid concepts like misanthropy and antinatalism because they re deemed as  negative and divisive  all the while deliberately ignoring the fact that even so-called  positive  concepts have been bastardized by the puppet-masters of this world to keep the masses controlling  hostile and hypercompetitive toward one another  humans want to continue living in strife despite the fact that true scarcity  meaning lack of enough physical resources to support everyone  does not exist and will only decrease as technology finds new ways to support sustainability and preserve life  at least misanthropy and antinatalism stemmed from concern for the greater environment and a desire to improve life for the people already here  people who buy into the  cult of individualistic positivity  seem to be primarily concerned with self-promotion and getting recognition above all else  even better if it s at someone s expense and they can feel like they knocked someone down a peg while pulling themselves up  the crazy part is that mentalities like this are promoted by society as  self-love  and  confidence  cultures of cutthroat scarcity are promoted as inevitable reality while cultures of abundance and compassion are quickly dismissed as childish na vet  it is all cultural  not based on the physical reality that is abundance    at this point  i m allergic to anyone this heinous society considers  successful  and want to keep at least three football fields of distance between me and those types of people  write me off as a deluded loser if you like  i stopped caring about petty bs like that a long time ago  i only care about one thing now  and that s knowing the true reality  things probably won t change  but i need to keep my eye out so i can at least avoid the madness myself  i m a second generation immigrant native born in the usa  and i m deliberately moving to a remote  third world  country to live on less money  and less stress  and to get away from this toxic  inhumane social darwinist culture  no matter how many people s lives are ruined by this system  the general public continues to go along with its twisted machiavellian values and sweep problems   victims under the rug  all to pretend  everything is positive and i am in control of everything that happens in my life  material difficulties aside  at least people elsewhere have a somewhat closer relationship with reality  they have to for survival  and treat each other more like human beings  i ll gladly deal with increased material inconveniences over this spiritually bankrupt cultural wasteland we call the west  in the first world  when people look at you  you are a walking currency amount  not a breathing human  never forget that ,o7aj5t

609,"I only view work as what the ''job'' can do for me, not the other way around.",i've been working capitalistic bullshit retail and food service jobs since i was 14 years old  i have been getting bashed by the people around me since then for my ''inability to hold down a job''  basically  i lived in a small town where everyone kept the same highschool job til they moved for college  and all college graduates kept the same job til they retired or died       i  however  only worked at places where i had friends and i had fun with it and i fucked around because i never took the market seriously  and the second my capitalistic sheep managers started giving me a hard time  i would quit  while i was working constantly  i never lasted more than 7 months at a job because i would not put up with anyone's shit          so many people say that this is bad  looks bad for me and my resume  and yet  it never impaired me from finding a job  wonder why that is  maybe because it doesnt fucking matter  capitalism always needs new slaves  so the way i see it is  i got to experience different jobs  different levels of bullshit  but got to make friends and memories along the way  and i intend to keep going         i dont see the point in going to fancy university and getting a fancy degree just to then sit at a desk for 40 years       i see these silly little jobs as much more entertaining and this might sound dumb  but they allow me to travel  i have 3 citizenships and in any of my countries i can just work a little retail job and afford a garbage little apartment for me and my cat and just vibe and discover places and meet people and make it worth my while  and really  work fades into the background      so while i hate the idea of selling my soul and body to capitalism as a forever minimum wage worker  i definitely see that it can have some advantages and work for me       plus  sometimes there are perks or i get a few cents above minimum wage  and it all adds to the delusional fun that is working to be able to survive  idk  anyone else have this attitude that  while work is rotted  we can make it work for our goals and plans         also  retail is bullshit and there is no one more stupid than ''the customer''           rant over  pleasant day  ,o75xpm

714,(Rant) Food not being a fundamental human right is purposeful abuse on the human race caused by the rich.,   you wouldn t tell a starving child that they don t deserve food unless they worked for it  that's child abuse  right  and we  are  only mother nature s children  after all    as a species  we need not pretend food is limited  or unavailable to everyone  if it makes you upset that people  work so hard  to bring the food to the people  and  of course they must be paid for doing such work    i urge you to reconsider where humans got food from to begin with  we found it in the wild  where it grew from dirt and water  with the sun as the only source of energy    yes  the wild is also is where we had a chance of dying  i know    in modern society  we have no chance of dying from predation  this is the whole purpose of the society  however    but that does not mean food should be given to the rich more easily  that defeats the purpose of the society  and only benefits the upper class  who are all fundamentally wrong for so much as being so rich  as they are inevitably hoarding food in  real time   this is true  as poverty is the leading cause of starvation    it means the rich need to realize that the very essence of the word  rich  is negative and selfish when you aren t also helping the poor by distributing your excess money almost immediately  this should really start to resonate with more americans  as we are one of the most disgustingly spoiled countries on the planet  on top of that  since we live in our own little bubble here in america  and pretend the rest of the dying planet doesn't exist  why not fix things here anyway  do you know how easy it would be  tell the rich they are going to be imprisoned if they don't distribute  is that wrong  absolutely not  in my eyes  we're already neglecting the rest of the world  start somewhere for christ's sake   it does not make you a good person to hoard your money  even if you think  if i spend it  who knows where it will go  you most likely know where it goes  don t kid yourself  do your research  support just causes and stop purchasing things that are wholly unneeded by our species  please stop to think about how worthless your purchases are compared to the people who have nothing  10  of humans on our beautiful planet ,o63qos

785,I got fired for organizing,this was a few year ago but i thought i'd share with this community  i got a job working with someone i knew from the church i went to as a child  he was actually my youth pastor  i no longer practice any religion but i think this is relevant to the story  he ran a small screen printing shop  when i first started there was only about 5 full time employees and the owner rarely ever came in  i started at 11 dollars i believe and had to fight for every raise  i only got my first significant raise because i was one of two people who knew had to run the automatic press  the other person put in his two weeks for a better job and i was looking for better pay myself so i used this as leverage and told my boss i was offered a job with higher pay  since he would have nobody to run his most lucrative press he reluctantly gave me a raise to 13 i think  fast forward a few years he finally decided to try and grow the business by adding more presses and hiring more people  i was eventually promoted to production manager and had clawed my way to 18 an hour  i saw all of the work orders and i knew what the business was making and my pay was dismal in comparison and i was the 2nd or 3rd highest paid person in the shop  all the while my boss owned a small trailer camper that he maybe used twice a year  bought himself a brand new 4runner and owned his house and was raising 4 kids  the main reason i didn't quit sooner was that i really liked the production team there and we all got along pretty well  they didn't want me to quit either so i decided to try and organize for higher pay and health benefits  we had meetings outside of work and i even went as far as to make a budget to show that he could be providing healthcare and paying us significantly better all while still turning a healthy profit for himself  well i never even got to share my budget with him because he fired my ass and told me it was because i once said that i  was checked out from the job  i ended up getting unemployment which was great and was sort of my plan b  it worked out better for me in the long run than to just quit  your boss needs you more than you need him  organize your workplaces and fight for better working conditions as a team ,o5bfq3

789,Walked out of work today,now let me preface this by saying i m fortunate enough to not be dependable on my current part time job  i m just using it as a way of financing my masters degree in teaching in ireland and i m probably quitting soon  i m quiet content where i work  in a community leisure centre  i m fairly friendly with everyone and rarely have issues with management as they re genuinely nice people that i m friends with  so i ve been doing tuesday through saturdays at the moment  no problem whatsoever  the needed me on saturday mornings and said i d be off sunday and monday so i could spend time with girlfriend or go for nights away  again no problem for me as i usually go out on a saturday night anyways  roster is done on a weekly basis but it s almost so routine at this stage that checking it is almost trivial for me  so it finally comes out this sunday which is late because our work week starts monday but one of the managers was hospitalised with illness this week so i could understand    out of curiosity i check it and i m due to work at 6 30am on monday  it was 5pm sunday when i got the email  so i m absolutely fuming  i had to look after dogs and chickens as my family are away until tonight   i got into work at 6 30 as a compromise and said i m leaving at 8 00 so get something sorted  the manager today seemed to take my statement as some sort of plead as she just replied  ugh okay i ll see if i can find someone   come 7 45 i ask if they got that sorted and she just replied  who am i supposed to get at 7am on a monday  so i just told her i m leaving  she began pleading with me to stay saying i can t do that without cover and i replied a spiel about not caring as i was told i was off on mondays  and that me showing up for 1 5 hours was a courtesy on my part as i had less than 15 hours between the time i received my changed roster to when i was working  because god forbid i was in another part of the country drinking with no back on sunday night and wouldn t have made it at all    so i walked out to a very disgruntled manager who will probably be out to get me during the week for leaving her short staffed but it finally clicked to me that i m not available to them at a click of a finger and have other commitments outside of work  i shouldn t have to even consider giving my work notice when my family go on holidays or shouldn t have to consider taking official holiday leave just to go for a night away with my girlfriend  just wanted to get that off my chest  again i m afforded the luxury of not being reliant on work for finance  but previously i was sacrificing a lot of myself to keep them successful  that s no longer the case,o4yi9z
790,Back to the real world,i got let go from my office job back in november 2020 and have been riding unemployment ever since   judge all you want - i look at it as the universe giving me a much needed mental break   it's been about 8 months now and i'm really dreading 'getting back at it'   i promise -- i don't mind working hard   i don't mind a heavy work load   i can even be reasonably flexible when it comes to low pay because i live in a very affordable area   but i cannot deal with micromanaging  office politics and someone constantly watching over my shoulder   leave me the fuck alone  let me do my work without feeling like i'm on eggshells for 9 hours a day  and don't give me shit for not participating in office 'outings' at bars or for not jumping at the 'opportunity' to work overtime when i've been coaching myself to 'just get through this week'   really not looking forward to continue dealing with entitled assholes  burning myself out and hating my life   but i assume i should snag one of these dumbass jobs now while i can  because once unemployment stops paying out in a couple months  nothing is gonna be available ,o54ikb

817,POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CLIMATE,      sorry if this has been brought up before  but i haven t seen it discussed yet  although i absolutely agree with the sentiment of this forum and agree that there is a massive issue  i have conflicting feelings on the direction that would be best for everyone        i am from the school of thought that we ve been fed a story our whole lives that hard work will eventually pay off  and a working class hero is something to be praised  at one point in time  i definitely believed this  it has become clear to me that this is not the direction we are being led  it is clear to me that we are heading towards a robot artificial intelligence driven economy  it is inevitable at this point  where does this leave the billions of people that rely on jobs that will be phased out  a universal basic income is clearly on the horizon         now part of me still romanticizes the idea of a meritocracy built on hard work where everyone can be the deciding factor in their destiny  the other part of me believes that working 40-60 hours a week to scrape by and have nothing left over prevents us from finding out what we truly value and enjoy in life      do we go the route of communism and everyone gets the same housing  same allotment of food  the same amount of money each month etc - or do we completely dismantle the established order that is being put in place and try to supply enough jobs for everyone  ensure that everyone is given an opportunity to make a reasonable living with benefits  and an affordable education  what is even possible at this point  i have many more thoughts that i could put forth but it would require a novel length diatribe that no one needs to read     i would just like to hear what the sentiment is here  is communism inherently bad or is it just inevitable that leaders will ultimately abuse their powers  is it possible to get back to a society where currency is more evenly distributed  or are we all fucked  and the path we re heading down is one where we will all be slaves to papa government  thanks in advance ,o52ci7

835,"Before claiming how secular your country is, realize the religious fervor it takes to believe in capitalism",humans don't actually need that much to survive and propagate the species  we need food  clean water  shelter  and to not be eaten by predators   capitalism doesn't provide any of this directly  instead workers are expected to engage in rituals called  jobs  to gain currency which can then be used in a  purchasing  ritual   your job probably doesn't create much of the above  food  access to water  shelter  security  but the superstition is that you add enough to an immaterial entity called the  economy  that you will be able to support yourself through purchasing rituals   this whole system only works because this shared superstition exists throughout places that believe in capitalism   however a shared superstition is not enough  since currencies can become useless and resources can become depleted through mass production   because of this  less religious adherents are in a constant state of anxiety   the religion of capitalisn has likely made inaccessible the ability to directly make or acquire food  water  or shelter without engaging in its rituals ,o5k40e

908,Today Is the First Day of the Rest of My Life,i've done it  folks - as of last friday i've quit my office job after eight long years  and am now starting my freelance career   i thought i would be more nervous  i thought i'd be shaking and crying and a fearful wreck  but so far  it seems the anxiety and the tears i was shedding on a weekly - and sometimes daily - basis was actually from spending 40 hours a week at a job i hated   after hearing that i was leaving  i had not one  not two  but five coworkers tell me that they were glad that i was  getting away from this abusive environment  to head that others felt that way was like a shock to the system  i hadn't realized how bad it really was  and had in fact started believing that maybe i was a bad worker  that i deserved to be berated over minor mistakes  to spend my hours having panic attacks  to be openly disliked by my manager  because this was just where i was stuck for my life  i can't even say that the money was worth it - i was making a pathetic salary  despite three promotions over the years  i was still making a little less than three thousand dollars above starting salary   i'm 33  i spent eight years at the same company - i started fresh from graduate school and it has been my only professional job - which means that i spent a quarter of my life at that place  worse  it was never what i actually wanted to do  when i first got hired on  i told myself that it would just be for a year  i would get some experience  have that line on my resume  and leave as soon as i could  one year became two  then five  and then i found that my identity was wrapped around a job i could barely stand  i needed a change   and you know  once i decided that i was going to quit whether i lined up a new job or not  it finally happened - and believe me  i'd been applying elsewhere for years  my new job isn't glamorous  but it is in a field that i love  it's remote  at my office job  we were supposed to be going back to the office soon  and  despite having fewer hours  it pays only a little less than my previous job - enough that i can survive   and that's what i'm going to do  survive  i'm going to survive  and without eight hours a day of dread-filled stress and work that lost its meaning years ago  without a manager who openly despises me and a company that refuses to see that i am a good worker who deserves to be treated as such - without all of that holding me back  i might just even thrive ,o4tmm5

948,What if I don't like any job?,i am in this tough predicament  i don't have any job i think i'd like  people always say to do what you love as a job  but what i love is watching funny videos  playing video games and sleeping  i can't turn any of those into careers  i am passionate for drawing  creating music  videography  video editing and writing stories    but i know for a fact that if i turn those into careers i'd be burned out and i want to avoid that at all costs because my creativity is all that i have  i don't want to turn my creative hobbies into an income because if i get burn-out and lose them  then i'm beyond fucked  it would suck the fun out of doing those hobbies  y'know what i mean   i feel like i wouldn't like any job at all because i hate the idea of wasting the majority of my life away from them  it fuels my heart with resentment with anything that i am forced to do against my will     before you say i'm not forced against my will  please know that if i don't do these jobs  i will be homeless and poor and possibly end up dead on the streets  which is like a form of slavery in a sense  it's all secretly implemented in our society  it's slavery but in a different form to make us scared and punishes us for choosing the alternative   and it's not like i don't want to contribute to society  i am a genuinely kind person  i do want to contribute to society but i feel like the work life balance with these jobs are terrible in the united states  i heard many many stories of people working low-wage jobs for the majority of their lives and being treated like utter shit  which makes me even more afraid about getting a job  i don't know how people do it  i have really bad anxiety so i know for a fact that things in my life are going to be so much harder for me    i just don't know how i'm going to cope with these jobs  also  people have always said  running a business or do freelance writing and such  i did research with all of that and most information says how hard and stressful it is to do those things  i don't want to do anything too hard or stressful for a job  if i end up doing a job that's too hard  i will end up feeling so uncomfortable to the point where i get into a really dark mindset  that's the best way i can put it   i even tried to do other things like becoming a youtuber but it's so unbelievably hard to even get success with that  i've tried for many years ever since high school but i never got any good results  that was my main dream career but it failed  so now i am left with nothing    i just want to do something that's relatively easy and low-stress because i want to enjoy my life  i don't want to be stuck feeling always on edge because of how difficult something is  especially if it's something i am not even fucking passionate about  i just don't get this life anymore man  i am scared because i think the only solution for me is to just accept it  but part of me is afraid to accept it because that's been my  1 biggest fear from day one  i was always afraid that i had to conform to this society and be a sheep  that my individuality as a person would be forever gone because i grew up a quitter  i just don't know what to do anymore dude  i really hate growing up so fucking much that every day this is on my fucking mind and i want it to stop  i don't know what to do and that's why i made this post  i am sorry if you hate me  call me a lazy piece of sh  i really don't care anymore  this is my real feelings and if you can't accept that then leave this post and go read another post or something    also  i know people are like jobs are just supposed to be a way to get money  i know that  i understand that jobs aren't supposed to be fun  i'm aware that it's just supposed to be a thing we do to get money  but that's not the issue  the issue is just my emotions to it all  if i am not content with my life then is that really living  at that point  i might as well not exist  what's the point of living if i can't even at least be content with everything  if i am literally suffering most days because of these thoughts then what the hell is the point    should i just accept that all jobs will ultimately suck and that i should just view these jobs as just a thing to get money  and try to enjoy the small free time that i have    i love you all  also if you are suffering from the same shit as me  i am so so sorry  i notice that i am not the only one that feels like this  i genuinely feel bad whenever i see people saying they feel the same way because this shouldn't be the norm  people always try to somehow justify this sick way of living and it's so stupid  i am sorry so many of you guys are suffering like me  i am here for all of you ,o4it54

951,"Company Profile: ""Horia Hulubei"" National Institute for R&amp;D in Physics and Nuclear Engineering (IFIN-HH)",  preface  i have decided to blow the whistle on the  horia hulubei  institute in bucharest  magurele and decided to use r antiwork in order to do so mainly since i believe that sharing experiences should alleviate the need of others to fall into the traps that i have fallen into  i hesitated on using  r jobs but it might be that they have a pay-to-win thing going on similar to glassdoor or yelp  in any case  i am not looking for votes  or karma  and if the content is not appropriate i will be happy to move the content to a different section  there is a lot to recount so i will try to break the whole experience into palatable chapters such that the post does not read like a wall of text with no breaks or turns  i will try to also break down the experiences to conform to what most civilized countries would expect from an employer-employee relationship  i might wander a little into side discussions but only for the purpose of providing background or highlighting the employer's connections that would benefit the company profile and frame the testimony in context   please take note that most of this is based on personal experience as well as personal impressions and that i may very well be that the institute is great place to be  i am publishing this partly to maintain a record of what happened and to document my experience at the institute  i share this freely since i have noticed that there is very little information on the subject of ifin-hh aside for a few dodgy reviews on various websites that seem to have been bought for or arranged to be posted  nevertheless  the reader is encouraged to keep an open mind and take heed that these are personal notes and experiences that might just be factually wrong  it is ultimately up to everyone to make up their mind and hopefully  not too late to do so     background  the  horia hulubei  national institute for r amp d in physics and nuclear engineering  ifin-hh   note the pompous name  started off as a typical communist ambition of third-world countries locked behind different forms of embargo with the western part of the world  just like other typical endeavors  such as the current-day palace of parliament  the fountains running through bucharest  the emphasis was placed on hyperbola and vanity rather than functionality and  as one could imagine  at the expense of the people since unfortunately the battle with the western world was economically dumped on the shoulders of the common man that had to double up on labor to fund the lavish dictatorial ambitions  it did not matter whether any important research was carried out or whether anything lasting was conceived  it just had to stand out and  ultimately stick up to the  capitalists  a lot of the glee was fueled by bling-patriotism or cynical patriotism  the employees developing some form of multiple personality disorder where on one hand they would have done anything to jump ship but at the same time any criticism would have been met with repression or victimization  a lot of this was carried on over by the romanian diaspora where the same duplicity is observed  on one hand romanian citizens living abroad criticize romania and accuse romanians of not fighting for their rights but at the same time they would adamantly refuse to return to romania and actually fight for the rights that they seemingly hold dear to  all flash  no substance   a lot of this has been carried over from communism and little has changed even in more than three decades since the alleged fall of communism  in some ways  one could argue that the situation has been somewhat amplified given that the embargoes has been lifted and that funds have been funneled by organizations such as the european union into the hands of the very few that had a good time during communism  surely  this was not the intended effect yet the result was fairly predictable given the power vacuum left by ceausescu  a very archetypal decaying of repressive regimes  people that had it well under communism  have it well now and now it is bolstered and backed up by funding from alleged allies   most of the staff at ifin-hh are former communist party members  have been working for the romanian secruitate or have acted as rats or moles for the romanian communist party and mainly for the extra buck and advantages that they hold even to this day  very little has been done to oust these people or make them pay for their crimes - as a side-comment  even if it was one of the accession conditions for romania to join the eu  very few former files of the securitate have been the light of day  i have personally been refused access to the files with an excuse that they do not have the files  which  in context  is absurd for a person traveling abroad during communism  in other words  the very same people that held communist party meetings in lavish and expensive hotels during communism are the very same people that are now in leadership positions  naturally  the same frou-frou patriotism is carried over where a lot of the staff have made great sacrifices to send their progeny abroad  obtain double citizenship so they can jump ship when trouble arises yet perpetually seek to  attract young talent  to perpetuate more of the same through multiple generations  as it would follow from the former paragraphs  the same degree of pompousness is carried over when given a context where a lot of rural romania lives in bleak poverty  the leadership of ifin-hh claim bold plans such as winning the nobel prize     a short moment of glory  for a short while it worked  surrounded by potential enemies and under the impeding doom of the soviet republic  a lot of the staff got heavily involved with western institutes  in particular  germany by doing political favors  organizing lavish conferences that had little to no purpose other than tourism or sex tourism  whilst germany at times lent a hand out of pity as well as other geographic interests  nevertheless  a belt was formed of fairly talented individuals that ultimately managed to escape by emigrating to other countries or have since long grown old  died or retired  given the institute's notorious reputation for espionage as well as meager or politically-motivated wages  there has been little interests amongst youngsters to seek employment and more than likely  from what i have witnessed  with good reason     employment  there is very little accountable employment going on at ifin-hh  most of institute is  family -driven and closed circuit with most of the job positions being dished out to  the right people  or  to spin a phrase   the same old good guys  being somewhat of an insider  my own employment took place more or less the same way  even though i consider myself a professional in my domain  my future boss asked me to write some interview questions down  the same questions where then passed at me during the interview such that there was no room for failure  ironically  and perhaps hilariously but not surprisingly for communist countries  my future boss awarded an interview mark less than the full mark even though i was the one to create the questions to my own interview   a lot of emphasis is set on trust issues - at first  i did not understand why  but it became clearer further on when i was requested by my employer to get meddled in fraudulent activities  although unbecoming of a public institution  ifin-hh carries a subversive attitude towards employees where most work is carried out in a non-transparent form  none of the work even remotely relates to nuclear activity nor is the opaqueness justifiable by the institute's profile but the cloak and dagger attitude  as it came much later to my attention  is meant  to cover the crass incompetence of the personnel as well as being used as leverage to perform underhand deals for various political gains   it is the case that every single minutia or details gets shoved under the carpet for no good reason  for instance  when handling a complaint from some of the staff  i forwarded the resolution and the message back to the person complaining  in order to show that work has been done and that the issue should now be resolved  i was immediately accosted by some of the employees claiming that i should not give the rest of staff too many details - even though  it was a trivial matter that would have worked to their own benefit once the claimant would have found out that their complaint had been addressed     work environment  there were a lot of underhand deals that one would hear about when talking to the lower tiers of staff  for instance a case was heard about ifin-hh awarding phds in physics to various well-placed members of the state such as the police  the gendarmerie or the fire brigade for the sake of political leverage  in other cases  there were rumors of phds being written and awarded to some members of staff that were politically well-connected such as the progeny of former members of allies of the communist securitate  one case in particular comes to mind where one of the managers had their phd written for them and awarded in sweden even though she had little clue of the subject and became a manager at ifin-hh for a department that is far away from the topic of the awarded phd  a lot of former securitate members had a  thing  for sweden and for some reason it was a place that a lot of these stasi members either sent their children or desired to emigrate to  more along the lines of the frou-frou patriotism mentioned earlier   i was offered to complete a phd in physics myself even though i have no clue  and little interest  in physics  initially i thought it was a joke and i told them that i barely know the equations of motions  let alone do a phd in physics  they told me it would all be  arranged  and that i would be awarded the degree regardless  when appearing visibly uneasy about going down that road  they told me that i should do it anyway  at least to be able to get better wages  in retrospect i could have completed a phd in physics from an institution that claims to be reputable - of course  there would have been little i could have shown for myself to back up a degree in physics  it is funny  but the same people employed at ifin-hh that heavily criticised ceausescu's wife for holding a bunch of figurative titles were also the same people that would put their wives  cousins  nephews and what not through programmes to be awarded degrees that they had no knowledge of   intuitively  the work environment was a  either you're with us or against us  sort of arrangement and on the big lines i attribute the attitude to the staff and management's inability to distinguish between life and work  just like all powers in romania are mixed up in one large conglomerate with no separation of duties  the managerial staff at ifin-hh was unable to distinguish business from pleasure  there were frequent fights such as one of the senior members of staff writing love poems to the female staff  fights in meetings between variously connected individuals on topics such as their wives cheating with each other as well as fully blown fist fights on the corridors between junior and senior staff on various topics  most of which  as i recount  the lack of professionalism to distinguish between life and work  touching on the topic  one of the bosses hired his wife to work within the same department mostly for the extra benefit of being able to delegate funds though her such that on paper he appeared with a much smaller income  one of the same spouses that went off to do a phd in nuclear physics while having only a technical school as her educational background - of course  just like my offer  a deal that would somehow be  arranged  and with the hopes of nobody calling them out   the staff had a habit of procuring various apparel via work funds that they consigned though their contract but made personal use of  exorbitantly expensive laptops comes to mind - water cooled gamer laptops that really were off the mark and context of research in physics  even though it is stooping very low now and it feels mostly embarrassing seeing a sextagenary hauling a big gamer laptop after them in a trolley  it is worth mentioning because most of the work requisites were obtained and seen by staff as  personal favours  for instance  the terminology used was  i bought you a laptop  or  i bought you a printer  instead of the work requisites being considered as the necessary apparel to carry out work  it was all one big favor  this attitude bore down starting from industrial apparel that should have been a given since they matched the work being carried out and down to very elementary things such as soap  toilet paper or bathroom requisites  employees would frequently bring such stuff from home with them because availability of said requisites hinged on the relationship that they would have with their boss  refuse to do a phd in physics  get no soap in the bathroom  stuff like that    i was told by some of the low tier staff that one of the bosses had been hoarding water cooler bottles under his table and refused to share with the rest of the staff  the staff that he was responsible for  the same person approached me and told me that he  suspects   what a word  though  one of my colleagues to be a gypsy  told me he was a little black skinned  you can imagine that given all the above i just did not know what to say  he told me that i should not talk to him much if he is a gypsy  on the other hand  this colleague was quite productive publishing some papers on nano technology and nobody ever had any issues with him such that i was not sure what to make of the event  i suppose that such events usually have to be reported and the institute did have an ethics commission as well as an union  however the recently promoted leader of the union was the one to carry the bosses suitcase up the stairs while the ethics commission frequently came to help the various head of the departments and worked mostly against the employees   the top of the cake consisted in an event involving me when one of the bosses and the union leader told me that there is a colleague working in ifin-hh that apparently had pirated material on his computer because some company complained that the software phoned home and requested from the institute that the person with the pirated material be apprehended  as a side note  you can see the dichotomy here as well  one one hand the institute claims to be  family  driven where everything can be arranged to the satisfaction of everyone while on the other hand they would readily rat out their own employees instead of shielding them from external pressure  on one hand they claim to be  unified  while on the other hand their would not even flinch to get their own people in trouble when offered political leverage  money or both  similarly for the union leader  whose alleged prime responsibility is to protect employees and not do the bidding of the bosses  who was there with us when the boss extended this request to me  i promptly refused the request to ransack a colleague's computer and told them that i do not have the necessary legal power to do such a thing and that if it is really necessary they should follow up with the police or whatever legal entity has the capability of carrying out searches and that it probably has to be done with a search warrant  i told them that it is a strange request because such complaints follow with a cease and desist order such that even in cultures that protect ip  it rarely goes as far as having to collect evidence right from the get go  they were taken aback by my refusal and the boss shrugged it off and told me that he had some money to dish out and thought i would want some money  in essence i would have been committing fraud while being paid to do so as well as  imagining  going through a colleague's laptop that might have contained family photos and god knows what that i had little to do with and would have been little business of mine to see   otherwise  there was a generalized attitude of harassment of various personnel and  as it was explained to me  the harassment was  bonus  offered to some part of the staff as compensation for the low wages  essentially  the bosses turned a blind eye to such matters paying staff in satisfaction  the satisfaction of bulling coworkers  rather than in currency     co-workers  after some of the former events i was considered  untrustworthy   more on the lines of what was recounted before and the desire to hide any minutia  such that i was excluded from most of the activities  one of the co-workers got in touch with me  probably at the request of my boss  to sniff me out and see what i am about  you just know that you met a romanian spy when the person you are talking to claims that romanians do not want to leave romania anymore  i acted a little surprised  oh  and played ball anyway to see how bad this was going to get  this guy  son of a former romanian baron  had some of the most flexible mental gymnastics in him than i ever picked up from anyone else  he was a bit like that undercover police man that comes to a party and tries to blend in but for some reason he is always a bit off that blows his cover to the entire attendants of the party but nobody tells him straight up because they just play ball and go along with it to see what his intentions are  i made sure to bad mouth my boss in every communication with him knowing fully well that he was sent by my boss  i called my boss so many names in our private correspondence that i had to look up a dictionary of swear words just to feed him all this stuff    in any case  a paranoid individual and a walking-talking meme and everything that came out of his mouth was along the lines of  see  ivan  he told me a bunch of things about how fear keeps people in check  how the masonry destroyed romania  how the russians hated romania  how the western powers destroyed romania - while listening to him it made me feel like we were angels on a pile of dung  it was the best piece of revisionist history that i had ever heard topping up with some russian princess ecaterina that did some things that  alas  i cannot remember  cared little about then and care even less now  in his view  it was that romania as some innocent victim and that there was a centralized conspiracy in destroying romania  i mostly kept my hand over my mouth while listening to most of the drivel that he hurled my way  in any case  after some weeks he confessed on how he would like to run away from romania so i guess that patriotism was not the main incentive of his little speeches  it reminded me of how soviet spies were looking to exchange currency after the berlin wall fell regardless of the generalized scare  it made me thinking that the worst enemy of romania is the truth   there is actually little to speak of about co-workers  mainly because they refused to  co-work  and perhaps the main reason was that even though they grouped up when it was beneficial other times they were mostly disjoint  every single one of them having various connections and deals that they kept to themselves and were used to justify their position    every single attempt to  co-work  was met with unfriendliness  mainly since it meant that  at least in their minds  they would have to share the prestige  money or position  competition amongst them was the run-of-the-day and a lot of them  from what i was told  would privately see the boss and demand that some of their co-workers not be placed on the same project for various reasons - a lot of the reasons  just made up lies  one of my co-workers on a project with cern went right up to the boss from my second day of employment and laid out a whole fabricated story about me that was both hilarious and mind bending to listen to given that it was a fully blown fabricated story with lots of nuances  i was even approached by one of the bosses of staff that was equally bewildered by the story and asked me not to tell him about it  i eventually did  after i resigned but i guess that cowardice comes in large doses   in one instance  i was  hired  as rent-a-coder to complete an assignment for a foreign student in the uk  i wiggled my way out of the arrangement but was told that it was not a singular case and that  just like awarding phds for political leverage  it was one characteristic of the ifin-hh institute to reel in foreign students while hinging their bets on future  arrangement  possibilities  one colleague of mine was reeled in the very same way and got hooked up with the mail order bride of his life while dealing with the ifin-hh  they tried this on me as well  but i suppose i am lucky to appear more stupid than i really am and was left to be just a witness of such  arrangements   plagiarism  in modern day romania is such a flexible term  when it suits an arrangement  it is permitted  otherwise it is used as a political tool by people that have little to do with research in order to incriminate each other   one hand washes the other  is something that is looked up to rather than looked down at and there are so many reversals that i have been witness to     infrastructure  there was an overextended debate over e-mail being read by staff members  in reality  the institute mixed research staff with support like nowhere else such that implicitly massive conflicts of interests were generated where control over mail serves was given to a part of staff that had no business and little to no formal qualification in administering the servers  for instance  the main mail server of the institute was administered by some guy with a degree in bio physics that probably picked up it as a hobby and seemed to have more interest in political gain rather than it overall  it was widespread paranoia and a lot of the staff asked around wondering whether e-mails were being read  i was questioned on this point myself and just offered up the technical background on the matter  since petty squabbles were another daily event  and given that i was personally asked to ransack someone's computer  it would not have amazed me if they did read e-mails   most of the staff used third-party e-mail services as well as bringing their own internet to work  the latter was twofold  due to the lack of transparency of the server administration  as well as a non-existing support department  as well as the incompetence of the it department to provide staff with a stable and working internet  any criticism to the computer infrastructure was met with a defense position from the it department that  in order to avoid taking responsibility  and this is an ever re-occurring theme for ifin-hh  would claim that the internet provided to staff is for work usage only and that the complainee most likely used the internet for something else and that is why their internet does not work  regardless of that  you were mostly on your own in case your work equipment was defective and most departments sought homebrew fixes to their equipment as well as hooking equipment brought from home to compensate for the lack of support   as a general overview of the network infrastructure  there was an avoid and voracious desire to bar access to various websites  the reason therefore was twofold  one one hand the institute spent a lot of money in acquiring expensive network equipment that failed to match the profile of the institute  essentially they acquired corporate equipment that is meant for small to medium businesses where employee are expected to focus on production-driven tasks that do not require  research  it goes without saying that researching a topic on the internet might take you to various areas of the internet that are either politically motivated  carry a degree of risk and so forth  nevertheless  the firewall was a block-solution that applied universally and would block both e-mail keywords or websites that were legitimate  second  it was the desire of the it staff to have employees call them and ask for various waivers for certain restrictions  there was a lot of that going on  where the it staff tended to hold a monopoly on common-good resources because in doing so made them to be  sought after  and hence  i presume  important people   for instance  i was asked to carry out experiments on a server that also held the e-mails of about 800 people  my employer could not understand that you cannot carry out experiments on servers that are in production even though i explicitly told him that the entire server might go down if we push the experiments too far  as a bio-physicist  i do not hold it to him  but it does beg the question why he was placed in charge of the department if his background and experience did not match his duties - that being said  of course  aside the insider knowledge that he was  by association  one of the former communist vips  other times  he inspired me with pity  mainly using one of the co-workers  a small step up and more enlightened  as his technical crutch because he was so clueless of the job he had to do  nevertheless  all the selections carry out where politically motivated and if someone with experience would have  in spite of the absurd  sought employment at ifin-hh  then they would have been marginalized by the rest of the staff for being too competent and inadvertently stepping on shoes   there is a lot of assignment and reassignment of personnel going on more in general in romania  shuffling of individuals from one position to the other such that it becomes diluted and unclear what their specialty is  if any at all  a late monument of a non-specialized society where people are hired by the numbers and not by the qualifications or area of expertise  i have been once told by a policeman that i am probably the right person to know how to hook up a soundcard which is akin to putting a dj in charge of pyrotechnics and then wondering why the result is a bad outcome     cultural diversity and inclusion  to borrow a quote  speaking of such matters at ifin-hh is like wiping your behind with silk  there have been some checkups performed while i was there  mostly from the government  bu the checkups are pre-arranged such that whenever government dignitaries visit they are usually taken around by the shoulders  or waist  and lead down a pre-arrange path so they get to enjoy themselves and report to their superiors that everything within the institute is just hunkey dorey  in fact  right after a colleague threatened to sue to institute for misconduct and a large debacle on the subject too place  some government official came to one of the main meetings and expressed her satisfaction  non-ironically  i presume  i really don't know anymore  and stated how she likes that we all get along so well  otherwise  as previously recounted  while the senior management staff drafts poems to female employees  matters of sexual harassment within the institute are met with laughter from the immature co-workers and staff  it was thrown at us  by one of the co-workers and also a government official   that if we spot a case of sexual harassment that we are free to report it which was taken for granted and met with chuckles from the rest of staff  i presume  partially since such things are way too fine for the brash attitude of the management staff and because such things go on but for various political reasons never see the day of light  similarly  topics such as data privacy are also too fine for a society that has long missed its train to civilization   although not the only case  one co-worker attempted suicide by jumping out of a second story building and luckily just broke a leg in doing so  an event that was rapidly covered up and the blame shoved onto the victim  his parents are still seeking retribution via lawyers for what had been done to their son but given that the institute is well entwined with the police and the jeandarmerie it goes without saying that such events are easily covered up under duress and threats extended to the individual in question as well as their families  to cite a co-worker and to summarize    they do things  at ifin-hh  that even the mafia does not do  in another case  a lady was harassed so much by co-workers  downright to calling her names  making up stories about her that she cracked under the pressure and got so paranoid that she thought the institute is trying to poison her  another matter to laugh at  from the point of view of the institute and co-workers  no doubt    cultural diversity  stops at the point where you know that there is barely any foreign staff employed at the institute  personally it stopped for me once one of the bosses mentioned that one of my co-workers was  under suspicion of being a gypsy  otherwise  the occasional student is reeled in provided that they also are accompanied by funds     the eli debacle  a societal perspective   just like dropping a coca-cola bottle over a pre-industrial society the eli project became an object of discontent due to disproportionate wages and cargo-pretige that was associated with the institute  the bottom line is that the working at eli-np became the object of veneration for people from low income backgrounds and thus sparked a lot of infighting between the various cliques that ifin-hh harbors in general  just like kids use to drive expensive cars through a hoodlum  eli-np was seen by many as an opportunity to raise their standard and flaunt their values to others that have been less fortunate  it was trivially clear that romania was not up to standard to be able to harbor such an endeavor  just by noticing the large income discrepancy between the common folk and those that would have worked for eli  it degraded to a bit of clown-endeavor where the general population had trouble getting tap water by contrast to the bold statements of the organizers promising nothing less but utmost excellence  there have been words and figures published in the media that were ripped out of an 60s sci-fi novels  involving suspended railways  lavish fountains  highways  tennis and golf courts and the likes  all of which  of course  right next to the piling up garbage that is unable to be picked up somehow  a bold statement  no doubt  for a country that barely has any highways   nevertheless  the authorities and various rag-tag branches of government bought into this elusive dream  so much that  from what i am told by first-hand witnesses  the government or affiliates went as far as to harass people that spoke against eli and extend death threats and the likes to silence any opposition  i was told by one of the co-workers how their family started getting calls during the night  police checking up on them from time to time and all sort of oddities going on since they started opposing the project  given the above  the behaviour of the government is no less than pitiful but given the context  it seems to be well explained for a country that lacks any shred of dignity  extrapolating  but on good grounds and first hand experience  given that ifin-hh acts so unprofessionally  there is grounds and reason to doubt that other institutions of the government are not much better off   as could be predicted  nothing of that ephemeral dream came to pass  there have been no suspended highways or railways built  there are no golf courts  the garbage and stray dogs are just piling up and ultimately romania has been excluded from eu funds  the initial agreement has been that the eu would find the construction up to a given year  at which the economic burden would shift from the eu to romania - and  well  if you cannot pickup garbage then you probably cannot fund such a large project  in what regards eu funding  one of the main reason of disagreement has been the use of such funds  it was expected by the eu that by funding the eli-np project  the management would hire local or domestic  expanding to the eu  businesses in order to raise the level within romania and the eu  nevertheless  the management used the funds to employ overseas companies from the us or china which did not go well with the plan to infuse romania  or the eu for that matter  with funds  such projects  even from the construction perspective itself  reach into the billions such that it is understandable that disagreements would have arisen     in closing  one of the last memories i have was stepping inside an office with one of the local kingpins of the institute that was in the middle of an inner political fight with one of the other old-new kingpin guys over a position of power within the institute  since repetition makes the pattern  he was concerned about the it department reading e-mails and asked me if i know anything about that  short of rolling my eyes  i provided the technical background and stated clearly that i was a persona non-grata already such that it would be highly unlikely that i would be given access to key mail servers that were well under the control of other political figures  what struck me though  with a modicum of awe  was how he mention that if he could  he would run as far away as possible - he called it  defecting  which was a weird word to use provided that we were still talking about a research institute and not a spy agency  i remember i stumbled out of the door and made plans to leave the institute at the earliest of opportunities whilst also coming myself under cross-fire of various political rivalry   defecting   it is my conclusion as well as my own personal opinion  just like the rest of this document  that ifin-hh is a cesspool of mixed-up services wrought with inner political wrangling and is very far away from being a research institute  i somewhat regret seeing some younger blood around there  thinking how eventually they will end up disappointed being perhaps naive in thinking that ifin-hh or eli  for that matter  has any future in romania  whenever heads of departments talked about attracting youngsters  i thought in my mind  better not since romania is barely able to provide even the basic of necessities to its citizens lest contribute in any shape or form to research or bring grandiose plans to completion  the mix of politics  involvement of security services  a seething government chasing wet dreams way above their pay grade and the country's networth  employees with multiple citizenships seeking to  defect  shady individuals with revisionist and crypto-communist attitudes  and the ever looming piles of garbage just growing and growing makes ifin-hh a toxic workplace environment and dangerous place to work for and should be everyone's last choice rather than the first

964,What job did you have that taught you how broken the system is?,as the title says    the job that taught me the bullshit of the broken system was my time as a production designer artist   it was my first job out of college   before i finished school   it required really fast drawing skills in adobe ai  fast design decision making  and much attention to detail  our jobs basically required us to create designs for products  coins  pins  patches and so on  all the spec to be produced  infinite customer revisions  and the customer didn't pay a dime til they bought the product  so they could literally just keep sending stuff in for years and never buy    as i worked there for roughly 3-4 years i quickly took notice to this cluster fuck job  the pay was awful  15-20 hr  no benefits time off sick days of any kind  super vague noncompete of two years   the company was set up like this  big boss has many small companies all doing the same thing  all staffed low to avoid benefits  each company was  ran  by a family member   friend  profit was split 50 50 with them and the big boss   this literally paid them out   after taxes    400k a year  and they did next to nothing  bare basic customer service work  customers just emailed us  they boss would print out the email  hand it to us  we did all the work  then they just priced it out   replied to a few basic questions  and took the order  that's it  and they got a 50  commission on the order  i got  15 for my work  and they got all the profit   orders ranged from  250- 15k    i did the math while working one day  if i made a shit commission of 5-10  off my work  if every order was  250  my pay would have increased over  90k a year  vs the  24k a year i was getting    rent for a studio apartment is like  1400    my suite had 3 people getting  400k  a year  another guy getting  200k  and another at  90k  the other 15 artist were being paid  15 hr   we all sat in the same windowless room  so we overheard these fucks constantly talking about spending their money  they all had  200k sports cars  one guy literally paid for his exes rent   i quit a year later  just walked out and never looked back   they had to hire roughly 4 people to cover my basic workload ,o4lqmu

968,About one young man apparently handed a sinecure who nonetheless found himself unable to handle the situation [Bullshit Jobs by David Graeber],  about one young man apparently handed a sinecure who nonetheless found himself unable to handle the situation   i will begin with a story  the following is the tale of a young man named eric  whose first experience of the world of work was of a job that proved absolutely  even comically  pointless    gt eric  i ve had many  many awful jobs  but the one that was undoubtedly pure  liquid bullshit was my first  professional job  postgraduation  a dozen years ago  i was the first in my family to attend university  and due to a profound na vet  about the purpose of higher education  i somehow expected that it would open up vistas of hitherto-unforeseen opportunity    instead  it offered graduate training schemes at pricewaterhousecoopers  kpmg  etc  i preferred to sit on the dole for six months using my graduate library privileges to read french and russian novels before the dole forced me to attend an interview which  sadly  led to a job    that job involved working for a large design firm as its  interface administrator  the interface was a content management system an intranet with a graphical user interface  basically designed to enable this company s work to be shared across its seven offices around the uk   eric soon discovered that he was hired only because of a communication problem in the organization  in other words  he was a duct taper  the entire computer system was necessary only because the partners were unable to pick up the phone and coordinate with one another    gt eric  the firm was a partnership  with each office managed by one partner  all of them seem to have attended one of three private schools and the same design school  the royal college of art  being unbelievably competitive fortysomething public schoolboys  they often tried to outcompete one another to win bids  and on more than one occasion  two different offices had found themselves arriving at the same client s office to pitch work and having to hastily combine their bids in the parking lot of some dismal business park  the interface was designed to make the company supercollaborative  across all of its offices  to ensure that this  and other myriad fuckups  didn t happen again  and my job was to help develop it  run it  and sell it to the staff   the problem was  it soon became apparent that eric wasn t even really a duct taper  he was a box ticker  one partner had insisted on the project  and  rather than argue with him  the others pretended to agree  then they did everything in their power to make sure it didn t work    gt eric  i should have realized that this was one partner s idea that no one else actually wanted to implement  why else would they be paying a twenty-one-year-old history graduate with no it experience to do this  they d bought the cheapest software they could find  from a bunch of absolute crooks  so it was buggy  prone to crashing  and looked like a windows 3 1 screen saver  the entire workforce was paranoid that it was designed to monitor their productivity  record their keystrokes  or flag that they were torrenting porn on the company internet  and so they wanted nothing to do with it  as i had absolutely no background in coding or software development  there was very little i could do to improve the thing  so i was basically tasked with selling and managing a badly functioning  unwanted turd  after a few months  i realized that there was very little for me to do at all most days  aside from answer a few queries from confused designers wanting to know how to upload a file  or search for someone s email on the address book   the utter pointlessness of his situation soon led to subtle and then  increasingly unsubtle acts of rebellion    gt eric  i started arriving late and leaving early  i extended the company policy of  a pint on friday lunchtime  into  pints every lunchtime  i read novels at my desk  i went out for lunchtime walks that lasted three hours  i almost perfected my french reading ability  sitting with my shoes off with a copy of  le monde  and a petit robert  i tried to quit  and my boss offered me a  2 600 raise  which i reluctantly accepted  they needed me precisely because i didn t have the skills to implement something that they didn t want to implement  and they were willing to pay to keep me   perhaps one could paraphrase marx s  economic and philosophical manuscripts of 1844  here  to forestall their fears of alienation from their own labor  they had to sacrifice me up to a greater alienation from potential human growth   as time went on  eric became more and more flagrant in his defiance  hoping he could find something he could do that might actually cause him to be fired  he started showing up to work drunk and taking paid  business trips  for nonexistent meetings    gt eric  a colleague from the edinburgh office  to whom i had poured out my woes when drunk at the annual general meeting  started to arrange phony meetings with me  once on a golf course near gleneagles  me hacking at the turf in borrowed golf shoes two sizes too large  after getting away with that  i started arranging fictional meetings with people in the london office  the firm would put me up in a nicotine-coated room in the st  athans in bloomsbury  and i would meet old london friends for some good old-fashioned all-day drinking in soho pubs  which often turned into all-night drinking in shoreditch  more than once  i returned to my office the following monday in last wednesday s work shirt  i d long since stopped shaving  and by this point  my hair looked like it was robbed from a zeppelin roadie  i tried on two more occasions to quit  but both times my boss offered me more cash  by the end  i was being paid a stupid sum for a job that  at most  involved me answering the phone twice a day  i eventually broke down on the platform of bristol temple meads train station one late summer s afternoon  i d always fancied seeing bristol  and so i decided to  visit  the bristol office to look at  user take-up  i actually spent three days taking mdma at an anarcho-syndicalist house party in st  pauls  and the dissociative comedown made me realize how profoundly upsetting it was to live in a state of utter purposelessness   after heroic efforts  eric did finally manage to get himself replaced    gt eric  eventually  responding to pressure  my boss hired a junior fresh out of a computer science degree to see if some improvements could be made to our graphical user interface  on this kid s first day at work  i wrote him a list of what needed to be done and then immediately wrote my resignation letter  which i posted under my boss s door when he took his next vacation  surrendering my last paycheck over the telephone in lieu of the statutory notice period  i flew that same week to morocco to do very little in the coastal town of essaouira  when i came back  i spent the next six months living in a squat  growing my own vegetables on three acres of land  i read your  strike  piece when it first came out  it might have been a revelation for some that capitalism creates unnecessary jobs in order for the wheels to merely keep on turning  but it wasn t to me   the remarkable thing about this story is that many would consider eric s a dream job  he was being paid good money to do nothing  he was also almost completely unsupervised  he was given respect and every opportunity to game the system  yet despite all that  it gradually destroyed him   why   to a large degree  i think  this is really a story about social class  eric was a young man from a working-class background a child of factory workers  no less fresh out of college and full of expectations  suddenly confronted with a jolting introduction to the  real world  reality  in this instance  consisted of the fact that  a  while middle-aged executives can be counted on to simply assume that any twentysomething white male will be at least something of a computer whiz  even if  as in this case  he had no computer training of any kind  and  b  might even grant someone like eric a cushy situation if it suited their momentary purposes   c  they basically saw him as something of a joke  which his job almost literally was  his presence in the company was very close to a practical joke some designers were playing on one another   even more  what drove eric crazy was the fact there was simply no way he could construe his job as serving any sort of purpose  he couldn t even tell himself he was doing it to feed his family  he didn t have one yet  coming from a background where most people took pride in making  maintaining  and fixing things  or anyway felt that was the sort of thing people  should  take pride in  he had assumed that going to university and moving into the professional world would mean doing the same sorts of thing on a grander  even more meaningful  scale  instead  he ended up getting hired precisely for what he  wasn t  able to do  he tried to just resign  they kept offering him more money  he tried to get himself fired  they wouldn t fire him  he tried to rub their faces in it  to make himself a parody of what they seemed to think he was  it didn t make the slightest bit of difference   to get a sense of what was really happening here  let us imagine a second history major we can refer to him as anti-eric a young man of a professional background but placed in exactly the same situation  how might anti-eric have behaved differently  well  likely as not  he would have played along with the charade  instead of using phony business trips to practice forms of self-annihilation  anti-eric would have used them to accumulate social capital  connections that would eventually allow him to move on to better things  he would have treated the job as a stepping-stone  and this very project of professional advancement would have given him a sense of purpose  but such attitudes and dispositions don t come naturally  children from professional backgrounds are taught to think like that from an early age  eric  who had not been trained to act and think this way  couldn t bring himself to do it  as a result  he ended up  for a time  at least  in a squat growing tomatoes 67 https theanarchistlibrary org library david-graeber-bullshit-jobs fn67    read the full book here https theanarchistlibrary org library

977,Interesting Lie Told to me by a Mass Chain Coffee Shop Employee,my fave drink is currently  temporarily discontinued  at a certain coffee shop i'm sure you all know    the guys that work there  where i've been buying this drink for a long time  said to me one day  ''bad news  there's not going to be any more coming in for a few weeks   i said   nooooooo  but wait  why   the guys said it was due to  covid  that there aren't gonna be any deliveries for a few weeks  which is kinda weird  considering there were no problems during the past year  so i asked for another excuse  they told me that they might be changing the recipes  then they said they ran out of certain products    come on  seriously  who actually doesn't believe this has 100  to do with the fact they probably don't have people there to manufacture this crap  and probably don't have any truck drivers available to deliver this shit to stores in certain regions    meanwhile this chain has produced commercials to be played non-stop specifically advertising all the cool  refreshing drinks they are out of for probably the majority of summer    go into one of these shops  and try asking them why they're out of half their menu  you'll either get one of the excuses i got  or maybe some new ones  i also find it sad  i think all these employees actually buy this shit they're being fed by management  lame ass excuses to cover up the fact nobody wants to work for their company  either    i'm seeing people posting pictures of completely empty aisles in stores like target  wal-mart  grocery stores  it's a bit scary  but at the same time i kinda feel good about it  we all know that many people in this country have had it and an actual effort is being made to turn the tables on employers  and as a result  there is literally no stock in retail stores  coffee shops have no fucking coffee  restaurants are closing half the week  or totally    i've been acting pretty lackadaisical on the job  and simply don't care who doesn't like it - after all  i'm one of the only people they still have in there  and it feels good to have so much less stress  so much more freedom  to call the shots in my own life  i hope it's a trend that gets bigger    maybe i'll even get a raise for it ,o3zto6

982,What does antiwork think about fluoride?,fluoride theories have always been shut down by everyone around me as a crazy conspiracy  but i have done research papers about fluoride in my neuroscience classes and found good evidence that it floods your brain cells and makes them perform improperly  it's not exactly understood what the overall impact is on us  but it's definitely not good the way it effects our brain cells  it is classified as a neurotoxin in many parts of the world   i know people will claim that it's natural and we used to get it from spring water  that is true  but the fluoride in our tooth paste and drinking water is synthetic  it's not the same  also  it's difficult to control how much fluoride you consume because it's just put in the water without your consent    people claim that fluoride makes us more docile and more susceptible to influence and persuasion  i saw a post on here today talking about how he feels like everyone looks at him crazy when he talks antiwork  do you think that fluoride theories have any legitimacy or are they are all nonsense  crazy  lunatic  conspiracies  is it a good thing that we have no choice but to drink fluoride and have no control over how much   i remember years ago i saw a bunch of news stations warning about not using fluoride  they were talking about how fluoride free toothpastes were the best sellers on amazon  the whole  fluoride is good for your teeth  is about as valid as  milk is good for strong bones  they're just lies told to us by lobbyist to sell their products  but that's just my opinion  what's yours ,o4kvpk

Now I see that it is the key to a genuinely free and fair market.,i still don t support  15 hr minimum wage  or any minimum wage for that matter  but ubi  imo has been now experimented in the usa for over a year  unemployment via covid  and it s done what minimum wage never could  given people the freedom to choose   with ubi  every human being in the country would have a choice between employers  businesses usually think of competition as between other businesses only which means maximize profits at all costs   but ubi introduces a new kind of competition  competition for employees  no matter how menial or  unskilled  the labor you need is  you re forced to compete with ubi to offer compensation  which means you may need to reassess your business model    imagine being able to tell an employer that  15 hr is garbage for what they want when you could  earn   13 hr by sitting on your butt or doing whatever you want   in short  it s an unexplored  avenue for ensuring a more free and equal opportunity market and the businesses that adapt will succeed and those who don t will fail and they ll go down kicking and screaming about how it  isn t fair  that they can t hire legal slaves anymore ,o3zzi5
984,Is work making it impossible for anyone else to have a love life?,i can't make a relationship last because my schedule and my partner's schedule make it nearly impossible to spend time together for weeks at a time  9 to 5 jobs are impossible to find around here  and often when we have time we have family obligations or housework to catch up on so we can't go on a date then either  and by that time the relationship goes stale  how is anybody supposed to have a love life ,o4d04a

1087,Companies need to be taxed where they earned the money.,i saw a post on here from somehow wondering if it's possible to put a cap on net worth   i just wanted to put out here that companies hide a lot of money in letter box companies in countries like hong kong  switzerland  panama    the reason why is company tax laws  companies are taxed where their fiscal seat is  this is the place of registration or where the  letter box  is  a lot of chains just have an address on some slumpy building in hong kong    taxes are much lower there  which is why they want to be taxed there and not here in the west    if we truely want to tax the rich  we need to change company law  this will lead to a lot of chain stores quiting though  but that's ok  since multinationals took a lot of job  less multinationals means more jobs  small businesses pay fair taxes and try to get by with some  black money  which is usually tolerated    but still sad to see my dad  who earns like 36 000 euros per year  pay more taxes in euros than that bezos piece of shit has ever done ,o3gyde

1090,"Trolled my rich boss, rather quit than go full time",so i actually trolled my boss  i was doing some legal work for a real estate firm  he was a rich cynical annoying masserati driving x'er  but he appreciated my top knowledge of real estate law  i was working part time  when the rona happened  not much was being sold so he asked me if i wanted to be a building manager instead  i knew there is a shortage of building managers because it's long nights and fairly average pay  average is 1600 net and cleaning ladies make 1500  the conversation went like this   - i took this job because it's part time  - why don't you want to work full time  - because it doesn't fit with my other activities - why not  - i do freelance work - oh - i told you when you hired me - you know  it's kinda fun work you know  i know it's long nights  but sometimes you see some interesting personalities during these meetings -  i was thinking wtf then you do it yourself  i already said no  i don't give a rats ass about appartments and the complaining people there  - if you can't be building manager i'm gonna have to let you go because there's no work to do during the rona - alright   me secretly happy looking forward to a couple of months of freedom   i didn't really work as a freelancer  i just really wanted out  i hate men who try to push or trick me into a job that clearly sucks monkeyballs and is payed like a cleaning lady  their other building manager had told me she was on the verge of depression  no thank you lol  good luck finding someone  rich asshole ,o304ay

1123,Just sharing that I quit my job and some of my own perspective on working.,i quit my contractor job paying  20 hour  this rate may seem pretty good for some of you  but i live in a major city and the the taxes on contract work is crazy high  i basically make a few dollars more than a mcdonald's worker where i live  previously  i was making  32 hour as a web developer  but that job burnt me out so bad and the commute was a 3 hour total every day  which was why i pivoted my career and starting working from home with my contractor job  basically  i had decent paying jobs throughout my life and comfortable environment  i had the privilege of not having to suffer at a amazon facility and peeing in a bottle with no breaks  or flipping burgers and having crazy people throw nuggets at me  yet  i am still on this sub-reddit because i think something is not right with working the way we do   for some background  i am not white or living in the suburbs  i am a brown asian whos parents fled here from a third-world country and i grew up in a gang infested neighborhood  i busted my ass to get myself in the corporate world and it fucking sucks  ever since i started working  there is no time for creativity  art  or working on your own projects or living your life  you are not free  you are a corporate slave  this is not a life any of us wants to live  my biggest accomplishments in life happened when i was unemployed and had mental time to think freely and make things   amp x200b   some of my accomplishments when i was unemployed    - wrote a javascript tutorial article which blew up to monthly thousands of views for some time    - went to new york on my own savings after i quit my previous job and wrote an article about my experience which also blew up and gained thousands of views    - got super fit and was the top post on  r brogress for a few weeks when i posted my before and after pics    - i made a few youtube videos on web development which broke above 1 000 views each consistently whenever i uploaded    - i made electronic music and shared them on the internet with positive feedback    - i was able to breathe and get 8-10 hours of sleep everyday   unfortunately  my savings did run out and i had to get another job  which is the one i am currently working until my last day next week   none of these accomplishments would have been possible if i never quit the jobs i held and i was employed  there is simply no time for these things  most of these accomplishments happened during odd hours like 3-5am because my mind gets creative at odd hours  i uploaded videos  wrote articles  made music  and created posts always after 12am midnight  when i'm employed  my brain becomes mush and i just become  demotivated and it feels like i'm on a drug that just numbs my whole life down like a creative person that jumps on ritalin or something  on top of this  it is impossible for me to pretend like i care about a company  so many people at work act as if the company is their life and then weeks later they vanish either from being fired or they just jump ship and go to another company  it's all fake and i'm not a great actor  i'm never a culture fit at my jobs  i'm just the quiet dude that gets work done  hopefully  one day  we all find a way to get our bills paid for without having to slave away our time  it's possible  we just have to find our own path to get there ,o2gv18

1128,worker co-ops doesn't fix any issue with capitalism,the issue with the capitalistic system is not really companies taking advantage of workers  the issue is special interest groups and corporation getting benefits for themselves at the expense of the larger society    the worker co-op model is problematic since then the people building up the company will not have proper ownership over it  the people who build up the company will not really be rewarded for it  https vintologi com threads finance 890 post-5297 https vintologi com threads finance 890 post-5297   getting stock ownership when working on a company can work out very well  see  facebook  but often it will not work out too well since most startups fail    being a part-owner in the company you work for exposes yourself to double risk since then if they company fail you both lose a big chunk of your savings and your job  furthermore often the owners of a company have to keep eating up losses hoping it will eventually become profitable ,o2l1u6

1195,Honest Review of my old McDonalds job,appreciate the downvotes  good to know people support corporations treating employees like slaves  i posted this to indeed by the way    i worked at mcdonald's for a month before i voluntarily quit over the phone  the training was very barebones  they had you sit infront of a very old and dilapidated pc and made you go through basic legalese osha stuff  as well as very basic rudimentary ways of operating the equipment  i should have took this as a sign to leave earlier   no overtime  they choose your hours  and you can't even take a photo of the schedule  you have to call and ask what time you come in  you will be overworked and underpaid   the real training they had you do was non-existent  because there was no real training  you are literally dropped right into the heat of battle  mostly clueless  and guided by another employee who isn't even a trainer  just another long time employee there  all they do is demonstrate how to do the tasks a couple times  then they expect you do mimick that perfectly  then they get mad if you mess up or ask for details  the person training me barely spoke english so there was a huge language barrier and i couldn't even ask a question   the term  crew member  is vague  as depending on the day  they'll have you either doing 1 thing or literally everything  drive thru  cashier  grill  etc  given the option of either cashier or grill at the time i applied  the existing employees there saw i was new and immediately used that to assign me as the person to operate the grill  and putting the food in the holding cabinets  which is the dirtiest  hardest and fastest-paced part of the job  some days its very slow  and other days you just cannot keep up  everyone else got to do the easier work while they shirked the harder responsibilities onto me  i was the only employee out of all of them to be forced to take out the trash and clean the floors grill grease trough as well  sometimes if someone more experienced is not there that day  you have to take their place  ie  putting together the sandwiches and wrapping them up  on top of the work i already have to do i explained earlier   in my particular case because of the work i was assigned  i had to walk in and out of the walk in freezer a lot  and sometimes you will have to take out several heavy boxes at once and be in there for extended periods  and despite that  theres no point in putting a layer on to warm up  because as soon as you walk out of the freezer  the rest of the floor is staggeringly hot from the heat being output from the grills   management has no respect  or value for their employees in the slightest bit   if you look new  naive or like a pushover  they will take advantage and you will be treated like a slave  several times there have been situations where one manager will tell me to do one thing  then as i am doing that thing  another manager will ask me do do another thing while i am already in the middle of doing the first thing  then the other manager will tell me to do another thing  until you get to the point where you forget the first task you were supposed to do   you get 2 10 minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch which is never enough time  sometimes you'll be standing hours on end and your feet will be sore  sometimes you will be lifting for hours on end  every day was different and unpredictable and i dreaded going every time   overall  i outright felt like a slave working there  and nobody should have to put up with what i put up with  please have dignity  please have self-respect   do not work here  this job impacted my mental health greatly and has forever tainted my perception of what an actual good job should be ,o2a8k7

1210,Work won yesterday (again),i work from home full time currently and have done for the last year or so  i woke up yesterday at my normal time having had an horrendous dream where i witnessed something very traumatic  my alarm woke me up before what happened in my dream was resolved so i was very disoriented when i woke up and actually in some distress  crying at what i'd seen and so shaken i went to the toilet and was retching for about five minutes  i won't go into detail about the dream  it's not ptsd as what happened didn't happen and can't happen now in reality  i considered taking a sick day but knew i had a couple of meetings i needed to attend and some work i was supposed to catch up on due to us being very short staffed  like a fool i logged in but struggled to concentrate during the first few hours so didn't get much done  i attended the meetings as normal and barely contributed  all i could think about was  why the fuck have i worked today  it got to around the time i go for lunch and i received an email advising i had been unsuccessful in a job application for an internal vacancy in another department  i was still shaken so it barely registered   when i went for a walk at lunch to clear my head  i realised i'd been an utter fool  realising i can't control what i can't influence and i've been stupid worrying about the impact that missing one day of work would have on my workload  i shouldn't have much to complaint about  i'm reasonably fit and healthy and in a job i actually find interesting but should pay better  the job application was only really for doing a similar role with a bit more responsibility for more money  it's not what i want to do long-term  which is teaching  so i wasn't really disappointed about not getting it  my problem is self inflicted  i'm pushing myself hard for work - i've used one years leave allowance over almost two years  but work couldn't care less about me  i'm just another person with a staff number  i live on my own so have been almost ever present online during covid and work know i'll just get on with whatever i'm given   no more  i'm taking leave and when i come back i'm no longer taking extra cases or volunteering for projects to help out  i'm making the most of flexible working and building in a couple of hour long breaks in the day with a workout rather than working long days to 'get stuff done' and building up flexitime to not use for months on end   my 'work' will be working on me ,o2f8vj

1221,There's a system in Germany wherein employees have the right thru the works constitution act to elect fellow employees into a works council that has right of co-determination in a bunch of matters. Sad that this doesn't exist pretty much anywhere else in this format.,in germany  co-determination at establishment  corporate  level refers to the representation of employees of one company in relation to their employer  the employee representatives  who are elected by the staff  have participation and co-determination rights in the employer's decisions  forms of co-determination at establishment level include    rights to information     rights to be consulted     rights to give advice     rights of veto     rights of initiative  and    co-determination rights   german employee representatives participate in decision-making  to-determination at corporate level is a comparatively powerful instrument in the possession of the elected employee representatives because the employer and the employee representatives have the right to decide at equal level within the  statutory limits  so-called principle of positive consensus   a decision taken by the employer without the compulsory participation of employee representatives  for example  may be legally ineffective and  hence  incapable of effectively shaping the legal relationship with the employees  so-called theory of conditional effectiveness  according to which the effectiveness of any measures taken by the employer is conditional upon the  implementation of co-determination rights   in an extreme case  the employee representatives could in fact paralyze a business unit in germany  e g  by objections to the work  schedule prepared by the employer  ,o2smaj

1250,I am very lost right now,bit of context  i ve been depressed for a year or 2 now  during that time  i ve radically changed my way of thinking  and i m becoming increasingly interested in the concept of simple living    i m in my early 20s  and can honestly say i have absolutely no dream job  or even a job i m remotely interested in  i feel like society has its ways of convincing people that everybody has a dream job  and that when you ve found it  you ll  never work a day in your life  i m not buying it  in an ideal world  i won t work  because it s just not something that energises me  in fact  i get exhausted very quickly  and just thinking about having to work every day for the next 40 years stresses me out    instead of working  i would love to spend every day doing something i love  walk around nature  write stuff  and live far away from any major city  so i can finally breathe and escape the overwhelm  i just hate the fact that that s practically impossible  because i am not financially independent yet  i ve come to a point where my depression is getting worse  because i don t feel like living in this world  where you have to work just to survive  aren t we supposed to do something we love  right now  i believe that i ll either be happy when i m doing something i really love  or if i m not working at all    in my opinion  i m stuck in a vicious cycle  where i want to enjoy the little things in life  and not spend the rest of my life stressed because i have to work  simply to survive  however  that won t be possible until i become financially stable  which won t happen until i ve accepted that i ll settle for a crappy job which will make me miserable    i m so lost  is there anyone who has similar thoughts and can give me some advice  i really don t know what to do or what to think right now ,o1xx9v

1277,Guilt over 2 weeks: what is wrong with me?,let me start this off with saying that it is mainly the clients and understaffing  but otherwise i really enjoy my workplace and coworkers  but this job is draining me is so many ways  i am at the point where i lose sleep to the anxiety i have with this job   this is an it company and i am the help desk dispatcher  i am highly praised and i feel like i really was foundational for the team  i've been here for less than a year but i not only coordinate technician appointments  their communication  large scale projects  technician client questions or concerns as well as ticket input management manually  my responsibilities grew because a majority of my peers will not handle these responsibilities    the manager for the team does not manage the team at all  he just advises on their ticket and that's if i put these issues directly in front of him  morning meetings are buddy sessions and otherwise  he is handling lvl 1 techs because he doesn't have the spine to demand more employees  i've been demanding for our superiors to get more employees  further management but because they are all buddies  nothing is done  similar aspects for the project manager   i honestly like them all as individuals and i had been communicating for months all of the shortcomings of my team but it doesnt go anywhere  only recently has it started gaining traction  our clients walk all over us with their demands and my already understaffed technician team can not only keep up but then put their frustrations on to me  finally i've put in my two weeks and now everyone is upset with me  i want to cry because of how frustrating this situation is but because the ceo  far removed from the real labor and work my team puts in  has prioritized growing this company and profits    i know internally that i shouldn't feel guilty  i need to prioritize my mental health and wellbeing but i still feel like somehow i made a mistake  i know i want to go but i feel so guilty i'm thinking of recanting my 2 weeks  i have savings for a few months but my family did chastise me for not jumping into another job immedietly    i would appreciate any wake up calls and positive words from others who have learned to shake off the work guilt  thank you for going through this rant with me as well  already feeling better just stating this all out ,o1bpop

1281,I’m not a slave to my debt,i went to grad school almost 10 years ago and i have six figure debt  i don t want to sacrifice my life at work and kill myself to pay off this debt    i feel like i m the only one among friends  acquaintances  and others in my field that is not living to pay off student loan debt and thus not letting this stupid number define me   that stupid number on a screen doesn t mean anything to me  it s not real  i don t get why that intangible number dictates people s lives in such a strong way   one of my friends is proud of the fact that she works a full time job and has a weekend per diem job to make more money  she has worked 14 days in a row before  no thanks  she s way closer in paying off her loans than i am  but idfaf  a single fuck  like i said  it doesn t mean anything to me   i don t know if this is naive of me  but i feel like i m watching all the people mentioned above on a conveyor belt to work their life away just to get rid of that number   does anyone else think similarly to me in this regard  is anyone else not willing to be a slave to work just to erase a number in 30 years time that at the end of it all no one thinks to themselves on their death bed   man  i m glad i worked so many hours to pay off my loans ,o1om20

1293,My desk job is slowly destroying my soul (and my body),i ve been working a sedentary desk job for three years this august  i worked retail before this job for 2 5 years  and while i had some issues with lower leg pain from standing stationary for several hours a day  it s nothing compared to this job    when we were still in the office  i experienced migraines  headaches  and eye strain on an almost daily basis  it was a combination of staring at a bright computer screen along with the ugly unflattering fluorescent strip lights  then we were sent to work from home because of covid and because it was unexpected  i had to do a makeshift setup at my dining room table  it worked okay for a couple months and then i started to experience lower back pain to the point where it was difficult to walk without a limp  i switched out the dining room chair for an office chair and it improved a bit   by that point my roommate had moved out  so i was able to make her old bedroom into my  office space  was able to get a legit desk and make the set up a little more comfortable  again for a while i felt a bit better  but fast forward one year  the headaches improved because i could keep my house darker than the office    i am now having some sort of neck or back pain on a daily basis  i get headaches and migraines and eye strain almost constantly  i feel much better on the weekends and it comes back almost immediately on monday morning  i gained a ton of weight last year but so far this year i m down 15 lbs    things i am doing to try and alleviate it  again adjusted my set up so it s perfectly ergonomic according to articles online  wear a posture harness thing to make sure i don t slouch  wear blue light blocking glasses  i don t wear glasses normally so it hurts my ears  and getting up from my desk once an hour to stretch and walk around  i m on the phone for 9 hours a day and the headset hurts my ears and the constant audio exacerbates the headaches    i ve been sitting at my desk for less than an hour this morning and i m already nauseous from a brewing migraine    we re simply not built to sit or do any sort of highly repetitive movements for 40  hours a week  we re meant to be doing a variety of activities each day  after 3 years of working this job i m at the point where i almost can t physically do it anymore and i m only in my mid-20s  i m looking into jobs that are a mixture of sedentary and physical work so i can get a variety of movement into my day but it s hard ,o1w77m

1346,"Rate of pay shouldn't just be about ""skill level.""",rate of pay should take into consideration the amount of stress that workers take on  this should be based on social factors in regards to customer interactions and interpersonal relationships between coworkers  i'm more so thinking of customer interactions as they can be far more stressful and labor inducing than that of dealing with coworkers   the higher up you go in a job setting  the less work those people have to actually do  those jobs are to mainly check that the work the people below them is correct  they often time get upset if they find an error and spend more time reprimanding a mistake that doesn't usually occur than just fixing it  it takes away from their free time of sitting around and talking to other people on their level about non-work stuff   anyone can learn a set of skills  some sets are bigger and some sets take longer to learn  however  there is a skill of learning to deal with social factors which is neglected and should be part of pay consideration ,o1sl10

1401,Reduction in work hours leads to MORE productivity,i actually hate this sentiment  it completely misses the point  what if reducing work hours and increasing pay actually leads to less profit  less productivity    the entire premise of reducing work hours to increase productivity  or 'having better well being of workers'  for the sake of  better productivity completely misses the point  we have to stop catering to these shit corporations and demand our rights   what if i take a vacation  and i don't come back 're-energized to take on more work' i come back the same  does that mean there's no case for giving vacations  of course there's no case for the corporations  that's why we need a strong labor movement  this isn't about their profit  it's about the workers   also fuck all those happiness psychologists who are trying to work with corporations to 'improve well being because it'll increase profit'  they're a part of the problem    alright i'm done ,o0pxu8

1452,Extreme burnout but can't put in two weeks until July 17th,i just need to vent  i've worked at this shitty retail job for two years at one of the worst companies you can work for  all due to lack of opportunities in the rural community i now live in  five days ago without justification or reason i was accused of over  1000 of theft without my till for the day being over or short and despite the fact the cameras didn't show me stealing anything because of course i didn't  i'm not that stupid    they ended up getting it resolved  turned out the closer that night fucked up the math on the deposit so bad that all that money never even existed in the first place  its clearly a case of my manager panicking and looking to pin it on someone because that's a lot of money to go missing on her watch  so much for having your employees backs right  whatever   anyway  this whole debacle has cemented my decision to get the fuck out of dodge  because if money really does ever go missing what's to stop her from accusing me again  however  due to financial strain i can't leave until july 31st  by putting in my 2 weeks on july 17th    i can hardly even be civil with my manager anymore and it's about all i can do to drag my ass down here every day  so if you made it this far  thanks for reading and if you have any advice on how to make this time less painful go ahead and drop it ,o0hw2x

1454,Pushed too hard woth a coworker,the lady in the cubicle next to mine has been complaining about her manager for months now   he's a shithead boomer who didn't believe in coronavirus but took his computer home at the first sign of it being in our state   he has been working remote for an entire year completely in defiance in what we've been expected to do  working in the office remote alternating days   while working from home he's been repeatedly nasty and abusive towards her   he recently threw her under the bus in front of the president for missing a single email  meanwhile he hasn't set foot in the office in a year  has expected everyone else to mail him drawings he needs  doesn't check his emails  doesn't contact customers   he has basically coasted this whole time on some vague 'expertise' he has in estimating our company's primary product  which is basically just entering data into a spreadsheet   he doesn't care because he's at retirement age anyway  but the company hasn't trained up anyone to replace him  and we've been getting less and less work both because of the economy and probably because he's shitty sob who no one wants to work with   she's telling me all this and i'm trying to fire her up more by saying how he's going to drag us all down with him since the economy is getting bad and he's off fucking off doing less while we all need to pick up what he's dropping and she shuts down and says that she's scared of being out of work so she's going to just shut up and do everything for him   we're all just living in terror that these fucking bullies will just let everything fall flat and leave us with nothing if we don't do everything for them and keep everything afloat while they get all the benefits and none of the risk ,o17a6q

1459,I dont even know why I was so eager to join the workforce in the first place.,26m   back in 2014   i was a typical carefree 19 year old teenage college student   i had no major thing going on im my life apart from school   i did not fail classes nor did i get straight a's or b's in most of them either which i think was okay  most of my time was spent hanging out with friends   watching sports   playing football and video games  joining local meetups when i got the chance  e t c   i normaly slept at 2 am and woke up at 8 30 on most days   during the christmas that year   i went to visit my parents and ran into an old friend  he told me about how he was hustling and studying at the same time and i could too   he wasn't trying to sell me on anything   he was just spreading the  hustle  culture   we parted ways and i thought about what we were talking about  i thought that making money while studying was a good idea since i would have something going on as soon as i finished school   2015 is when i decided to change my life   i started doing various gigs here and there   doing peoples homework   making and sellling detergents   restaurant  work   cleaning pools   leetcode nonsense   basically anything that could make money  i started reading self help books   all i can say about them now is if you are a young  person without a clear goal with what you want to do with your life  most people   and want to add fire to your depression  read self help books   4 years after graduation   i have been for the most part doing the same gigs   the difference is that i am now older and not much money to show for it   the realisation that  even with hard work and ambition   i am years away from buying my ideal home   the way to get rich and have plenty of fuck you money is by stealing   embezzling public funds   lying to customers and throwing others under the bus    i don't even know why i was putting myself through all this pain   my dad told me once that he was willing to pay for everything as long as i helped from time to time in his printing business like i had done for years  who am i to listen when a motivation quote tells me i could be out in the streets   hustlin and being self made    given another chance   i would chose to continue being care free for up to two years after graduation   once you are done with school   the message is crystal clear  f ck you  playtime is over   grab a shovel and get to work  any personal goals dreams ambitioons are out the window    sorry for the long rant,o15wic

1468,Learned The Hard Way About “Hard Work Pays Off” By Devaluing My Worth, hello folks  although hard work can pay off  when it comes to the corporate job world  that s not so true  however  it can pay off if we re talking about personal goals that you re working hard to accomplish   i used to work my ass off  waking up 4 50 am  working 12-13 hours  working two jobs at the same time  etc  unfortunately  i was a gullible teen off of high school who had not experienced reality yet       right out of high school at 17  literally the day i graduated  i moved and went to work in roofing the next day  we would work 6-7 days and would work up to 13 hour days at times  pretty hard  brutal work i might add  however  i did gain useful skills for future use from this      the people i worked with highly encouraged hard work and kept  pushing and pushing  more and more upon me  at some point  i had become the best worker and a jack of all trades in my field  i had learned how to do everything  but i had the working force of 3 men  due to the fact i was always being pressured to work harder  i tried to become quicker and stronger to shine above the rest  i could lay out roofing shingles for three guys at once  remove a roof at the speed of three workers  so on and so forth       my hard work did not pay off however  and i never got a raise and i was never allowed to move up  even though i had learned to do everything and faster and quicker than everyone else  and more efficient  they realized moving me up to a shingle roofer position would cost them more money  of course i did shingle roof sometimes  but my main job was every job  removing the old roof  removing old nails  cleaning up gutters and ground  putting the new shingles on top  putting the new roof on  putting all work tools up and packing us up  meanwhile  everyone else s job was to remove the roof and put the roof on and  they were being paid more      my co-workers were being paid more even though i done their jobs  and more work too  but i was being paid less  even when i asked for a raise  multiple times  i was refused       after working in roofing for almost three years  i left and moved into my own place  i did not realize moving would cost so much and now i had to work  two jobs to make up expenses  so  i worked as a mattress deliverer for a company and at the amazon fullfilment center at the same time  i was working seven days straight  with no days off  which when compared to 6 days a week in roofing is not so bad when i first thought of it       i would constantly work hard and try to over achieve at both amazon and the mattress company for months without a single off day  however  nothing good would come from this  it was now about 4 months without a single off day and i had not even a single raise from all my hard work and i was perplexed did my hard work not pay off        i suffered from being anorexic from losing so much weight from working 4 months straight and working out  that i essentially quit both jobs to try to recover from it  during this time  i turned to gig work and came across the reality of companies fortunately at this point  i had spent three years of my life with almost no off days  working my ass off and over achieving and all i got in return were  thank you s  and  you re a hard worker  no raises  and being extorted by being given more work     all my life i had been taught the lie about  hard work pays off  and  companies will notice  oh yes  they did notice but guess what  all they did was thank me essentially  me doing more work for less money essentially lowered my value as a worker in the workforce which is ducking depressing for me to realize over time  i started to realize that time is valuable and living the life you want to live should come first  i shouldn t have to work my ass off until i m 60  which i may add is about the average life expectancy in america  just so i can retire these companies really want us to work until the average life expectancy in america until we should retire essentially  they want us to literally work to death  or the life expectancy we are expected to die  how the hell can i go on working 60-80 hour weeks knowing we re in a cycle of working to the average life expectancy in america  that literally shows how much value is put on our lives here    of course i still work  however  i do gig work currently and plan on staying that way to make more time for myself  i truly value my life  but i can not believe i really wasted the first three years of my life after high school being extorted by the system in turn  devaluing myself as a worker work hard  but only work hard if it s to a personal goal these companies will make you feel like you should be ashamed if you don t want to over work yourself to meet a company s goal but in the end  is meeting their goal really beneficial for your future      tldr   have you ever heard of the statement   hard work pays off  of course you have   unfortunately  i had to learn the hard way about this and learned that hard work only pays off towards a personal goal  i was a fool i went to work the day after graduation working 12-13 hour days  for nearly 6 days a week at my first job in roofing  i learned to do every part of the job  even better and quicker and more efficient than the ones who i worked with  unfortunately  they handed me more work  and pressured me to work harder  which i complied with and became a three man work force in one even though i had to do more work than anyone else in my job  they refused to move me up and pay me more as it would save them money to just have me do everyone s jobs  after working in roofing for three years  i moved and upon moving  worked two jobs at once  7 days a week at amazon and a mattress company  i worked my ass off and did not take a day off for nearly four months i ended up becoming anorexic and had to learn the hard way that all my hard work got me no raises and actually devalued my worth as a worker,o0x64m

1512,I walked out of my pizza delivery job…,well  there s not many places i can get this out of my head and get responses from like minded people   let me start off by saying that i pretty much did this job for disposable income  i worked at a higher end pizza chain where we charge upwards of  30 for a specialty pizza  anyways  that doesn t matter because drivers get paid  13 minimum where i m at  that s cool and all  i was never expecting to get paid like  15  we also get 1 50 per delivery which is eh considering gas prices nowadays  my big problem with my boss is that he is soulless and whenever there is a slight problem with my scheduling or something he becomes like this corporate possessed dummy  this is coincided with the fact that he has a useless fat wife that comes into only micromanage  she essentially is a ghost of our boss who only comes into doublecheck on micromanaging shit  like why did you park over there and can you explain to me why you missed work again   i personally believe that being a pizza delivery driver  if you are punctual  have a newer vehicle that isn t a total beater  this should not be a minimum wage job  you clean  you take phone calls  and deal with typical restaurant bs    well  the final straw hit when they broke covid guidelines by having a big ass party of 20  people crammed in a tiny dining room  ventilation was horrible and i didn t want to get sick  i told my boss this situation is horrible and his only solution was to offer a n95 mask  that was when i told him it was my last day there  i honestly had no problem doing this and didn t regret it because of how soulless and slimey he is  he wants the best of both worlds of  family style  but  corporate strictness  i just couldn t do it no more  for minimum ass wage   fuck a job  ,o07quu

1724,"We can stop this, together.",i made a  post https www reddit com r antiwork comments n61l4s yo im just sayin  a month ago about how the antiwork community is rapidly growing and we could actually make a change with the amount of people in this community  well  that generated more attention than i had anticipated   i had all sorts of people such as professional writers  software engineers  web developers  and so on contacting me wanting to help  i had people saying  they were waiting for my next instructions https www reddit com r antiwork comments n61l4s yo im just sayin gx5ljbc utm source share amp utm medium web2x amp context 3  i was not prepared for this   i do not want to be a cult leader  i do not want to start a movement that promotes riots and i do not want be the face of abolishing capitalism  however  i have been thinking about this project as much as i could to come up with a real solution   this is what i have come up with   people are 'forced' to work jobs that they hate because if they did not they would be homeless and starve  so  we need a way to ensure that people have food and a place to live  even if they are not working   the solution is seeds  seeds grow the food that we eat  seeds grow the food that the animals eat that we then eat  and seeds grow the timber for housing  people need to collect  share  and grow seeds of all the variety of plants  it is honestly the only solution i can think of to get people out of the system and becoming less dependent on capitalism  i have created r seedsociety for people to share information on how to transition to this lifestyle     s e e d s  seeing everyone eat disrupts society  i could go on a huge rant about how this would literally solve all of the worlds problems  but i have more to say and i will save that for anyone interested   i realize that this is not an instant solution  i realize that not everyone has the means to grow their own food  i realize that not everyone wants to spend their life gardening     earth loves all  i have come up with a movement called  earth loves all  basically  the movement is about spreading awareness and doesn't attempt to motivate people to do anything   the idea is that the earth provides us with all of the resources that we need and we should not be forced to work for them because resourciopaths  sociopaths that hoard resources  a word i made up  created a society that strips us of everything and make us compete for basic necessities   the  earth loves all  phrase was thought up to be an incomplete sentence on purpose  it could become  earth loves all africans  or any other group  humans create groups through instinct and i wanted to create a group that encompasses all people  the one thing everyone has in common is that we live on the earth   so now that i explained the name  let me explain what earth loves all supports believe in     the earth is our home and we should not destroy it  in fact  we should actively rebuild the earth    all humans have a right to food  housing  healthcare  and education   that's it  it seems simple  but for some reason humans have been developing advanced civilizations for thousands of years and yet most people are forced to work their entire lives   i have created r earthlovesall which actually got up to 100 members very quickly  it is not active  but please go there and start posting memes  ideas  and rants  i also have a website  earthlovesall com https www earthlovesall com  that i have not put anything on  if you are interested  go ahead and write up an article and send it to me at  moneylovesmisery gmail com mailto moneylovesmisery gmail com  i will post it onto the website if i think it supports the movement     about me  i don't know if you care  but if you read this far maybe you do  i am just a guy who has been passionate about trying to solve mental health issues for the past 10 years  i have a degree in psychology with a minor in sociology  i am an advocate for psychedelics because psilocybin mushrooms cured my depression  i have been poor my whole life and i have even lived in my car for 6 months before  i make all of my money through the internet by teaching english and doing other random things like testing apps and websites  i want to find a way to spend my time making a difference in peoples lives and influencing humanity in a way that stop destroying the earth and actively relieves people of all possible misfortunes   i'm thinking that the best way for me to have an influence is by using social media  i have a  youtube channel https www youtube com channel ucnk9jkoxt6xvhkggfrvvfyw featured  that you can check out and see my face if you want  i haven't used social media since around 2014 but i've made profiles on twitter  instagram  facebook  pinterest  and tiktok that you can follow by searching  psilipijiphili  i hate social media but i think it's the best way to reach people   tldr  r seedsociety is a new community that will help people learn how to use seeds to become less dependent on capitalism  r earthlovesall is an awareness movement that aims to stop destroying the earth and ensure that all people have food  housing  healthcare  and education  r antiwork has 330k members and we can come together to make a change  memes are fun  but we can do more ,nyczx7

1820,A labour time economy?,so  after  a short comment https www reddit com r antiwork comments ny2fuc what exactly do you want h1i03ix context 3  i thought this might deserve its own thread  in short  i  found a remarkable book https www marxists org nederlands documenten 1950 1950gic htm  from the 1930's dutch council-communist left  that left me so enthused  i immediately started editing it for modern language use  so this could be republished for a wider audience  a project that is pretty far along right now  should speak dutch and be interested  an earlier version in english can also be  found online https www marxists org subject left-wing gik 1930  although you can find the  second edition in print https www amazon com fundamental-principles-communist-production-distribution dp b0851lzz17 ref sr 1 1 crid 28yzjt7axyqmd amp dchild 1 amp keywords fundamental principles of communist production and distribution amp qid 1623509579 amp sprefix fundamental principles 2caps 2c260 amp sr 8-1   why this hype  i've been active on the far left as a communist for over 15 years now and barely do i get to read or hear about how communism would actually work  like economically  most commonly you get a variation of the argument  we don't have blueprints  which is a cop out  then there are many strands of communists that aim for a replication of the soviet union but  better this time  the most developed argument along these lines is perhaps  paul cockshott's take on it http ricardo ecn wfu edu cottrell socialism book  which has never really convinced me   this book however  the  fundamental principles of communist production and distribution  starts from the comments marx and engels made in their  critique of the gotha programme   anti-d hring  and  capital  and develop it from there  it is still just a basic outline  its fundamental principles  but still already gives a comprehensive look at how a communist economy would 'tick'   the basic premise is extremely simple  you abolish wage labour and  thereby  money  this gets replaced with a social accounting based on  socially average  labour time  from an individual's perspective this is extremely transparant  you work  say  four hours and you get four hours 'credited' which you can spend on whatever the hell you want  there's no more exploitation as surplus value  that is  profits  no longer exist as wage labour no longer exists   from the perspective of society  labour time accounting also becomes very transparent in planning for the  re production of the economy  for human consumption and even for free-at-the-point-of-use general services like public transport  education or healthcare   besides this positive claim  the book also critiques the 'soviet model' of a centralised and bureaucratised economy and  crucially   why this model can never work  while the book has its weaker points  mainly in how to  realise  this  i think it's a good thing that it would get rediscovered by a wider audience  i hope this thread contributes to that  ,ny8xfm

1828,Why I Quit My Job and Became Anti-Work,i just recently discovered anti-work and i m glad to surround myself with people that feel the same way i do about living to work  i have a life story to tell about how i ve grown increasingly anti-work   in 2017  i was laid off because the company i worked for eliminated my position due to downsizing  fortunately  i just accepted a creative services director position for a local tv station within the same week of my termination  i negotiated a pay rate that doubled my previous pay so i was very happy and thankful  i thought life was sweet because i had a higher paying job and my family could settle down in a new place and lay some roots  the downside  we would be moving out of state with no family or friends nearby  it was just my wife and two kids  ages three and one  we were fortunate enough for my wife to stay home with the kids while i worked  the job was stressful  fast paced and i was constantly working under pressure to meet deadlines  i was struggling internally  i felt alone because i worked all day and was missing out on spending time with my family  i was missing watching my kids grow  my wife helped me feel better by sending videos and pictures of her and the kids  it was a sad reality knowing my family was literally down the street  but i felt so far away because i m stuck in an office for at least 9 hours a day  sometimes  i would cry in the bathroom because i missed my family and i felt like i was missing out on so much  the pictures brought me joy and happiness  but i felt saddened too knowing my family is without me  i had to push my feelings aside because we lived off a single family income so i grudged along  this went on for three years until i finally quit   more of that later    my wife and i added a new addition to our family  late 2018  she had a difficult pregnancy and raised the family alone a majority of the time because i was working to save pto for my son s birth  my absence was very hard on our relationship  we had no help from family or friends and i was juggling a work life balance  i regretted leaving her alone while she battled severe morning sickness but i didn t know what else to do because we lived on a single family income  some days i would sneak out of work to come home  but i couldn t keep this up because i eventually got caught  my gm told me i needed to figure out my work life balance better  giving me a stern warning that disciplinary action would be taken if didn t  figure it out  these words came from a man that put his work before family  living hours away in another state separate from them  there s no way he would have compassion for my situation  it s always about the bottom line and what s best for the company  paid parental leave is nonexistent in america so i ended up using the remaining pto i had to care for my wife and kids after my son was born  my wife almost died in the hospital from birth complications because she became septic  thankfully she recovered and we were discharged after 5 days in the hospital  she needed help even more now but i had to return to work because i used up all of my pto  i wish i could have stayed home to help and care for my wife and kids  i think it s disgusting that paid parental leave is not required by law  it s sad to think that puppies can not be separated from their mother no sooner than six weeks  yet in america it s ok for women to go back to work two weeks after giving birth  she had to do it alone again  this time with a newborn with colic  my wife and i began fighting more frequently now because we were tired  stressed out parents  eventually things got better for us as we developed a new routine and she recovered postpartum   it s now 2020 and started the year off with a new gm  another boss that puts work before family  there s an annual company trip to vegas and i wouldn t be able to make it because my son has a rare medical condition that requires special treatment at cincinnati children s hospital  it s a trek  a 7 hour drive one-way  it s important to keep the scheduled visit because the hospital s schedule is always full and rescheduling can be a nightmare  i told my gm i would not be able to make the company trip because his medical appointment conflicts with the scheduled company trip  she told me that my attendance is mandatory and if i declined to go  her boss will get involved  i viewed this as a threat so i walked away wondering how i will make this work  thankfully the trip was canceled because of covid-19    i always rallied for promoting good and safe health precautions when covid-19 began and that s also when the issues became worse  my gm told me that it was a democratic agenda and there would be no action taken for health and safety precautions my wife became sick with covid-19 symptoms on march 31st and her doctor ordered us to isolate at home for 14 days  my gm would not allow me to quarantine so i used pto for the first part of the isolation  at that point someone close to me made an anonymous call to the gms boss  which resulted in my gm calling me a few hours later to tell me to stay home per cdc guidelines  every morning  afternoon and end of my work day the gm would call wanting updates on my wife as well as my children  she then asked for medical records for my family and when i said no  i was contacted by hr  gm and the corporate hr  they told me that if i don t provide my families medical records  they would contact their doctors and the health department to obtain them because i said no  considering i don t have access to my wife s personal medical information  my gm said that i had to break quarantine and come back  i show up at work ready to social distance and ended up leaving again because my baby became sick  living in east tennessee  the healthcare is very poor  we always had problems with inadequate care and negligence  we packed the family in the sedan and drove four hours away to kentucky  i ll never forget that moment driving 100 mph down the interstate with my hazards on as i looked over at my wife in the passenger seat  holding my son for dear life as he had trouble breathing and his fever spiking to 104  we rushed him to the er and the medical staff saved him  they tested him for covid-19  but the results came back inconclusive because they could not get a good sample up his nose  the er doctor diagnosed him with covid-19 and discharged us  ordering us to quarantine  i was forced to use pto again and still could not work from home while under quarantine  i ran out of sick time and had to go back to work because my gm did not approve working from home    i was in my office when another employee came to me and asked for help  outside of my department and nothing that i am required to do within my job  and i said i couldn t as my baby is being treated for covid19 and i am supposed to isolate  the employee asked the gm why i wasn t allowed to quarantine and the gm brought myself and hr in and yelled at me saying i will not self isolate and that i am getting my office taken away and will work around my staff  i am the only department head without an office now and felt like i was retaliated against  the gm said she will determine when and if i need to self isolate and she said  verbatim  that i was crying wolf over my baby  she said she does not think anyone is sick and that i need to stop isolating unless she tells me to go get tested  immediately following that  i submitted fmla papers and a couple hours after doing so  i was written up for not working while using my sick time  my fmla request was ignored and it had been a week or more before hr finally approved it   my gm s intentions were to drive me away because i was a strong advocate for workplace safety and following cdc guidelines  she wrote me up two more times  gave me a bad review and was constantly nagging me about work  i had enough and on july 2020  i quit my job and walked out  it was a liberating feeling    we moved back to kentucky and are now surrounded by friends and family  i m  working a different job and don t make near as much money  but that doesn t matter because family is more important than wasting away for a job that doesn t care for the well being of it s employees  i find work culture and  hustling  to be very toxic  especially in america  i take no pride in working my ass off at the expense of losing out on enjoying life and missing family friends time  if i could change things  i wish i didn t take the job in tennessee but i didn t know what else to do since i was laid off with no safety net  my wife was so strong through it all and continues to be the best wife and best mother for our family  i couldn t ask for more because she continues to amaze me everyday  i am blessed to have her in my life    i wish there were better workplace laws in america like paid parental leave  higher minimum wage  and healthy severance for termination  also  it would be nice if employers would provide more pto for its employees  it s a disgusting rat race and i ve become jaded about society rewarding people for living to work  anyway  family always comes first and don t work for assholes ,nxhwsi

1849,I have a friend who is being hopelessly exploited and its heartbreaking to watch.,so as i've posted on here before  i used to work for a horrific company that absolutely took advantage of and abused its employees  the owner and all upper employees were unbelievably narcissistic  completely lacking in empathy  and viewed all of their employees as pawns and lesser beings  i left  and was able to find something much closer to my ideal work environment   a good friend of mine still works there  and has taken over most of my responsibilities and title  though her salary is substantially less than mine was  they are currently in the midst of their busy season  and the abuse and exploitation of their employees is just staggering   this woman is working 60  hour weeks with a salary well below the minimum federal salary overtime threshhold and the company lies and says they have a small business exemption to avoid paying overtime  the business regularly picks up last minute events and does a terrible job scheduling their employees so as a manager she's frequently made to hunt for people to send to events at the last second  with the implication that it's her responsibility if no one is available    she has been fending off a foot injury for awhile  and yesterday was told to come in and she could spend her whole shift at her computer  even though this time of year often involves lots of manual labor from every employee  she went in and was promptly sent to work in the basement on her feet   she has a doctor's appointment this afternoon and her whole leg is swollen  she called them to let them know she wasn't coming in because she can barely walk and they basically told her she had to come in anyway and guilt-tripped her about all the things in her wheelhouse that needed to get done - things that there is no good reason another employee couldn't do   through all of this  i've encouraged her to stand up for herself  especially today i reminded her that if she has decided she is too injured to work they have no right or even real ability to override that decision beyond what she gives them    i felt so good about finally quitting and leaving that place behind  and they were furious with me when i left  so i have an idea of the kind of pressure she is dealing with  she is aware of the fact that she is most likely not overtime exempt  but through all of this  the fact is that she lives meagerly paycheck to paycheck and even though she's miserable and is completely aware of how much she's being exploited and abused she can't really afford to rock the boat or quit  she's working so much and is so exhausted when he has time off that it's difficult to organize a job hunt  i know that's a poor excuse sometimes  but i suspect we can all sympathize with that feeling  i try to refrain from nagging her about finding a new job because i know what that can feel like   all of this to say fuck that system  and fuck those business owners who treat their employees like objects and are unable to see beyond the next dollar they might make peddling their overpriced crap no one needs ,nxizbb

ish  belongings which we're willing to sell   i could ask my company to allow me to work remotely in mexico  they do adjust pay based on location however and i'm not sure about international restrictions  but i truthfully need a full break not just a change of scenery   feel rather numb with my current job  and scared to  not  do what makes me excited in life  traveling  writing  knowledge management  creating content      i went through a difficult childhood in which i essentially raised myself  grew up in poverty  helped my mother financially throughout my teens and early 20s  then put myself through an undergraduate and graduate degreed education  the first in my family  then worked the ranks through the corporate world until i now find myself in a well-payed job in silicon valley   except now i'm just plain tuckered out  my job looks great on paper  i'm paid very well  i have excellent benefits  i have a good boss  decent people i work with  but  at times i just feel completely numb   it's not that i don't want to  work  it's the mindlessness of imposed deadlines  endless emails  meetings  circular tasks for the sake of appeasing the machine  business speak  i'll circle back  reach out  i'm just following up  checking in  what's the delta  you're on mute  kpis  mbos  can i get a copy of those slides  let's do a round table  etc   it kind of erodes you and this was happening years leading up to covid   so this is not fatigue from the pandemic   i understand the trade-off  i know all of the mindlessness above means that i get the cushy pay and benefits  i sincerely appreciate for a lot of people in my position  they'd be perfectly satisfied and happy  no judgment  in fact  i'm kind of disappointed that i'm not one of those people  it feels like i'm defective   part of me also feels a bit devastated  that i'm a fool for even considering walking away from this   i've explored a lot of other avenues to make sure it's not other aspects impacting me psychologically    i've been through a lot of counseling and therapy  i've done extra projects at work in other divisions to see if i just need to change up my focus    i eat right  i get movement  and i have a loving spouse  fortunately  in my view  i have no kids  love children but not 24 7  we have no pets  love animals but not the maintenance   i've worked for different companies  i've moved to different states  cities  counties  i've changed titles  roles  responsibilities    all of it has been helpful to some extent but never truly motivating   i've been very disciplined in my life and i've pretty much always done what everyone else expected of me  i've always been seen as wise  reliable  trusting  gentle  etc  i'm usually well loved by my bosses and colleagues  i say that with no pride  i genuinely am happy to serve them well and be helpful    and to be fair  it hasn't always been external pressure  i've always done what  i've  expected of myself and pressured myself to do    however  i would kind of like to step outside this construct  as it were  and do what i  want  to do versus what i  have  to do  when i think this way  it's like a huge weight lifts off of me  as if i've been wearing a heavy mantle   the only times when i've felt truly  alive  are when my husband and i were traveling  like  ebulliently joyful   for example  in 2018  i took off three weeks to explore germany and france  at the end  i didn't want to come home  i wanted to keep going to another country   this is not the only traveling we've done   what i'm doing is probably very idiotic  maybe i am committing career and financial suicide from a western perspective   at the end of this  estimated  2 year sabbatical perhaps i've been able to rebirth myself in a sense and come back to corporate america with renewed direction -- although i understand the risk of losing my place and maybe losing some ground with pay  etc   or  maybe i'm able to generate my own revenue through putting my skills to work for myself  my spouse also with his skill set   i don't have a question  i just wanted to connect with other people maybe going through a similar analysis  and also the exercise of writing this out was helpful   thanks if you made it this far ,nx7hhg

1923,Overstaffing,are the rest of you in office settings where there s nothing to do yet your employer wants you physically in the office  or is it just me   why are companies hiring people if there s no  work  to do  do companies get reduced taxes or kickbacks due to their staffing numbers   was the whole point of getting an office job just a means to day trade or work on your own passions while getting paid in a comfortable location   i feel like i m missing something or maybe everyone is too scared to speak up  i ve tried to be positive and take these  opportunities  by learning new skills and incorporating my own professional development  i ve gotten new jobs and i ve even been recruited to new ones  at the end of the day it s the same thing where i m sitting around waiting for work to come down the line and i leave the office confused    thank you all for any insights ,nxc4pk

1956,"I'm done with 9-5, I'm going to begin enjoying my life again",i'm 36  work in a busy hospital  worked in person through the pandemic  caught covid  recovered and went right back to work as soon as i was cleared  my hospital sent us a  hero bonus  which was 5 whole n95 masks sent to my house  thanks a fucking lot  i literally steal more n95's than this every week   yesterday i decided that i need to reclaim my own life  my mental health has seriously suffered since the beginning of 2020 obviously due to covid  lockdowns  work shit and the loss of my sister last june due to cancer  she had two kids  my niece and nephew ages 4 and 1  though my nephew was only 3 months old when she passed  i've been extremely depressed  borderline suicidal tbh and it seems like the only thing keeping me around is that i can't imagine leaving my niece and nephew without their only uncle and leave my parents with no kids out of two    i get home from work exhausted both mentally and physically which leaves me basically no energy or capacity to cook dinner  dishes  laundry  housekeeping  etc  i don't even have the energy or motivation to do things that i used to enjoy like reading  gaming or golfing  it's taking a toll on my relationship with my gf since she is feeling the burden of having to try to pick up my slack  i do still cook and clean stuff but i'll be the first to admit that she's doing more of it  she's very understanding of my situation  i'm very lucky to have someone so supportive but it's getting to her as well  my mood  energy level  lack of interest in most things anymore including sex most of the time  it's having a negative impact on both of our lives and it can't continue like this   when i got home yesterday we had a great conversation about our situation  in particular my work situation as she knows how miserable i am  i told her i want to quit my full time job and do freelance writing jobs and gig work like delivery and she was completely supportive  i can't continue working in a place that feels more like a punishment or prison sentence than a means to support my survival  i can't continue asking permission for a day off or a break to run an important errand or attend a doctor's appointment like i'm a fucking child  i had to basically plead for extra bereavement days off when my sister passed and they acted like xerxes the generous god for giving me 3 extra fucking days  this isn't how we're supposed to live and now i'm ready to do something about it   my sister's death actually made me realize that you can do everything the  right  way  get a career  work your ass off  pay for your health insurance  sacrifice things that are important to you to  get ahead  in your career and then lose everything with one phone call  we had to crowdfund her last couple rounds of chemo because she lost her employer sponsored health insurance due to the fact that  she was dying of cancer and couldn't fucking work  and therefore was deemed uninsurable  what  the  fuck  america   so i'm dipping out  i'm not sacrificing the remaining best years of my life when i can be active and actually enjoy life before my body begins to break down even faster in order to keep up with the status quo that's clearly not working for me in any way to die early having not achieved really any of my own personal goals or realized any of my potential as a fucking human being  not as a wage slave sacrificed at the altar of profit and productivity  i have a sick dual screen phone that is pretty amazing for office productivity  fuck that  i'm watching youtube on one screen and reading r antiwork on the other screen  fuck your productivity metrics   so yeah  sorry for the long rant but i'm quitting at the end of the month  i'm going to do some freelance writing and work on some old projects that i'd shelved a long time ago  do some delivery driving where i can take breaks whenever i want  go to the driving range or fuck it  do a full 18 in the middle of the weekday and i won't fucking feel bad  i'm going to stay up late when i want and sleep in when i want  book vacations when it suits me and my gf and not ask permission to someone who doesn't give a single fuck about me in any way and only cares about the empty chair where i used to be  i'm done being afraid to ask for things and accepting what i'm given  i'm going to make money on my own terms even if that means taking home a bit less  if the tradeoff is that my mental health improves and i can begin enjoying my life again then it's a trade i'm willing to make    fuck your 9-5 30  unpaid lunches  micromanagement  denial of time off requests  need a doctor's note for a sick day  employer sponsored health insurance  2 5 hour daily commute  office bullshit and  hero pay    and a big thanks to this subreddit for showing me that it's not just me feeling like this  i'm not an outlier  a weirdo or a lazy fuck for wanting to live my own life on my terms  i've never been more motivated to change my life than now and if that change means taking a few steps back and slowing the pace to enjoy the scenery then that's what has to be done  if you're reading this and feeling similarly then i honestly hope your situation allows you to make the changes that you need to make for yourself and not for anybody else  especially not for you fucking employer ,nxk3cg

2009,Why It's Bad to Have a High GDP, source https lukesmith xyz articles why-its-bad-to-have-high-gdp     to put it in other words   the common way of looking at gross domestic product  gdp  is that it's a metric of economic success  more gdp is more wealth  wealth is good   poverty   meaning low  per capita  gdp  is bad  nowadays  pretty much everyone talks about  economics  like this as if this truism was scribbled on the back walls of the cosmos   this is just looking at one side of the ledger in a kind of global double-entry accounting book  a logically equivalent way of looking at it is that  gdp is a metric of economic exchange required for survival in society as it exists  you can say that some area  produced   1 billion of output  sounds good  but you can just as easily say that  1 billion was required for that area to sustain itself  sounds bad  these two are simply logically equivalent     living on  1 a day  let's dive into the gestalt  when you hear that a family of eight lives on less than a dollar per day  ppp adjusted  you might wonder how they manage  to  actually  do such a thing would require buying large bags of rice for the whole family  eat only that and live in free cardboard boxes   the reality is that that often uttered phrase means that they use less than  1 a day in the general economy  while the rest of their livelihood is  off-the-grid  or self-sufficient  they may grow food in a family farm  hunt for food  and most of their daily needs from cooking oils  to plates  to pottery  to soap are often made at home as well   there is still  an economy  but often one that is barter based or  socialist  in the real pre-socialist sense of the word  mediated by direct face-to-face social tit-for-tat between neighbors and friends  none of this mediated by currency being exchanged  thus it is not part of the gdp   if you read about some bangladeshi village where the only product is  textiles  that doesn't mean that everyone there makes textiles all day and  without a textile company  everyone would've starved to death  it means that the only on-paper  measurable global industry practiced there is textile manufacturing  other villagers might farm  hunt  even do some kind of gathering in some places  they will produce the arts and crafts and live the way people live when you leave them alone  if your view of the world is mediated by gdp  you're only seeing the extremely small sliver that pops into existence when people exchange something involving legal tender   this is extremely difficult for us modern bugpeople to understand because to be a bugman in a large city is to produce absolutely nothing on one's own and buy literally everything you need from the store  to us non-productive people  gdp means income which means survival  but the further out of bugmanville you go  the clearer the vacuousness of gdp becomes  when you realize that most of human wealth is unmeasured by gdp  you realize that whig history and steven pinkerism is based on shaky foundations     example  a minor example  we had a large thanksgiving feast near my uncle's house in very rural florida  as it got cold in the night  we had a fire in a repurposed old sugar cane cooking vat artfully standing on used symmetrical cinderblock pieces  a bugman hipster might pay two hundred dollars or more for a similar looking  authentic  piece of equipment  those  200 would be counted in the gdp  a bugman hipster might have also bought or rented chairs for the event   contributing  more to the gdp  but my uncle  as part of the local wholesome church community  simply borrowed some from the church  thus our event produced basically no gdp output in goods or services  despite being functionally equivalent to some similar but expensive and ergo  productive   friendsgiving  practiced by urbanites  in reality  we  are richer than the bugmen hipsters who blew hundreds of dollars on a faux-folksy party  in this case  we owned the firepit and had easy access and permission to the chairs  thus we are more economically flexible than they are  that gdp that they produced expended is evidence of deeper reliance on the economic system  that gdp output is a marker of  fragility  reliance on the conditions of the outside economy in the same way that a village of bangladeshis who abandon their traditional way of lives to work on textiles are more fragile  despite being able to save up for iphones     what gdp really measures   most of the increase in gdp across the world is simply the movement from local partially-social partially-under-the-table economies to economies mediated by taxable currency  an economically self-sufficient village with close social relationships and a barter economy has 0 gdp  a township of entrepreneurs and artisans you partially barter and partially use currency which they don't report has 0 gdp  all of these people are  in poverty  and  earn less than a dollar a day  and if you want to be truly self-sufficient  that means having a personal gdp of zero   more than that  pretty much everywhere  gdp is a strong indicator of social upheaval  if you think that gdp is some eternal goodness  remember that  everything  good  about industrialization shows up in the gdp  while at the same time   everything bad about it will not show up  or  sometimes bad things are registered as positive economic growth  urbanization has caused mass-disease  and if that means a market for new medical services and pharmaceuticals  great  the gdp just went up  the ganges is polluted due to the textile plant  that just means more opportunities for local entrepreneurs to sell bottled water  the gdp just went up  are people being pushed out of fishing or other subsistence occupations because of it  even better  now they have no choice but to contribute to the gdp  with every passing year  in fact  more and more of the gdp is produced by dealing with the problems that our higher level of gdp have caused   at the end of the day   gdp is only a measurement of how reliant a place or country is on the global economy  self-sufficiency has a gdp of 0  wasteful consooomerism has an extremely large gdp     planned obsolescence  i have one of my great grandfather's early electric circular saws  it has a bunch of gunk in it  but it still works  although i recently took it apart to replace some old screws and springs and other little parts to be careful  they literally do not make circular saws like it  it's all metal  while even the fancy modern stuff is mostly plastic   the  unfortunate  thing about it and other durable tools is that it's  bad for the economy  especially the gdp  since that thing has been around since maybe the 50's or 60's  that's as long as 70 years the economy has gone without the  stimulation  of us having to buy another saw   viewers of my technology videos  which would be better for the world  if everyone used the material equivalent of a classic american-made ibm thinkpad  or some apple laptops that are unfixable computers made of mostly batteries designed to conk out right before the new version comes out  regardless  the apple macs that cost thousands a piece are much better for the  economy   that's what i mean  if you have quality tools and do not need to constantly throw money at the system to buy things  fix things and otherwise waste money  you are going to be having a lower gdp  that's just how it is     the propagandistic role of gdp  when you don't think things through like this  gdp is supposed to appear as an objective measure of economic goodness  you're supposed to be looking at those gdp charts and saying   wow  my life might be terrible  i am not free  i am subject to forces out of my control  and i am told i have to participate in mass-consumerism to survive  but these charts are the facts  and the facts say that things are better now  so i believe them   it's legitimately surprising to me how big of a boon the idea of increasing gdp is for whig history and npcs of many different ideologies  people of the left and right will matter-of-factly tell me that a plastic based economy taking over the world is still good because the line is going up  i've heard it as a justification for everything    gt don't like globalization    you're wrong  the gdp is going up    don't trust state-funded institutionalized science    you're wrong  the gdp is going up    don't want child drag queens    you're wrong  the gdp is going up    don't want everything to be made of plastics and other petrochemicals    you're wrong  the gdp is going up    don't want mass pornography    you're wrong  the gdp is going up    don't want free sugary drinks since infancy    you're wrong  the gdp is going up   when you abandon the illusion of gdp  you are suddenly able to ask whether massive technological  progress  has  actually  been good for real human life and human pychology ,nwgq7h

2015,Does anyone else hate seeing employees defend customers?,for some reason it really gets under my skin when i feel like employees have been brainwashed by the  customer is always right  mentality and the culture of customer service  to me it is ridiculous to expect an employee to never show annoyance  never snap at a rude customer  or in general act  unprofessional  when met with rudeness and ingratitude from customers    i know i'm bitter because i've been working since i was 16 - that's nearly a decade in the workforce - and most of that has been in the restaurant industry and retail  i've been treated like garbage by nearly everyone involved- owners  managers  corporate  customers  coworkers overworked and underpaid as well  it's all taken quite a toll on me  because of that  i revel in stories where employees were rude right back to customers  neglected their work  snapped at their bosses  etc  in my opinion  the more an employee can get away with that actively goes against customer service culture  the happier and prouder i am for them   so it annoys me when i see other employees of this hellscape that is customer service standing up for customers and saying stuff like  you're being so unprofessional  and  you should have just ignored that rude customer and smiled through your aggravation and helped them with what they needed   first of all  what level of  professionalism  can be expected of someone who is being paid minimum wage  or slightly above it  i mean  seriously  and how much are employees expected to put up with from the public while being expected to smile and be polite  why are we expected to lick the boots of someone treating us like shit just because they're a customer or a boss   i know i'm bitter  but i feel truly sorry for anyone so brainwashed by our culture that they come to a rude customer's defense over the defense of an employee who finally snapped after years of mistreatment ,nweqhy

2052,Volunteer work is just as bad as paid work,tl dr  don't bother volunteering unless it's in something you're passionate about or will help you get a job   i've volunteered an awful lot in lots of different places and if i'm being honest with you  i was taken advantage off as much as i am in a paid position  obviously i didn't do it for the recognition or anything  but i sure was annoyed when people took the mick   the first volunteer work i did was when i was 16  busted my ass in this cafe working 30 hours a week  getting told off multiple times for not knowing how to do certain things and having to deal with incredibly rude customers  it was exhausting work and because i was young and naive  they got me to do essentially everything  i did enjoy it though and i learnt a lot of new things  not to mention all the confidence i gained  plus they only needed me to help out for a month or so   i also volunteered at the back of a charity shop  sorting stuff out  it was dull  i learnt nothing more other than i hate retail  customers were rude  the staff were okay but they were old and we had nothing in common  and i spent hours in a stuffy room folding clothes  i lasted a year before the store had to shut down  i was hired because they couldn't afford to employ another staff member  so instead of being treated like a volunteer  i was treated like staff   volunteered at a doggy daycare  job was good  boss was an absolute asshole  she would scream at the dogs and couldn't hold a temper to save her life  i spent all day picking up dog shit  starting at 7am in the morning  she only hired staff under the age of 21 to save money  the breaking point was after being on my feet for several hours  i decided to sit down and pet one of the dogs  she comes storming in  4 hours after the start of my shift  shouting at me that i need to be standing up and that i'm being lazy  i left the next week  i later learnt that over christmas  she had given everyone a christmas card with a  10 gift card in  except me  wish i had told her to shove my notice up her ass   there's loads more stories about being treated like shit  but volunteering is just code for  we just don't want to pay you  unless it gives you some kind of advantage  don't even bother ,nw2jfu

Is this normal?,i don t know if i m just overreacting or actually in the right  i started working at the reception of a company months ago and everything seemed great  my boss is a nice  older woman but an extreme perfectionist sadly   so 2 weeks ago i came to work and found 13 tasks at my desk  yes i calculated them  they all had little stickers on them from my boss asking me to do it  it was ridiculous stuff like  please bring those papers in this room  or  throw this cardboard in the garbage bin one floor down  just seeing my desk  and my mail afterwards  full of task got me into a panic attack and i felt paralyzed for hours  like why give out such weird tasks  don t get me wrong  i m not saying i wanna do nothing because i enjoy meaningful and serious tasks  but this was just stuff she could have done herself instead of taking the time to write stickers on them  or stuff that is literally just her microorganising every molecule  so  the boss came later and wanted to give me 2 more tasks  i couldn t reply and just broke down and cried  she seemed understanding of my situation but said that it s normal  everyone has such amounts of tasks  and she became all pseudo-samaritan and said that having those tasks will help me improve my stress and organisation skills    after this convo with her  i ve noticed more and more how i get every single  fart  of a task  another coworker needed to something and my boss was quick to say  oh let them  me  do it    and today i come and see my desk again full of papers  now it was another coworker giving me stuff to do too which caused a full mental breakdown and i was just crying  thankfully while clocked in atleast  me and the boss had another convo after this and she said again how it s normal and how there are only 6 other coworkers at the reception and they all get so many tasks to do blahblah  i did hear of 2 other coworkers that they ve never seen anyone get this much of work     i honestly don t know if my boss kinda  gaslighted  me into believing this is all normal  on top of this  i always have to pick up phones and do the customer contact part too  which is getting harder for me too with my sanity going downhill   can someone maybe share examples of their work tasks  or tell me atleast what is going on   ,nv9a97

2115,I'm interested in hearing more about the anti-work rationale (Genuine),i confess i don't know all the nitty gritty details of all the arguments behind anti-work philosophies but i tend to agree with some of them and disagree with others     amp x200b   thus  i'd like to get hear the additional reasoning behind some of the points i don't agree to see if i would change my mind  i visit this sub occasionally  2-5 mo  and don't really get to see much rational argument -- just a lot of rants  please comment respectfully on some or all of the points below if you disagree with me    amp x200b   1   wage-slave    or some variation of it  this term seems overly bombastic and almost certainly not meant to be literal  slavery has such a complex and serious history and meaning that you can't honestly compare employment to it  with a job  you are  voluntarily  agreeing to do something in  exchange  for an income    2  capitalists are evil  i agree that many aspects of how the market and its participants function are reprehensible  i think the strongest argument i've every heard for why the complaints of business over regulation is hyperbole is child labor  we use to have it  then  we passed laws banning it  we still have a functioning market today without it  nevertheless  the core idea of private citizens owning capital  in terms of money  or assets  in terms of land  buildings  stocks  etc  is not inherently evil  there is a core incentive to improve the efficiency  but guardrails have to be put in place  baseball players are incentivized to knock the ball out of the park but a referee is there to make sure they don't use an air cannon   3  working hard or hustle culture is dumb  let's draw a distinction between people that are motivated solely for an income to sustain themselves and people that are motivated for other reasons  e g  achievement  altruism  i agree that at a baseline  nobody should  have  to be overworked to live a safe and stable life  i do subscribe to the idea that we could probably have a 4 day work week standard and every worker could earn enough for  i  food   ii  shelter sanitation   iii  healthcare   iv  education    v  security  and  vi  transportation  however  i disagree that hustling or working hard or putting in overtime or working 70 hours a week is  inherently  bad when the primary motivator is the worker themselves  i've had friends that have started businesses  i myself have worked long hours not because i needed to but because i worked for a company where i believed in what they did and wanted us to succeed and improve  i derived satisfaction from our purpose like someone might derive satisfaction from playing the guitar   4  we could all just buy a farm and live off the land  you could  but you'd have to give up every modern convenience like cell phones  tvs  automotive  tractors  refrigerator  etc - to be consistent in your logic  each product of convenience we use in our life is the result of thousands of other people working in interwoven supply chains  again  there's a distinction between an individual wanting to live is isolation independence and thinking that the whole of society could  work still needs to be done to have the life of comfort and convenience  relative to centuries ago  that most enjoy    5  robots could do everything and humans could live a life of leisure  given how hard it is to get 10 people to agree unanimously on something  i don't foresee an entire country agreeing to it and coordinating on the gargantuan effort  the simple act of retrofitting a factory is insanely complicated  time consuming  expensive  and  ironically  labor intensive  as a technophile  the technology is there for perhaps the majority of the means of production  but not 100  i hope to significant progress towards the automation of the means of production  but only if we install safeguards to inhibit the unequal circulation of money    ---------------  overall  i agree with a lot of the complaints in this sub and i've listed a few below but i disagreed with some notions that seem to circulate frequently here as well and i wanted to challenge them  i'm coming from a place of sincerity and interest in internalizing the rationale of other viewpoints and having a healthy discussion - none of my friends can keep a cool head when discussing this stuff and so they aren't really interested in debating it  it's either  rah rah capitalists are the devil incarnate  or  lol  lazy bums    amp x200b   thanks    amp x200b   i agree    - without regulations  a majority of private for-profit businesses would exploit nearly everything they could to make more profit including people and the environment    - a fully free market with no restrictions  e g  libertarian style  would could a lot of human suffering    - the inheritance of wealth is a major source of corruption and conflation of incentives    - there are basic human necessities that deserve additional protection from exploitation like food  housing  education  transportation  security  and sanitation  perhaps even a government owned  basic  version that challenges private businesses with insane profit margins    - ceo   executive pay is so stupidly high and not proportional    - people should not have to spend a majority of their waking hours in any given year just to live a safe and stable life    etc,nvbqlu

2122,I had the weirdest dream / nightmare last night.,basically it was found out that large scale companies like amazon  walmart  etc were making worker's lives as miserable as possible in order to cause depression  stress  and other health issues that stem from being over worked and working long hours   i was one of the whistleblowers on this case and living in a remote bunker because of the high price put on my head   the reason for doing this is  is because they were getting massive kickbacks from the drug companies that were enjoying record profits from sales of anti-depression  anti-anxiety  and a host of other medications  they were in turn using these kickbacks to supplement the wages of the workers  by as much as  10 hr in some instances   this was also the reason why many of these companies paid such little taxes  they did not want a paper trail showing this   the reason why healthcare was not made free is because they would lose this incentive   weed was made illegal for the longest time because they would lose out on profits if people had a natural substance to consume that would reduce stress  smoking and drinking were perfectly legal because they would soon cause other health issues like lung cancer and liver disease and they would also make bank on sales of drugs to treat these ailments  especially chemotherapy drugs ,nvw6d1

(the dilemma behind why so much media glorifies awful workaholism),i m an active filmmaker and video producer i love the form and the practice deeply  yet i find myself frustrated at how most media glorifies work-worship  unbalanced lives  and workaholism   root to this is the tenet that anything that lacks conflict and struggle is boring  we want to see unbalanced people making herculean efforts  well-adjusted  healthy people don t make for good ratings    that s why on american daytime tv you always see game show hosts prodding the contestant s most triggering backstories and struggles it s almost like they get a bonus for every tear  but i digress   i ve been trained to accept this as gospel  and honestly still believe it  but i ve been trying to have an open mind and begin exploring what an  anti-work  school of film and tv can look like  many works that would qualify already exist the late 90s were an especially fertile time for movies with  slacker  heroes  but even those still stuck within the traditional hero struggles mightily construct   is it possible to create a totally new  anti-work  form and still have it be entertaining        are there movies or tv shows out there that you consider to be truly great examples of  anti-work  stories ,nvz1n2

2220,My job is driving me toward a mental break.,i am a 21 year old recent graduate working at a company that vaguely intersects with my degree   when i first started here  i loved it  i was getting good pay  having a positive impact on the environment  and creating good connections with my coworkers  over the past 11 months however  the company has shifted further and further away from caring about its employees and more toward cutting excess and increasing profit   for example  11 months ago we had a shift lead and 7 other workers on our team  totaling 8 for our division  today  with an even larger workload and greater responsibilities than when i started  we have only 5 team members and no shift lead  as we are now directly managed by the ceo  whose favorite word is  efficiency   the work itself is my biggest gripe  it is hard  mind-numbingly repetitive physical labor  i m talking repeating the same 5 tasks thousands of times a week  and with fewer and fewer team members  more and more work is put upon the individual  i struggle with jobs that i do not feel i am learning and gaining experience in  within the first week of work i had exhausted all available wisdom   the only things keeping me tethered to this position are the pay  a little over 2x the minimum wage in my state  which isn t saying much  and the fact that it has been practically impossible for me to find an entry level position that i am passionate about without  2-3 years of experience   rant over  thanks for reading ,nvynph

2225,Rant / Confession,i just found this forum  i thought this was the best place to write what i want to say   i think it's mostly for people who are actually employed but honestly   anitwork  so    ----  this got really long but i don't care  i poured my heart and soul into it  now i know i needed to do this    ---   amp x200b   i really don't want to get a job   i'm going 31  american age  this year and i was never once employed in my life   am i unskilled  do i need to try harder  is it because i've never presented myself well enough  i wouldn't know  because i've never ever once in my lifetime submitted a resume to a company  not once   oh you say i must be a loser who can't even approach the gates  of hell  bit of a backstory  i'm korean  literally korean - i lived in the states for only about four years-ish   you know that asian stereotype about how we're all hardworking  diligent  and disciplined  well i passed a presitigious school in junior high  dropped out  got submitted to a nationally renown high school  dropped out again  i thought maybe the us might be different  so i went to a catholic school  nope  dropped out  people keep telling me it's a miracle that i got into one of the best universities in korea as a high school dropout  especially in korea  guess what  dropped out   didn't my family tried to kill me  sometimes i wish they did  sometimes i wish they were actually pure evil  then i could've just not given a shit about what they wanted  good grades  good employment  good wife  etc etc   i'm gay also  that really didn't help  especially not here  maybe then i could've just exploded and ended it all  suicide or murder or whatnot  what happened to me is not a result of a rebellion or a prodigy gone wrong  it's just a result of the elements of life pulling me in all directions  giving me conflicting messages  all just to make me a very productive and useful asset to society   thing is  i just don't get it   ever since a child i've been taught  especially from the us side mind you  in many ways  you're worse   that i will eventually find my bliss  do what you want to do  find something that you can do for the rest of your life that you can enjoy  and you wouldn't have to work a single day  huh  that's nice in theory  you know what  call me stupid  but i still want to believe in it  it's that bad   and then from the korean side  you constantly hear the exact opposite message  oh you already know  the asian stereotype  get beaten for low grades  get scolded for math  i was really lucky  i was already really good at math and english  i also have a mother who only used to beat me as a kid  and then got scared of me later  and just really wants me to live that asian dream life  doctor  lawyer  well paying job  traditional family  yeah i know that she really actually does love me  but sometimes i really wish she didn't   i hate both of you   there's one thing you don't know about asians  we complain the shit out of life  i mean  sure  it's obvious when you think about it  why would we not when we're expected to work and act like slaves  but you don't hear that one often do you  koreans  always working hard  always diligent  alwyas silent and docile  as if  we shit about our co-workers  our employees  our employers  our  work ethic  our hideous work hours  9-5   more like 9-11  and have the lowest work efficiency among all oecd countries   i've just heard so many horror stories  so many  i'm not gatekeeping on korea  please don't think that  i don't think the us is any better  but it's not about that  ever since i was a kid i did not see the reason to get a well paying job  i'm not gonna marry  you don't even allow gay marriage  i'm not going to have children  i can't and i won't  i don't even want a lot of materials in my life  i happily lived in a single room for 2 years just fine  all i need are my internet  music  and games   for what would i have to work 9-11s    you're not even a good society  you're capitalist for crying out loud  you're all about stuff i don't believe in  expensive cars  expensive food  expensive furniture  ridiculous fashion police  sure i do like a good looking house now and then but not 9-11 for the rest of my life worth good   not even 9-5  you can sacrifice a lot of that to help people but you don't  i don't care what you call me  your opinions do not matter in the slightest  you're evil  why would i have to work just to satisfy the bellies of people like you   i don't understand guys  i just don't   i don't want to get a job  my mom is like near literally dying for me to get a job but i just don't get it  i love you mom i really do but i will not sacrifice my life for  you  she says it's for my own good  lol  what are you even worrying about  i already told you i won't marry  she doesn't believe in it still  i don't need a palace or a family or a fashion wardrobe and i don't even have a refined palette  i have other way urgent needs and wants and they all have extremely loose connection to money  some of them none  why  i mean why  seriously why   why do i need to get a job   oh you think i'm lazy huh  you think i don't  like  work  well tell me  how many lazy people worked on their own game engine  how many lazy people has put in so much numerous hours into perfecting his skills on programming  composing  and art  when i do what i want to do  making what i want to make  whenever and however i like it  using whatever i method i choose to do  then suprise  i do it  how many can say they work 60 hours a week without any superior telling them to  i even exercise 5 days a week because i chose to  how many lazy people pull that off  tell me   i am not going to be a corporate slave   i dropped out of college to make games  i made a complete u-turn with my  career  focusing on doing only what i want to do  as you can tell i haven't been successful yet but i don't care  i'm still studying in so many areas  i'm still making games in the  most inefficient way possible  like i fucking care  mom has been begging me  coaxing me  even threatening me since then to use my new skills to at least submit a resume somewhere  well mom  1  i made a complete u-turn  remember  i'm still not that good enough 2  i don't really know about the us but korea really has some really stupid thing against hiring people over the age of 30 without a career  i mean way to go  like i care  and 3  i don't  want  to  get  a  corporate  job   everytime i work on something i want  i work  everytime i slightly give into their nasty idiotic mindset of  needing a job because your neck depends on it  no it doesn't  and work on something i don't want that can  build my portfolio  i just can't do anything   i sound like i'm one of those guys who have my own dreams and will follow it no matter what  it's not like that  when i make games  i'm not doing what i love  i do what i hate the least  i actually have another path i love more than making games or even playing games  it just doesn't pay  it's not even a job   bliss  yeah right  it's just that when i make games  i actually hate myself the least  in most days  i actually feel neutral about it  a lot of times i'm even proud of it  when i listen to songs i've written or pictures i've painted or even mini games or modules i've made over the years  i'm proud  yes  that work pride thing is not totally a myth  it does exist in reasonable amounts   i will throw what's left of all of that and more away when i get a job  i just know i will    amp x200b   why is it like this  why  and why don't people see it  i just don't understand guys  i just don't  i've been actually made to feel guilty about not working and not earning money and not contributing to the economy which has very little of what i want in return in the first place  why is everyone so materialistic  and most of all  why do i have to be the shunned and abnormal one because of your greed and indecency to humanity   why can't i just be left alone to work on what i want in peace  why do i constantly feel like i have to give into this idea of getting a job and  building a stupid portfolio  when i absolutely don't want and don't need it  the only plus side of me getting a job is to earn my money and get the hell out of this nagging place  so it's not a complete null option even now  but that is such  such a dumb reason  such a dumb fucking reason  just moving from one stupid prison to the next   what the fuck can i do except ignore the hell out of the rest of the world ,nug4vr

I want to relax, learn about the world and go on walks for the rest of my life.",i've been suffering from stress for years now  modern life sure has its comforts  but it also comes filled with neuroticism  slavery  and gaslighting  the best experiences i've had were escaping into fantasy  being on my own  working on personal projects  i could easily live 500 years if i had the freedom to just  be  sort to speak  and experience the world without the compulsion to slave for others  study  and stress constantly  and submit to the will of whatever authority that comes around   this pandemic has shown me that getting to even a bearable state of existence is very hard  the pressure never ends  and i'm not sure it's even possible for us millennials to reliably get a  chill existence  at all  it feels like a continuous grind  striving for more  getting more certifications  better grades  appearing more social  hiding your introvert personality  for a while now i've been thinking that i hated existence and consciousness  but in the end  i just hate the way society is structured  and how i don't ever seem to fit  i remember a time when i was happy with a simple videogame or a novel  now i can t find the will to even play with my friends  anhedonia  i keep asking myself  why  all the time  i don t feel like myself  just a corpse going through the motions  waiting for a chance to breathe again   why is society like this  we have all this technology  all of this knowledge  and still  we exploit each other  still  our quality of life goes down  still  we pollute our planet  the only place known to harbor life and sentience  we are so disconnected from everything it makes me cry  what could be a life of adventure turns out to be a life of worrying about an abstraction such as money  what could be a motivated  creative person turns out to be an alienated soul  forever escaping  instead of communities  we have cliques  competition  hatred  resentment  this is not a society in which i would be willing to participate  but sadly i never consented to any of this  i just reproduce the same sickening tendencies on my own  and i m too afraid to ever revolt or go and live a life of adventure   yeah  i m venting  i think many of you will be tired to hear these stories  but they are a tool  a map to analyze the spiritual collapse of our world  the complete lack of purpose  the ways in which we can not  deal with capitalism  i hope things get better one day ,nv4xa7

2269,How do I find work I actually enjoy?,i left my job a year ago mostly due to mental health issues but also due to covid  i was in healthcare  didn't want to deal with that on top of the mental health stuff  i moved back in with my mom as i didn't have any other options  i've been trying to find a new job but every time i look the dread of having to get up for work every day creeps back in  and i give up  i've left every job i've had because of mental health  getting to the point where i feel like it's a choice between quitting and suicide  thankfully i've been able to choose quitting every time so far   i just don't really know how to go about finding work that i might enjoy  especially because it's impossible to try certain jobs  requiring certain amounts of education experience etc  to see if i would like them  like  maybe i would absolutely love being a pilot  or ui ux designer  or physical therapist  or whatever  but how do i find out without first going through all the necessary schooling certifications etc and working in the field for at least a month or two  i know at a certain point i just need to pick something and try it but i find the decision incredibly debilitating   i do have some hobbies that might translate into work if i really try  but i'm worried if i do these things for work i'll come to hate them just like every other job     i know a lot of this can be traced to having depression and the resultant anhedonia  but i'm at a loss for how to overcome it  i've been dealing with depression dysthymia for more than a decade at this point  so it's hard to remember what it's like not to deal with it  and now i'm starting to feel like a failure for not being able to figure this out and relying on my mom for support  and not feeling like an  adult  which obviously isn't helping anything lol  so yeah  i just feel stuck and don't really know what to do about it   any advice would be welcome  thanks ,nunt3t
2270,The one thing I hate about work,it's the constant need for 'infinite growth' and i absolutely detest it    my boss is never happy just coasting or doing slightly better  it always has to be way better than last month or last year  and if it isn't  does he need to send me back to training  is there something wrong with my strategy  do they need to hire other people  do they need to outsource my job to someone else  it does nothing but stress me out   after a successful hard working month where we smash our targets  sometimes i just want to chill  maybe sometimes i do want to coast along and had an easy month  because i can't run on permanent infinite growth mode    when i first started this job 3 years ago i was so determined to change and improve things  and i did and it's better than ever  but as soon as you improve things your boss constantly demands better  and once you've exhausted it you feel like you have nothing left   i've lost all passion for this particular sector because i gave it my all  improved things drastically and now he just wants it to keep going up and up    it's starting to dawn on me that maybe 3 years is enough time to be at a company  you come in  make a big difference  then leave after it starts to stagnate because you can't work on permanent infinite growth mode ,nu8rmm

2296,"No, work is good.", if you guys actually want some financial advice  i ll give it to you   1 work nights  night shift is often way more relaxed and chill than day shift  and is always understaffed  meaning the employer is forced to pay a much higher amount to night employees than day employees  my last job paid literally double the pay rate of day workers to incentivize people to work nights  2 work weekends  let s be real you don t have plans on the weekend anyway  and as i mentioned before  there aren t as many people willing to work weekends  so employers who want that will pay more  3 do overtime  i don t know if it s the law  but every employer i ve seen pays time and a half for overtime  which really starts to add up if you pull like 10 hours over 40 per week  very valuable  4 don t buy shit you don t need  save money each week  pretty self explanatory   if you want help with a budget  dm me  even if you don t get paid extra for overtime weekends night shifts  you can still make lots of money ,nuquer

2298,Just about given up with my job. Need to search my options.,yesterday i had the worst experience with my fast food job i had for a year and a half now  sundays already run on a skeleton crew  but on that one we had 2 call offs that night  when the night manager comes in she's complaining about headaches  a pain reaching from her chest to arm  an eye feeling like it was drooping  and she couldn't lift her arm without feeling out of breath  these are all stroke symptoms so i urged her to get an ambulance  she eventually left and i'm still not sure if she went to the hospital    so now we only have 3 people and no manager  they should have closed the store right then and there as we were way too shorthanded to run the store on our own  but instead of doing that  our franchise manager told us to lock the doors and that we can close the store an hour early  we had to shut the food station down and only ran drinks  with the 3 of us scrambling the store to get orders done  this was fine for maybe an hour  then cars starting taking ten minutes to get through the drive thru  i reached my breaking point when the people at the window started laughing at us  i asked what was so funny  they said they're still waiting for their drinks  i stop what i'm doing and find one of the drinks  so i hand it out  i failed to realize the lid was only halfway on and they pointed it out  i explained how we are very short staffed at the moment and that we are all fucking stressed out  i was so stressed i was accidentally using curse words to customers and sounded incoherent  they were obviously unsympathetic and probably thought i was on drugs    on the verge of a mental breakdown  i walked to the back  screamed a bit in the walk in cooler  and put my fiance on the phone to vent about the situation  as i'm sitting in the office  the store phone rang  it was one of the customers in the drive thru asking what was taking so long to get through  i explained how we were very short staffed and how they refused to let us close the store or even send a manager to help  then suggested she should go to our sister location  she said someone should call our corporate center to complain about it  and i told her not to worry  that i was going to call myself  which i still plan on doing   eventually the girls working that night yelled for me and said i need to come back to help them  i tried to explain that if i went back to working that line i would have a nervous breakdown  and that if they can't run the line without me we should close the store now  they were unsympathetic  one of them saying the lines  it doesn't matter  its your job  more times than i could count  and i'm still having trouble deciphering it  how does my mental health not matter  how can this be worth it  when tensions rise and she demands i come back up front i explode in her face  she ended up calling a bunch of people  telling them i refuse to work under the current conditions  one of them was a shift leader who threatened to kick my ass if i left  i'm still not sure what to do about a blatant threat like that  another was the gm's wife since he was busy at the time taking a shower  apparently he said if that i don't keep working and stay an hour after my schedule to help close i would be fired  i had no choice but to keep working or lose the one source of income i had    this is probably what messed me up the most  the gm is usually a nice guy and we have had a positive relationship since i started working  i feel betrayed above all else  forcing me to stay an hour late was unethical  and i'm still trying to figure out if he's even allowed to do that  now i plan on calling sick on my next workday  but now i'm scared he will use that as a reason to fire me  i am ready to leave this hellhole once i get another job lined up  but not before  and i really don't want to have to go in quite yet  i really need more time to think about this situation ,nutrlx
2299,Companies pretend to care about the environment to save costs (greenwashing) and other empty boxes,i'm so tired of companies constantly talking about the environment and other empty talk  their sole existance is a catastrophe for the environment  so  but what's worst is that what they do is just greenwashing  it's just bla bla and they don't do anything actively for the environment  they will do things that save them money  at most  using less electricity  sending less e-mails  saves work hours and salary  cutting company cars  but they will never ever lower their precious production of useless stuff  useless marketing and contact  they will keep investing in the worst companies on earth  china    if they mention the environment again i will lose it  the funny thing is i'd be way happier working on a farm than in some exhaust fume expelling office in the city  or be a neo-ludite  and a simplist  who will never ever buy any of their stuff  when i see all these giant companies in cities  usually dark and empty  all i can think is  why do you even exist  you literally aren't doing anything  corona has exposed so many useless companies  one of them was wework and theranos  i also got a new appartment and instantly got an e-mail from a so called partner of a  well known provider who suggested me a country that seemed quite expensive  everyone tries to get rich off of nothing  i feel like everything is one big fraud  i wish we still had a full lockdown and only essential stores were open ,nuqdqg

2309,Wanting a new job,hi guys  currently called in sick and feeling guilty because i did a month ago  too  planning on probably going in later but definitely having a crisis right now  i really hate my job  and i hated my last one too  same field  lately i ve been thinking i d prefer something that is work-from-home so i don t have to deal with the public  i currently work four days a week and i love it  i can t imagine working five days a week  and to be frank i really want to work three if possible  thankfully my boyfriend helps provide a little more income than i do  so i have a little bit of wiggle room with my income but not much  i have a lot of experience in my current field so i make decent money  the problem is i want to at least try something new  i ve only had two different types of jobs in my past and hated both of them  i can t try something new without taking a huge pay cut though  i just feel extremely stuck and unhappy as most of us do  i m so happy and carefree on the weekends  and feel genuinely happy about life but as soon as sunday afternoon comes  i go into a deep depression  usually i can push through the week but lately every week just feels longer and longer and more unbearable than the last   this rant has been extremely all over the place but the bottom line is  do people who have worked in an office and from home prefer working from home  does anyone know of any work from home positions that pay decently and allow a flexible schedule   i know  very unrealistic question  i m just trying to figure out where to go from here and am so scared of taking risks  but every day i want to walk out on my current job but can t because i need the money ,nuhdwn

2314,"References are ruining my mental health just like having to explain gaps, help?",the thought of  having to  list references on my cv is one of the main reasons why i have anxiety  i've had good jobs but even there  there were very few bosses i could trust to give an objective reference about me  who knows what they will say  i tried to avoid this crap by asking for a written reference when i left but they ignore it  in my country  at least it's illegal for interviewers to call previous employers behind my back  but still    all these advise websites tell me to list references on my cv  so i did  but i feel like removing them all because i'm starting to freak out  most of my jobs were short and these people don't know me well at all  some of them were mentally unstable  i even left out some jobs cause i hated the place  there's where i have gaps instead  which i also  have  to explain but that's less of a problem for me because i realised it's none of their damn business and best i can do is  i was looking for work  that's all they are allowed to know about me   out of the 8 jobs i've had  i could only list 2 as a reference but one is of a job from 2018 and another of 2019  luckily a lot of companies don't really seem to bother asking for references  the thing is i switched function in 2020 and i hated it  i started slacking and becoming depressed so i don't think this period would even be relevant as a reference  i became a copywriter while i'm actually a lawyer  two completely different things  i want to be in the legal field again  maybe  and start over  definitely skipping those toxic job agencies  they have the biggest tendency to call an ex-employer and might even make you sign a document that you allow them to  and then they cold call your ex employer  yikes    so should we all just stop listing references  or list the ones from the past  i wish there was a law that stated that employers should write a written reference for every employer that leaves  and you sign it  and everyone agrees and is happy  it would solve so much ,nup3e3

Lets add to and spread this list to end companies taking advantage of vulnerable students.,these are some alternatives to unpaid internships  all you need is a bit of research skills on what the field you want to go into is  and if you have 6 months to be working for free  you have time to do these  - build a portfolio - have a blog  website - write a couple on topic articles - if its software related  help out on github open end projects - start your own company  - work on a project - read books - publish a book - start a youtube channel - work on your soft interview skills - practice presentation - interact with professionals who already do the job  directly on forums or read articles  - take free courses   companies know interns are just there to get people coffee  there is absolutely nothing an internship can offer you that you can t do on your own  with that being said  if you do have an internship put it as full time work on your resume ,nucrdu

2357,On the Basis of Repost Bots,i know many of you are frustrated with the current state of this sub in regards to massive amounts of reposts  the sad fact of the matter is that it is not just r antiwork that is having this issue  a quick jaunt over into r modsupport reveals that this is an issue moderators have been begging for help with for the past two months and have recieved no reprieve   the hard part in developing automod scripts to detect and remove bots is that the bots start understanding why they are banned and then try and circumvent   this new wave of bots are from accounts that were created from 4 months to over a year ago  they seem to all be waking up at once and finding top level posts  top level comments and reposting the to farm karma    this is bad for reddit for two plausible reasons  farming karma serves two purposes  us  the users often times will look at a person's account and see how much karma they have as a virtue signal of trust  let's say these bots are designed to farm tons of karma and then bombard country specific and political subs to try and alter public opinion surrounding an election  or they go into financial subs and try to pump up the value of an unstable crypto or stock so they can sell high before a big bust  what i'm trying to get at  is that these bots are not only a nuisance  but they are possibly dangerous   sadly we've had posts reach the front page that have been made by these bots and recieved thousands of upvotes before removal  we can't take away that karma from them  reddit wouldn't allow that for obviously good reasons  but now they have it  if they're strategic  out of these thousands of bots  they get us to miss 1 or 2 that really take off  those are now two high value accounts that can be bought and sold to the highest bidder and used to manipulate   i know this post has been long but i'd like to end it with some tips on what patterns we've seen with these bots and what to do before interacting with a post   1  username patterns are emerging every day and constantly changing  the two most common current patterns are u  namename  typically feminine names  and then u  word kshekosiejjejhejdjdbwjsj  but the random letters at the end are always a different keyboard smash pattern  2  the accounts are 4  months old with some being more than a year old   3  the awarder karma is always 0  these bots aren't giving out awards so they are right at 0   4  the posts are reposts and the comments are lifted from other top level comments  these are harder to spot unless you're a die hard fan of the sub  5  they typically only post to two to three specific subreddit's within minutes of one another  this may be a way to help them lay low    i know that yinz are just as stressed and frustrated as i am with these bots  it is making reddit a hard place to browse when the front page of the internet isn't even half human anymore  right now  the best things users can do is report accounts and be vigilant with which posts you interact with  before giving out your free reward or paid rewards check the account and see if it's a bot  hopefully this can get fixed soon but right now we're all in this together  a phrase i know all of you live to hear after these past 15 months   please be patient with us as we are trying our absolute best to remove them  try not to interact with bot posts and report them as spam to us ,nup46h

2361,Perception is King,after a couple of months of building a case for a salary bump  i finally went and proposed it to my boss  for the past 6 months  due to engineering staff reductions  i have taken on the better part of two additional positions with no increase in pay  this was under the direction that we will eventually replace these positions  and it is only temporary  as usual  this turned out to not be true  the rebuttal to my salary increase was that a salary bump wasn't possible due to low sales  and that i don't commit enough extra time to work and only work the  bare minimum  aka leaving on time  after inquiring further  i was told that since i leave at 5 10pm every day  my official quitting time is 5pm  and not something closer to 5 30pm  i will never have the opportunity to climb the corporate ladder at this company  i asked if there were any issues with my work  which the answer was no  but  my boss said that if someone needed my help on something at 6pm  i wouldn't be here to assist  i asked if that has ever happened in the past year i've worked here  and he said no  i asked if he ever heard any complaints that i don't support other departments  inside or outside of work  and again he says no  being salaried  i have my cellphone number plastered all over my emails  and have taken many calls outside of normal work hours  after telling him this  he says he knows  but the perception by upper management is that i don't put forth the extra time to complete tasks  so i said  ok  has there ever been a time where i have been late for a project or have not put forth my best effort to complete tasks and again he says no  at this point our meeting was cut short by another meeting  so instead of leaving feeling much better at my current situation  i left feeling frustrated  after sitting at my desk  i realized that if that is the only reason they will not promote me to a leadership position  than that is their loss  i will not sacrifice my free time for a huge  what if  situation that i may or may not be promoted  i will not spend my weekends at work like a good drone chasing the carrot on the stick  this is why i am anti-work    amp x200b   tldr  during a request for a salary increase  my boss said that since i only stay an extra 10min past the end of my work day instead of something closer to 30 min  i will never be considered for promotions in this company due to the upper management perception that i don't work hard enough  although having evidence on projects that prove the contrary ,nugeld

you're just going to have to fucking pray that you don't  you're going to spend the next  best 50 years of the physical prime of your life working  coz if you don't you'll be homeless  hungry and probably sick and die  you'll work 40-50 hours a week and get paid less than the value you generate  because that is how businesses work  all the while you're expected to make it look like you're privileged to have this opportunity to not starve and die out on the street  if you die before you can access retirement age  well sucks to be you  should have lived long enough to take advantage of all that tax you chose to pay your whole life huh  but even if you make it to retirement age  and don't have any debilitating diseases affecting your mind or body  you will spend the final years of your life having finally the time and money but not the ability to do the things you've wanted to your whole life  skiing trip  forget about it  travelling around the world  maybe climbing everest  no fucking way  you're just there to witness your body slowly fall apart and if you're lucky spend some time with the friends who haven't passed away and your family when they can be bothered to visit you  i'd probably nope the fuck out of that agreement right there   just how we know that having to do something - anything  makes it a chore - the freedom to explore and enjoy  your life can only come once you have achieve financial independence - unless of course happened to be plopped out of the right vagina into a family where everything is handed to you   i once had this absolute prick of a boss who was so fucking full of himself he treated everyone else below him on the corporate ladder like utter shit  blaming you for his mistakes  lying about work related issues  or just being a rude dick  more than once  the way he spoke to me i wanted to say  fuck you prick  punch him and leave  but i'd put up with it  tell myself i need that job and he's not that bad  even though i'd spend my morning commute hoping the train crashed just so i wouldn't have to go to work that day   this was a long time ago now  but  it still makes me seethe  and i never want to be in that position again  thankfully i'm a fair way along in my goal of getting fuck you money  so hopefully i won't have to   fuck you money means different things to different people  for some it means having enough money  to say  fuck you  and walk off when your job puts you in an unacceptable situation without having to worry about starving or becoming homeless because you have a few months or a years worth of expenses saved up and you could take your time to find a job you really liked  for others  fuck you money may mean having enough never to have  to work again  ever  this also falls under the fire financial independence  retire early  movement that is really popular right now for good reason  that's not to say these people want to sit around and do nothing forever more  although there is nothing wrong with that  it's just that people want to work on what they want to do  for the amount of time they want to do it   on the days they want to do it on   imagine for a minute  a world where everyone had a fuck you fund and with it the power  at any point  to walk away from their job if you didn't like the way your boss behaved  or if you were overworked  or you simply wanted a change  it would make the world such a better place  it would force bosses to treat everyone with respect and fairness  imagine if you had fuck you money today  would you still want to be in the same job or would you look for a new job  or even go back to studying  learn some new skills  do charity work or just retire   while obviously we can't make this change happen on a global scale as great as it would be  but we can  at least make sure we and the people around us that we care the most about have the financial independence that comes with having fuck you money  so start working towards it today   you can not know what you want to do with your life and what your life's work will be until you can stop worrying about survival  there is a reason the greatest philosophers  artists and athletes tend to come from wealthy backgrounds  they're free from the feeling of dread that accompanies each day we have  the hatred of the very thing we so desperately need to survive   obviously deciding to work towards fuck you money and actually getting there are two different things  i'll be creating a new post to help others like i've been helped and hopefully  you too will start to see some light at the end of this fucking horrifying tunnel that doesn't involve having wasted the majority of your life generating value for a corporation and it's shareholders ,nt9x3i

2433,"The Current Rhetoric Surrounding ""Labor Shortages"" is just a negotiating tactic.",    please read    disclaimer  i am not an expert on economics  most of this comes from understanding rhetoric and how media manipulation works  there is a lot of attention on labor shortages right now  mostly stemming from pictures circulating of stores hanging disclaimer signs about lack of staff and retail chains offering sign-on bonuses and incentives  in addition  we have gov abbot of texas ending unemployment benefits in his state to encourage people to return to work  and montana and south carolina following suit  these are all in the media to force people to go back to work through negotiating tactics  i m going to talk about why we need to fight these tactics  this is going to be a long analysis  with a lot of tangents  so buckle up    1  no one is willing to make structural change yet  their  desperation  is disingenuous    think about this  if workers had any more leverage than they currently do  there would be actual incentive in hiring  but there isn t enough leverage yet to make real change  there was an ice-cream shop that changed their wage to  15 an hour and got 1000 s of applicants  and  adjusted for inflation  the dollar purchasing power  it s still not a great wage  but it was enough to attract a large enough pool that they could choose anyone they wanted  this benefited the company because it creates trust in the employers  makes them distinct from other businesses  gives them positive attention  and saves them costs from turnover rates  now why aren t other companies taking this approach   2   zombie  companies are looking for workers to offload debt and blame onto    forced structural change from covid-19 caused  fear  and  panic  in corporate america  first off  supply shortages and corporate debt became highly stressed   it s why you see the rhetoric right now that we all have to go back to work  to the offices  and can t keep the benefits we reaped from working at home  we saved money from commuting  got more control over family life  and saved more time  but it wasn t as directly profitable  and gave us the more control over our lives  so it s being attacked    as for why companies with supposed labor shortages aren t just raising their wages to attract a larger hiring pool   i believe it s because  they don t have the capital  this sounds ridiculous  right  how would they not have capital if executives are making 100 s times more than their employees  it s because since before covid-19  companies already had this factored into their structure  finding the cash for executives is a given  but finding it for employees caught them off-guard  they didn t know how they would be forced to increase wages to attract employees  they can take on more debt  but they can t lose revenue because many companies are already massively in debt  and only alive because of share prices  why would walmart be offering free phones to employees instead of higher wages  think about it  rather than considering working for a low wage  let me point out the obvious   3  it costs more to work than to not work    let s go to the absolute lowest that we should even consider raising the minimum wage to   15 an hour  you have to work 100 hours for a baseline of  1500  let s say you live in denver  more expensive i know  but i want to give an example on the higher end  if you work 40 hours a week  you make in a month  2400  after income tax it is  2288 88  subtract an average rent in denver  1200  for  1088 88  gas on average is  250 per month   838   average cost of food per month  387   451  after utilities  phone  any debt payments  costs of living  you would be lucky to have any money left to save  you making  15 an hour will still net you debt  but this is not all    you lose money by going to work  it costs you in time  that was 160 hours of your life that you reaped almost no benefit from  it will cost you in your health  in trading off time to a company that doesn t care about your wellbeing for time you could have been doing other things  it took you from your family  from any side-gigs or self-employment  it cost you your humanity if you work in retail or warehouse work  it was not profitable for the time you gave away  you were forced to adopt their wage and their burdens  and you were responsible for any liabilities you took on as a worker  in actuality  a homeless man panhandling is netting a higher profit than your average retail worker  if they aren t giving you a raise  you are losing money to inflation  the dollar is losing its value and i wouldn t be surprised if more companies start paying us in alternative currencies   4  they don t really want workers    again  there is no labor shortage yet  this current trend is the media and corporate america smelling blood in the water and attempting to coerce us  don t  for any reason  give up unemployment for slavery  it is better to be in-control and hold out  i can t share my political opinions on all of this  but i believe it is better for us to take care of our friends and family who are struggling than to encourage them to sell their lives to a corporation  if you have enough  i encourage you to help with the costs of living others may be struggling with  as long as we can circulate the money between who we know than to allow any more money to be absorbed into the debt of failing corporations    think about this  how can there be a labor shortage when companies are still incentivized to lay off workers  most have not prioritized workers in any meaningful way  here is the truth   workers are a liability for them  they do not want to hire anyone  they want us to work for nothing  all of this is a game to get us back under their control  i ll end it by saying that we must hold the line  they will start playing psychotic games  blaming us for their failures  and yet  offering more incentives   it is all a trick  stay strong and do your best to survive with the money you have ,ntxsy3

it is familiar and comfortable and at some level you feel it is what you deserve - there's no shame in this  but it is something that you need to work on to get on with your life   so how do you work past this  luckily you can start with the 5 actions below    treat yourself as you would  someone asking you for help  imagine a close friend  or member of your family came to you with a problem that has been plaguing their life for a long time  they are miserable and can't stop thinking about it - negative feelings fill their days and nights due to this problem  i imagine you would set aside everything else immidately  listen to their problem in details  give them a constructive way to solve said problem and then follow up with them to help them through it   what you wouldn't do is blame them  tell them how stupid they are to be in this position and that they should have done something sooner and it's way too late now- but then why do you say these things to yourself everyday   treat yourself as a priority  think about yourself  your problems  what you want to work on and how you should go about it without free from judgement and negativity  you are your harshest judge but you need to afford yourself the very basic courtesies you would to anyone else   once you learn to follow this on a regular basis it will make a powerful change to your life  and rapidly too  this is because any advice you give others  while meaning well  it will always be based on incomplete information but when you apply this exercise to yourself it will have insights no one else can give you    practice saying  no   is there someone to whom just the idea of saying  no  to makes your blood run cold  maybe it's your domineering boss or a strict parent  do you see yourself as a  nice guy  who doesn't want to  be a bother  and always goes along with what your friends partner family want to do  whether it be where to go on dinner or what movie to see or even where to go on holiday   you may tell yourself you don't really care or that you're just happy going with the majority but the reality is each time you don't speak up on what your inner desire  deep down you feel just a little bit bad   this feeling of repressing yourself compounds and can get lead to negative consequents  when you say no  you're telling yourself that what you want matters  yourself and others around you will respect you more  just to be clear  it doesn't mean you need to always get your way  win every argument or only ever go to dinner to a place you choose - you just need to express yourself stop repressing your true feelings and just that simple act   in and of itself will create a positive feedback loop within yourself to stop repressing your emotions  leading to a happier  healthier you   make changes in your life you've been avoiding due to fear of judgement  think about how  if you did not care what people thought of you  how would you live your life differently try not to focus on the past  just on what changes you would like to make and what obstacles you may face in doing so   for example  if i wanted to stop drinking but i'd be worried about how i'll explain it at the weekly work outings  what reason would i give to those asking me why i'm not drinking  i might worry  will they think i'm an alcoholic trying to cut back  or  will they resent me for trying to preach about cutting back  - and for that reason  just to avoid this   i might just end up drinking and tell myself  it's just this one night    you see how easy it is to rationalise not making changes to your life for fear of judgement - this can be incredibly harmful in the long run for your physical and mental health   what exactly this is  will of course vary from person to person  but what is true is that just identifying how you want to change your life and what is stopping you from doing so is an important first step in actually doing so   surround yourself with people who have the qualities you want yourself to have   for better or for worse  people end up becoming like the company they keep  you've probably heard this before but it merits repeating for good reason   more than anyone else  people are influenced by their closest friends  this is because advice from most sources is unwelcome  even intrusive when compared to just normal conversation and feedback with your best friends  your views and habits are influenced disproportionately by those of your friends than any other source   this can of course be a double edged sword  if you have a friend who smokes  you yourself are 61  more likely to be a smoker yourself  this goes for a lot of things  including happiness  health and confidence among other things - so take a look around and make sure you're in the right surroundings    plan  prepare  pratice   there is a reason that virtually everyone tasked with dealing with customers  whether it be telemarketers  salesmen or it support have pre-made scripts that they follow   it gives them confidence and structure which is important to achieve your goals   whatever you want to do or achieve  structure a plan on how to go about it  prepare a series of actions that will let you carry out that plan and practice doing the actions on your list - now do them again  over and over again until you're so confident in these actions that you've ingrained them in your subconscious  you should be able to do them without thinking about them  once you've done this  you will undoubtedly achieve your goal   it's as simple as that - overthinking and over-preparation are  shockingly  the bane of a lot of people who want to make changes to their lives - practice your life until it becomes your life   i hope these help you - and if you'd like feel free to reach out and leave a comment about your experiences and read more of my work  here https retiredecadesearly com ,nu1hbb

2468,Defending a system that allows homelessness and forces parents to take care of their kids into adulthood makes you a leech to society,funny how so many people have it backwards  they think parents being forced to take care of their 18  year olds is disgusting and unfair  and the  solution  according to them is for us to literally take part in the system that allows it in the first place  our entire argument is that capitalism allows immoral situations to occur  and we need to do everything we can to stop it     taking part in it is the worst possible thing someone who wants to help stop it can do   i know even a lot of people here don't agree with that  but i will forever stand by it  it's  their  system  and i feel no obligation to take part in it to make up for the fact that it allows immoral shit to take place  by defending it they're literally helping extend the amount of time that parents all across the world are forced to be in such a unfair situation    stop trying to victimize people who cannot work or simply are not supporters of your system  there are  always  going to be people who either can't work  or outright refuse  so if your response to the inevitable is that we should all do nothing  then really  you're the leech ,ntatwu

2490,A bit of commentary about my WFH experience,so  ever since lockdowns had started in my area  somewhere in germany  last year  i got some wfh experience and it was absolutely miserable  i was initially doing job training for it last spring when i was 16  and my boss expected me to work 8 hours a day 5 days a week at home for some reason  which i find very stupid  it later turned out that none of my workmates had woken up at 7 30am like our boss had wanted to  i didn't either  and i don't manage to wake up before 10am at the moment anyways   there was also some table or something like that online  y'know  in a link my boss had sent to me  in which i had to put in how many hours i worked each day  which i find weird  the second lockdown through last winter became absolutely miserable by six weeks in  with a third lockdown from late april through late may which i found quite annoying  i later figured that i don't expect to work more than six hours a day in a workplace away from home  and three or four hours a day at most if i have to work from home  i also figured that i will set a certain work quota each day  and log off once i'm finished with the work quota  i will elaborate on that last part in my next post,nsc1jc

2506,"I don't get how people still have a social life, work on themselves, &amp; spend time with family while working full time?",im literally burnt out everytime i end work for the day  i graduated college 2 years ago  landed my first full time job and have been miserable  struggling to be a functional human ever since  i work remotely so i am thankful for that but since i started working ive begun to realize how little time i have to myself now outside of work  and during those hours im not working  i truly feel like those hours dont fully belong to me because i have to plan what i do during those hours with my work schedule in mind  for example  i can't stay out with friends too long on a weeknight because i have work the next day  if i want to work on  myself or my side hustle  i have to say no to seeing friends for a few nights  if i want to see my family  i have to say no to working on myself or seeing friends  with such little time outside of work  it comes down to picking and choosing who i spend my time with and who i don't spend my time with and how long i can spend with them while tryign to balance other things  i dont feel free anymore  im exhausted and miserable everyday  i have lots my motivation for many things i once loved because i dont have much time for it anymore  i dont hate my job  its not extremely stresful  but just having to do the same thing for so many hours per day  every day of the week  with so little free time to  myself and being exhausted during that free time makes me so sad  as each day passes i feel like so much time is being stolen from me  i was not meant to live like this  nobody is  and i cannot see myself being able to handle this for 40 something more years  i want more out of life than this and i am bitter about the situation enough to create a pathway to change  i am picking up a skill that i hope to make money with soon  but its difficult to work on it when im drained from work and have many other responsibilities i need to take care of  i just dont get how so many people are okay with this  of course i understand there are people who love their 9-5 and feel purpose there  but for me  its not it  ive tried different part time jobs too  those arent fulfilling  all jobs sap the energy out of me and if i switched jobs to something that paid higher  the exhaustion it will bring and the time i have to trade for that money wont be worth it  i just want to live comfortably on my own terms  without having to answer to a boss that doesnt care about me in the end and without having someone controlling what i do for 8 hours per day  life is such a cruel joke ,nskmm6
2507,My quitting experience from emergency travel to emergency roadside.,i worked for a company that rhymes with bbb  i was hired to train to become a travel agent in june 2019  i worked at the corporate headquarters for my region handling online travel and phone requests for travel from 1pm-10pm est  it was fantastic learning everything there was to learn about booking travel and traveling  i got the job to support my love of travel and make hella commission on selling cruises and tours  the training was intense and i learned fairly quickly  i was finished with the most basic training within two months but was not allowed to book anything for another two months  so while my colleagues were making boat loads i was making about 3 dollars in commission for every hotel booking  it was frustratingly slow  i could have been using my time to build my business  for whatever reason my boss decided to hold us back for a very long 6months  only booking hotels  oh and by the way you had to make over 2k in comission before you saw anything in your pay check  during this time i had many friends and family members look for vacations i couldnt help them with so they refused to book with bbb   when the pandemic hit we had to rush to become work from home  travel took a nose dive and instead of figuring out that they needed travel advisers to handle their bookings that were getting canceled and figuring out everything with the vendor for the customer they fired all but like 3 out of  15 travel agents in that office  that was february 2020  some of us were lucky to be hired by the customer service center and were able to keep using our work from home set ups  we are trained very quickly to handle  emergency roadside  membership management  internet support  insurance claims  hotel bookings  very different style than i learned in travel  car care appointment booking  triptik and tour book ordering  ect  its a lot  im averaging 100 calls a day at a 3min service call 5min customer service call time  im exhausted  there is no leaving the house  the only place i can work is in my room  i always feel like im at work and never at home  i start feeling suicidal and we were given 125 hours in pto to take for the year  when the vaccines came out my discord family decided we would all get vaccinated and go stay at a cabin in the woods in about 6 months  i tell my supervisor about the trip they are excited for me  i try to request the time in advance  say i have to wait till 3 months out to request time off  thats fine  three months is april 2021  april comes  try to request off  days are green no one as taken them  awesome  put in the request  denied  ok what the fuck  email the work  hours department  email back    short staffed dont have enough hours to have someone take time off  ok  how is that my problem  im requesting time in advance you will have plenty of time to figure it out    supervisor monthly meeting we go over performance and i tell them about my vacation not being approved  they decide to go over the attendance policy  1 day  1 point  every day you call out if you dont have it scheduled  10 points and youre fired  my vacation is about 8 days but i was going to take a few days before hand to move into my new apartment  10 days    so basically ill be fired if i take the vacation i planned 6 months in advance even though i have the pto  all because the company didnt want to hire any more people    decided to quit that day  got hired at a company that pays way more and for just selling lighting and working on online orders  dropped my two week notice in an email and they immediately terminated me so id be two weeks without pay  awesome  i move in to my new apartment  everything is ready for my vacation and we drive up to the cabin  im so happy and stress free i can actually enjoy my vacation    tldr  got fired from travel and hired as ers sales claims it support same company  they would not allow me to take my vacation even though i requested months in advance  they said it was due to staffing shortage say ill be fired if i go on the vacation anyway   so i quit  got hired somewhere else getting paid more and doing far less  actually got to enjoy my vacation ,ns5u8d

2548,My general work experience thus far,so  in my previous post i talked about my experience with remote working aka wfh  work-from-home  in this post  i will expand to my general work experience  last year  after the first lockdown had ended last may  i attempted to clock out at 3 pm because that's what i knew at the time  however  i was stopped and told that i have to ask the boss if i can leave  which made me feel awkward  when i asked my boss if i could leave at 3 pm  he told me that i could stay there through the night    later  the work i was doing became too confusing and i eventually became bored as i couldn't finish my work  so i resorted to just browsing reddit all day as i didn't have the courage to just go home  i guess i didn't want to feel awkward again  so that may have factored into that   after that  i just continued browsing reddit all day  y'know  when i managed to complete my work that time around  so a young woman who was with me at the time  a supervisor iirc  told me to ask for more work from the teachers  which also felt awkward  i did it reluctantly after resisting slightly  and i feel dumb for that now   last september  i was literally raging  as i randomly got a power-tripping woman appointed to be in charge of me  and she was just so freaking annoying  she appeared to be in her 60s  so i guess that she's a boomer  not sure why i added it in this post lol   finally  i tried to do the assigned work my way with like 12 attempts mid-october  and every single one of them failed  that's when i realized i was backed into a corner  so i threw a fit  and then left afterwards    i wouldn't ask my boss if i could leave or tell him i wanted to leave because i wouldn't have it with the same response as before  and also it just felt awkward first time around  and i wasn't having that either   i later figured that i will set my own quota for work to do each day instead of asking for more work once i'm done  since the latter is just unbelievably annoying ime,nt3jpi

2551,"Why ""Do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life"" is absolute bullshit that will ruin your life.",since i was young  my dad always told me  follow your passion  and not to worry about earning money since it'll come if you are good at what you do   on the surface  this makes a lot of sense right  i spent a lot of my life following that advice  i've been great with computers since i was a kid  i spent all my pocket money from the age of 11 onwards buying computer magazines  memorising computer  tips and tricks  and being fascinated about the latest developments in technology   at the age of 15 i worked a summer job assembling and networking dozens of computers at a local  cyber cafe  remember those  i spent my days helping people with issues  troubleshooting computer problems and generally enjoyed myself   after a couple of weeks though  i realised i began dreading my time at the cyber cafe  this wasn't a fun activity anymore that i chose to pursue at my leisure  it was something that i had to do  every day  and what's worse i didn't get to choose when i did it  the problem with having your  passion  attached to your job is that  now  it's no longer a choice  you have to do it  every  single  day  for at least 8 hours a day   no one likes being forced to do anything  doesn't matter what it is  the fact that you're forced to do it takes the fun out of it  don't believe me  imagine something you absolutely love doing  it could be anything  but lets pick sex   getting paid to have sex as a man would be a dream come true right  you spend your days having sex with many  different  beautiful women  and you're thinking - hah no way am i getting sick of this   but one day  you want to leave early  you'd like to have only 7 hours of sex today  but you can't  you have to stay  you're forced to stay for the whole 8 hours  even though you don't want to be there  i promise you  that 8th hour  is going to feel absolutely fucking terrible   no one likes feeling powerless  and that's exactly what is happening to us 40-50 hours a week  every week  we aren't donating this time out of the goodness of our hearts  we need to do this activity to survive - it's not out of choice   but you know people that really genuinely do enjoy their work  these people are either delusional who've convinced themselves this is the case as a coping mechanism and are suffering from stockholm syndrome or they have fuck you money  meaning they actually are there out of choice  and if they wanted to  could just say  fuck you  to their boss and quit on the spot rather than do something against their will like work unpaid overtime - which i am sure everyone reading this has done at some point  things change when you have fuck you money and that is a subject worth talking about in-depth on its own   what ends up happening when you make  your passion  your job is that you end up not only dreading an activity you used to once love  you lose something that used to be your escape from work which you now no longer have  the reality is that as long as we are forced to do work to survive  it doesn't matter what kind of work it is  the sheer fact that you are forced to do it everyday without choosing your own terms makes it fucking unbearable   so  for your own sake  face reality  recognise work for what it is  an unavoidable reality where we trade labour for means to survive - and don't let it corrupt your enjoyment of whatever you're passionate about ,nskclk

2587,Indeed.com keeps rejecting my honest 1-star review of my old crappy job. Ill just post it here then,locations and personal details will be redacted    i worked in the  location redacted  branch for just under 3 years before i was let go due to downsizing  this job is a dead-end endeavor and you will be wasting your time working here  there is no potential for advancement within the company  no overtime  reduced work hours when theres not a lot of work  no potential for a raise  and the benefits are very basic  my mental health took a huge toll at this job with my time here  many things over the course i worked here had to be axed because management realized they can get away with treating their employees like robots   favoritism among specific staff was very apparent  you cannot talk at all during work and you will be let known of it if you do  except if you're a favorite  you will be lectured by upper management for being less than 5 minutes late to work or leaving work 5 minutes early  despite there being nothing to work on  staff belittles other staff  and sometimes they get chewed out pretty brutally for small and trivial errors  they do not care about the wellbeing of their employees and will extract as much labor out of you as they are able   there is no training at all for your specific position  in this case mine was document scanner  literally just given a sheet of paper with instructions  you are left with no understanding at all of what you're supposed to do in the grand scheme of things  no idea about the hardware you're using  as well as the software  and told the very basics of how to do the most basic operations of the machine to facilitate the project you're supposed to scan and nothing more  then if any issues cropped up with the documents or machine  you were left in the dark and forced to walk up ask questions  sometimes the supervisor is not there so you can get left stranded sometimes  it took me a lot longer than it should have how to entirely operate the machine  because they don't have enough people or time to properly train their staff on the plethora of random things situations that can potentially come up  sometimes  you are left in the dark on purpose for a specific error  issue or task you need being done  and have to walk up and ask the supervisor  simply because the error is out of your job position experience  management is uncoordinated and nobody has the patience to sit down for a few minutes and teach me how to operate a piece of software that other people who have been in the company longer  and also have the same position as me  know how to use   heres a specific example  the job requires the file name to be exact and proper for the client  if i   a document scanner  make one small typo for the files i have to scan  that's potentially thousands of files outputted that have to be renamed  which is a very time consuming process to rename them one by one  the windows 7 operating system does not have the ability to let you bulk rename files  there is software that allows you to bulk rename files  i have to  every time there i make a small typo  walk up and ask my supervisor to use the software for me to bulk rename the files  sometimes the supervisor is not there  and i'm stuck with a folder full of wrongly named files that need renaming    if they had just sat down with me for 5 minutes  once  and taught me how to use the program  then i'd never have to walk up and ask for their help or worry about the supervisor not being there when i need assistance   two months into me working here  i made a trivial error where there is a label on the entire stack of physical documents that demarcate a specific chunk of documents within the whole stack to be scanned double sided  and not all single sided  nobody trained me on that when i was working here for the first two months  then immediately when i make the mistake of scanning the whole stack single sided  i get written up for poor job performance and got scolded and blamed for messing something up that i wasn't even trained on or let known in the first place    they don't have the time  patience or energy to help you get a better understanding of your job and train you  but have plenty of energy to quickly jump on you if you do wrong  even the slightest  certain staff have belittled me and made me feel stupid several times for asking questions or trying to get a better understanding of certain aspects of my position  there was a lot of condescension and a overall additute of superiority among higher staff  like to them i am a child who needs every detail explained thoroughly  it's very infantilizing and patronizing   you often have to do the work of two people in one job  the machines constantly break and they will keep repairing them until they completely break down at the expense of the safety of employees  there a days where this job erodes your mental health and you will get very angry and stressed out with the machines because they will keep breaking down  with the combination of both workload  the machines having issues  and the prep quality of the work coming to you  it makes you feel hopeless and out of control some days   there was little to no overtime preceding covid-19 and they reduced hours significantly if there was not enough work to go share between the whole company  sometimes you're left doing very menial tasks like sweeping  wiping down desks  folding letters  etc  and having to pretend to work  simply because you are not allowed to leave when there is nothing  it's very degrading to your self worth as a human being  sometimes you get full days off because of the lack of work which i prefered  as i'm better off doing literally nothing than sweeping a warehouse for 8 hours   the only thing i regret not doing when working here was quitting earlier  this job has taken an absolute toll on my physical and mental health over the time working here  and the only way to make myself feel better for all the time i've wasted  is warning people to not make the same mistake that i did  i apologize for not being professional as i wanted  but if you were at where i was at  you would feel the same way ,nt1mpe

2597,Anyone who is just anti-work?,i'm pretty sure this post is gonna get downvoted into oblivion  but whatever  last time  i saw a lot of people complaining about the  ancaps  on this subreddit  so here is my response   so you see  i hate work  work makes me miserable  admittedly  i am a very privileged man  as i'm a software developer working from home  but 40 hours is still too much for me  i am also privileged to live in a country where i receive 21 days of annual leave plus 10 government-assigned mandatory holidays  something all the americans would kill for   but i still feel miserable  now  i wasn't happy before wageslavery either - i have been depressed for 9 years before that  and if i had my way  my only interaction with human society would be buying groceries  because i am antisocial and ultra-introverted  but it was still such a huge downgrade in my quality of life  before that  my life was browsing the internet till 3 am  i'm a night person  waking up at 11 am  eating lunch  spending the rest of my day petting my cat  playing video games and browsing the internet  compared to that  having to wake up at 7 am to commute to work  then coming home at 7 pm  because commute on public transport takes 2 hours  so 9-to-5 really was 7-to-7 for me  was a huge downgrade  i was already depressed before  but this made me even more depressed  even after we switched to remote work  i still resent work   well  that was an overly long segue   what i wanted to say is  i came to this subreddit assuming that anti-work just means anti-work  hatred towards the concept of full-time employment  and a desire to make work optional  e g  via a universal basic income  however  much to my disappointment  what i found is a subreddit full of hardcore communists who believe that you can't be anti-work without also being anti-rich  without wanting to redistribute all the wealth  without ending free enterprise  without beheading everyone who has a net worth over  1000   who else on this subreddit is anti-work  in the literal sense of the word  without anything extra  but still thinks that capitalism can be salvaged  e g  via a universal basic income that covers the basics  or just simply wants to make work optional without the need to eat the rich   who else on this subreddit is just anti-work in the literal sense of the word  without anything extra   and to all the hardcore leftists on this subreddit  if the rich offered you to make a compromise  not saying that it'd happen  just saying   hypothetically  and implement a universal basic income that covers the basics  while automating away all the unpleasant work - why wouldn't you accept it   isn't the goal to abolish forced wageslavery ,nsq1ki

2609,I feel like there is only one way out,i ve been thinking about this a lot lately  i just graduated university  so i m  coming into adulthood  now  and the daunting idea of paying income tax  housing tax  bills  healthcare etc  essentially paying to be alive  is looming ever closer   when i was younger  i had so many dreams of how my adult life was going to be  the adults around me at the time were all so optimistic  and made me believe i could be and do whatever i wanted to do  i was very self assured and confident in my future  but now that i am actually living in that future  and am in that adult world  i feel hopeless  the fact that to be a person you have to slave away in a shitty job  wasting your limited time on this earth  to earn a bare minimum just to stay alive is  horrendous  the fact that basic necessities like food  water  shelter and healthcare aren't free is atrocious    our society has made it so that even a simple and regular life is basically unattainable  even if you work 9-5  5 days a week  you still wont be able to afford more than bare minimum  wtf is up with that   freedom is unachievable  recently i ve just been wanting to escape to the countryside and become self sustained  but even that costs a lot of money  and would require years and years and years of working in an unhappy miserable career   you have to work and be a wage slave in society  or society doesn t want you  if you choose not to work and go on benefits  everyone else looks down on you and sees you as an undesirable leech  the only way to be truly free of all this is to exit society  and the only way to exit society is to commit suicide  but even that is frowned upon and seen as a horrendous thing to do  it was once a criminalised act  because they dont want people to exit society  they want everyone to remain as cogs in their system  without freedom  they dont want people to feel as if they have a way out   honestly though i am starting to see suicide as the only option  i dont want people here to take pity on me saying that  or think i am making a cry for attention etc etc  i literally just think suicide is the only way out of a capitalistic world  i dont want to participate in this society that has been set up  i dont want to work everyday for the rest of my life  but i also dont want to starve or be homeless  so what other option do i have   i hate that this feels like my only option  i was so excited for the future  so excited for my adult life  but the harsh reality has slapped me in the face and its incredibly stressful and upsetting,nraxw4

2617,How to avoid working for someone else FOREVER., amp x200b   greetings   i recently joined this group after it was pointed out to me over at zerohedge   it was one of those articles where the op was bemoaning the fact that there were all these jobs yet no one wanted them   well  now that i'm over here visiting  i thought i'd drop some wisdom that will help you guys that never ever ever again wish to work for someone else   here is how you do it   go into business for yourself as i did 22 years ago when i got sick of all the things you guys talk about   actually  i had no choice as my sister had bought for me my first ever dog - a female black lab that i named  daisy   as soon as i had her i decided that i couldn't leave such a cute puppy home all by herself each and every day   the very next day after getting her i gave my notice   i decided that i'd do things related to sound - musician  audio engineer  local roadie  house sound guy at a sleazy club  etc   sometimes the money was good and sometimes not so good but i can tell you that daisy spent the last 4 years of her life living with me on a sailboat in s  california   hell  i even hired a surf instructor to teach her how to surf which she loved to do   here is the best part   once you have worked for yourself for a couple of years  no one will ever consider hiring you for anything 9 to 5 related as you are now a walking red flag   i've talked to a number of high-ranking hr people off the record and all have told me that any resume with a history of business ownership on it gets immediately thrown into the trash   i've been told that business owners make the worst employees because they can see every bit of bullshit going on - all of it and they tend to share that info with the other employees   i've tested this theory dozens of times as  for giggles  i will apply to some job that i am completely qualified for and i never hear back from anyone except for one time   a video production company needed someone to manage their post-production team and somehow my resume didn't go into the trash and somehow slipped thru   anyway  i went to the interview because i was curious as to what i'd earn doing work like that as i've certainly run quite a few crews doing subcontracted media work   frankly  it is good to know what you are worth   so  the owner of the company and i are talking for a few minutes and he interrupts himself mid-sentence to say   i can't hire you   if i hired you  i'd be working for you in two weeks' time   of course  i had just answered his silly  where do you see yourself          question   my answer was   i see myself in your chair but it isn't going to take me 5 years or even 5 months because the amount of money you are going to have to give me will necessitate you out hustling for new clients while i run all this   so guys  put your money where your mouth is and go work for yourself   you will be seen as worse than a leper and no one will ever consider hiring you no matter how qualified you are   you will be antiwork for the rest of your life    amp x200b   good luck ,nrn8tj

2634,What the hell should I do with myself?,i am at a huge dilemma in my life  i will try to make this as short as possible but please excuse me if i don't  i really need help    i originally got a massage therapy license in texas 7 years ago in 2014 and in 2016 i moved back to california where i'm from originally and i transferred my massage license to california and i let the texas license expire  i was staying with my mom and stepdad in texas  well i'm not really making it here in california and things did not go as planned so i think i might have to move back to texas and stay with my mom and stepdad again  but since it has been more than 3 years since my texas license expired i need to take the massage licensing exam all over again  it's called the mblex if it matters to you  it will cost  265 to retake the test and then the application fee is  100 plus  35 for this stupid texas jurisprudence test  this honestly is not worth it for a stupid weekend job at a spa literally only getting paid  15 an hour after taxes and before tips  and i don't know how to market myself worth a shit  i went to massage school  not marketing school  in general i don't like doing massage anymore    are there any licenses that i can get for jobs that are not like a typical job  i was thinking i could get a texas real estate license  i mean i really don't need to make a lot of money  i would be happy with like  25 000 to  35 000 a year  i have no kids and i'm happily single  i just simply want a job that is not stressful that will enable me to make enough money to put myself through a bachelor's degree program for biochemistry   i'm not interested in real estate but i'm good at faking things    are there any other licenses or certifications i can get for a job that is not like a typical job  typical job meaning you have to go to a building for like 6 to 8 hours a day getting paid slave wages  i really don't know what the hell to do with myself ,nr3xth

2683,Any gurus/experts on corporate-speak(bs) willing to help semi-desperate soul out w/paid resume coverletter help? Pretty desperate tbh!,sorry  i know this isn't exactly up antiwork's alley  but it's closest to my sensibility overall   i'm pro-labor  and human endeavor  and anti-work -- not full on -- 4 days is a minimum acceptable standard w living wage  amp  some vacation that i could reasonably say is a fairish compromise and reasonable step in the right direction  6 hours is ideal  and i'm v  unhappy about the jobstyle-creep of 9-5 to 8-5 9-6 w unpaid lunch  how exactly did that happen   theystorians i'm not looking for an answer  it happened  is the point  and that's on the  good  end of things  and if work is your joy and your about it all the time good for you  do you   workaholism maybe can have some good outcomes  but also  can be a problem that maybe one might wanna address in a best better case scenario   like a lot of people in this space  i'm very pro-productivity  it's hard to be healthy mentally and emotionally  and arguably is a situational outcome  including biochemical  amp  genetic disposition  and there are many approaches to problem-solving  which is undeniably hard and inherently challenging even if you try and get all tao about it  consciousness - it's a lot to deal with  honestly  i'm not trying to point fingers at culprits  bystanders are culpable too and it's thorny to get into how things got off the rails and who's responsible  it's a human tendency  likely pretty biologically rooted  and we're just trying to figure out how to best rock and roll  or dubstep or kpop or whatever   make the music happen  and deal with our demons  collectively  and hopefully maybe intentionally create rather than be beholden to our more screwed up impulses and ignorances  we're in this together at some level and i hope all of you have some small  or great  comfort and joy despite whatever challenges you have  although obviously sometimes that's simply not possible in more extreme situations   i want to clarify that  productivity  isn't an external value  it can be super productive to one's mental health and community values to daydream or even simply veg  there's not necessarily a universal field theory when it comes to human beings  if you wanted to throw that love word out there  that's fine  but clearly we also have a full gamut of emotions  maybe that's a brilliance of gaming  and frustration is clearly a core one we have to contend with  easily leading to lower-hanging fruit solutions of anger and hate    so the whole thing's very dynamic   anyway  back to my own situational  work  semi-horrible work-crisis -- i feel like i have to preface this by saying i feel this heavy deal of comparison to very bad worse case scenarios which frankly feels kind of like messing with my head -- like yes  human  and animal  suffering has a very deep bottom and if you want to even get all existential about it even we're all going to die and those we are fortunate enough to love will also die - there's some hard truth's out there  although personally perhaps flippantly i find living more daunting then the prospect of dying  all our problems will be over soon enough  until the next life at least  but in the meantime   in the meantime  we're tying to make a go of it  and make the best of it  and figure this ish out to the best of our ability  and hopefully grab a little joy out of the experience  hey  maybe even a lot   so yeah  uh  my job is not sparking joy and i feel this heavy oppressive energy that i should be grateful because it can be and is so much worse for so many  i hope we can collectively navigate to less misery and to greater mental and emotional health    but i'm not trying to realize it can be worse - this is worse for me  and maybe as good as it gets but i'm hoping and trying to get out of the path of the blows  not to leave others in the path  but to practice not being beat  and it does feel like there's an element of abuse that it's maybe useful to sidestep  like in a domestic violence situation  one has to kind of desperately try to extract onesself from that messed up dynamic  and one might need help with that   who's fault is it  the larger picture  where's the best pressure points to try and alleviate or address  to some extent we're all here figuring that stuff out the best we can    right now  i'm climbing up a little hill  but it's a big one for me  i know the whole thing is a monster with it's head cut off  i'm trying to put the head back on  maybe the monsters are just really lost folk  to put it mildly  maybe sometimes lost beyond redemption  but there's vastness that's salvageable if we can learn and create better ways and implement them   and  we're trying as best we can  we got a lot of untapped potential  humanity it can be  sometimes  the greatest  so interesting and passionate and creative and so often times confused   but  uh  yeah  i'm just looking for someone who might be able to help with a hand up out of a weird and bad situation in one micro situation in a whole lot of macro  i've burned this situation i'm in  it's unsalvageable and i'm trying to minimize the damage at this point  i didn't light the fire  i'm a burn victim here an i'm trying to get out in as healthy a way as possible  if possible  there's a lot of people burned worse  but again i'm trying to aim high and have a healthy relationship - if i can possibly manage to do so   my relationship with my own self  and my ingenuity and ability to problem solve  again just in this little micro situation  unfortunately the worst in people has come out  there's a whole little backstory  what's that thing about all good families being alike and all bad ones bad unhappy in their own way  but let's just say i didn't have the political skills and charisma influential techniques to create a pathway for the people around me to vaya con dios  and i'm going away  with learnings  but a lot of those learnings are of the things-go-wrong variety  it's definitely been an experience but i'm trying to get out now asap  and i guess i should try and leverage the experience to another hop in the frying pan since i could probably conceivably manage that  i got in the lower rungs of the corporate world  and i'd like to like homer simpson fade back in the bushes  down the road i hope i'll be able to contribute to more dynamic and creative solutions  but i'm not kicking the can down the road in saying  hey  i learned a lot in a way by experiencing this scenario  the 9-5  wait i mean 8 30 to 5 30  and it's probably good i had this experience -- also  it was definitely practical even if it came at a high cost  and i probably have one more jump in me if i can manage it to make use of the  so very minimal   privilege  and opportunity    a lateral jump  obviously  it's not my scene  it's not anybody's scene although i tend to think most of us really do get off on and get into being productive  but we have those daemons and primitive tendencies to contend with and -potentially hopefully- navigate  i was really into it and tried to be a good egg but obviously the conditions frequently don't support that  and this was not the exception that proved the rule  overperforming  in my very underperforming way  did not ease the way in the random vagaries of my particular situation  it just set the stage for an untenable bad story  again  not a unique story or situation  but i do feel like there is some oportunites for learnings there  some idealism remains  although i'm not sure what exactly  like how do you be high performing in a healthy way  how do you be that trendsetter in a cultural environment that gets everybody on board to functioning smoothly  i missed a better era of my department  again  a low-level one not fancy w so-called-privileged   i was hired at the tail end of an era  which is why i took the job  but then the longstanding  lower level  manager took a hasty exist and  things changed   that's why she took the exit  it's clear  anyway  i was kind of a virgin even though i'm a million years old and was a kid more than a million and a half years ago  but still  yeah  i did that a little bit for a long time  years  more than one years  multiple years  plural years     i should probably do it another year or so  but then again  i'm not a practical person -- and this situation is on it's last legs  i learned the job  plus a lot of other skills  not political  those skills remain pretty flat  and i could do this job in another company  i have one shot at that  possibly  with a jump  otherwise that ship is going to pass  and i'll need some other scenario  maybe better maybe worse  but i might be able to manage a  practical  one-more-go-round in a new place without the baggage of the unsalvageable personal relationship drama trauma    this would require resume s  and cover letter s  and might be a long shot anyways  my chances would be much better with skilled professional help -- i could pay  or beg  or beg  amp  pay  for that  finding it's the problem  but i dunno if i have it in me to make a res let alone cover letter  at the best times i'm not gifted at that  so meybe i can pay some one to talk that corporate speak for me in order to make an escape  otherwise it's just a waiting of who will blink first  and i'm not sure who i'd put my money on  or what the timeline will be  i just know someone's gonna blink i'm pretty sure  i don't see that situation as sustainable  and it's definitely not healthy for me  i don't see a light at the end of that tunnel and i don't think i'm going to have any epiphanies   so  i doubt anyone's made it this far  but anyone wiling to take pity and help me with resume coverletter for same job elsewhere  or any recs for people who do that for     amp x200b       amp x200b   thanks everyone  hope you all survive and really hope you get a some chances to thrive  i think one thing people miss about the value of this space is that it helps just to talk about things  bringing awareness can add value in itself  i'm not really trying to demonize a system or a group  i can roll with enlightened capitalism  or self-interested altruism  or a system redesign or even incremental change  and worse case scenario at least it was a wild ride and a bunch of people did get to have some good experiences  of course we wish to try to be mindful of those who suffered and try to honor that is some way in the fullness of our souls  people make mistakes  sometimes really really really  inconceivably  bad ones  minimizing harm if one can  and maybe even leaving the door open for redemption and for more optimal solutions to achieving a greater sense of well being seems like one leg of an approach that's maybe worth exploring  there are a lot of ways to try to tackle problems which is really a very basic fundamental of the human condition ,nrrxpz

2786,I need to vent about the slap in the face I got today,    strap-in guys  this post is about to be long  and i don t care if it gets like 2 upvotes  i just need to get this off my chest   so about 2 years ago i got this awesome job that was perfect for me  i could work part time in the year while going to school and it was full time in the summer  the boss was great  and i liked the other employees and i felt that they respected me  i had worked in back breaking jobs like a factory before and i hated it  and this was a calm office job with a bit of customer service  i maybe would not have done this for all my life  but i would have at least kept going while i was still in school  honestly  great experience   but then the pandemic hit  i worked at an essential service  so work did not stop but everything changed  the old boss quit because of burnout and the new one sucks  probably got here by licking balls  the employees i liked quit and got replaced by people that obviously do not respect me  i got social anxiety  but with the old employees i could still have a decent conversation  with the new ones i say hi and can you pass me the pen and that is pretty much it  these changes sucked  but it was still tolerable   but then today  the boss tells me to meet him at 2pm  he tells me that at 7am  leaving me stressing all day  and starts the meeting by asking me what i strive for in life  kind of a weird question  and i give a bullshit answer by saying i like  learning  and  getting better  he then says he s thinking of cutting my hours because i don t have the  drive  or  initiative  for the  mission  when the job is just a repetition of simple tasks and a bit of customer service  he then says i m not made for this kind of job  which is kinda true tbh  because this a social job and i m not really social  he says he s not going to fire me  but only make me work for like 5 days a month  the big days  he also sneakily said that he s going to make me do things i never done before and that are above my pay grade and he s questioning if i ll be able to do them  but then at the end of the meeting he says that he s not going to cut my hours  if i present him with a letter proving him why i m  worth  this job  i say present  because i can t just write the letter and send it by email  he wants me to read it to him and sell myself at the same  he gave me a week to do this  so  to keep my hours  i would have to write a whole letter  then go to the office on a day i m not working  then  perform  the letter to him and beg for my job  just to have a chance of have the same schedule i had with the old boss  i found that honestly dehumanizing and cruel  i legit almost cried  oh btw  since this is a student job  the government is literally paying the company to have me full time for the summer so it s not like it s a money problem    so my options are quitting and going through the torture of finding another job  keep the job but with way less hours or go through his stupid games to maybe keep my hours  this fuckin sucks ,nq39xq

2788,Should we make a GoFundMe for this?,after following this page for a long time  i have begun to be more open to the idea of asking people for financial help when you could  survive  on your own  technically  we could continue to live out of my in-law's house for the next year or so until we save enough to get a place of our own  but i don't know that that is the best for our marriage  i figured you guys would have an interesting perspective to share on whether or not people would actually donate or if they would see us as lazy  this is what the description of it would be  plus it explains everything    after living with noah's family for 6 months after getting married in january  we are looking for an apartment of our own  emma's car needs over  1 000 in fixes  plus purchasing it from her parents for a similar amount  noah's will most likely need that amount or more in fixes very soon  we have medical debt  and we will have to start paying off emma's  70 000 in student debt within the next couple of months  with  5 000 in the bank currently  there's not a lot to go around  of course noah is currently working at a job he enjoys and emma will be getting a part time job soon  nevertheless we are very anxious about the future and don't know when we'll be able to afford a place of our own and pay off emma's debt while still building up our savings  and  ya know  enjoying life   the reason for asking for  5 000 is because we want to have at least  10 000 in emergency savings before we would feel comfortable saving up for things like a house  traveling  and the possibility of children in the future   we don't want to ask for help  but after a lot of contemplating and praying  we have decided to create this gofundme  since we had a very small wedding and no one was able to participate in a registry  as is customary   i told my mom about this and asked her advice  she said she would be embarrassed if i made the gofundme  citing the fact that i haven't gotten a job yet  even though i was a full time until early last month and my car stopped working 3 weeks ago and we haven't been able to afford find the time to get it fixed  i think it's not a terrible idea to ask for some help  while also finding myself a part time job  since i also take care of all of the cleaning  laundry  and most of the cooking because my husband works full time  of course she argues that i should get a full time job anyway because  if i can do it so can you   yeah but you're miserable all the time  mom  what do you guys think  would anyone donate  or would they look down on his for not  pulling ourselves up by our bootstraps  and being miserable for months just so we could have a home and food ,nq6udt

2836,"Current supervisors had my back re: the employer being deceptive about ""overtime""...so I walked",true story from may 2021  i was looking for a weekend job that wouldn't interfere w  my part-time self-employment  i found  what i believed to be the perfect situation which was as a supervisor at a warehouse for fri  sat  amp  sun  when i interviewed i was told that it would be rare and only in peak season where i would be asked to work four days per week  it's a warehouse so i get it  i negotiated my salary only after confirming it would be a weekend only position without interfering with my schedule family time during the week and that four day weeks would be rare  if ever  this was confirmed   once i began  the training jumped off the rails immediately  they apparently did not realize i was starting on a monday and believed i would be starting the next day  the hr person in charge of my onboarding was out until the next day  they didn't know where to put me  so they placed me w  a supervisor to get the lay of the land  after he showed me the basics  i said to him   so  tell me what is the worst part of working here   he looked surprised  so i said it a different way    we are supervisors and we have to look out for each other  what am i really getting myself into that they are not telling me   he proceeded to tell me that for the past year and a half they have been working 6 days per week and the weekend shift working 5 days per week  he said that they have been promised that  things will get better  for so long that it has become a running joke among the supervisors  he mentioned the high turnover among the supervisors and that management is making decisions based upon not making things better  but because they believe the supervisors are replaceable   i told my wife this and she said   well  maybe with you there  it will get better  so  i returned the next day for my onboarding  the hr person was not there and apparently the other 5 hr people had never done onboarding so i would likely be waiting 10-14 days b c she had contact w  someone who had covid    thus  once again  i was on the floor w   different supervisors  i asked them the same question as i did the day prior and they all said virtually the same thing   how can we have record profits and no supervisor support  and  i've been working 60-70 hours per week  i asked if they pay overtime for supervisors and he said   no  you are bought and paid for   past jobs  i've received overtime straight time   this is what was irritating  i negotiated based upon 3 days and not 5  each was a 12 hour workday  if i'm going to choose to work someplace  pay me for my time and don't try to get over on me   at the end of the 2nd day  i had  trained  w  four supervisors and we all stood around talking  they did not say one good thing about the employer  three of them had been there for years and  as a result  were divorced and living alone  one could no longer see his children because he worked too much  one more had no issue because this was the best job he'd ever had  he was a nationalized citizen from another country and his girlfriend also worked there with him  side note  his girlfriend made more than him because she receives overtime   the next day  i went back in and asked the operations manager about the overtime  what i was being told and how it would affect my weekend shift  i didn't like the answer because it felt evasive   so  i shook her hand  said the position was not for me and that i feel like they should have negotiated my salary based upon the possibility of working more than the stated schedule  side note  that manager had been there for four years and developed so much gray hair  she looked older than me i'm 17 years older than her   i feel like i made the right decision and  luckily  so does my wife     amp x200b   tldr  don't give up your life for a company  spend as much time as you can with your family and if it's looking bad at the beginning  don't live to regret your decision bounce ,nqrj15

2855,"Finally quit a job I've been conditioned to ""be grateful for"".",after 5 years working as a  creative  in a corporate environment  i finally pulled the trigger on turning in my resignation this morning  i have no idea what is coming next  but i feel like a massive weight has been lifted from my soul  and i wanted to share my story with the lovely folks of r antiwork who inspired this decision  a bit of a rant  but i hope my story resonates with someone who is feels tethered to a job which doesn't value them   in college  i studied illustration   graphic design and have since managed to dabble with videography and eventually animation  most of these skills were obtained as a side-hustle  while i paid the bills working as a line cook over the years  finally  i got the call from the big leagues one night as i was clocking out of the restaurant  asking me to be the in-house animator for one of the biggest health care providers in the world  i took their offer without blinking  feeling like i had just unwrapped one of wonka's golden tickets  for the past 5 years  i have continued to take on more an more responsibilities in my role  increasing efficiency  constantly educating myself on modern animation techniques  and even getting a master's degree from one of the nations top art schools in 2019  after graduating with a costly degree  i began asking my supervisors what my future in the company might be  after all  i had begun to exceed the expectations listed in my job description  i was able to arrange a meeting with my manager's supervisor who was in charge of promotions  in short  he told me  the best advice i could give you is to go find a counter-offer  without that it will be difficult to justify a promotion to my supervisors  on top of this  due to it being 2020 with a pandemic looming over the world  and the health care community at large  i was told i should  be grateful for having a job in the first place   this meeting spawned a 2-month anxiety trip as i juggled my daily job responsibilities while feverishly applying to   interviewing for jobs around town  the truly messed up part is that i learned that my supervisor's technique had truly worked  and that i wasn't able to find a job opening with my specialized skills  after being told i was runner-up at 3 different job openings  a realization hit me like a ton of bricks  all of my preconceptions regarding the professional ladder i've been climbing are bullshit and the effort i've put into honing my abilities has effectively left me over-qualified in a field where employers value cheap labor  like plato's allegory of the cave  i felt like i had been operating under a false pretense of what my reality was  the ladder is actually a treadmill  and you don't tend to notice when your employer casually turns the pace up over time  after that  you're expected to appreciate the cool new muscles they helped you develop while acknowledging that you are standing in the same place you started   after feeling defeated by the job hunt  i continued to chug away at my daily work  feeling more depressed and anxious than ever  this went on throughout the entire pandemic  and the workload only increased as i started to receive word of a potential raise around the corner  as my responsibilities increased  my mental health only got worse  living with epilepsy  means that i can have seizures purely from stress  something i have learned the hard way  three weeks ago i had a seizure randomly after finishing one of the most stressful projects i have ever overseen  while recovering  over the following week  a thought crossed my mind   you could just quit your job   it took two more weeks of mulling over  but the thought of walking away from the job right as they prepare to finally offer me a raise was too poetic to pass up  the truth is  i don't want to work there  or any of the 20 places i interviewed last year  i've saved some money from every side gig i took over the last 5 years  painting murals  filming weddings  making logos  etc  and i'm fortunate enough to have built a nest egg for this sort of  fuck it  moment  after setting up a meeting with my boss this morning to turn in my resignation  i could not be happier with my decision  when asked if i wanted to give them a chance to make a counter offer  i said  absolutely not   i've got no idea what i plan on doing from here  but that is a really good feeling right now  i'm on my wife's health care plan  and have several existing clients for design and animation work to help me transition into being my own boss  so i do consider myself fortunate  grateful to have come across this awesome thread which gave me permission to think outside the box about what defines success and which helped me see the ways that companies exploit their talent  i could fail spectacularly from here operating my own business  but i'm stoked to say i'm done wondering  what if   tldr   i asked for a promotion   raise and was told to be grateful for the role that i currently have   to find a competitive offer elsewhere  looked elsewhere to find a system-wide issue with companies valuing profits over qualified talent  returned to my boss and quit this morning  and now they are trying to ask me to consider a counter-offer  i said hell naw    epilepsy is different for everyone and my biggest factors are stress and diet,nq0ouj

2876,A hard worker of 2 years quit out of the blue,this is the story of a hardworking man who started a family recently and bought a new house  when i started working at this business  he'd tell me things like how he wasn't afraid to work hard and how he used to stay late all the time when he first started  he got a promotion here and taught me how to do my current role  he would briefly mention the man who worked before him occassionally  the previous man left because the business refused to give him a promotion due to his regular mistakes even though it was a safe place to make mistakes  the business was nice to me and hired a part time worker to do half of my tasks  and i took advantage and would take extra bathroom breaks  come in whenever i felt like it  and would leave early  all while the man was working hard in his new position  well  he quit today and the way my coworker explained it to me shocked me  she said he felt  entitled  to have more pay and was beginning to get an  attitude  idk what his pay was  but i got a raise recently and make a gross salary of 31 500  he was the only man in this business and i wonder if everyone was hard and expected more from him just because he was a man  all i can say is good for him and i hope he's compensated and treated kindly wherever he moved on to ,npwzfx

2882,"""Nothing Personal, It's Just Business""",next time  you feel guilty or lazy or put down at work  remember that business never feels that way about you ever    if you're tired or sad or having a bad day  that doesn't matter to the business because business is business  it's not personal  your boss can't find anyone to cover your shift  fuck them  that's their problem  they should feel exhausted and overworked without any help from anyone because that's how this system works  you've done this multiple times and it never mattered before  your boss was a lazy irresponsible little shit  maybe they should feel like a scolded child for a while  if your manager is upset because they have to work 60 hours because of their own incompetence then they shouldn't have taken the job   if your manager talks down to you  consider the fact you're both humans and not animals and that the manager most likely doesn't hold any superior intellect to you either  they can also be ignorant  in most authority cases people tend to follow the person most pissed off while working hard  so in a situation with your superiors sometimes it's best if you put them in their place instead of you cowering in fear like a dog submitting to a higher power  maybe you should have their job because you're better  you should show your bosses boss that you're more capable and that your manager isn't    don't have empathy and get your manager more money because you're a nice person  get yours  you should probably take their job anyways  the business would be much better off with you in charge   don't be mad  it's just business  don't feel guilty  remorseful  or empathetic because they will not    capitalism is a street that goes both ways  so screw over and backstab accordingly  if they didn't want this system then they wouldn't be using it  they just can't stand if you use the system to your benefit   if they want to change the whole societal system to something a lot nicer  say like modest socialism where we all pull together to help each other then great  otherwise this is the system they made so use that system the way it was designed    shake hands with your fingers crossed behind your back  well  don't even shake hands anymore because you can't even trust people to wash their own fucking hands ,npuuhc

2894,Here is my big rant on human society and the complete insanity of the economy!!!,temporary biological organisms such as the primate mammal  'homo sapiens' require certain fundamentals such as food and shelter to be alive  sadly  in the current age - food and shelter access is only granted through the obtainment of an arbitrary made up fiction called  'money'   money - which has only been in existence for 3 thousand years while the human species has existed for around 300 000 years - and yet the majority have come to view money as some fundamental intrinsic and inescapable aspect of human life  despite it's presence in human life only making up around 1 percent of our time as humans and the fact that it is ultimately an arbitrary man made invention  furthermore most people view it as sane and acceptable despite the fact that 8 individual men have as much monetary wealth as half the earths human population combined  25 000 human beings starve to death unnecessarily every single day on this planet not due to any tangible shortages of food or recourses but merely due to a lack of purchasing power which is an unreal made up concept  a famous tv star 'earns' more money in a couple of days of filming a frivolous tv show episode than a full time firefighter 'earns' in over 40 years of life risking service  so because of our economy and thus our society is based on money and the inherent incentive structures associated with such a system - the vast majority of human beings in the modern world have to tragically engage in largely nonsensical  boring  unfulfilling  unpleasant  manipulative and destructive 'jobs' to be allowed to be alive  earning their right to be alive through this submission to work    the vast majority of human beings on this planet are not following their genuine passions in their fulfilling careers that help make the world a better place  this whole idea that earning money and they way you go about that defines who and what you are and your value and it is linked to your sincere passions in life is utterly untrue and ridiculous to the vast majority of people on earth  most human beings in adulthood at least are essentially doing this  going somewhere they don't want to go  to do things they don't want to to  for many hours at a time  having to be around people they don't want to be around  to perform tasks that are fundamentally nonsensical  unpleasant  often inherently manipulative and or destructive - all in order to be able to pay for rent and food     this entire set up and behavioral pattern of the human species today is fundamentally unnecessary almost across the board in the modern age - due to the incredible potential of science and technology  which if purposefully oriented to emancipate the human species from drudgery through advanced automation methods - producing a global abundance and eradicating poverty and starvation and homelessness entirely - while of course carefully maintaining ecological equilibrium could lead to a kind of world  most dare not even dream about due to the current reality of having to submit to labor for survival and the general misery and hardship of the current world    this future possibility and potential is not a utopia or a perfect naively idealistic dream world  but simply a vastly more sane  rational and pleasant world for humankind which is possible indeed - if only a larger majority of the human species in fact had an awareness of the possibilities of the future humanity could move towards and more information and comprehension about the utter insanity of the current socio-economic system    i urge anyone who resonates even the slightest bit with what i've written here to look into things like the zeitgeist movement  the venus project and the concept of a natural law recourse based economy  and to listen to or read from for example a philosopher such as alan watts talking about these exact topics in great detail in a way that is easy to follow  there are books and talks where he was going through the rational and logic of this kind of thinking - going back all they back to the early 1960's - this can help to get more of an introduction to this train of thought    these thoughts i have shared just now are not at all new radical ideas so much as very old yet largely suppressed common sense observations that have become somewhat taboo and thus more and more uncommon especially in the media and in the mainstream  a lot of this common sense thinking of course goes directly against what most of us are largely indoctrinated to accept as 'normal' but as peter joseph the film maker and social commentator so often has pointed to - we live in a world where normality indeed has become distortion  the economic system we currently live under is in no uncertain terms fundamentally insane at it's very core and to be somewhat depressed and overwhelmed with it's destruction and insanity is in a paradoxical way precisely a sign of sanity  if you are not utterly appalled and astounded by the horrendous state of human society  more specifically in terms of the economic absurdity and madness - you are fundamentally one of 3 things    amp x200b   1  uninformed  2  misinformed  3  in severe denial     i hope this finds you well as a fellow human being on this planet  all i can really say is i invite you to not passively accept the current economic system which is always expressing itself around you as sane or acceptable because it is anything but if you actually look at it with even the slightest bit of critical analysis ,npzgq9
