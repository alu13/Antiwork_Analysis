1,Reworking the antiwork subreddit! (User feedback appreciated!),so user waldyrious and i have been going back and forth for a little over a few weeks  very leisurely  don't worry  p  and we're trying to come up with a better sidebar for this forum  and in general we'd like to see the forum improved   tl dr  we want this subreddit to have a great sidebar that'll include the best selections of anti-work stuff  be nice looking and anything else you guys think should be in there   we also want to work on a wiki and a faq built into it  i may incorporate some of the questions that i got in my ama thread from a few months ago  but if you think of any yourself  don't hesitate to add them   and although  as an anarchist  i don't agree with the idea of a basic income  that's a topic for another thread  i like how the sidebar for r basicincome looks a lot  so maybe something modeled  read  not an exact copy per se  of that   i'm very new to reddit and don't often go to other subreddits so if you know of other places that have awesome sidebars  feel free to mention it   the wiki would also be open-source and always open to modifications  if folks are abusive or misleading stuff gets on there it may be deleted by yours truly or another mod or  and this is much more likely  will be brought up to the individual who did the edit first to see what's what  hope that sounds fair ,39z2a2
