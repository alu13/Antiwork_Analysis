8,Being excited to get a new job seems awfully sad when you think about it.,"My friend got a new job recently. We all were invited to dinner to celebrate. I thought the entire time “what are we celebrating?”.

Having a job is something I NEED to live, I spend hours of my day commuting, doing boring things I don’t enjoy, tasks for other people. I get home when it’s dark and have just enough time to get some food and think about going to work the next day. 

My typical day right now is getting up early in the cold, showering to wake up, doing the mundane morning routine then taking the commute to work. I get into the office, blinded by the fluorescent lights. I get some coffee and spend the first half of my day talking to people I don’t really want to be spending my time with. The rest of the day is about spending all my energy on things for other people while checking how long is left before I get to go home.

Then we get old and retire, except now I have all that free time to enjoy but without the youthful energy I once had to enjoy it. That energy was spent working. 

It’s all terribly depressing when you sit down and think about it. But I need that job to live. And p.s, I hate when people tell me “do the job you love and you’ll never spend a day in your life working again” because unless you can find me a job which allows me to lounge around some days, cuddle with my cat, watch some shows and have some light exercise then perhaps head outside, try new hobbies and travel... then sadly that job doesn’t exist.",False,k3mhc7,Late-night-club,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k3mhc7/being_excited_to_get_a_new_job_seems_awfully_sad/,6,1

We have one 30 minute class with about 15 kids where the whole point is for me to check-in with them and make sure they're set up to graduate. Being keenly aware of the state of things, it's really hard to be optimistic with them about the future. I know several of them will certainly go off and thrive doing something they love, but the rest are sure to be eaten up by the systems that be. That frightful hobgoblin will burn their world and enslave them to help burn it. They, for the most part, are aware of this as well. I think it's a misconception that young people are hopeful. Young people need power to enact change. 

In the words of Greta Thunberg at the age of sixteen, 

""We've had 30 years of pep-talking and selling positive ideas. And I'm sorry, but it doesn't work. Because if it would have, the emissions would have gone down by now. They haven't.

This question is for those who were still left with their jobs but were working at an entry level for various companies in bangalore. How has been the work from home experience post lock down? Also if you guys were called to work from office again, post your experiences here. 
How has the management been treating you? Were they behaving same like before pre covid era, or were they resorting to threatening measures to get the work done? Have you guys been working more, or put under more stress than before?
Also I would like to know some of the positive outcomes that work culture has bought for few people here post lockdown.
The last point I want to know from the workforce here is that, do you think HR ever really listens to your concerns or problems? Or they are just there to secretly take side with operations /management leaders.
Please Note :
This post is not for the senior level management people, including team leaders, because I know there is always a confirmation bias that would come out from this level of management. And I am not blaming them. It's inherited human nature to always prove their point of view that they are right. I am sure the upper level management is dealing with their own set of challenges, but trust me no one can deny the fact that the real productive work which gives an organization value, and brings in the profit is being done by the ones who are at bottom of the organization level. I am talking about Junior level associates, analysts, programmers,MIS executives etc who actually sits for 10-16 hours a day and gives out the real productivity.
I would love to hear their point of view.

17,I just had one of the most depresing talks of my life,"Im spending the day at my parents house and my mother came to me to ask me how I was doing at college. We dont talk much about studies but I (almost) always try to be sincere with her, so I told her that i was getting super stressed out because of all the assignments from college, something thats getting worse because i hate my career more every day that passes. She then told me that this is what life is, and how my sister comes home super stressed from work most days and even crying a few times from the preasure his boss puts on her, she then put herself as example of the same as my sister and lastly told me how my father, the only one that enjoys is work in the family, has ridiculously long work hours that force him to work in weekends and stay till late most nights. She was going for the ""Life is hard, but u have to live it"" approach, but has only managed to leave me desolated. 

I guess that if I had any hope in my future it may have helped me to get motivated, but what I didnt tell her is that lately the stress is becoming depression as I see my future darker every day. Right now I just want to walk away from this place until my legs collapse, but I cant because im a prisioner of my own life, a life thats only going to get worse when i end college.

24,Things I like and dislike about this sub,"After getting downvoted heavily for making a fair point (imo) I wanted to wrap up what I think is good and bad about this sub.

**What I agree with:**

I initially came here because I have one of those boring office jobs that will tire you out till your brain gets drained completely. I know there are worse jobs out there and I know how hard it is for many to make ends meet at the end of the month. I do not have that problem and therefore am privileged. 

Nevertheless I have every right to hate my job, hate company culture and corporate bullshit. I despise many aspects of capitalism and am deeply worried about how money accumulates and how 1% of the population owns 50% of the money/land/influence and so on. This is deeply flawed and it gets worse every day. This is why I joined r/antiwork and this is what I agree with. If a company makes a surplus, people should benefit from it. Not everyone contributed in the same way so it shouldn't be divided by the number of people but still there are limits to how much a person can actually contribute and therefore ""earn"" and right now, this balance is just ridiculous. We shouldn't let neoliberalism dictate how wealth is distributed and make sure that chances are fair for everyone

**What I disagree with:**

Many people in this sub seem to oversimplify, that just by distributing existing wealth (taking it from the rich), everyone can do whatever they want and follow their dreams. Even if you took all the billionaires' money it wouldnt allow everyone to do their hobbies full time. This is just not how economy works. You want to be an artist and have society pay for your basic needs? So be it, but then everyone should be able to do so. All our blue collar workers included. This will dramatically increase the prices for those services and taking out your trash, building your street, growing your food and so on will be much more expensive because if given the chance most people would rather do anything else or at least not do their job for 40h a week. 

Some of you might say that we just need to automatize jobs but there are limits to that too. In the US there is 1% of the GDP coming from agriculture, 20% industrial and 79% is the service industry. You just can't automatize all of that and to be honest, I don't see that coming anytime soon.

We could all have more time to spare for the things we love but that doesn't come with having the newest gadgets, a (big) car, your own property and so on. You can't have it all at once, because eventually someone will have to produce it for you. We are all dependent of contributing our part to have wealth as a society. Unless we agree on lowering our standards, we will not be able to all do whatever we want all day. I am not talking about living in the woods, but still you would have to give up a decent amount of wealth in order to do so as a society and as far as I can tell, the vast majority is not willing to even sacrifice the tiniest bit of their wealth, so this is just not a realistic scenario.

In the UK things aren't quite as good as in France, but the healthcare is completely free. I can turn up at a hospital with just myself and be treated.

In France the govt just seems to hand out money. There are a few organisations which just give you money to help with rent and stuff if you can show you need it.

You rarely do though. Two people can live comfortably for €1500 in most cities outside of Paris. Some cities rents can be as low as €400. I lived in Nantes and paid that for a small apartment.

44,24 and Disabled,"I’m somewhat of a lurker on this sub. I recently got my first full-time job in October 2019. It was actually AmeriCorps service in an office, but I’ve been working from home since March. That term ended in August 2020, but then I signed on to do another 300 hours for the same org, down to half time. I’m so fucking sick of it to be honest. It was okay earlier on, but now I have no excitement for it. Fortunately I should be done the second week of January 2021. 

That’s a little intro. So like I said in the title I’m 24 and disabled. The conundrum I’m in is that I could choose to never work again because I receive Social Security, but that means living in poverty the rest of my life. I’m not too excited about working, but I want to do something to improve the world. I could try working for myself again, on green buildings, so I set my own hours and shit. That’s probably what I’m going to do honestly. Office jobs fucking suck.

Anyway, what do you all do for work? Or are some able to not work too?",False,k3pt28,MyNameIsMud0056,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k3pt28/24_and_disabled/,6,1

47,It ain't over till the boss man sings.,"Exactly two weeks ago I put in my notice. I work with children with disabilities and quitting meant they would have to find someone else to take my cases. They told me they would make a fading plan, and once my cases were faded we could amicably split. Fine. 

They have done nothing. In fact, no one has even talked to me since the day I put in my resignation. I have another job now. I am literally employed somewhere else. But my previous employer hasn't faded me off my cases. They know the guilt providers feel when we leave our clients with no services. They want me to feel like I am abandoning my cases, when it is really the higher ups who have made no plans for continuity of care. 

Today I was sick. I am salaried and even though I can make up my work during the rest of the week they told me I needed to use PTO. Fine, I don't care. I submitted the request. Denied. The same manager responded telling me that because I resigned I can't use PTO. If I resigned, why am I still here? They docked me for today. 

This feels like an abusive relationship. I left but they won't let me leave. They have ignored my fading plan, but they sure as hell didn't ignore me asking to make up my work later in the week. 

My work. 

No, it isn't my work. It's theirs. Just because you can't find a replacement doesn't mean I didn't quit. I am trying to compose a professional email telling them I am done waiting. Why is it so hard to think of the words to say? They have stepped all over me for the past year, and after I finally got the courage to quit, here I am. Still working here.

51,So I asked my manager for resignation from my crappy toxic job,"I'm a new member and I saw a lot of posts about people sharing their experiences, so I decided to share a bit of mine too.

I work as a software developer for a local company, I started as an intern and became a full-time employee. Since my intern times, I was already the main maintainer of the company's most important system, they just threw loads of work on me and forced me to work overtime even this being literally illegal for interns.

In those 2 years working for this company I had lots of mental breakdowns and overwhelming sensation of dread and hopelessness. Worked my bones off for a salary below the average for IT professionals where I live, having to deal with a chaotic work place with toxic people and incompetent superiors. That one time, they forced us to work 8 am to 11 pm from Mondays to Sundays for 3 weeks because they thought it was a good idea to start an enterprise-level project 3 weeks before the deadline.

I snapped this weekend and decided to quit, now I still have to work the next 2 weeks because the law protect the company, forbidding me from quitting whenever I desire to without previous warnings, but I'm already a lot better and brighter than before, my gastritis and anxiety are under control, I'm not so stressed anymore and I'm even a bit energetic, this is so weird, I'm not energetic in years.

My boomer parents are already bothering me, they are shocked, saying I'm complete ""pussy"" for quitting, an idiot for choosing being unemployed in times like that and I need to find another job right now, without even letting me have time to recover from trauma and chronic stress (ps. I don't even live with my parents in years!).

Anyway, I'm also worried about the future, I don't know if I'm going to find a job anytime soon, but it's liberating at the same time, I hope I can get some rest after all of this.

I hope none of you ever have some experience like that, no one deserves it.

Key

DS = data scientist/data science  
SD = Software developer/Software development  


Currently employed as a data scientist (DS) in the UK, but really starting to burn out. I've always been a life long learner, but the rate at which the field is changing is quite inhuman.

It's hard to explain if you're not in the field. Still, basically the completion is enormous (read global competition) and the field is quite saturated, and I've noticed (anecdotally) that employer demands are increasing and wages are stagnating. People are even starting to point this out: [https://towardsdatascience.com/ridiculous-requirements-from-data-scientist-job-ads-d84fa716af73](https://towardsdatascience.com/ridiculous-requirements-from-data-scientist-job-ads-d84fa716af73). To do well in your career, you really need to be in London (or another expensive tech hub); I know one can now work remotely, but it is really not as fun as its sounds, and companies offering remote working opens themselves up to more candidates and more competition for you. Frankly, I don't think it will be long until data scientists are ten a penny. I don't really think I want to keep having to stay up to date. I feel like the returns are ever diminishing. I certainly can't see my self doing this in 5 years.

I keep thinking about getting into the trades. My reasoning is as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

* I know that things change in the trades (electricians have to keep up with new legislation, for example), but not at the rate they do in DS. I don't think you can truly feel like a master in data science or software development. A software dev's skillset can quickly become obsolete; you're basically continuously competing with fresh blood because the tool stack has shifted and your experience with an outdated technology counts for nothing. An electrician, on the other hand, has skills for life. Not only is one constantly having to learn, but one also has to constantly ensure that they are not working themselves into a corner, i.,e. you constantly have to hedge your bets with the topics you choose to focus on.
* Many of the trades have a barrier to entry: You need to be licenced. Whereas anybody can call themselves a data scientist (or even a software dev); you can't call yourself an electrician/gas engineer.
* DS/SD can easily be outsourced. It's harder to outsource the trades.
* DS/SD is increasingly becoming automated. Again you have to keep up with the latest tools, all the while adapting to aspects of your job being automated. In fact it's kind of your job to automate stuff and eventually put yourself and other out of work. I don't see electricians etc. becoming automated any time soon.
* DS/SD (if not working remotely) need to live in expensive tech hubs (London, Oxford, Cambridge). Those with a skilled trade are in need everywhere.
* Many DS/SD employers expect you to have ""passion"". This is especially true on the DS side. I don't see this kind of cult culture in the trades; people seem so much more down to earth in the trades. But maybe I just haven't looked hard enough. As tech workers, we seem to have to wear this mask and be super excited about synergies and growth hacking. Nobody expects a plumber do plumbing as a hobby. In the DS world, there is a culture that expects you to live and breath data science and technology.
* The DS hype train. There is so much hype out there that setting realistic goals puts you in the dog house. I've lost count of the number of times a non-technical manager has told me to do something; I explain that it's not actually possible (I'm an expert in my field), and I've been told just to get it done. It turns out they skimmed a medium article, got the wrong idea, and made promises to important people without first consulting anybody who knows whats they are doing. Instead of owning up to their mistake, they double down, declare it doable and try to make out that you aren't good enough at your job.
* I feel like DS/SD careers are a race to the bottom: DS and SD literally give code away for free: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/), and companies in need of data science solutions offer prize money, instead of hiring a team to complete the work: [https://www.kaggle.com/](https://www.kaggle.com/). These companies get thousands of solutions for putting 10K prize money down. Again I don't see this occurring in the trades: nobody expects to be able to put 1K down for a new bathroom; have 200 plumbers all submit their bathroom; pay only the winning plumber; and keep the other 199 bathrooms.
* Relates to the previous point: You can strike out on your own. As a plumber you can start your own business. Not easy, but doable. As a data scientist, it's more difficult when everybody gives their code way for free on Github.
* In the trades you can work on the side. In the IT world, most contracts forbid moonlighting, and you sign over all your IP/copyright rights to the employer. They basically own you.

All in all, I don't think a DS/SD career is all it's cracked up to be. I know the trades have their own sets of issues, your body goes etc., it's long hard work, but I feel like it doesn't suffer from the above issues.   


So with this in mind, has anyone changed fields? Is the grass really greener? Or am I being naive? I don't want to romanticise the trades, or suggest for one moment that they are easy, so forgive me. But I do feel they offer opportunities to somebody with sound work ethic. Am I thinking about this wrong? 

I'm becoming quite jaded and burnout and reevaluating options, but no idea what my next move should be. My current career path is giving me a lot of anxiety. Tackling big open-end data science projects with uncertain outcomes, doing the work of 2-3 people. Mangers with no understand of the work calling the shots. The intense competition nipping at my heels.

88,Why do so many poor and low-income people HATE socialism?,"You really can't even discuss finances or poverty with a socialist angle without people absolutely losing their shit over this ""spooky"" word known as socialism. Reddit seems to be full of reactionaries too.

Capitalism must be one hell of a brainwashing tool because you can't convince the majority of these people otherwise. So many people think the simple solution is to go 50-100k dollars in debt in HOPES of getting a good paying job. Go to Walmart or McDonald's and ask the workers if they have a college degree. The answers will shock you.

The more simpler ""boomer"" reaction is ""just get a better job"". I really want to start punching people when they come up with these idiotic catchphrases. Seriously, if you made a boomer doll with a pull-string, this would be a phrase they would say. 

Now I'm not anti-boomer, my dad is one and he understands the situation at hand. But there are soooo many boomers who think the entire world operates the way it did during the 60's and 70's. Seriously, their entire view of society, politics and economy has pretty much remain unchanged some 50 years later. 

The reason ""get a better job"" pisses me off so much, because not only is it a stupid and overused argument, the math is flawed. It's really no different than walking up to an elderly person with a cane and shouting ""get a better body!"" (hey, I might have to use that sometime some old fart tells me this). 

If you look at the data, it's pretty simple to see there aren't enough good paying jobs for everyone to have one. If you count a ""good paying job"" as at least $20 per hour, then only 38% of Americans have one. This means 62% of the ENTIRE WORKFORCE cannot posses a better paying job. Not only that, but then who would flip the burgers, mop the floors, ring people up, wipe old people's butts, etc? 

On top of that, so many people my age still vote republican when they only do everything they can to screw poor and low-income people over.

I got really excited when Sanders ran, hell I even got to meet him in person. He wasn't even that socialist yet a lot of people still hated him.

I don't get it. So many people whine and bitch that they are poor, but they won't do anything to fix it. They won't vote socialist or democrat. They won't protest or suggest revolution either. A lot of them are just ""temporarily embarrassed millionaires"" as well.",False,k3ov4e,_Raspootin_,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k3ov4e/why_do_so_many_poor_and_lowincome_people_hate/,68,1

90,Few example of people who saw the wage labor / capitalistic society problem,"&gt; Wages is a cunning device of the devil for the benefit of tender consciences who would retain all the advantages of the slave system without the expense, trouble and odium of being slaveholders […] They must be no class of our fellow men doomed to toil through life as mere workmen at wages. If wages are tolerated it must be, in the case of the individual operative, only under such conditions that, by the time he is of a proper age to settle in life, he shall have accumulated enough to be an independant laborer on his own capital, on his own farm or in his own shop.

Orestes Brownson, _The Laboring Classes_  (1840)

&gt;The alarming development and aggressiveness of great capitalists and corporations, unless checked, will inevitably lead to the pauperization and hopeless degradation of the toiling masses.It is imperative, if we desire to enjoy the full blessings of life, that a check be placed upon unjust accumulation, and the power for evil of aggregated wealth.This much-desired object can be accomplished only by the united efforts of those who obey the divine injunction, ""In the sweat of they face shalt thou eat bread.""Therefore we have formed the Order of Knights of Labor, for the purpose of organizing and directing the power of the industrial masses, not as a political party, for it is more - in it are crystallized sentiments and measures for the benefit of the whole people, but it should be borne in mind, when exercising the right of suffrage, that most of the objects herein set forth can only be obtained through legislation, and that it is the duty of all to assist in nominating and supporting with their votes only such candidates as will pledge their support to those measures, regardless of party.

Extract from the _Journal of United Labor_, the official organ of the order of the Knights of Labor (1885).

&gt; We have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence. “Necessitous men are not free men.” People who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made. 

Franklin D. Roosevelt, _Second Bill of Rights speech_ (January 11, 1944)

&gt;To the Congress:

&gt; Unhappy events abroad have retaught us two simple truths about the liberty of a democratic people.

&gt;The first truth is that the liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic state itself. That, in its essence, is Fascism—ownership of Government by an individual, by a group, or by any other controlling private power.

&gt;The second truth is that the liberty of a democracy is not safe if its business system does not provide employment and produce and distribute goods in such a way as to sustain an acceptable standard of living.

F.D. Roosevelt, _Message to Congress on Curbing Monopolies_ (April 29, 1938)

&gt; In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.

92,Society makes me feel like I'm useless if I don't have a job or a career. It also makes me feel useless if I have a job but can't even afford a roof over my head on my own.,"Every time I've held a job, depression hit me so hard that I had very strong suicidal thoughts and would have bouts of crying at my desk or in the bathroom. I quit my last job a few months ago because I was so overwhelmed. I know that it's hard to get disability with depression, but I tried anyway and unsurprisingly was denied. 

I'm on meds and see a therapist weekly. I exercise regularly, take some walks for some sun, and I eat pretty regularly. I'm trying really hard to take care of myself daily. Even so, depression seems to get the best of me and I feel so empty... then I go into this vicious cycle for hating how ""unsuccessful"" I am for not having a stable career. :/ 

The thought of going back into the workforce scares me. When I learn about unfair wages are and how when we work, we're just making more money for rich people and killing the earth, I just want to exit this society. Everything feels hopeless. I feel like there's no escape. 

I have a bachelor's degree and 10 years of work experience but any job I might be qualified for pays so little. I'm afraid to drag myself to a miserable job 8 hours a day to barely pay for anything. 

I find some relief in anti-capitalist and Marxist memes, but at the end of the day, I'm still struggling. 

Society makes me feel like I'm useless if I don't have a job or a career. It also makes me feel useless if I have a job but can't even afford a roof over my head on my own.

97,Becoming a Monk to Escape Capitalism,"I’m thinking of joining a monastery to escape the bullshit of capitalism. I am mostly attracted to this path as a counter-cultural and anti-capitalist alternative lifestyle. I am religious, not particularly pious, but love the chants and the traditions. 

I have dragged out the intellectual life of leisure in my 20s as a fully funded PhD student on a lower middle class stipend. I’ve spent the last decade reading books, waking up at noon, bumbling about, writing occasional articles, travelling for “research.”. It’s been a pretty aristocratic existence, despite not having that much capital and not saving anything at all. 

I don’t want this dream to end, but am conscious of the academic career not being as enjoyable as the life of a grad student... I can’t imagine having a mortgage, paying bills, going to work, all that wage slave bullshit that our overlords have brainwashed us into thinking is normal. I’d gladly suffer the mandatory celibacy of being a monk just to continue living the lackadaisical life of meditation, reading, writing, reflection.

98,I'm sick of the big fake personality I have to put on at my job and can't wait until I'm no longer stuck in retail.,"Currently working retail as a seasonal casual while on break because I need the money knowing the Coronavirus supplement is about to be reduced and my mother still on furlough and only getting part pay.

I don't have the personality for this shit. I'm not a shy person, I consider myself polite and I smile at people and all that, but I'm not a hyperactive super bubbly I LOVE LIFE LOVE TO BE HERE EVERYTHING IS SUNSHINE AND SMILES LOOK AT MEEEEE type.

After working for the assistant manager for the first few shifts (she is pretty chill and let me chill), I had a shift with the manager today and it was **hell**. 

She made me shadow her so I could ""see how it was done"", and it was fucking horrible.

She was practically yelling at every customer with her BIG PERKY FUN LOVE BEING HERE voice and she was going right up to them as well. Yes, things are now thankfully pretty under control here in Melbourne but after weeks of harsh lockdown, I'd rather err on the side of caution when it comes to go right up to strangers. ""Make yourself heard to everyone"". Dude, normal people just talk to the person they are speaking too. She was insisting on giving a huge speech to customers who clearly just wanted to be left alone to look in peace, she is insisting I try and sell stuff to people who clearly didn't want it, and it was a mast. 

She keeps sharing videos in the group char from other stores of other employees being completely over the top and making twits of themselves with lame Christmas puns at the front of the store to ""welcome our guests"" and they are always the most cringey fucking things I've ever seen and I would probably rather stave than do that.

The worst thing is that even though I have terrible anxiety about public speaking, I am forced to stand up on a fucking step and yell out a big fat perky ""WELCOME TO \[STORE\], JUST LETTING YOU KNOW THAT OUR DEALS TODAY ARE \[BLAH\].......HAVE A GREAT DAY"". She forced me to do it three times even though I was clearly super super uncomfortable and anxious and panicky. There was literally no reason to make me do it, it was just about humiliation. And don't even get me started on the way she was getting shitty if someone entered/exited the wrong way as if I can control people and when they'd do it when I was serving someone. 

Thankfully it is just a temp job, but fuck, what is it with these kind of jobs being obsessed with humiliating employees who are clearly uncomfortable and making them put on these stupid fake overly bubbly annoying personalities?",False,k3vhq4,fu_capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k3vhq4/im_sick_of_the_big_fake_personality_i_have_to_put/,16,1

Not only that but the job market is shrinking because of automation. What's going to happen when many people are out of a job for no fault of their own? Sucks to be them I guess.

Second off, the jobs that we currently value are ones we don't pay enough. You value your teachers, your pilots, your plumber? Give them better pay. I didn't realize how we thank teachers for teaching our children is by having them live just above the poverty line.

&gt;Wait? What if all of the teachers in the world stopped working? Would you really be so happy about the idea of not working then?

Yes, that's a great idea. That's called a global strike and I am all for that plan. Frankly I wouldn't be surprised if they all decide to quit collectively. We treat them terribly.

&gt;So, you just want to not work? At all? Not even a little?

No I would work, I just wouldn't work for a capitalist. I would volunteer my time as I want to. My time as I see fit.

&gt;So how would you make money?

Oh you're right, I still have to make money. Hm... UBI. Give everyone a base income and everyone would be set. And don't make it something stupid like 900 a month. Make it at least 1,500 a month.

&gt;But where does that money come from?

The same place we seem to get all of the money for our f****** wars. We would stop fighting wars in the middle East to pay for the UBI.

Hi, I'm not completely sure what this sub is about and was curious about it so I thought I'd ask. I don't understand what ending work means. I understand better working conditions, higher wages, and proposals like UBI but I'm lost on this one. 

1. Don't we need occupations like doctors to take care of people and engineers to innovate and solve new problems? Don't we have to pay these people to do these things? 
2. Even if a full blown UBI was implemented, isn't the idea that it would be funded by taxes? If no one had to work and most people chose not to, how could we even fund UBI? 
3. In an antiwork society, are people still allowed to work for someone and make wages if they want to?

136,[UK] How do you cope?,"This is more of rant/vent than a chance to ""fix"" it.

I've strugled with mental health issues for what feels like most of my life; depression and anxiety etc but what I feel now is completely different.

I've done all the expected stuff in my life; school, college, degree, All the things that are supposed to prepare you to work, to be successful and  to be happy. Yet it doesn't, I don't want to work, I don't want to be ""successful"" and I ain't happy.

I work at bland contact centre job in the UK, I have my own car, I have my own hobbies, I still live with parents,  and savings but it's not making me happy. 

I want to own my own house - practically impossible without handing 40 hours a week of my life over to a menial job that provides no benefit other than to line the pockets of my already wealthy boss for the next 3p years of my life.

I want a better job - I was told that if you go to university, get some relevant experience you can do whatever you want, earn lots of money and be happy. But it's not true, all the jobs are the same bullshit jobs with a different brand and managers, all with the same outcome, a rich boss, unfulfilled me. These jobs have abitrary requirements ""looking for a positive person who can operate *random company software*."" 
Even if you get one of these jobs that anyone in the world can do (because they are easy and the company chooses employes based on who they can exploit more not because you are more qualified or intelligent) you will not be fulfilled, because they are pointless jobs that  have one purpose;  more money for the rich at the expense of the working class. There is no dream job, because I do not dream of working. 

Like is this it, is the purpose of my life pre-determined and should I just resign to working a mundane job in order to just exist? 

Questions:
How do you cope with people who don't even realise they are being exploited? 
How do you cope with people who refuse to educate themselves to learn of others sufferings and injustices?
Do you know people in real life who share your perspective about antiwork?
How do you cope with working with people who are bootlickers? 

Most of my friends are similar in this perspective but when at work it seems no one cares about the fact they are wasting their lives to get someone else rich.

I'm not even asking for alot. What I desire is to be able to be fulfilled, to learn, to educate, to grow and be happy, to be a productive and beneficial member to our society.I want a house, not a big one filled with random products we have been told to buy. Not a waste of resources.I don't expect a private jet. I don't expect constant free clothes or food. I just want to wake up in the morning with no dread about 8 hours of my day (more when not working from home) being wasted for the rest of my life. I want to wake up knowing today I can do what I want and what is required for my fellow community.

159,I asked a friend if he wants to be homeless with me,"When I was 20 I went to study abroad in England. I quickly saw that the warehouse Jobs I was getting were full with graduates so I decided to quit university since it's pointless and costly.

But work was hell too. My phone step counter had 35 km (20 miles) everyday with those steel toe heavy boots on. I also had to constantly lift heavy while walking so much. I begged to take these steel toe shoes, it's my feet I don't care if I get hurt but they won't let me.

Over the course of 5 years, I changed around 85 jobs. I just could last more than a week. And it wasn't just me too. The turnover rate in every warehouse was completely new people every week. Most of these people lived on welfare because they have kids and they lived like four people in a single bedroom.

I met a homeless dude that i hanged out with a couple of times. He showed me that churches give perfectly fine food absolutely for free. 

This was the first time in all my adult life I saw a light in the end of a tunnel. I realized that I can go to Spain or Italy, as a EU citizen, sleep on the beeches and eat from the churches. As a social mammal, all I needed was another friend. I had only one that I spoke to on a daily basis at that time. We were real close and he hated this system just like me. He always said how all ""they"" do is just generate some numbers in your bank account in the end of the week. I loved that dude. 


I thought about it and proposed this idea to him. To my disappointment he denied. He had dreams of first buying a house in eastern Europe (our homeland) and making a small business. The statistical chance of a small business succeeding is less than 10%, and people save up a lifetime to start one.

My friend did find somewhat happiness. He became a night shift security guard at a warehouse and all he did was play video games and watch Netflix on his laptop. He married and became a father.

I also passed the security guard license but made the wrong decision and came back to my country because I was too lonely abroad. Now I'm lonely here.

164,"""Minimum"" Wage","So, I'm only 25. I have a question for any folks here with more life experience.

**Were there always this many minimum wage jobs?** I've been scrolling through Indeed this afternoon and it seems like every single job is at minimum or like 25 cents above. Not just grocery stores &amp; fast food, but supposedly important jobs like healthcare, city government, social services... A lot of these jobs require years of experience, so they're not totally entry level. What is going on? 

Have human services always been this devalued? I don't think people who are against raising the minimum wage know that SO MANY people are making minimum wage. And important people! The folks taking care of your retired parents are likely making minimum wage. 

 I live in Oregon and in 2022 we will finally have a minimum wage of $13.50.  Which was known to be not enough already, years ago when the ""Fight for $15"" was a big thing. Are people just screwed unless they're salaried? Is this supposed to be a ""work your way up"" incentive? It's so very very hard to justify giving all my time and effort... for 12 measly dollars. It's kind of embarrassing, honestly. They want us to beg and scrape for....12 dollars? Maybe ..10 dollars, after taxes &amp; healthcare? It's dehumanizing. (Also I was raised in Missouri which still has federal minimum (7.25 OMFG)?.  Why would I give my all to my work if that work doesn't give its all back? The employment contract is supposed to benefit all parties involved.

165,The only true way that work will abolished,"The only way that the social and economical construct of humanity will change is (imo) through automation. The thing a lot of people fear the most might actually be the key. As AI gets advance enough to figure out cures to diseases and a formula/solution that can solve world hunger...then that would eliminate part of the need for humans to work. You could also program AI/robots to build a community that people can live in with materials that don't hurt the environment. Its already been done a thousand times through multiple projects with limited funding and is progressing slowly,but humanity doesn't want to embrace it. You already use computers,cellphones, cars and all the technology around you and never gave it much thought as to how much it helps you cope with the challenges of life...but when it comes to saving you from cancer or a traumatic injury...you wouldn't trust a machine to administer care or medicine? why? 

This is where the future is headed. Its going to happen. Its inevitable. People are always quick to assume the machines will take the jobs? THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT! The only ""job"" humans need is the ones assign to yourself to accomplish something YOU want to accomplish. Not working for some corrupt CEO paying you pennies to be exploited for 40 hours a week. why do you work? for food,shelter and pay your bills like electricity etc. If that is already taken care of BY TECHNOLOGY then what would there be left for you to do besides spend time doing things you enjoy? Working should be a choice, not a necessity. That idea would be so foreign to majority of people it would leave them dumbfounded.

People are too in love with money and its monopoly (ex: oil industry,meat processing,fossil energy,industrial agriculture etc) and don't want to embrace a lifestyle change...so my thought is if we don't allow the assistance of AI to accelerate our learning and machines to cover many labor intensive tasks then we won't be able to reach the point where we have the option to merge with the two. That is the only solution because evolution won't be fast enough to survive the coming world events or space itself and that will be the end of humanity sooner than people care to think.",False,k4d8j1,Voxis-Aevum,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k4d8j1/the_only_true_way_that_work_will_abolished/,6,1

175,"Until Capitalism dies, we're not going anywhere.","Conservatives like to claim that the world is just going through some sort of temporary phase. That eventually all the protesting, riots and advocates for a better world will disappear and the world will go back to ""how it was."" 

lmao. 

If you're a conservative, someone who doesn't think the world should progress to something better, then I'm going to need you to listen real close to the next sentence. 

**The. world. you. grew. up. in. is. gone.** 

It's done, it's over. You now live in a world filled with people who are going to tear this shit down and watch it burn so something better can take it's place. It's not a phase, it's not something that will end soon. Your kids are going to grow up in a world that is much more radicalized and violent than the one you grew up in yourself. They're going to go their entire lives watching people fight directly against the way of life you hold so dear.

Don't misunderstand me, when I say ""it's over,"" I don't mean to say our side has already won. I'm saying that the world where the lines weren't as thick as they are now isn't going anywhere anytime soon. This is going to be the way things are until Capitalism dies. We're going to get louder and louder, fight harder and harder until every single human here is treated with respect and love, regardless of how much of your worthless currency they have.

Fuck money, fuck servitude, fuck ranking humans and what they deserve via pieces of paper. Whenever I say this, people tell me that ""it's not just paper, it's mostly digital now."" As if the fact that it's not even a real thing makes it less of a disgusting and archaic concept.

Just like slavery, Capitalism is nothing more than an outdated system protected by immoral people. Until it's dead, we're going to riot, we're going to protest and we're going to fight. It doesn't matter what country we're from, how long it takes or how many of us are lost in the process. Humanity as a whole is more important than any of us are as individuals. None of us can do this alone, but together, we can absolutely destroy this system and create one that works for everyone. 

This selfish system that values money over human life is going to be crushed under the weight of the masses. We're already starting to see this come to fruition. The funny thing is that Capitalism is the cause of so many problems, that people don't even need to realize that it's what they're truly fighting against in order to bring about it's demise.

If you're a conservative, racist, homophobe, transphobe or any other type of bigoted fuck wit, I'd suggest waking up and taking a good look around, because the ball isn't rolling in your direction anymore. At this point you don't stand any chance of ""conserving"" your way of life indefinitely into the future. Even if you do decide to fight back now you're still going to lose, because there are *a lot* more people worldwide suffering under your system than there are thriving under it. 

We should all keep in mind that throughout history every single economic system has died, despite being defended by immoral humans. Tribalism, slavery and feudalism, all dead. Economic systems always end up dying, no matter what, no matter how many people unjustly protect them. You don't have to like it or agree with it because it's a historical fact. Capitalism is going to die eventually just like every other economic system of the past. Any pain it causes conservatives to watch their system crumble can't come close to the amount of pain they caused others by supporting and defending it for so long. 

To all the petrified snowflakes that are currently ""prepping,"" I say good call, you should be scared, because we plan to do to your system exactly what it did to humanity, leave it behind.",False,k33mnq,nbatman,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k33mnq/until_capitalism_dies_were_not_going_anywhere/,1,1

192,I am tired of inconsiderate managers and long hours,"So, I work as a package handler for a large shipping company (the purple and orange one, not the brown one lol), and Christmas is coming up. That means peak season for us, and with the pandemic people are shopping online more anyway so it’s kind of a double whammy. 

So basically for a little background, where I work there’s the upstairs where the packages are sorted and sent downstairs where a bunch of other jobs happen. I work upstairs and– since there’s a *ton* of freight to sort– my days have averaged from 9 to 11 hours lately. 

I have a decent amount of gripes about this job, but this is my main one: not only am I expected to do my job, but when I finish I’m expected to go downstairs and help there. So, I spend 9 or so hours doing one of the most physically strenuous jobs there, but then I have to help the people downstairs (who, by the way, leave before their job is done *all the time*). 

This has led to myself and many others basically sneaking out. Part of me doesn’t really like doing it, but I refuse to let the managers take advantage of me any more than they already do (the only break we get is a half-hour lunch break).

Anyway, this job is only temporary because I earned my MBA this past May, and this was my way to get my foot in the door.

196,(RANT) My colleague does 5 hours free labor weekly,"Furlough pay is confusing as hell, so much so that I just gave up on understanding it and assumed that my pay would be correct. That is until this week, when my colleague and I both had to put in extra hours as our other colleague was ill. I told her that she needs to make sure that our job isn't getting free labor out of us, so we worked it out:

My colleague gets paid 8 hours of furlough pay per week, regardless of how much she actually works. This was dressed up as a great deal as she could potentially only be needed for 4 hours and still get paid for 8. However, we worked out her hours for this week and she's actually done 13. This means that she's worked 5 hours for free this week.

Similarly, I'm being paid regularly for some hours and furlough for others, so we worked out that I shouldn't be working any more than 5 hours extra, on top of my usual hours, per week.

It's just astonishing to me that a job will take free labor from you and dress it up as a present. I'm so glad that we checked for her sake - she's a single mum working 2 jobs and would be losing out on over £100 per month.

Ps. When we were first furloughed, our boss also told us that we were free to come in for a coffee if we felt bored or lonely at home!

However (and I need to speak frankly here, otherwise I can't get to where I want to go with this), I work to a much higher standard than the majority of those around me (and it has been this way in all the office jobs I've had). When I have work to do, I can't help but 'go in', as much as I loathe it. I'm an editor btw. It might be the companies that I've worked for, but some of the shit I've seen passed off as acceptable would be hard for some people to believe. I'd say that some colleagues were 'stealing a living', but then that phrase goes against what I believe in, and isn't it also what they should be doing, completely blagging it? They're winning if they're managing to do the bare minimum and still get paid pretty fucking well for it. Aren't they the ultimate antiworkers in that sense? Except they're not. They are the people who keep this game running. So now I have to partake in the bullshit system that they help maintain whilst also toiling over the degrading (and I mean degrading) bullshit (or work) that they fling in my direction?

Maybe this is why they're so in love with work, office life and all that bullshit, because they don't break a sweat doing it. They can get paid for doing fuck all and it's an unlucky few who have to clean up their shit. Joke's on me, right?

In that performance review, I was told my bonus was being deducted because I had been ""disrespectful"", and the crazy bitch wanted to add ""tone"" to my career objectives. This is after she had already added ""patience"" and ""empathy"" to my career goals previously. 

After I gave notice, I wrote a long email to the head of HR and the global head of my department giving them details of toxic manager's abuse of power and unfair evaluation of employee personality traits instead of work. As expected, HR has been useless but it still felt good sending that email 

I'm serving my one month notice now. 

Toxic manager tried to call me on the phone, and left me a text message. I proceeded to block her LOL 

I told HR I want crazy bitch to cease all communication with me because she has caused me a lot of mental distress and I have been a victim of retaliation for innocuous things I said during my 1 on 1 meetings with crazy bitch. 

\- crazy bitch has been speculating to my team mates that I must have quit because she promoted my peer to be my supervisor and I am bitter about it.. this is complete nonsense because this peer/supervisor is a really good friend of mine 

\- crazy bitch then says she doesn't believe I have found a job 

\- crazy bitch further speculated I must have started to look for a job after a ""team exercise"" she did where she told me I needed to have more empathy, which resulted in me crying. seems like she can't make up her mind... she thinks I've been job hunting for months, but also does not believe I have found a job 

\- crazy bitch told new supervisor I am negative, disruptive, and unprofessional.. but my stakeholders told me they are sad I am leaving and some even wrote me recommendations on LinkedIn 

It's just so fun to watch this control freak unravelling! Her whole identity seems to revolve around her career and her success. She loves to say our team is a family, and we are super close... look what happens when you upset your 'family'

221,*Rant* My employer cares more about productivity than public or employee safety.,"TLDR: My boss might have Covid and is still working, and her boss doesn’t give a shit about Covid regulations and public safety. And now I’m scared I might be sick. I want to report them but I have no clue how to even do that or if I can. 

As if I didn’t have a few dozen reasons that I hate my job, I am not so angered with my job that I really want to get this out there. 

When I first started this job we immediately had to quarantine for two weeks because an employee had a family member with Covid. We all got tested, then went back to work after 14 days with pay. It was nice, actually. For context that’ll matter later, we work in a small office that comes face to face with the public. There are less than 6 employees at a small retail loan office. 

Fast forward a few months, my boyfriend’s mother was diagnosed with Covid. We had just seen her 5 days prior, and he had seen her less than 48 hours ago at the time. I told my manager and she jokingly said “Let’s pretend you didn’t say that, because if we get quarantined again they aren’t gonna pay us this time.” I was very concerned, to say the least. 

Then about 2 weeks went by and now my manager is sick as a dog. She has all the symptoms of Covid. She still showed up to work “just to let us know” she’s going to get tested for Covid because she thinks she has it. She got tested and then let the district manager know this and he said “You should probably go home if you don’t feel good because if you get anyone sick with Covid they could sue us.” 

Not “You should go home because you’re not feeling well and need to rest.”

Not “You should go home because you’re endangering your employees and the public.”

His only concern is them getting sued. Priorities, right?! 

So, she stays at work all day and then takes the next day off because she literally can’t get out of bed. Then she came right back today because her *very concerned* boss has literally NAGGED HER CONSTANTLY at home through texts about numbers, and productivity and is threatening her job if she doesn’t push us to do more loans and collect on more accounts. So it’s clear his concern for her working while sick is BS because he’s scaring her into working while sick because it’s month end. So she was at work all day in this tiny office, not social distancing or wearing a face mask. She even texted him and said she isn’t feeling good at all but it’s up to him if she goes home or not. He only said “Okay.” He didn’t even answer her question. So she stayed all day today again. Then he harped on us all about productivity, clearly giving no shits that she’s at work, possibly with Covid. Which then inspired her to hold a private meeting with me about my productivity in an even SMALLER room 3 feet away from me with her germs going everywhere. Again, she possibly has Covid but still hasn’t gotten any results yet. 

Now, I’m sitting here feeling randomly lightheaded and my throat has been bothering me all day. I am choosing to believe it’s just due to stress, lack of sleep and anxiety. But now I’m worried I have covid because of these shitty, greedy, sociopathic corporate  leaches. I don’t know if I can report them or what. I just am so sick on this place and I don’t even want to go back Friday.",False,k16mu7,sirwolfsson,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k16mu7/rant_my_employer_cares_more_about_productivity/,5,1
222,Thoughts about mental health treatment,"Does every discussion about mental health seem so fake to everyone else? (Also this might not 100% the right sub but I feel you guys might understand)

Im fairly certain I have ADHD, but I feel like I could never bring up the true root of my anxiety around working until I die because no one will understand. Or any other ""radical"" thought. Therapy seems like a load of bs that is only designed to keep us productive. 

I have anxiety about working only to spend my precious money on drugs that make me able to keep working. I shouldn't have to manipulate my brain and the way I am to survive in this society. I should be valued and accepted for what I am, but alas that's not the case. It's so messed up that I need to trick my brain into doing things it doesn't want to do anyway.

But on the other hand, I want to believe that it could be helpful for living a less anxious life. I'm stuck in the hellhole, so I might as well make it easier for myself by getting treatment, until I finally am able to die in peace. So Here i sit, unsure If I would be okay with receiving 
a prescription or not. I think i am going to at least make one appointment so I can get an official diagnosis tho.

223,I hate my call center job.,"Been there about a year. Thought it would be nice to work in an air conditioned office and if someone turns into a ""Karen"" on the phone, I can just hang up on them.

How very wrong I was.

Most call center jobs rely on scripts. A canned message you have to repeat on every call. My job is VERY script heavy. Almost 90% of everything you say is scripted. 

After a year, I'm very burnt out due to the fact I feel like a robot saying the same phrases over, and over, and over again. In fact I can recite most of them from memory. 

There is no change, nothing new. I feel like a robot, or a cartoon character who eats the same food every day and wears the same clothes. We have to wear a uniform which is really ignorant considering the fact no one sees our face, obviously. 

It's really no surprise my job hasn't been replaced by AI considering how scripted it is. 

The other thing that sucks is we have supervisors but they aren't trained very well. If my supervisor is busy I have to ask someone else. The answers I get vary wildly and have even been in trouble for giving wrong information, even though it was supplied to me by a superior. 

The benefits also suck. I get 8 UNPAID time-off (sick, bereavement, etc) days a year, and about 5 days of UNPAID TIME OFF (vacation, etc). No paid leave for Covid either.",False,k1bkf9,_Raspootin_,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k1bkf9/i_hate_my_call_center_job/,6,1

Not lazy just don’t want to do meaningless shit for someone who wouldn’t care if I dropped dead the next day,"I graduated college two years ago and furthered my education through two years of continuing studies for another bachelor’s degree in nutrition. I graduated and was fortunate enough to get accepted to a competitive internship across country and moved. I loved the thought of finally being somewhere brand new and having that independence and freedom of starting fresh. But I absolutely hated the idea of conforming to a box. I knew it in my head I didn’t like the program but carried on anyway because that’s what we’ve been conditioned to believe right? Get a degree, slave away at a 9-5 job, get married, buy a house, have kids and continuing slaving away for the next 40+ years until you have the next exciting thing to look forward to....retirement! I was afraid of disappointing the people around me but I knew deep down, my life is mine and only mine and I couldn’t justify spending a minute doing something I couldn’t bare just so I could please the people around me by participating in the rat-race of our capitalist society. I want the freedom to work wherever I want doing things I love and have ample time to pursue my interests and travel. 

Anyway, I ended up withdrawing from the program because my head and heart both just weren’t in it. I immediately got a job in the nonprofit sector and had zero drive or passion for it. It wasn’t a typical corporate job but there was no meaning to it and I hated being disrespected and talked down to like I had no worth. So I trusted my gut and left. Right now for income, I am a “freelancer,” taking care of people’s dogs. I started about a month ago and have made ~$700 which is decent for starters but not remotely enough for survival. I’m very content watching dogs for money as it brings me a lot of joy and is my primary form of therapy and encourages me to get some exercise in when I have a dog under my care. 

I also have a lot of interest in creative work particularly in digital media. I’m currently helping a friend launch her business by helping her design templates for social media use that matches her aesthetic and branding. She does not have any clients at the moment since she has not launched yet so I told her I’d be happy to help her without any monetary compensation right now since it’ll help me build a portfolio. I love this type of work but I also need more income, but do not want to make the same mistakes of jumping into a job solely for the money. I want to continue freelancing but feel stuck/unqualified and I know the market is saturated. I’m not looking to make 6 figures a year but simply just enough to be comfortable and then some. Any advice for me here on next steps? I’d love to hear your story if you started from the bottom freelancing and now do it for a full-time income!",False,k0zy3q,sy403,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k0zy3q/career_prospects_for_those_who_hate_work_not_lazy/,5,1
231,What is so wrong with taking a leave of absence from working?,"When I was in college about 1.5 years in I found myself completely depressed and anxiety ridden because I had no idea what I wanted to do and went right to college after HS. Luckily I found the strength to take a leave of absence from school even after my father yelling at me and being quite upset at the fact I needed a break...ended up working 2 jobs for a year off from school and was the best thing I ever did. Got my bearings and finished college after that.

But now since I’m done college and in the workforce I feel like I need another break from this fucking work. I’ve been at it for 4 years since graduating and the 15-20 days off we get a year DO NOT CUT IT.

I wish I could take a leave of absence from my job and go back in a few months but I feel like no one ever offers that unless you are pregnant?? I guess I just need to quit and find another job after I’ve recouped my mental.

But again even mentioning this to my father he said “you need to minimize the time between this job and your next” fucking why? If I want to take 1,2 or 3 months off with some of the safety net I’ve acquired from working and live cheaply for a few months before getting another job I should be able to.

243,Don't keep asking me the day before if I can work the next day and get mad when I say no.,"My boss used to occasionally ask me on Thursday evenings if I could could come in and work on Fridays. I told him that Thursday evening was not enough notice as I had a newborn at home and was relying on family (who also worked) to watch him while my husband and I were at work. He said fair enough.

He kept asking me on Thursday evenings to work the following Friday and I would constantly tell him, ""I've told you, it's not enough notice. If you knew on Monday that you wanted me to work on Friday, you should've told me Monday, I could prepare. But you keep coming out of nowhere, asking me at random to work on Fridays."" 

My shifts were 4am-2pm Tue-Thurs. I worked outside as a traffic control officer at an airport. The pay was good, but I could've definitely used the hours, if he'd given me the chance to accept them.

A few weeks later, he stopped asking me altogether to work on Fridays so I asked him if I could pick up extra shifts, actually have them on my schedule and know in advance when I'd be working rather than being bombarded on random Thursday evenings to work the following day. Especially when I'd have to be there at 4am. It's hard to schedule childcare when you have to work so early.

My boss told me that since I ""never wanted to work"" on the opportune days he gave me, that he didn't want to give me an extra day on my ACTUAL schedule so he just hired someone else to cover the Friday shift.

I couldn't stand him. He was such a stuck up, backwards son of a bitch. He always changed the rules too.

255,the progressive international will conduct a day of action against amazon,"@ PROGRESSIVE INTERNATIONAL

Yesterday, shocking leads revealed that Amazon has been spying on
warehouse workers, environmental activist, social movements around
the world.

why?

Because CEO Jeff Bezos is scared of us — scared that we will
come to collect on the debts that Amazon owes to its workers, to our
societies, and the planet.

Two weeks ago, we asked you which corporation should be the target
of the Progressive International's first global action. Now, we are ready
to announce it.

In the days to come, the Progressive International will launch a
global campaign to take on Amazon, alongside dozens of trade
unions, social movements, and organizations. And we will be calling
on you to raise your voice and get involved.

To get ready. Our global day of action is coming soon.

262,To my fellow creative field antiwork people...,"It is not the hardest job and there’s worst I know but MAN the mental toll. 

Between being in house and being asked to basically do everything from marketing to webdesign to coding to social media ( hello, I was hired for graphic design and the pay reflects that...) and being sent the same project for revisions 5 times because your boss doesn’t know what he even wants or being a freelancer and having clients that take the absolute PISS because they tell you they can get a logo off fiverr for 5£. 

I’ve worked in other industries before and this creative stuff is where I’ve witnessed the most exploitation - it gets worst than retail sometimes. The amount of people working “for free” for “portfolio” or for the promise of a role that never comes to fruition ( of course). Crazy hours too. 

I work in the fashion industry. I got exploited so fucking much as a graduate now I’m 8 years deep and man do I hate it all. I do bare minimum, mostly freelance, work and thankfully I can drop terrible clients but even the decent ones I can’t stomach anymore. Always tryna get more work for free, tryna get “favours” and extra here and there. Piss off. I try to get the most commercial and straight forward work possible : boring sales banners and product photoshoots that’s my shit. Used to do fashion advertisement campaigns for “cool” brands as a creative director but behind a “cool” brand is a nightmare of a middle aged trustfunded boss trust me lol

Or an agreement between a landlord and a lobbyist to petition for the right to raise rents higher than what people can afford, leaving people to struggle in the streets. On a more drastic level an agreement between a prime minister and his country's corporate elite to begin the stripping away the people's freedoms or their right to exist. There is some breaking point that everyone has where one handshake can drive them so far into a corner that there is no coming back.

It was also in a field I didn't enjoy and overall I was extremely depressed. I quit this job and was unemployed for a while.

Then I got a job I thought sounded fun. It was advertised as a dispatch position and you were required to have a Bachelor's. ""Great!"" I thought. 

I get the job and it is apparent immediately in the training that this is a call center that does sales for alarm systems, not a dispatch position. After being screamed enough by customers during week 2 of training I quit.

Now I'm working a temporary job with a mail carrier where I deliver packages. The job is outside, part time, and fun. I like it, but it's going to end in 4 weeks. 

I just got out of my horrible depression with this job, but I know soon I will have to get something else. I applied to a position I'm qualified for at the library and I am just HOPING SO MUCH I get it but I'm so so afraid I'm going to have to go back to something like the call center or just work retail or something. 

I want to work remotely really badly but never get any responses from the jobs I apply to. I only apply to things I feel I genuinely would enjoy because I don't see the point in getting jobs I know I will quit. I don't know what the secret is to getting the kind of jobs I want. 

My degree is a really marketable one actually but where I live is very industrial and there are few jobs for my field here and I can't move. The only jobs I can get with my degree all pay really well but they're all the same field as the first job I had originally this year.

I have a decent career with low voltage systems, mainly nurse call and school PA systems.
I was with one company in the same field for 3 years and I'm now coming up to a year in my current company. I've done well so far and got a promotion.

I don't  think I can keep this pace up and downgrading makes me feel physically ill.
I'm so swamped with sites and ""small jobs"" I'm finding it hard to even eat. The opportunities are endless as long as I keep pushing.

I'm considering dropping everything and figuring out how to live without a steady income. I'm not necessarily antiwork but I'm afraid if I keep pushing for this ""success"" I'm going to end up having a mental breakdown.

300,[RANT] Supervisor and higher-management gets paid at least double for less work and being able to boss around?," I remember my first day where I got almost fired twice.

 some supervisor made only me do the literal heavy-lifting for things that were also at a high place where I could barely reach filled with items of varying sizes, some which fell on me. She made me do it for like ten aisles, alone. I started on one aisle, and and then a coworker called me to two other aisles to work on. After I worked on those i returned (still having some of my energy left after all those heavy-lifting) to the initial aisle and the supervisor thought i hadn't budged from there and called me slow and ""speed up dude"" in her accent. I can understand questioning me to check why I was slow (i wasn't), but 

i thought if you were getting paid better, especially being at a higher-level with less work, you would be acting more professional, but no guess you just want to stroke your ego.

Later, I finished all my assignments, and was given an easier task. After I went to get other resources, i noticed my work-station was hijacked by others who have been working there for years. They also used up all the things I was using. Since it was still my first day, I didn't know where to look for it, and i went back to the usual place hoping someone filled it up again , though it was still empty. Suddenly the manager? sees me ask why I am doing nothing, although it was only 1 minute i stepped away from my work, after it got hijacked, to look for new work. I saw his face getting angry thinking that i wasn't slaving at all (more misunderstanding), which made me even angrier having this similar thing happen to me on the same (first-) day on i kept a stern face told him what I was doing, and he backed off somewhat . 

Was this a victory? NO! In the end I was still a slave, wasting my time (only minimum wage compensation), doing more and dangerous work, than my bosses, for my bosses to earn their pity and and be chewed upon by their misunderstanding.

 I mentioned they also want to stroke their egos. Well, this way, your ego will also be getting bigger along with the number of your enemies. I thought they enjoyed their ""'wonderful'"" career and life, so why do they make more enemies?

304,Exploitation of new employees.,"I wanted to share a story of a day of work which just ended, and at the same time, make a point.

Today our boss was out for most of the day so my colleague who's been working there for 4 years decides she does not want to cook. (I work at an Italian restaurant, so cooking is our job). She went and made unimportant and kind of useless things the whole day (cleaning every corner and etc.). While prep-kitchen work is something all experienced employees do everyday inbetween rush hours for an hour or two everyday, she pretended to be there most of the day. I'm not dumb. I know what has to be done there and how long it takes. I also was in a terrible condition, my stomach hurt and I was super nauseous and since food and cooking makes lots of smells (onions, bacon, etc.) my day was super hard which I mentioned from the very start of the shift. She didn't care though. She'd show up in moments of rush where I couldn't do everything alone, mind you she didn't come in to help me, somebody would call her in (that happened maybe twice). She'd come in, start making some orders and when she'd notice I'm done with mine, she would just say (here, I've started two of those, finish them, and move on). So I'd finish hers and... go on. Alone. 

My last straw was when the shift manager asked me to clean the fridge (where drinks are stored) and while I was doing it she was back and standing by the pan and then shift manager brought her a couple of orders so she just turned around and left screaming (get them done!). I pretended to not hear her and so she came back and just told me - can you make those? I'm sick of cooking. Though she barely cooked today - she had most of the stack of takeaway food boxes, pretty much all, while I, on the other hand was almost halfway through my second full stack. While I was cooking she didn't even bother to pretend to work - she just stood there, supporting her head with elbows on the table and was talking to the shift manager. Later when shift manager went for a break she would just yell out orders and wait until I make them. Because I was in a hurry, I fucked up two orders, because I forgot to read the comments. She gave me shit for this and also for making a bit of a mess in her side of the refridgerator where our ingredients are stored, which is usual when you are... you know... working? Especially since I was doing it all alone. She made me clean it all up while she sat by the table with her phone 'waiting for orders to come'. It was really nice when she was telling me amounts and names of dishes and watching me hurry while just sitting. I feel exhausted since I had nausea and terrible stomach pains and was working alone all day even through most of the rushes. Which is not a new experience. That happens a lot not only when you're new, but if you are also young especially.

Most working environments are toxic like that and they suck. How is one supposed to be happy after being stressed out after having to do all the work on time and without mistakes all day.

306,"You live under a system of servitude, which is why ""freedom"" propaganda is so prevalent","I've probably made a post like this in the past, but I don't care because this is important. The word freedom and the word servitude both have definitions. When I was a teenager, I truly wish an adult looked me in the eyes, and explained this simple truth to me, so as an adult, I'm going to explain it to whoever is reading this. 

The definition of [servitude](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/freedom) is ""a condition in which one lacks liberty especially to determine one's course of action or way of life""

The definition of [freedom](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/freedom) is ""the absence of necessity, coercion, or constraint in choice or action""

Every human you have ever met lives under Capitalism, and you will be taking part in it or else. This, by definition, means you are under a system of servitude, the opposite of a system of freedom or free choice. 

I'm not making an argument, I'm simply explaining to you that words mean things. They have definitions. You don't have to like it, you don't have to agree, because again, it's not an argument. Like I said, I wish as a teenager a adult told me the truth, but that never happened. It would have helped me a lot to know that at least someone has a grasp of what is going on and was able to explain it in such a simple way.

Instead of the truth, I was, like so many of us, lied to by economic propaganda and the victims of that propaganda. I was never sat down and told that no, I don't live in a free country, and I most likely will not in my lifetime, and I really, really wish someone would have told me that. I hate the fact that I had to learn that as an adult. 

If someone tells you they live in a free country, they are accidentally lying to you. You're not special, your country is not special, it is no more or less free than anywhere else. You live under the same system of economic servitude as North Koreans. If someone tries to convince you that you live in a free country, I would not take life advice from them. I'm not saying treat them poorly, they are victims of propaganda, and you should feel bad for them and try to educate them in an attempt to ""break the spell."" 

Don't let lies win, don't let propaganda win. Tell the truth, tell your kids the truth. Tell as many people young and old as you can the truth. I know it's uncomfortable to accept this fact, but it's very important that as many people know the truth as possible, otherwise the world will continue the way it is, and if you care about humanity, you know we can't allow that.",False,k2k1be,nbatman,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k2k1be/you_live_under_a_system_of_servitude_which_is_why/,0,1

309,This is how fucked the system is,"My goal is to not have to work ever again. I did pretty much EVERYTHING perfect (and got incredibly lucky), and the earliest possible age I'll be able to retire is 40.


Here's all the things that went right:


*I joined the military at 17 years old, right out of high school. Earliest start possible. I was essentially working a full time job. I had to deploy twice and put my life on the line for 4 years.


*I did not leave the service unscathed however. I have quite a few issues with my health that have put me on 30% disability. The government sends me $400 a month to make up for this.


*After I got out, I worked two jobs (40 hrs/wk total), while on the GI bill, and got a STEM degree. No student loans, and I had steady income.


*I got a job making 55,000 a year. I quit after a year and got a new job making 80,000 a year.


*I bought a tinyhouse for 80,000. My loan + taxes comes to about 800/mo. Electricity, internet, water, etc bring it to 900/mo.


*I have a girlfriend that pays me $200/mo in rent


I don't do much aside from play free videogames. If you're wondering where I got the age/calculations from, It is assuming a 4.5% growth and essentially having enough money in the market that the 4% of returns each month equals what I spend monthly.

Short of having someone give me a ton of money and rolling a 100 on luck, things really worked out for me... I was born into a working class family and both worked my ass off and got incredibly lucky along the way. I didn't die in the service. I didn't have student loans. I got job offers. I was able to find a new better paying job.

I spent time researching investing the correct way too. And if the market doesn't crash and continues an upward trend... The earliest I could POTENTIALLY hope to not have to work again, is at the age of 40, after having worked 23 years of the prime of my life.


How fucked is that? That is only if you do EVERYTHING PERFECT. There are so many people out there who weren't nearly as lucky as me. The didn't get that job offer, or they had some medical condition come up that BANKRUPTS THEM and now they can barely afford to feed themselves or their families.

The book he recommended was called **Atlas Shrugged**. The way he talked about it, it sounded completely anti-antiwork. But I'm still curious about it because I like to expand my bubble and learn about all sorts of points of views and opinions. Except the book iss soooo long and I read really slowly. 

Can someone give me a quick overview so I know it's worth it and that I don't waste my time reading something boring.

Along with unpaid time spent on tests and work samples and interviews, employers are increasingly adding the step of requiring an essay or answers a bunch of essay-style questions on the topic of why you want the job/why they should give it to you. The kinds of questions that could come up in an interview.  In my experience this comes before any interview or even a brief phone screen.  Sometimes it's required just to submit your application.

You can't just dash them off in 20 minutes either.  It's 5-20 in-depth questions asking for *detailed* info about specific stuff.  Plus if you want the job you want to write something halfway intelligent, so that will take longer.  You could easily spend several hours preparing your application.

**With no guarantee that any of it will ever be read.**

Sure, I can pop off a resume and cover letter.  If they're *actually interested* in me we can take it from there.  But this essay stuff is so unreasonable.  I figure jobseekers are putting in literally billions of unpaid hours a year on stuff like this.  Nothing stops employers from making their hiring process as onerous as they want, as long as some applicants are willing to do it.  any are!

328,My relationship with anti-work ideology,"When I was younger I had a list of things I wanted to be when I grew up. Scientist, president, teacher. The usual.

I grew up and went to school for Fine Art, thinking I'd find a career doing something I was passionate about. College killed that passion for me, and I came out still not knowing for sure what I wanted to do.

I graduated and, not knowing what I wanted to do and desperately needing a job, I became a pre-kindergarten teacher. And while the job itself was fulfilling and it was super satisfying seeing the kids learn from me, the office staff and the other teachers were a mess. The owner was getting away with a lot of illegal shit when it came to running the daycare (nothing that harmed the kids, but shady shit in terms of employment. Refused to hire men, reduced pay to minimum wage if you no-call, no-showed, fired people on a whim without reasonable explanation, even once refused to give an employee the day off when said employee had a court date).

I left that job and moved back to my hometown, realizing that I no longer wanted to work for someone else. I started working Doordash. It's not the best, but it's feeding me and I can work when I want and there's not much interaction. Not too many complaints.

I caught up with an old friend recently and she asked me what I want to do with my life. ""I just wanna be myself and live my life."" I told her. This wasn't good enough for her.

""No, like, what do you want to do for work?""

""I don't want to work.""

""Yeah, no one wants to work.""

""I don't want to be defined by my job. Working is not the be-all, end-all for me.""

She kind of smirked and rolled her eyes at me. 

I don't know what my future looks like in terms of working. Doordash and Grubhub are not forever gigs for me. I have a useless degree that's burned out most of my passion. So the future is unclear. But what is clear is that I am worth more than being defined by a job. I am more than someone's employee that they don't actually care about once they've stopped signing my paychecks.

349,A rant re: bullshit jobs,"My job is essentially pointless. I analyse digital trade for a big fast fashion retailer. Right now it’s Black Friday so I feel especially guilty about all the needless consumerism, but even when it’s not a big promo event like now, it takes me an hour and a half tops to do everything I need to do. I’m very happy I can work from home since corona so I can actually do things I enjoy doing with my day however I am dreading going back to the office from 9-6, (9-5 on a Friday as an “early finish” - wtf?) and staring at a screen doing nothing for 6 hours. My boss will sometimes make up things for me to do just so we can fill the time. Eg new “trackers” that we need that aren’t really tracking anything new at all. Sometimes my boss will ask me to take a screenshot of sales for her so she can add it into an email. Or my favourite pointless task is when my boss asks me to add in links (literally just copying and pasting URLs of products) into a google sheet when it would taken her 2 mins to do it herself. 

It just seems insane to me how vastly accepted this is. I feel crazy sometimes because I can’t believe how backward everything is and how little it seems I can do to change it. It was even crazier when I realised that not everyone thinks like this deep down either. We say “thank god it’s Friday” like it’s normal to hate 5 out of 7 days of the week. The human experience could have been amazing but I am literally sitting at a desk analysing how I can get people to buy more mass produced clothing, which not only were made unethically but directly contributes to the climate crisis, fast fashion and my CEO getting richer and richer whilst I make barely enough to live on. 

Honestly I get very depressed thinking that this is the rest of my life, although I am lucky enough to have some savings which I’m hoping to grow so I can one day just go back to nature, get a much more chilled job that isn’t helping to kill the planet, and never have to look at google sheets ever again.",False,k2052y,gothsartre,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k2052y/a_rant_re_bullshit_jobs/,13,1

My boss will literally call you out on an email with the whole sales team CC'd, or call your cell and ask why you're not at your desk. I got tired of it and I found an app that moves your mouse so Teams/Skype/whatever IM shows as active and doesn't time out. 

I turn it on first thing in the morning and leave it on all day, respond to email on my phone (changed the ""sent from my iPhone"" signature first thing), and dial into any meetings from my cell. Also, I use Outlook's Delay Send feature to space out my emails so they send at random times throughout the afternoon and at 7:30-8 the next morning. The mouse-mover app I use is slackinoffwork.com if anyone's interested (idk if links are allowed)

369,Perspective from a Manager.,"I worked at a company for 12 years from part-time to salaried department manager. (Not that the pay was very great, I have since left) but it gave me a different perspective on managing people. For most of those years I worked under a manager and asking for time off was always like trying to grind diamonds with play-doh and we'd be given groans and I don't know blah blah blah or had to ""make it up somewhere else"" cause they were doing us a solid by letting us have time off, as part-time employees mind you (even if we were working 40hrs a week)

So when it came my time to sit in the chair I found out being a manager was laughably easy. (Retail mind you, nothing is THAT important in retail). I told my employees never to worry about asking for time off, you are part time, you don't get paid vacation time, you are telling me when and when you cannot work, no questions asked. I asked if anyone had preferred regular work weeks or special needs (like I need to be home by whenever for kids, or school or whatever) and made a set weekly schedule for everyone so they could count on consistency of what to expect instead of our previous shooting fish in a barrel toss up of what was coming schedule. I asked everyone to give me as much notice on ""day-off requests"" as possible and accomidated (even if it was last minute) I asked before putting someone else in their place to cover that shift and if no one could/would, tough beans we were a little short that day (again retail, never THAT important) I always encouraged younger employees who would talk about leaving to go back to school or train for a better job. I had realistic expectations of their motivation for making a company money was (which is none) but just expected them to do their jobs not stress themselves out about it. I ended up having the best functioning department in the whole store within a few months of treating my employees like people with lives outside of work and who were only here cause they need $. It wasn't fucking hard. If I had the authority to give out raises to everyone would get them.

I don't really know what the takeaway here is, maybe just that you are not asking for time off, you are telling your employer when and when you cannot work. It is not your job to stress nor your responsibility to put your mental/physical health on the line for any job. You manager/boss whatever may be stressed about things, but their job is usually just as unimportant as yours and they don't need to be stressed, the world keeps turning, never stress about work, it's your life first and foremost.",False,k2p9wn,BucketsOfOnions,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k2p9wn/perspective_from_a_manager/,13,1

There is no boss breathing down your neck besides a morning check in and a weekly meeting with everyone. No one cares how you do things as long as you get all your tasks done for the day.

I've seen a lot of people say how they'd love to have a job where you have a lot of the control. But not me. I hate that soon I'll have to be figuring out what needs to be done on my own. I NEED someone to guide me, tell me what to do, and tell me I did it right. Not just when I first learn the task. Every single time. This is most likely because my sister kind of bullied me throughout my childhood and would call me stupid and rant about all the things I did wrong over just trying to make dinner. I don't trust my abilities, my pace, and my judgement for this job. I feel like once I'm on my own it'll take me 10.5-11 hours instead of my normal 9.5.

I go to a small, private gym. They have a sign in sheet so if someone tests positive they can alert people who were in during those times. I was alerted about a member who tested positive that I was exposed to and I promptly informed HR like a good little boy. 

Later on, I was then pulled into a conference room where the CEO accused me of lying and saying that I’m just trying to get extra paid time off before the holiday. By the way, I work a desk job, you know, one of those jobs that can be done remotely? He said there is no remote work at my company (even though we did for two months in March). Anyways, he goes on to say the days that I quarantined in the past (and worked from home) I wasn’t actually being paid to work, they were paying me hazard pay. He blamed me for being in close contact with this person and that I was being irresponsible. All the while, they’ve made the determination that I’m probably safe and don’t need to get tested.

But competency based interviews do not focus on the knowledge someone has but on how they parrot corporate ideological garbage back to the hiring panel. They also discriminate against introverts and people on the spectrum. When practiced they are a tool of psychological prejudice, a type of crime, yet not many people recognise this and seem to think they're fantastic. I find this bizarre, although the general public have lost their sanity in recent years. Finally, are there fields which are immune to this infesting, toxic, corporate effluent or has this interview technique infected every area of the working world?",False,k0g4lr,TheCassiniProjekt,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k0g4lr/competency_based_interviews/,1,1

Now I'm struggling financially at the moment quite badly, and my employer is very well aware of this. Losing my car has been almost the final nail in this closing coffin, I'll take any shift they can give me.

389,Toil after toil,"I was in a role I enjoyed for about 3 months, when I got made permanent in January of this year. The service desk expanded external management came in, he was a complete and utter narcissist, bullied me from the get go and because I struggle with bpd, gad etc I felt awful knowing that the tight-knit team of friends with autonomy was about to be ruined. He brought in loads of his old mates including 3 'supervisors' who were even more incompetent than him, narcissistic and unwilling to learn anything technical. I basically ran the team despite being given the lowest grade and salary along with 3 of the original guys. He didn't want me having any official power because he knew how much of a threat I was. I always speak my mind, I am very vocal and extremely competent at what I do. It frightens these types because they've gotten through life through kissing ass, nepotism, smearing and bullying. Taking the piss generally. So they target me and eventually trigger me into a reaction and I have to quit before I'm pushed.

 I won't go into the details more than that but I ended up resigning and had a pretty fun time on gardening leave in all honestly, but I became an alcoholic due to losing my job I loved (helping people fix issues and making their day better was my joy). That was around July/August time. I then was able to get sober after some gruelling 2 months of withdrawal. I then somehow managed to get a job as  a team leader, on the same money as I was on before, but no night shift. Little did I realise how hard management would be for me. It's a completely different skill set to just doing tech support, I have been told I am doing a great job but managing 2 teams and being on call 24/7 is so unbelievably stressful.

My boyfriend is currently working insane shifts at his job, sometimes not getting home until 4am. I work 16-hour shifts a couple times a week. We still live paycheck to paycheck regardless of how many hours we're able to pick up.

I'm able to see him a few hours a day before he goes into work and not at all on the weekends since I'm working basically the entirety of it. I'd like to find another job so I could see him more but mine pays just enough to where I cannot leave it (and by that I mean barely over $15 an hour).

I had a rough year in 2019. I lost my grandfather due to heart failure and my brother was hit and killed in a motorcycle accident. I was provided ZERO days off to even attend either funeral. When I came back to work, my boss asked me, ""How are you even here? There's no way I would be able to come here after that."" Well gee, if the company cared enough, I WOULD have paid days off but here we are. 

My family was already extremely small before both tragedies and now, I barely have anyone left. I just want to be home cuddling my boyfriend, working on my mental health, and enjoying my life.

My  coworkers  would talk about drinking, their marriages, divorces, their  college  lives, their retirement funds, etc. I remember just wanting to  end it  all. I don't know if anyone here has ever worked alongside much  older  people, but it's excruciating. And on top of that, we were just  so  different. It was the kind of environment where I couldn't question   people's views on things even though they often broached politics or   controversial issues. It was an echo chamber. I remember just staring at   customers, at my coworkers, and into space. Just so confused and   saddened by everything, wondering what my life had come to. I would stay   up at night dreading having to go to work the next day.

It   got to a point where I started taking off work constantly. I showed up   late. Then I just stopped showing up without any notice. I remember my   supervisor taking me aside and saying, ""You used to be my favorite   employee; what happened to you?"" And it's true. I used to be a great   employee. At the time I was hired, I was just happy to be making money.   But the more and more I worked there, spending 8 hours a day there, the   more exhausted I became with the environment. I plunged into this deep   depression. I even came in one day and shaved my head (I'm a guy and  was  known for my quite-long hair at work). It just kept compounding and   compounding.

By the time I was finished, it was clear that even being propped up in bed was making me worse. So I called in today in the hopes that lying flat would help my back.

427,Creative ideas help?,"I am absolutely pro ending capitalism, forced work, and the idea that every being created needs to ""earn a living"" despite having had no choice in being born. 

HOWEVER I am already born, and forgive me please if this isn't the right sub to ask this, but I'm not sure where else in my life I can post it without being attacked for being anti work.

I need suggestions for how I can earn a livable income (*at least* $16/ hr or $2G/ month CAD) doing something that 

- is not 6/7 days, 8hrs/ day, $14.25/hr CAD, no benefits, retail 

- does not involve too many people

- is not outdoors

- does not require a credit card 

- is moderately enjoyable and involves art, writing, or creativity somehow...but is not so stressful that it totally commodifies my hobbies 

I was planning on returning to post-secondary but the amount of government assistance that I am approved for is still greatly insufficient to cover my living costs *and* school fees. So please do not make any school related suggestions as I cannot afford them. I also cannot afford any union fees, or any ""startup materials"" costs.

I'm also relatively nihilistic on my own, so as much as dark humor is usually appreciated, *in this particular case it is not.* I know it sounds like a pipe dream and nonsense but help a dude out. I'm hoping for some genuine help and answers.

 During that time I've been the unofficial second hand of the department behind my manager. My pay barely increased.  

During that time my workload increased dramatically to pick up the slack in the department. My pay barely increased.  

Just over two years ago I took a month of work for my mental health as my job was causing me insane anxiety and depression. During that month It was made abundantly clear that I needed to get better, or get out. My mental health is the worse it's ever been and I'm still there.  
  
During the pandemic our industry is probably the busiest and most disorganised across the board its ever been. Yesterday I got called into a meeting for an ""Unofficial verbal warning"" as I'm making more mistakes. No mention of how I'm now basically the busiest in the department now.

That and the looming threat of if I don't get better my job is basically on the line I've finally thought, ""Fuck this place"". 
 
 
For where I need advice, I'm currently living with my parents with no plans of moving out too soon. I have enough saved up to pay my way at home.

But for some time now, I have begun to suspect that the issue is actually with the society we all live in. I read a really interesting article entitled '[This is your brain on neoliberalism](https://neweconomics.org/2020/10/this-is-your-brain-on-neoliberalism)', and it (among other readings) made me realise that many of my problems can be put down to the fear/stress state my mind is being put into due to the poisonous socio-economic system we live in. I also believe that a large part of the problem is that we are essentially designed to be nomadic hunter gatherers, living in a system which relies on our financial dependence. I don't really know what the solution is, I think a universal basic income would at least mean that we don't have to rely on soul crushing wage slavery just to make ends meet, but ideally we would return to an existence that we were evolutionary designed for.

462,Examples of living without ‘work’," 

I read this excerpt a while before I found this subreddit and I finally found it so I could post it here:

“In the European squatter’s movement, some cities have had or continue to have so many squatted social centers and houses that they constitute a shadow society. In Barcelona, for example, as recently as 2008 there were over forty occupied social centers and at least two hundred squatted houses. The collectives of people who inhabit these squats generally use consensus and group assemblies, and most are explicitly anarchist or intentionally anti-authoritarian. To a large extent, work and exchange have been abolished from these people’s lives, whose networks run into the thousands. Many do not have waged jobs, or they work only seasonally or sporadically, as they do not need to pay rent. For example the author of this book, who has lived within this network for two years, has survived for much of that time on less than one euro a day. Moreover, the great amount of activity they carry out within the autonomous movement is completely unwaged. But they do not need wages: they work for themselves. They occupy abandoned buildings left to rot by speculators, as a protest against gentrification and as anti-capitalist direct action to provide themselves with housing. Teaching themselves the skills they need along the way, they fix up their new houses, cleaning, patching roofs, installing windows, toilets, showers, light, kitchens, and anything else they need. They often pirate electricity, water, and internet, and much of their food comes from dumpster-diving, stealing, and squatted gardens.

In the total absence of wages or managers, they carry on a great deal of work, but at their own pace and logic. The logic is one of mutual aid.”

I know dumpster diving and squatting probably isn't most people's ideal vision of their life, but I also don't think working your life away at a meaningless job is most people's ideal vision either. 

This is from “Anarchy Works” by Peter Gelderloos. [(link)](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/peter-gelderloos-anarchy-works#toc22)  There are lots of examples of stateless societies and people functioning outside of our definition of work today, it’s super long but really in depth. It covers tons of topics and questions like, “Without wages, what is the incentive to work?” “Don’t people need bosses and experts?” and lots of information on how decisions are made in equitable societies, and how disputes are solved. Here are a few more excerpts from what I’ve read:

“Some worry that if we abolish capitalism and wage-labor, no one will work anymore. It is true that work as it exists now for most people would cease to exist; but work that is socially useful offers a number of incentives besides the paycheck. If anything, getting paid to do something makes it less enjoyable. The alienation of labor that is a part of capitalism destroys natural incentives to work such as the pleasure of acting freely and the satisfaction of a job well done. When work puts us in a position of inferiority — to the boss who oversees us and the wealthy people who own our workplace — and we do not have decision-making power in our job but must mindlessly follow orders, it can become excruciatingly odious and mind-numbing. We also lose our natural incentive to work when we are not doing something that is useful for our communities. Of the few workers today who are lucky enough to actually produce something they can see, they are nearly all making something that is profitable to their employers but completely meaningless to them personally. The Fordist or assembly line structuring of labor turns people into machines. Instead of cultivating skills workers can be proud of, it proves more cost-effective to give each person a single repetitive task and put him or her on an assembly line. No wonder so many workers sabotage or steal from their workplaces, or show up with an automatic weapon and “go postal.”

“Indigenous societies with less division of labor had no problem doing without wages, because the primary economic activities — producing food, housing, clothing, tools — are all easily connected to common needs. In such circumstances, work is a necessary social activity and an apparent obligation from every member of the community who is able. And because it takes place in a flexible, personal setting, work can be adapted to every individual’s capabilities, and there is nothing to keep people from transforming work into play. Fixing up your house, hunting, wandering in the woods identifying plants and animals, knitting, cooking a feast — aren’t these the things that bored middle-class people do in their leisure hours to forget their loathsome jobs for a moment?”",False,jzw3aq,Ratsincorduroy,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jzw3aq/examples_of_living_without_work/,4,1
463,A person can be disabled without receiving Disability from the government,"The government isn't the end all be all on a person's condition.

It feels dehumanizing to go through the process of being denied Disability  when you are struggling to maintain a normal life. That you are  disabled enough to struggle through life, jobs, school, and basic needs  but not enough in the eyes of the government. Your homelessness or  suicide risk isn't a factor in how your disability is affecting your  life, its glossed over like some footnote. It feels like the government  saying you are not disabled, when you are.

This  post stems from being told I'm not disabled because I don't receive  Disability, it's been on my mind for a year since I was asking for  reasonable accommodation at my last job.

478,"Job hunting, ""work-life balance,"" and guilt","Like far too many other people, I'm currently looking for a job. The field I'm in is underpaid, competitive, and has been drastically impacted by the pandemic. I'm also a full-time grad student, so I'm not qualified for many of the jobs I'm interested in.

I interviewed for one of the jobs I applied for recently--it's at an institution I've already been interning at as part of my coursework. They just wrote back to me inviting me back for another round of interviewing (why do I need to go in for multiple interviews for a low-level position?). It's good pay, good benefits. Obviously I could use the money and the benefits would be good to have especially since they're not common for the positions I'm qualified for. 

But I just can't imagine what my life would look like if they offered me the job and I took it. Trying to balance full-time studies and work, keeping my house in order, maintaining my relationships, and actually investing in taking care of my physical and mental health? I worked part-time and went to school full-time in undergrad, and I was exhausted, anxious, and depressed. I stopped doing pretty much all of my hobbies because I didn't have the energy. I socialized a lot less than I wanted to, ate like crap, didn't get enough sleep. I survived, but I didn't LIVE. I'm scared to do that again, especially because I feel like I'm starting to reclaim that creative, adventurous, active part of me that died during that time.

But when I think of turning down the interview or the job itself, I'm overwhelmed with a sense of guilt. So many people would KILL to get a job like this one. Who knows when another job might come up for me--I've been applying for positions intermittently since March and this is the first one that's wanted to interview me at all. I can't keep not having a job forever. I would be hurting myself by not accepting the job. But I know I would be hurting myself by accepting it too.

I just feel resentful that I'm forced into this position of having to choose between... my mental health and my mental health. Do I want to have money but feel dead inside and overwhelmed every day? Or do I want to have more time for myself but be stressing about finding a job and having enough money and be worrying about ""advancing my career"" and all that? And I feel resentful that so many people have it worse than I do that my situation would be an enviable one. I just want to do some good in the world while also taking care of myself.

This will probably be the longest, most honest and detailed, employment ad you will ever read.

We did this so that you don't waste your time applying for a job that you know, deep down, is not for you.

We want to lay it out from the get go - what type of person we are looking for and what we expect from you.

If you are up for a job that is as demanding as it is rewarding, please continue reading the rest of this ad. If you are up to the challenge, we look forward to receiving your application, resume and cover letter.

To those of you who read this entire ad and apply for the position, we thank you in advance and look forward to meeting you.

We are looking to hire offshore talent for the position of Digital Marketing Assistant.

This is not a temporary position, the successful applicant will become an integral part of our team.

We are looking for a hardworking, detail-oriented individual to be our staff.

What will you do?

Our Digital Marketing Assistant helps plan and implement our marketing and advertising activities. Directly manage multi-channel campaigns from start to finish, including strategy development, execution, and analysis based on specific goals. Optimize, test and analyze targeting, campaign structures, ad copy, and bid strategies to drive results in line with our goals. Identify and maximize new opportunities for client growth. Strong understanding of Google Ads and Analytics, Facebook Advertising and/or LinkedIn.

What are some characteristics that you should have?

You will need to speak English and Spanish clearly. You will need strong grammar and writing skills in both English and Spanish.

You must be a positive person. If you see the glass as being half full, you are the type of person we are looking for. Our office does not do well with toxic or negative attitudes, complainers or victims, and you will not fit in if you even think that you may fit into one of the above categories of negative people.

You must be competent and proficient in the use of Facebook and Instagram at a minimum. The more computer experience with social media the better.

We prefer people who are not afraid of computers or learning new things that will make their jobs easier.

If you lose stuff, are not organized, and get easily distracted, please don't apply.

You need to be detail oriented and willing to go the extra mile to get the job done right the first time. In our practice getting it done right the first time for our clients is very important and we need everyone to work with this goal in mind. If this seems too much to ask of you, don't apply for this job. As a way to test your attention to detail we have included a question on our application which reads “Do you feel attention to detail is important?” Please answer this question by placing the words “Apple Pie” and nothing else in the space provided for your answer.

You must be a team player. We are strong believers in the team approach, so if you are not a team player, this is not the job for you.

You need to be able to interact with people in a manner that is polite, educated, and puts them at ease.

You cannot talk down to anyone that you deal with in our office. You need to have compassion when dealing with those you meet as part of our team.

Your ability to listen to what you are being told and ask follow up questions is very important. If you cannot listen, understand, evaluate and interview someone, this is not the job for you.

You MUST be able to handle working with several different databases of information. If you aren't 100% confident managing data and people, you are not the right person for this job.

At times, you will also need to know how to figure things out on your own, creatively problem solve and come up with solutions.

To put it simply, we want you to earn what we are paying you. We don't want to pay you to socialize, surf the Internet, e-mail friends and family, work for another company or any other non-work related activities while you are on the clock for us. This does not mean it is not fun to be on our team, it just means we know when we have to work and we know when to have fun.

If this sounds harsh or unfair, then this is not the job for you.

At this point some of you may be thinking that this job will be the worst job in the world. If you are, this is not the job for you.

If, on the other hand, you realize that such a team will help you get your job done efficiently and also have a life outside of work, then you are the type of candidate we would like to discuss the opportunity we are offering.

If you are hired, you will be part of a wonderful team of people, who work hard to get the job done right the first time and take pride in the work that they do. You will be part of a team that is rewarded for their hard work.

Regarding compensation, it is negotiable based upon experience and is subject to review after 90 days. The starting pay range is $600 US Dollars a month during training. After 90 days, if you have completed your training and established yourself as a valuable member of the team you will receive an increase of salary to $800 a month.

You will be challenged but you will have fun and you will enjoy helping our clients.

If you have gotten this far, you are truly an exceptional worker looking for a professional team, as most people will have stopped reading this ad a long time ago. You want to be part of a team where your hard work and efforts are recognized, appreciated and rewarded.

HOW TO APPLY:

Fill out our application and link the necessary documents.

The application requires you to attach two photos one of yourself and of your workstation. For the photo of you please hold a sheet of paper which nsays “The Job Duck”.

In an odd way, if I dig deep now and get the qualifications needed to progress and put the hours in now, technically I’m taking on more responsibility but I’ll actually be “less busy” during the day as middle management Where as I (a worker) run around like a headless chicken from the moment I get in until the moment I leave. 

I see my seniors and management swan in on time in the morning (I come in 40 minutes early every day to catch up with work from yesterday). They make coffee and chat with each other and staff on the floor, they check emails and organise things for the day at their own leisure. My manager sits in her cosy office all day, no interruptions, no one hassling her. Constantly sending our pointless emails telling us what to do, extra roles and responsibilities we need to do. 

Management take multiple coffee breaks/tea breaks and chat constantly throughout the day. If any workers were caught doing that, a very serious talk would happen. If we’re “caught” chatting to other workers we will be pulled up.

We get more and more responsibility and demands pushed on us constantly and it’s burning me out big time. I come in and am haggard at the work load and fast paced environment, scoffing down lunch, never taking a drink of water throughout the day. They are always dressed immaculate, never a hair out of place, never in a rush, never force feeding lunch down to make it back. 

Our allocated lunch time is 30 minutes. Every single worker takes 30 minutes and goes back to relieve the others - management are known to take lunch from anything from 1 hour to an hour and a half. Management are known to go long walks(on company time) and then have a long lunch. Could you imagine if I tried to go for a long walk on company time? It would be an immediate dismissal. 

So yes, as much as I’m an anti worker, I’m also very, very eager to progress.

They proceeded to ask me if I’m available to start immediately to which I said yes and they scheduled an interview over zoom in literally 3 hours time. I’ve looked up the business online and they’re a fashion company that markets heavily on social media selling trainers and tracksuits. 

They even said they’d want me to start as early as tomorrow if I’m successful. Would you go to this interview??? I’m getting really bad feelings about the entire thing. I HATE interviews as it is and the thought of one in about 2 hours makes me want to throw up.",False,k05b9n,amythevegan,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k05b9n/would_you_attend_this_job_interview_scheduled_day/,6,1

511,Why do we seem to want to believe that the art world is a meritocracy?,"Addition to title: ... when nothing under capitalism is (a meritocracy)

So I've been studying and making art for the last 6 years and beyond and something I've had to grapple with is the idea of the self-made artistic genius' success. I used to believe this, too, but I've had to find out that this is magical thinking. However, I keep seeing neoliberal logic around the topic of success in the wider field of artistic world, which to all of those who work in it is infamous for being harshly precarious and instable as a source of income and as having below livable wages for all those who seek to work in it without already having the backing of rich sponsors, read most often rich parents.

Those of us who are the 95% of art students who go on to make a living outside of the field are called ""bitter"" when we bring this up and told that ""maybe we weren't good enough artists"" when that is not what eg. the fine arts market is about at all.

The fine arts market sells status objects that gain value by being charged with symbolic capital, read, references to other greats of the art world, philosophy or politics that are currently ""in"" for rich people to pose with to uphold a facade of charitability and responsibility. Many arts collections are also investments, as art gains value over time rather than losing it, singular artists' sponsorships like bets placed on racehorses in the hopes of an even greater win down the line, and artistic project funding by banks etc. motivated by the incentive to launder money while appearing cultured, social and modern.

That is the plain truth of the field. Even if you try to stay out of the institutional scene, you'll find that it is a schmoozefest. Who knows who, who has a good reputation already, what is in? Who can perform what's hip most convincingly? Who can market themselves more aggressively as THE ONE/S WHO KNOW? 

I wonder if the denial of these circumstances is somewhat of a self-protective mechanism of denial and deflection, à la ""If I made it or my friend did, and we are both competent people, the industry must be fair because how else would we have made it?"". And that denial must be intensified and multiplied in accordance with the cognitive dissonance caused by knowing ourselves to be good artists and responsible people and knowing at the same time that we are not valued for that, but rather for what we can create in terms of symbols of wealth and status, how much we can kiss ass and how we can justify hierarchies by doing the markets' bidding and making luxury items out of dire struggles.

Pardon my language, but I am pissed off. 

We are quintessential flunkies, part-time ducttapers and boxtickers, to use David Graebers categorization, we exist to cool the faces of rich with beautiful fans and to entertain with a multitude of tricks up our sleeves and if we don't do that we're considered worthless under capitalism.

Maybe I am bitter, but I would rather be authentically angry at how I can do almost NOTHING of artistic consequence in my position without it being subsumed under neoliberalism. I am in an institution that lives off my unpaid work, I am not the consumer here, I am the product and the producer at once. Maybe my art is shit, but that doesn't explain why people with equal skill have more opportunities to present and get paid for their work, why they have connections even before getting into university, why they have the money to pay for good supplies, why they have the time to dedicate themselves entirely to their artistic careers, why they can wear designer clothes and spend their evenings at events, networking, why they are the 5% that ""make it"" after uni and the rest of us are non-starters. 

Let me repeat that.

Less than 5% of fine art students go on to find paying work and a career in the field.

Maybe it's different in other areas, but I have a hunch that it's not by much. Those 5%? Tend to be names you already know, or who have one relative or another already in the arts and culture scene.

It's a self-referential, self-maintaining elitist network. Why pretend that it isn't when hardly anything under capitalism is about ability, and so much about what standing you started with?

I know that there is a *highly* discernable difference between wage slavery and chattel slavery.  I'm not advocating wage slaves deserving reparations anytime soon, and especially not until the descendants of chattel slaves receive the reparations they've been requesting.  

An undebatable fact, though, is that today's working class have less rights than serfs/peasants (and that was the catalyst for this thought process).

527,We should use PIRACY to our advantage 🏴‍☠️,"Piracy is a form of **digital anarchy.** 

I know some people think it's selfish because it ""hurts creators,"" but in reality, piracy does nowhere near as much harm as denying less fortunate people access to educational material and potential happiness does. We absolutely should use piracy as a way to ""fight the system,"" not only because it can work, but because it's something that cannot be stopped. It's in OUR control! There is literally nothing they can do about it, other than trying to convince people it's wrong. 

They know they can't stop it, so they lie and try to convince people that copying and stealing are the same thing. The truth is that unlike stealing, when you copy something the original stays exactly as it was. Words have definitions, even if Capitalists would prefer we ignore them. Trying to change or ignore the definitions of words to preserve an outdated economic system is both stupid and dystopian as fuck. 

I believe we should work together to show as many people as possible that our society doesn't need subscription based companies like Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, HBOgo, Amazon Prime and others. Not only would this help in the fight for digital digital freedom, but it could also help people realize that much of our current systems infrastructure is a lie that could be done away with absolutely no downsides. 

Think of all the companies that, just like Netflix, are really only glorified middle men. Take a company like Wal-Mart. What service do they offer other than essentially storing and putting price tags on items? Society can grow, produce and distribute everything Wal-Mart sells, without the need for Wal-Mart. This is true for *every* store. We can manage all the important aspects of production, distribution and storage without these giant companies existing. Selling isn't a requirement of nature, it doesn't add anything beneficial to our society. Another example is landlords. What purpose do they serve? ""Owning"" isn't a service. We can build and distribute homes without them. There are countless examples just like this. 

Companies like Netflix are lying out their teeth when they claim that they're providing a service. Literally every single thing on every single streaming platform is available for free to any person with a internet connection. Anyone can plug a hdmi cord into their TV from their computer and stream, download or torrent the content themselves. We don't need to pay for a streaming service in order to do this. In fact, not only is all the content already available for free, but you'll have access to a **much bigger** library of content than all those services combined. In reality those ""services"" are doing nothing more than limiting what technology is already capable of by splitting all the content onto different platforms. That makes them, by definition, media limiting services. Why the hell should anyone pay just to let a company limit the capability of technology? How is that a service? 

Humanity has the capability to store every movie, book, song, digital class and more in one centralized location. Every single person in the world could have direct access to literally everything that has ever been made digital, for free. Capitalism however, can't keep up, so in order to protect itself, everything is placed behind unnecessary paywalls, stopping technology in it's tracks, and preventing millions of people from sharing, learning and being happy. 

How about **fuck you** Capitalism. 

We should want as many humans with the ability to educate themselves as possible. It's not just about fun stuff like movies, it's also about educational material which is even more important in my eyes. Can you imagine how many humans in the world would have chosen to learn something, but couldn't afford a book, digital class or tool needed to do so? I guarantee you it's a lot of people, especially in lower income parts of the world. I believe that preventing technology from being used to it's full potential is much more detrimental to the well being of humanity than most people realize. 

Don't let these companies limit what our species is capable of to protect their outdated economic system. Like I said, this is something that they can't do anything about, and we should take full advantage of that. They can't stop us from sharing. They can't stop us from using the internet for good. I really believe it would help push our world to change if enough people have their eyes opened to what is already possible. 

If you agree, and you want to learn to pirate or help others learn, there's a sub linked on my profile that you may find useful. I'm more than willing to help anyone in terms of learning about piracy or finding what you need, so please don't be shy. We also have a Discord with many people who are much smarter than me who are willing to answer any questions too. 

To be very clear, I get *nothing* by people joining our sub or discord. I don't care at all about views, making myself look good or anything weird like that. I'm not trying to promote this for any reason other than to help. I just want every person to have direct access to what the internet has to offer, so they can in turn offer the same to others. I want our species to be as smart, well connected and taken care of as possible. That honestly is my only goal. If you have any ideas on how we can help more people and spread this information outside of reddit please let me know. We can't let anti-piracy coalitions like [ACE](https://www.alliance4creativity.com/) convince people that sharing is immoral. I consider them criminals to humanity, and we need to stand our ground together. 

Pirates are preserving the digital history of humanity, and sharing that with everyone. They are the good guys. They are on the side of humanity, unlike giant companies who claim to be offering services that in reality, people can offer themselves. All they care about is money and protecting an archaic economic system. They are making the world a less intelligent and less happy place. Stop letting them screw over technology, the internet and our species as a whole. Show them that we really don't need them. 

**tldr** - Learn to pirate, teach others to pirate, help spread knowledge and happiness to as many people as possible.

The good:  Our entry-level compensation with no direct experience is $61,000. I advocate against after-hours work, against tracking exempt workers’ time, and against place-based work. I provide all staff with 100% healthcare, 401k, at least 6 weeks paid time off, and 12-week parental leaves—regardless of age or wage. This total benefits package costs 5% less than than the industry standard (as a function of salary).

The better: The vast majority of our revenue will directly serve teachers, students, and adult learners of all ages. Our overhead is projected to be less than 9%.

The unexpected: Each of my 3 peers has less than 10 years experience. Each makes a 6-figure salary. Each makes 20%-40% more than than even me. Each has increased their salaries at least 40% in the last year.

537,Working a dangerous job and bragging about it should be considered one of the dumbest things a person could ever do.,"One of the most ridiculous things in our culture is people bragging about how dangerous their jobs are to sound like some tough guy.

Here is a sample conversation.

Guy #1:

""You guys are pussys. I work in a Metal Foundry where at least 2 people die every year. We have these pools of water built in the floor for people to jump into incase someone gets set on fire or has super-heated liquid metal splashed all over their face and body. I risk life and limb on a daily basis so a multi-state steel conglomerate can increase their profit by .001%""

Guy #2:

""That's nothing. I'm in the Logging industry and due to treacherous, hastily built, mountain roads I almost die twice a day just getting to work! Then I spend all day dodging falling trees and using heavy equipment on 60 degree sloped hills. Between that and chainsaw accidents mine is the most dangerous profession in the world. I do this so Home Depot can save 3 cents per 2x4 vs. buying them from Canada""

Guy #3

""That sounds like a walk in the park compared to working on an Oil Rig like me. I've seen at least 5 guys lose hands and arms because of our almost non-existent safety standards. And if the machines don't eat you something as simple as an unexpected breeze can send me plunging into near freezing, shark infested waters. I do this so an oil company can increase their profits by .0001%""

539,My job punishes me for having a lunch.,"I work 12 hour shifts in a cleanroom at nights delivering parts. The rest of my crew works in a warehouse without the whole cleanroom suit getup. It takes me 20+ minutes to take suit on and off and walk all the way to the clock out spot, then double the amount to cafeteria, which closes at a specific time earlier in the night. I have to leave at the last hour before it closes if I don't want to starve (it serves one dollar meals which is sadly all I can afford right now). My coworkers don't understand that I have to plan my entire night around this, whereas they can get up whenever they want to get something to eat or to take a shit. There's no one to cover me while I'm gone, meaning, there are people to cover me, but they'd rather spend their time smoking cigarettes, gossiping, and handing their work down to someone with less of a backbone. Basically, I can leave for lunch and take my whole hour, but then I get into trouble for all the late orders while I'm gone. I'll get written up if I don't take my required one hour long break. Either way I get glared at and written up. I also get in trouble for going to the bathroom, even though there are nights where there's no break between orders. I'm told because of tough times and being understaffed that I just have to deal with it.i make sure to never shit or piss on a break, I will always make sure I get paid to take a shit because shit companies deserve paid shit.

I can see my family whenever I want.

I can do whatever I want.

I don’t have to worry about what I say, or gave crippling mental fatigue from trying to fit my personality into a corporate environment. Square leg round hole, I’m loud, swear a lot, and bust balls. All frowned upon in the office, informally.

I don’t have to rush to be 5 minutes late if the plows don’t come through.

I don’t have to worry about “maximizing my free time” or staying up too late to salvage the 8 hours I lost.

The cons?

Irregular sleep schedule, sometimes not as active as I should be with social interaction to keep my brain busy.

But all in all? I finally feel relaxed again.

 I can follow my passions and not check the clock to make my lunch for the next day. 

I’m not worrying about stupid mistakes I made or awkward co-worker interactions.

My qualify of life has skyrocketed.



This system is BROKEN. Life should not be this way. It’s unbelievable. My friend complains about his job all the time, but why can’t he quit?

He just bought a house, is getting married, and has a mortgage plus wayyyy more expenses than I do.

546,Proof that we are all actually pro-work,"1.  When posting images to our social media accounts, we primarily post selfies showing the burger-flipping, spreadsheet-tabulating, and phone-answering we enjoy so much.

2.  While lying on our death beds, our biggest regret consistently revolves around not spending enough time commuting to the office.

3.  The hierarchy of needs has recently been adjusted to include a bin full of useless non-recycled plastic dollar store toys, $1000 annual phone upgrades, and daily telemarketing calls.

4.  On Thanksgiving, Americans place the privilege of spending half of their waking hours working, getting ready for work, driving to and from work, and otherwise thinking/stressing about work at the top of their list of things they are thankful for.

5.  We as a society are transitioning into an era where we drink to forget family time, vacations, and relaxation, just so we can make it through to our next shift.

Do they not want to confront how their lives are being wasted? Better just to defend the system that victimises you.

I think most of us work. That's why we're antiwork. Or why would we care? So how are we ""lazy"". I see over and over that people here love creating, helping, building. But we don't want to do it in a toxic place for rich fat cats to get richer.

Charity is inherently a conservative capitalist idea, entrenched in the idea the the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie take pity on those without and donate their excess money out of goodwill. The post war Labour British Prime Minister Clement Attlee hated charity as a concept, because it would take the place of social security and instead of mandating fiscal and other support to those living in poverty etc, it was up to the 'kindness' of the privileged few to determine whether or not they should spare their loose change.

561,"No Future for the Workplace, by Bob Black","Essay by Bob Black, published in 2015 | [Source](https://archive.org/details/InsteadOfWork/page/n91/mode/2up) | [Buy the book](https://littleblackcart.com/index.php?dispatch=products.view&amp;product_id=529)

# No Future for the Workplace

The best future for the workplace, as for the battlefield, is no future at all. With belated notice taken of a crisis in the workplace, the consultants surge forth with faddish reforms whose common denominator is that they excite little interest in the workplace itself. Done to — not won by — the workers, their tinkerings are very much business as usual for business, as usual. They may raise productivity temporarily till the novelty wears  off; but fiddling with the who, what, when and where of work doesn’t touch the source of the malaise: *why* work?

Changing the place of work to the home is like moving from Albania to Somalia in search of a better life. Flextime is, as the Microsoft office joke goes, for professionals who can work any sixty hours a week they want to. It is not for the service sector where the greatest numbers toil. It will not do for fry cooks to flex their time at the lunch hour nor bus drivers at rush hour. Job “enrichment” is part pep rally, part painkiller —  uplift and aspirin. Even workers’ control, which most North American managers find unthinkable, is only self-managed servitude, like letting prisoners elect their own guards.

For Western employers, *glasnost* and *perestroika* — how soon we forgot those unforgettable words! — are too little and too late. Measures that would have been applauded by 19th and 20th century socialist and anarchist militants —  indeed, it was from them that the consultants cribbed them — at best now meet with sullen indifference, and at worst are taken as signs of weakness. Especially for North American bosses,  relatively backward in their management style as in most other ways, concessions would only arouse expectations they cannot fulfill and still remain in charge.

The democracy movements worldwide have swept aside the small fry. The only enemy is the common enemy. The workplace is the last bastion of authoritarian coercion. Disenchantment with work runs as deeply here as did disenchantment with Communism in Eastern Europe. Indeed, many were not all that enchanted  with either of them in the first place. Why did they submit? Why do we? Because, as individuals, we have no choice. 

There is far more evidence of a revolt against work than there had been of a revolt against Communism. Were it otherwise, there would be no market for tranquilizers like job redesign, job enrichment, the quality of working life, etc. The worker at work, as to a tragic extent off the j ob, is passive-aggressive. Not for him (and  especially not for her) the collective solidarity heroics of labor’s storied past. But absenteeism, job-jumping, embezzlement of goods and services, self-sedation with drink or drugs, and effort so perfunctory that it may cross the line to count as sabotage — these are the ways the little fish emulate the big fish who, flush from peddling junk bonds, looting savings and loan associations, and extending home loans indiscriminately (let  government bail them out if they can’t collect) —  they triumphantly downsize, outsource and Toyota-ize along with new requisitions and repressions which await their neologisms.

What if there were a general strike — and it proved permanent because it made no demands, it was already the satisfaction of all demands? There was a time when the unions would have thwarted anything like that, but they don’t count any more. Someday the bosses may miss them.

The future belongs to the *zerowork* movement, the revolt against work — should one well up — unless its object is impossible because work is inevitable. Do not even the consultants and the techno-futurologists take work, and so much else, for granted? Indeed they do, which is reason enough to be skeptical. They never yet foresaw a future which came to pass. They prophesied moving sidewalks and single-family air-cars, not computers or recombinant DNA. Their American Century was Japanese before it was half over.  Futurologists are always wrong because they are only extrapolators. The limit of their vision is more of the same — although history (the record of previous futures, the graveyard of previous predictions) is replete with discontinuities, with surprises like the personal computer (try to find it anticipated in any science fiction), or Eastern Europe (try to find any academic and/ or intelligence community anticipations of the imminent demise of Communism).

Attend to the Utopians instead. The difference between the Utopians and the futurologists is the difference between more of the same and something different. Since the Utopians believe life could be different — and it will — what they say just might be true. 

“Work,” referring to what workers do, should not be confused with exertion, “work” in the physicists’ sense. Play can be more strenuous than work. In a social sense, work is compulsory production, something done for some other reason than the satisfaction of doing it. That other reason might be violence (slavery), dearth  (unemployment) or an internalized compulsion (the Calvinist’s “calling,” the Buddhist’s “right livelihood”). Unlike the play impulse, none of  these motives even maximizes our productive potential; work is not very productive, although production is its only justification.

Enter the consultants with their toys.

Although it does not have to be, play can be productive, so forced labor may not be necessary. When we work we produce without pleasure so as to consume without creating — containers drained and filled, drained and filled, like the locks of a canal. Job enrichment? The phrase implies a  prior condition of job impoverishment which debunks the myth of work as a source of wealth. Work devalues life by appropriating something so priceless it cannot be bought back no matter how high the GNP is. 

*Life* enrichment, on the other hand, consists of the suppression of many jobs and the recreation, in every sense, of the others as activities intrinsically enjoyable — if not to everyone for any length of time, then for some people, at some times, in some circumstances. Work standardizes people as it does products, but since people by nature strive to produce themselves, work wastes effort lost to conflict and stress. Play is pluralistic, bringing into play the full panoply of talents and passions submerged by work and anaesthetized by leisure. The work-world frowns on job-jumping; the play-oriented or ludic life encourages hobby- hopping. As their work-conditioning wears off, more and more people will feel more and more aptitudes and appetites unfolding like the colorful wings of a brand-new butterfly, and the ludic mode of production will be the more firmly  consolidated.

You say you love your job? Fine. Keep doing it. Your sort will help to tide us over during the transition. We feel sorry for you, but we respect your choice as much as we suspect that it’s rooted in your refusal to admit that your present prodigious efforts made life (especially yours) no better, they only made life seem to go by faster. You were coping in your own way: you were hurrying to get it over with.

With the abolition of work, the economy is, in effect, abolished also. Replacing today’s Teamsters hauling freight will be Welcome Wagons visiting friends and bearing gifts. Why go to the trouble to buy and sell? Too much paperwork. Too much *work*. 

Although the consultants are inept as reformers, they might make magnificent revolutionaries. They rethink work, whereas workers want to think about anything but. But they must rethink their own jobs first. For them  to transfer their loyalties to the workers might not be too difficult — it’s expedient to join the winning side — but they will find it harder to acknowledge that, in the end, the experts on work are the workers who do it. And especially the workers who refuse to.",False,jzen4d,onedayitwillbedaisy,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jzen4d/no_future_for_the_workplace_by_bob_black/,1,1

566,I’m frequently the “bad guy” at my job and I hate it so much,"So without getting into too much detail for obvious reasons: I have been wfh due to COVID, office job, managing claims (will not specify for what) for a fortune 250 company, been doing this for around 2.5 years. 

Some of the claimants will bitch and complain about the dumbest shit. Okay, that happens, they’re probably the same people who flip out at the waiter at the restaurant for no reason. 

But then there are the people who actually have legitimate complaints about the process and like...I agree. But I can’t tell them I agree or obviously I’ll be in trouble for talking shit about my employer. And what’s holding up the claim isn’t me, personally, not doing my job. It’s because I’m waiting on another party to submit information, or waiting on someone to finish this review, or waiting on a manager to sign off, or what have you. And I try to tell people (without trying to push the responsibility on the other party, even if it’s the truth, just because that’s not a good look) this is the process,
I’m trying to work with you, sorry it’s taking so long or this is the way it’s working out, etc etc. and constantly, I’m just painted as an adversary. “You just don’t care about helping me or my family,” “You just want to deny my claim because you don’t want to do your job,” “You’re just holding things up because you’re lazy and incompetent,” “this is the worst customer service I’ve ever received and I hope you get screwed one day the way you’re screwing me.” Like bro I’m just the same as you working some job to get paid and feed myself, I have to follow these rules whether they’re dumb to you or not. 

Anyways I don’t know if it’s due to the pandemic or something but people been extra *spicy* at me lately and it’s just starting to wear me down mentally. I try to tell my manager about it and she says she understands but it’s just the nature of the job. It has great capacity to help people but sometimes it’s just such a long convoluted process that doesn’t help anyone at all and it sucks to be on the other end of it too. Getting told at least once a week that I’ve “ruined someone’s life” (even if it’s not true, and I objectively know that whatever happened isn’t really my fault) is starting to get to me, I feel like the nature of the job kind of pits me against the customers. It’s giving me so much anxiety and I hate that I have to sit here and take this for 40 hours a week.

I know this subreddit is more just to vent about your company or your coworkers rather than customers or something but I wanted to put this here since it’s still about work. I know I could just...find another job, but as we all know, each job has its own set of crap to deal with. There’s also so many other aspects of my job not customer related than I hate such as having everything we do tracked with metrics, having us do the job of 2 people for the earnings of 1, etc but what’s been weighing me down lately are the above things.

574,I used to think it was weird that I didn't know a lot about most of my friends' careers and jobs.,"Yet, the next time I would see them or interact with them... I still wouldn't ask or talk about it. I thought that it meant that I just wasn't close enough with them.

Then, after finding this sub, and others, like LateStageCapitalism, I came to realize that I didn't really care a lot about my own job, so why would I care about someone else's? What's more telling, is most people don't voluntarily share this information that often either, because why would they? Who wants to talk about the almost 1/3rd of their life that sucks the most? 

When I did talk with someone who actually liked their job, it was because they had found their passion. Of course that didn't mean their jobs weren't still severely flawed, like doctors/nurses being dangerously overworked, teachers being criminally underpaid, or scientists having to spend half their time looking for research funds.

575,Months of overtime has killed my enthusiasm for anything,"When the pandemic started my work tried to allow people to work less to limit exposure. However within a week it became clear that we were getting far more orders than usual (I work in a distribution center). So fewer than normal work hours quickly became constant overtime that has gone on for months.

Even when trying to take time off (unpaid because vacation time quickly ran out) I still worked about 40-50 hours a week. Recently that turned into 66 hour work weeks as we switched to 11 hour shifts 6 days a week, and in a couple days it will turn into 77 hours a week as we lose that last day off. Despite all the hours we're working, the total workload only grows. A week ago we had a backlog of about 700k orders, when I came in today, it was over 1 million, and we haven't even gotten black Friday sales. What amazes me is that the company fired over 70 people about a month ago, which was when our backlog began endlessly growing.

We're gonna be working 11 hour shifts 7 days a week until new years, (and probably more if this year has been an indicator) which means I'm likely to miss Christmas with my family. I get no real time for anything, I can maybe play 1 game for an hour or so after eating and bathing. I've already had a breakdown at work, and my supervisors are aware of my mental state.

I'm a heavy Introvert, and it's super difficult to spend what little time I have with friends because of that. Work has completely consumed my life and I hate it so much. This pandemic has either left people destitute and begging for anything that will pay, or it has given those that still work enormous workloads that drain your soul and kill your ability to care for anything.

My supervisor gave me a bit of a reprimanding a while ago, and one thing he said that struck out to me was ""you just don't seem to care anymore"". I'm surprised it took him so long to figure that out. How can I care about my work when I do nothing else? All I do is toss clothing onto a conveyor that will likely disappoint some bratty kid because they got socks for Christmas instead of toys. How can anyone care about work like that beyond its ability to pay the bills?

I'm looking for work elsewhere right now, but being in a small town makes finding something that pays enough near impossible. It also doesn't help that I'm an extremely inexperienced driver (just bought my first car a week ago and I'm still too scared to go on the highway). Oh what I would give for just a month or so of vacation.",False,jy7kon,Zombiecidialfreak,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jy7kon/months_of_overtime_has_killed_my_enthusiasm_for/,14,1
576,Is this all there is to life?,"I’m 18 years old and in May I got my first job which is a shitty 9-5 in a call centre dealing with Covid patients. It was okay for the first few months because if I’m being honest I was thoroughly enjoying the feeling of a weekly paycheck after years of living off my parents and asking them for money if I ever wanted or needed it. 

That quickly got old though, around 3 months in I started to become more and more depressed which was manageable until about a month ago. I now wake up every morning annoyed that I didn’t die in my sleep and angry that I have to be subjected to 8+ hours of being treated like shit by both the people I’m calling and the control freak manager I have. I spend the day calling these people and being depressed in between calls, which doesn’t last long because I’m being constantly watched and can’t even slack off for a couple of minutes without being told to get back to work and to explain why I’m not on the phone. For years I was so excited to leave school and the entire teacher-student superior-inferior relationship behind yet it’s exactly the same in the workplace if not even worse because the consequences aren’t detentions and losing lunchtimes but being fired and no longer having an income.

By the time I finish work I am exhausted and want to go to sleep but instead I spend the rest of the evening dreading the following morning. I stay up extremely late because I don’t want to sleep and be transported at hyper speed to the next morning of depression and self hatred which means I’m sleep deprived through the day. I’ve been in this job for a little over 6 months, and it’s already completely destroyed my will to live. If this is all there is to a life in the workplace I better find a way out or else I’ll probably jump off a bridge long before I reach 30.",False,jxgi3w,notsoexoticjoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jxgi3w/is_this_all_there_is_to_life/,24,1
577,I'm new to this sub.,"Hey just been checking some of the posts here only been scanning the sub for a couple days.  I've hated work since I started work and before that I hated school since my first day of kindergarten.

I'm not a lazy person, I dont mind the physical act of work, I just hate waking up to the alarm,  dragging myself out of bed and putting on my steel toed boots  just to go somewhere and be miserable in order to barely keep my head above water.

I'm 32 with a wife and two kids love them.  But the working life seems so hollow.  I'm fortunate to have a job that I work 4 10's and get 3 day weekends and it's not terrible but it still doesn't make me feel fulfilled in life.

So what are you guy's ultimate goal of what could provide for you and your dependents but all the while be fulfilling enough to not be ""work"".  I'm at a point where I want to find a alternative way of living and providing.

578,Can you imagine being triggered by people because they do nothing?,"Here's some real comments I've gotten in response to my decision to do nothing. All from your average, everyday conservatives.

* ""I hope this person fucking starves.""
* ""I hate anti work people more than *anything* else.""
* ""Why do we have to pay for these sacks of shit, losers with our taxpayer money?""
* ""If you are just against ""working"" completely you are a degenerate piece of shit""
* ""Yeah, it **pains** me that someone types this using a device they didn’t pay for, sitting in someone’s house they didn’t pay for, and not see anything wrong with it....""

***

lmao

The first one is my favorite. I also like the guy who hates us more than ***anything else.*** So murderers and rapists are apparently less evil to this guy than a human who doesn't do anything. I thought it was a troll at first, but 27 people upvoted it.

Honestly, I'm glad it ""pains them"" that I do nothing. It's hilarious to me. I have fun *everyday* while they take part in and defend Capitalism, doing things that many of them don't enjoy. It's funny that they will tell people like us to ""take control of our lives"" while giving up 5/7th's of their own. Sorry but if you are spending the majority of your life doing things you don't really want to be doing, then you yourself have no control over your life. You have control over your life for *2 days* of the week. I have control over mine every single day. 

I love that people think that the lifestyle I lead shouldn't be possible in their ""free society."" I love hearing them whine about people like me who have real freedom under their system when that *isn't* supposed happen. The fact that doing nothing is so triggering to conservatives is very convenient for our side. 

I thought I actually had to try to fight their system, you know, with effort, but according to them I can just do nothing and that counts as a revolutionary act? Can you imagine have a boot down your throat so deep that you actually think a person who does *nothing* is a issue that needs to be addressed? 

It's a great feeling knowing that by sitting here, apparently I'm doing something they wish I wasn't able to. I'm gonna do so much nothing for my entire life, you have no idea. Like it's going to be my mission to do as much nothing as possible, and to [help](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/index) as many others do the same as I can.",False,jyeqkt,nbatman,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jyeqkt/can_you_imagine_being_triggered_by_people_because/,3,1

Our job doesn’t require us to be present, it’s an office job and it can totally be done from home, in fact we’ve done it before when the first lockdown happened. 

We share toilets, kitchen area, people don’t wear masks AND we have an open space office (aka hell).

So yeah, my boss didn’t send us home to quarantine, didn’t make us get tested, didn’t switch to wfh, nope, we need to be there for him to see his little bees at work.

589,Dreading work.,"I cannot be the only one who hates working so much that I start dreading the time when work starts. It's like I'm almost in physical pain and every evening I start getting anxiety from the thought of waking up just to go to work next day and the next morning the anxiety is even bigger, I can't help, but sit at home until the very last minute and I almost always have to run to not miss the bus. When I come in and change I sit until the very first minute of the shift and not a single second earlier do I start work. When work starts my anxiety and sadness peak and it only starts fading away half into the shift with the idea that after a few hours I'm going home. Few hours after I come home, it starts to creep in bit by bit because I know I have to come back and work again tomorrow.

I don't know why, but I don't have what it takes to work 9-5 rat race, dead-end job for my whole life, I can't just suck it up. I guess I'm not normal.

I wanted to ask for advice on how to deal with it and any ideas why do I feel like that? I want to man up and stop whining, but I just can't. I really don't know how long I can go on, when everyday I feel like this. This must be partly due to me being an introvert and knowing that for 8-10hours I'm going to work with other people, be supervised, monitored, judged, screamed at. I work at a restaurant as a cook in an open kitchen, so during lunchtime and on weekends there's a huge rush, you have to do serious multitasking which I'm not good at, I panic and get stressed, because I'm also a slow-learner I guess, I often forget things, especially small, minor ones that actually are important, I often get zoned out too and I can't help it. I feel like a failure, but still can't remember those things and can't focus and work as fast as they want me to. Saddest part - I live paycheck to paycheck and money is super tight so I can't afford therapy.

Thankfully, I produce music and I'm getting really good at it, to the point where I'm starting, bit by bit, to be proud of the music I make. I also study math, gonna retake the exam and hopefully I make it into a university and study psychology, since I love reading about psychology and working as a clinical psychologist is my dream too. Hopefully in a few years I can quit the rat-race, but I'm not sure I can go on doing this for a few years. 

Sorry for a long post, just wanted to get this off my chest since none of the people I know feel like that and thus they don't get me so I need your advice.

tl;dr - terrible anxiety before going to work, peaks at work and fades a little when only a few hours are left to work. comes back again at the evening with the thought that I will have to come back and work tomorrow again. need your advice on how to deal with it and some insight on why I feel that way.",False,jx8q3v,wureva,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jx8q3v/dreading_work/,9,1

611,What Makes Antiworkers Different.,"I was recently thinking about why it is that I don't want to seek out a job like a lot of other people. Why the dreams of other people are my nightmares.

It clicked. My dad is a guy who likes to work and go to the office. He's always liked his structure being decided for him.

I think the reason a lot of us can't stand the thought of a job is because we are truly independent people. 

I started thinking about my life and I pretty much don't like any form of structure imposed on my life by someone else. This bleeds into friend groups, teams, and just about everything. I want to decide everything for myself and for some people, I can understand why that can be scary.

613,I don't even work and I'm just so tired already,"Been disabled badly for a decade. Still I'll but nothing too bad. So I started pre university course in science. I used to be passionate and motivated about it back in high school. Now though I just don't care. I don't care about anything cause I know it's all rigged. I'm so tired and I've hardly began yet. I literally just my life as neverending punishing soft slavery.

I just want to be loved and free and valued for existing rather than having to prove my worthiness. It's so cold it repulsive to me literally. I feel sick thinking about humanity.

I'm traumatized too and gave all sorts of difficulty in life and love. I can't really take it much more. I only ever had motivation to work when it was a supplement to the things that make life worthwhile, bit I don't have those and doubt I'll ever have them at all tbh. I can't really find the care to care. This PRISON of capitalism and social, moral, etc decay has sucked the life from me.

It's not even wholely society as many day. Society is a creation of humanity and is nature, so really...I don't like being human or living under their behaviours. Honestly I'd rather die. I'm not even depressed I just can't be passionate about anything. There's no joy for me here.

We will continue to get fucked so long as we let it. Tenacious revolt is what needs to happen. Not just internet talk or the odd protest here and there. Humanity is animalistic and there will always be those that try keep others down in whatever sickening vile ways. Like the billionaires hoarding everything while we suffer with disease, poverty, wage slavery, in fighting, extreme stress, mental illnesses because of it all. I'm tired of there being no avenue for pleasure of goodness. It's suffocating. 

These people are fucking destroying US. They are literally robbing us if our fun, love, passions, health, free time, wealth, security. You're a slave. I'm a slave. It doesn't have to be like this. But it won't get better until individuals stat taking serious action. individuals have to take their first step, then the rest will follow.

620,The sudden emergence of toxic Hustle Culture is due to a decrease in the standard of living in America.,"This is just my personal theory. 

I know a lot of people end up in this subreddit after going from job to job, quitting or getting fired. Maybe you tried to become an entrepreneur to get out of the rat race, but you quickly realized that the banks would rather loan you money to consume, rather than to produce anything. Which is the opposite of what banks were traditionally designed for. Sound banking practices don't really exist anymore. But I digress. 

If you look around you, everyone and their mother (literally) is trying to be some famous instagram figure, a youtube star, or ticktock famous. You have 20 year olds trying to trade stocks because they heard about some other 18 year old who made a million dollars in the stock market last year. Everyone is now a Real Estate Investor. Every guy in the hood is a soundcloud rapper up until the age of 37. He's working at a sweatshop in california making 13 an hour trying to fund his career. You've fake gurus on youtube becoming millionaires because they're selling people a get rich quick program that's going to get that out of their shitty lifestyle. They're predators in a society of helpless prey. And onlyfans..... Smh. Some of you have tried to start business after business. With every business it becomes less simple, more complicated, and more expensive, and more frustrating. 

What happened? What's so wrong with being middle class these days? Simply put, it's not worth it any more. You need to go 60k into debt just to be middle class now? You have to work OVER 40 hours a week sweating from head to ass cheek just to barely be able to pay rent??? I know a guy making 18/hr as a landscaper. He's great at what he does, has 3 kids and has been working for the same company for 12 years. What???? You have people with college degrees working 6 days a week just to bring home peanuts at the end of the week. But it's okay. People will still smile on their way to the dealership, to make payments on a car that no one is really able to afford, further enslaving themselves. 

In the old days, you were able to work at a sweatshop and be able to buy a house with zero debt. People were just fine with that. It isn't until you look around you and become self aware. You then start to see how desperate everyone has secretly become.

Now for me to afford that (no degrees or anything, I left the army with qualifications but no college/Uni recognises them. Typical) I need to work a lot of hours. I'm a security worker but thanks to the plague wages have plumetted. So at £8.72 (national minimum wage) I need to work 62 hours a week which in Security would be 6 shifts of 12 hours to make £2500 a month and after taxes, bills, food and enough money to put aside for emergencies (always done this, it just makes sense to me now) I would be left with nothing. Meaning I'd be working to live and living to work.

657,Career advice for the awkward?,"I'm in my early twenties and trying to figure out how I can work around my social limitations enough to earn money and achieve my goals. Said social limitations are that while I understand the rules of conversation and can make good first impressions, my interests, mannerisms and authentic way of behaving come off as odd to people, particularly once they've been around me for a while and start seeing through the Polite Version of me. I also have a very limited social battery and need extensive periods of time alone to recover.

I tried doing the Office Job thing. Even though my role was one that only required me to use a computer 8 hours a day and attend a weekly meeting, being surrounded by people in an open-plan office completely burned me out. I also want to avoid a 40-hour workweek as much as possible, since my life goals are to (a) write novels and poetry and (b) be involved in some kind of politics or social activism. Both require lots of time, and the second is demanding socially.

I left the Office Job in January 2020 and started trying to make money as a freelance writer. While I wasn't making a full living out of it, I was making regular amounts and gradually growing my income. Then the pandemic happened, and, well, you can guess what happened to my burgeoning freelance career.

I'm lucky enough to not need to Immediately Find A Job for survival purposes. But I do want to figure out a way to make money that is consistent, not too taxing and leaves me wiggle room for recreational spending (for me, that'd be somewhere around the €25000-€30,000 a year mark.) Does anyone in this sub have any ideas about what I could train in, or what jobs I could apply for? Here are the skills/experience I have so far:

* 1st Class Honours BA in English and History
* some retail experience
* some factory and night shift experience
* office experience
* enough French to be able to moderate written content for a website, but not great spoken French
* great research, writing and editing skills
* experience creating SEO content and marketing copy
* experience with organising events, groups of people and persuading people to vote for a candidate",False,jyv3bv,skullsandscales,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jyv3bv/career_advice_for_the_awkward/,4,1

666,No one can force you to work. Have you ever considered quitting your job to live off the land?,"For most of human history, humans didnt need money for their survival. They built their homes, collected, cultivated and caught their food. Built communities that survived together. I guess at some point money became the center of things. You need money for food, you need money for a house, you need money for clothes. But money in itself doesn't create these things. People do. 

I believe the idea that we need to rely on companies for our own survival is bs. The idea that we need to work our life away in order to pay for things companies provide is bs. 

We dont need restaurants, furniture stores, clothing stores, banks, etc. but they're nice to have. 
(I am not saying get rid of these services, but the idea we must rely on them and must work our life away in order to pay for the services they provide bothers me) 

We have a ton of things that are convenient to us. But we dont need them. Most people are capable of creating things, they just dont know how because they have never needed to. Some people only know what they learned in school and what they need to know for their job. 

I remember learning about ancient civilizations in school and being told that how these people lived is just terrible in comparison to the great society we live in now. But lately ive been feeling like the workforce is a prison and that anyone is capable of escaping it if they really want to. 

I often dream about buying out land and just living off it. I wonder if anyone else has thought of this?? Creating a community and thriving together.",False,jyoalq,Ahhahhahah,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jyoalq/no_one_can_force_you_to_work_have_you_ever/,6,1
667,"My pay ""raise"", feels like a pay cut.","I'm so frustrated. I recently was promoted, and told that I would be getting a raise. 

Before my promotion, I made two different amounts of money ""admin time""(paper work, driving, and marketing) at 12$/hr (with a guarantee of 40 hours a week). And my ""labor time"" pay( anytime I'm at a job site) at 20$/hr. 

I was recently given my offer letter, and they are giving me a salary of 24k (this will be all of my admin time), and my ""labor time"" pay is now 16$/hr. 

Before, I technically made 23k a year. So they want to give me an extra 1,000$ dollars, but then cut 4$ from my labor pay? If I work more than 50-60 hours worth of labor time in a year, Im losing out on money. If I work more than 40hrs worth of admin time, I'll lose out on money. 

Can someone please tell me I'm looking at the math wrong, and this company didn't actually lie to my face, think I'm stupid enough to notice.

I no longer write books, I can barely write poetry, and I can barely type this right now. I currently don't want to die cause I havent reached a point of no return but I am afraid if I turn thirty this will be my fate. I am a person with dreams, creative spirit, artistic pursuits, hopes, and I always feel like something beautiful is ahead of me. Or I used to feel this way.

Why is  the world like this? Why is everything so tiring, to the point where it benefits a few elite folks that have private jets, have ten mansions and own private islands and then we have 8yearols doing hil labor in mines and neuodiverse people having suicidal thoughts from all that shit and being overworked? It is not that I am lazy and do not want to work, I do want to work, I do have career ideas that sound good in theory, but I do not want to do them in real life because I don't want to do them for 8 hours, six to seven days a week, in specific times, with specific limits, and someone controlling me, telling me what to do. How does the Hamilton cast not get sick of their passion, acting, by doing this for so long? How do people who monetize their hobbies not get sick of it? I is not that I am lazy and do not want to work like the world thinks, I jsut want to have a healthy work life schedule and not get sick of the thing that gives me enjoynment. I have things to offer the world for fucks shake, I have storiess to tell, why is the world like this?

I have this one friend, who has found her career path in life, is two years younger than me.

I imagine myself as a poet, and author, like Sylvia Plath, having died a tragic death, by choice, and the world reading my writtings years after I am long gone, seeing me as an example of the unfairness of this world, of how people with hopes and things to offer, even not neccecarily the best  things, are completely crippled mentally and destroyed by this system, and ho fuckturds who found out that they can sell books on the internet become billonaire money hoarders.

If you don't, that's okay. I'm just so happy to finally stick it to a boss after months of recording. This boss was for my janitorial job for an elementary school, the one mentioned above that tried to make me drive with company equipment with no compensation whatsoever.

My boss continued to do shady things like this as well as other things like:

* Reusing vacuum bags by cutting them open and stapling them shut again
* Cutting our hours and expecting us to clean 50% more due to the pandemic
* Refusing to allow someone to call out sick unless they have a fever of 101.4
* After I was possibly exposed to Covid my GM told me to ""Come into work anyways and just wear a mask. We can't afford to be a man down while you are being tested.""
* Having a meeting of Covid regulations such as taking temperatures before you enter a building for work only to have absolutely no one to do it for the employees. Not even the school office staff or nursing office knew about this protocol when I went to get temp checked before my shift started the day after the meeting.

The list goes on unfortunately but last month was the final straw. I go into work and I find that a classroom is untouched. No dirt, no trash, no signs of anyone being in this room in the last 24 hours. The school had been open that day and the rest of the classrooms were dirty so I call my boss because of Covid protocol and because I wasn't told anything of this. I wanted to make sure I was still supposed to check the room and not get possibly infected by covid.

Before I continue our company has a policy: If there is a positive covid case or even a possibility of covid then the room needs to be left alone for 1-2 days before it is deep cleaned by several staff.

I call my boss and ask her what is going on with this abandoned room and thankfully...I record the conversation without her knowledge. She goes on saying she is ""taking this Covid stuff seriously"" blah blah blah and that there was a possible covid case with a child. The child's grandmother had contracted the disease and had previously spent the weekend with the grandmother right before she started to show symptoms. My GM then tells me to clean the room anyways because they still have school tomorrow.

I remind her of the Covid policy she stated during the pandemic team meeting we had. I simply wanted communication because if I hadn't called her to ask I would have never known about this. I even have told her on several occasions that I have multiple auto-immune diseases that puts me at extremely high risk so I could use a warning just in case I need to be extra careful for a specific room. She started getting aggressive saying, ""Well that's your job...you are at risk, that's just part of it."" and ""They don't even tell me half the time what is going on and it's illegal for me to tell you the little girl's name and personal information about her covid test.""

This turns into an argument going back and forth with each other, her spouting off company policy and when I simply voice my concern she tries to shut me down completely. I was treated like the bad guy and that I was overreacting.

I sent the voice recording to corporate HR as some people suggested in the story above and they actually got back to me and opened an investigation. It's been one month since I have heard back from them and I'm thinking about texting my old shift manager to see what is going on. I hope she has been fired or at least reprimanded and is following proper protocols from now on. They have several older staff and they work with children. I sincerely hope that no one gets sick due to her lackadaisical treatment of this pandemic. 

If people ask (and if it's not against the rules) I might just post the audio file and let you guys hear it if you want.

TL;DR - My boss was lazy about covid protocols and I record her conversation of blatant lies. Reported her to HR and haven't heard from my boss or any other ex staff workers since they opened an investigation.",False,jyl9ij,YourLocalHealer,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jyl9ij/i_think_i_got_my_boss_fired_or_at_least_on_thin/,2,1

Though I have absolutely no interest in the corporate or financial sector i of course have an interest in her endeavours. The other day she told me of a concept at her firm called ""utilisation"" which basically uses hours worked and productivity as a barometer for how well employees are being utilized.

She told me about a meeting she had last week which outlined that since the outbreak of covid, employees has worked 90% of their hours the previous quarter, yet productivity had more than doubled. Naturally the partners of the firm who take in a nice 800k a year to do little more than tell the people ""below"" them what to do were not happy with this and despite the great increase in productivity they still wanted people to work even more hours. In a time in which peoples mental and physical health are more important than ever.

It just goes to show that no matter how hard or smart your work, even if you do work hideous overtime hours, the people at the top are so consumed by greed and avarice that they will only ever want more from you to continue to line their coffers. Absolutely fuck this.

I would actually rather be homeless than play such a servile role to those who would also rather see me homeless than anywhere close to their financial equal.

In my barbershop I run based on quality. If you are up to my standard you can work as many or as little hours as you want so long as you're happy, secure and you don't struggle to pay your chair rental at the end of each week. If you're not up to my standard of barbering then I will provide guidance and get you up to the standard off of my own back so that we can both benefit from working together.

726,"""Selling"" is a man made concept and people doing it for a living aren't contributing anything useful.","Currently we build enough homes and produce enough food for everyone, but because of our current, man made economic system, simply producing enough for everyone isn't considered to be enough. We're told that even though the homes are built and the food is grown, there is more work that ""needs"" to be done. According to them, we need to ""sell"" these things, something that nature isn't actually asking us to do. 

Nature is asking us to grow things, build things, distribute things, teach others, protect others, but never ""sell things to others."" Selling is a man made concept that does not replace any function of nature needed for the survival, growth or well being of our species. Every salesman, stockbroker, banker, business owner and landlord is not contributing to to our species in any necessary way. 

Nature doesn't care how you believe things ""should be."" Once a home is built or food is grown, **that was the work.** The required work is now totally over. Beyond distributing it to those in need, no more work is required for that item once it exists in it's completed form. Countless humans spend their entire lives doing things that nature isn't even asking of us. 

No one on /r/antiwork believes that ""everyone should have to work while a few of us sit on our asses."" If you think that then you missed our point completely. We're anti **unnecessary work** leading to unnecessary forced labour. No one here, not once, has ever suggested certain things aren't required by nature in order for our species to survive and flourish, and yet somehow that always seems to be the common straw man argument used against us. This misunderstanding is so common that it's rare to be able to have a conversation about this without being hit with classic questions like: ""But who's gonna grow the food? Who will build homes? You don't think hospitals should exist? Do you want to go back to being hunter gatherers!?"" 

Like yeah guys, you got us, all 195,000+ of us are actually just *super* into foraging. 

They rarely have an actual understanding of our claims or position, and because many of them are so triggered by their own straw man arguments, they never actually stop to listen to what we're actually saying. Our position has never been, and never will be that ""No types of work are necessary."" Our point has always been that the current economic system creates ***made up jobs*** that aren't actually necessary for any natural purpose. They exist only as a means of supporting yourself in man made system for no other reason than to support yourself in the man made system. Once you eliminate all the jobs that aren't required by nature, for example, selling, then we could easily eliminate massive amounts of unnecessary labour. 

We're allowing nature to determine for us what is and is not required for the survival of our species. As far as nature is concerned, once something is built or grown, it can then be considered completed. The fact that our man made economic system then says, no, more work is required by people before we distribute these things is irrelevant to the way nature actually works.

By defending a system that is making people perform jobs that nature does not require in order to survive, you're creating a world where empty homes outnumber the homeless by [6 to 1.](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/post_733_b_692546) You're creating a world where we can fill grocery stores with food, and end up throwing much of it out, ignoring the people sitting directly outside of those stores desperately needing it. Nature is not requiring them to ""earn it,"" humanity already earned it by producing it. 

We're not anti-work in the sense that we think no work ever has to be done, we're anti-work in the sense that we realize that we're already producing more than enough for everyone, without the need for *every single person* to be ""doing something"" for no other reason other than to convince others that they deserve things that have already been produced. 

""Everyone must work or die"" **isn't** actually how nature works, it's how your man made system works. 

If you believe that a man made concept like selling things should determine if people get food, water and shelter, then you have no right to complain about having to take care of people who don't have the essentials of a human life. We could easily make sure everyone's needs are met without the majority of people ever moving a muscle, but by defending this system you're creating unnecessary poverty, so people like you will have to pay for their spot via taxation. Whining that you don't want to pay for the ""lazy"" people to get a free ride is ironic because nature isn't even asking you to. By giving the middle finger to nature and allowing man made concepts to determine who and who does not get treated equally, you signed up to live in a world surrounded by people in need for no reason other than selfishness and ignorance. 

This is why so many posts on /r/LeopardsAteMyFace are Capitalists complaining about how their own system, that they vote for and defend works. By not stopping the required work where nature allows us to stop it, you're creating all the issues in your system that you hate so much like ""leeches."" If you don't like living in a world that has so many people in need, don't support a system that creates and accepts poverty when we already produce enough to eliminate it.

We could easily live in a world where very few people have to work in order for our species to thrive, but you don't want that, you want people to work made up jobs in order to survive because you're delusional enough to think that's how it ""has to be,"" despite living in a post scarcity society. You want to create more work than what is required by nature. Once the actual work is done to produce what is needed, you think it *shouldn't* be distributed immediately like nature allows. Nature isn't asking everyone to work, only the people who defend this man made economic system are asking that of everyone. And guess what?

***We're not going to.***

Regardless of our refusal, there will still be enough food, water and shelters for everyone. That's why people who refuse to work don't feel bad at all for doing nothing. We know for a fact that society is already over producing enough for everyone without needing our help. We can see clearly that the majority of people who take part in this system aren't actually doing things required by nature, so in reality, they're contributing the exact same amount as we are, **nothing.**",False,jxvkrr,nbatman,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jxvkrr/selling_is_a_man_made_concept_and_people_doing_it/,1,1

Then I endured through four and a half years of engineering school to complete my education, during which I developed a tasty amount of anxiety and depression. Along with that, an aggressive loathing for the work culture that I would have had to be a part of if I continued that path. During the several internship fairs that I attended during those years, I witnessed nothing but a disgusting amount of ass-kissing and sacrifice for the sake of having *experience* on your resume. 

I was never able to land an internship through any of those events, but I did manage to ask for a job at a machine shop one summer. That involved an intimidating hierarchy of ass-kissing along with a toxic work culture of “40 hour work weeks is pussy shit”. I left that job as soon as summer was over. After college, I landed an internship with Pike Telecom. This also held a phenomenally toxic work culture that worshiped 90 hour work weeks and only seeing your family 4 days out of the month. After 4 months of working there I couldn’t handle it any longer and I quit, I was not going to live that life. 

I’ve completely given up engineering as I hated the schooling and I never found a related job that I enjoyed or could even see myself enjoying. By the way, I had the pay the bills, so I couldn’t sit around and wait for something interesting to show up. 

I am now learning carpentry under a small, family owned business, and my boss has been kind enough to take me under his wing to teach me construction. I’m 1099, so I basically own my business, and am technically able to work whenever I want. However, I still show up every day to learn what I can. It’s the first job I’ve had that respects the worker enough to let me have my own life outside of work.

755,Dealing with a person higher up who is just. the worst.,"Asking in this sub because I don't want to get told to ""suck it up"" or anything.

So I work with a great manager, we get along so well. We work with clients and families of clients.

I just started the job recently and have started taking on a caseload of my own. My manager and I have to work with another person--I'll call her Karen--who is above both of us.

This person is essentially creating an environment that is abusive. Karen wants to stay looped into emails to monitor things. And everything we do is wrong--reaching out to a family to send a simple email of acknowledgement with ""thanks, we'll get back to you about this soon!"" is responded to with her *calling my manager within 15 seconds* (literally) of me sending the email to say how wrong that was.

I got criticised for ""straying out of my lane"" today and was told to ask questions about the differences between certain job roles if I had any. I thought of a couple questions which my manager wasn't sure of. So I drafted a polite email asking for clarification and guidance for moving forward in the future. That was responded to with an *immediate* email from Karen to my manager to set up a meeting regarding this. I am invited to ask questions, but criticized when I do. We are to do our jobs, but can't ask for clarification when we have questions.

The worst part is that even after that, I still don't have the answer to my questions about the roles because she chose not to focus on them, but on how I ask too many questions and should just be expected to do my job.

I am so frustrated and feel like I have to walk on eggshells just to work. Is there a way to deal with this where I won't end up fired? I won't allow myself to be treated badly, but need the job, and really do enjoy my immediate manager.",False,jw6f0e,applepickingbitch,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jw6f0e/dealing_with_a_person_higher_up_who_is_just_the/,18,5

A job is supposed to be a means to an end, but capitalist indoctrination and my reflexive, constant comparison of myself to my old peers who weren't laid off from my old programming job makes me feel like I'm falling behind and stagnating, even when I'm doing my best to learn new things. I wish I loved programming for its own sake and because it makes me happy, but I'm not sure I do.  


Does anyone else feel this way? That they kind of dislike having a job but can't stop obsessing over, essentially, the idea of having one? People were so interested in my job and the projects I was working on. They would treat me with so much more interest and respect because I was employed, even though they didn't know or care about software dev. 


I'm still kind of traumatized and very angry at being laid off without any warning just months into my first dev job, at being rejected for so many jobs because someone else always swoops in with more years of experience or better connections or whatever the hell else. It pisses me off that people with 5 years of experience are applying for entry-level jobs, but even entry-level jobs ask for so much experience, I can't really blame them. 

The job market has gone completely insane and no longer makes any sense. It's all made up because employers can tell people to jump, and people will ask ""how high"". Unfortunately, I'm included in that :(

P.S. don't even get me started on how many times I have everything/mostly everything the job is asking for, but they just want more years of experience than what I currently have.

I usually just delete them and block the number or email address, it makes me feel better and like I can actually breath. Sometimes I feel bad because the people that phone or call do take time out of their day to call me or email but it’s just so incredibly nerve wracking for me that I simply cannot answer or respond. It’s so bad that I struggled to make a complaint against a driving tester that purposely failed me. 

I think it’s because I don’t like confrontation when it comes to the small things. It bothers me and It has to be a disability or something because it hinders my ability to live what society deems “socially acceptable”.

I do feel good when I look up the reviews of places that have very low reviews and I feel good when I block them though, that is some solace in the dark spots of these situations.

811,Nothing but assets,"I have finally learned what my job thinks of it's employees, we work our asses off 7 days a week (6 if we are lucky) 12-18 hours a day, out in the blazing heat,freezing cold,snow,rain. And yet when any of us reach towards the request forms to have a day off it's as if the end of days are coming, the entire management team freaks out as if we have broken a ancient relic. and make up reasons as to why it's important we all stay working. Even with covid if anyone wants to take an hour off to go get tested, that person is grilled until they no longer want to take that hour off. To make matters worse we recently had an employee test positive for covid and none of us found out UNTIL 2 WEEKS LATER when the said employee texted everyone as to why he was gone! They kept us all in the dark and put all of our loved ones and ourselves in danger for the sake of profit. I have finally decided to break free of this prison and after my grueling 15 hour shift is up, I will clock out and go home,go to sleep, wake up to my alarm only to turn it off and fall back asleep and leave them in the dark as to where I am just like they left us all in the dark. I will finally get to see my lawn in the daylight,get to see what my kids look like for more than 30 minutes before I put them to bed or when I kiss them on the forehead when they are already asleep, I will finally get to interact with my wife more than just a kiss good morning and a kiss goodnight. Other employees have talked about doing the same thing and for a company like this, shutting down 2 operations would crush them. And to make it even better it's going to be very difficult for them to find people to replace us because no sane person would agree to literally signing there life away as we had.

812,Am I being unreasonable?,"I understand that this subreddit usually is filled with people from Western nations and my grievance that I am sharing may not resonate with a lot of folks here, but here goes:

Alright, attended a job interview this morning.

I have about 10 months of total work experience, as a graphic designer.

My salary expectations are around 15-20k (preferably, 17k-20k) Indian rupees (INR) per month but, they proposed 14k for me as I am still a ""Fresher"", it seems.

I did the mistake of accidentally disclosing my salary from my previous workplace. I was drawing around 10k INR per month (did not get any increment in all those months and instead, got a bad paycut due to COVID-19) and I accidentally revealed it by mistake, as I was caught off guard and revealed it out of panic.

The recruiter reached me via phone and started asking me a lot of details through it. Normally, I discuss and negotiate with recruiters in detail, on person. He could have told me prior that our phone call will be a pseudo-interview of sorts, but no.

Also, I couldn't show off a weighty portfolio as most of the work I did was from where I was employed in a previous company and they declined my request to upload my works on my Behance portfolio, due to company policy.

And I did a decent sum of work, while I was working there. From package designing to logo designing to advertisment materials to interior branding - essentially almost every discipline within graphic designing.

Am I being unreasonable with my expectations? Am I still a fresher? I might be a Junior designer sure, but....isn't fresher a bit much?

It's not like 10 months and 1 year (12 months) have a huge difference.

It's understandable if it's a small firm. Sure it's a start-up but, it seemed pretty well-funded and owning a considerable amount of brands under its name and all.

Is my salary expectations reasonable? And am I being  low-balled by them?

I emailed HR with examples and asked them to reiterate the company requirements for wearing masks. They said they would but never did.

Last night my boss's boss had a 20 minute meeting with two employees in an office with the door open. One of the employees wasn't wearing a mask the entire meeting, despite the fact that she owns one.

I am angry that I am being required to be in an environment where safety measures are not being followed, and are not being enforced. I do not want to be in this work environment.

I am considering complaining to HR, but their lack of cooperation so far might make that a waste of time, and it might even backfire. I'm fully aware that they are there to protect the company, not me.

847,"""And nevertheless the genius of the great philosophers of capitalism remains dominated by the prejudice of the wage system, worst of slaveries.""","&gt;Our moralists are very modest people. If they invented the dogma of work, they still have doubts of its efficacy in tranquilizing the soul, rejoicing the spirit, and maintaining the proper functioning of the entrails and other organs. They wish to try its workings on the populace, in animca vili, before turning it against the capitalists, to excuse and authorize whose vices is their peculiar mission.

&gt;But, you, three-for-a-cent philosophers, why thus cudgel your brains to work out an ethics the practice of which you dare not counsel to your masters? Your dogma of work, of which you are so proud, do you wish to see it scoffed at, dishonored? Let us open the history of ancient peoples and the writings of their philosophers and law givers. “I could not affirm,” says the father of history, Herodotus, “whether the Creeks derived from the Egyptians the contempt which they have for work, because I find the same contempt established among the Thracians, the Cythians, the Persians, the Lydians; in a word, because among most barbarians, those who learn mechanical arts and even their children are regarded as the meanest of their citizens. All the Greeks have been nurtured in this principle, particularly the Lacedaemonians.” [1]

&gt;“At Athens the citizens were veritable nobles who had to concern themselves but with the defense and the administration of the community, like the savage warriors from whom they descended. Since they must thus have all their time free to watch over the interests of the republic, with their mental and bodily strength, they laid all labor upon the slaves. Likewise at Lacedaemon, even the women were not allowed to spin or weave that they might not detract from their nobility.” [2]

&gt;The Romans recognized but two noble and free professions, agriculture and arms. All the citizens by right lived at the expense of the treasury without being constrained to provide for their living by any of the sordid arts (thus, they designated the trades), which rightfully belonged to slaves. The elder Brutus to arouse the people, accused Tarquin, the tyrant, of the special outrage of having converted free citizens into artisans and masons. [3]

&gt;The ancient philosophers had their disputes upon the origin of ideas but they agreed when it came to the abhorrence of work. “Nature,” said Plato in his social utopia, his model republic, “Nature has made no shoemaker nor smith. Such occupations degrade the people who exercise them. Vile mercenaries, nameless wretches, who are by their very condition excluded from political rights. As for the merchants accustomed to lying and deceiving, they will be allowed in the city only as a necessary evil. The citizen who shall have degraded himself by the commerce of the shop shall be prosecuted for this offense. If he is convicted, he shall be condemned to a year in prison; the punishment shall be doubled for each repeated offense.” [4]

&gt;In his Economics, Xenophon writes, “The people who give themselves up to manual labor are never promoted to public offices, and with good reason. The greater part of them, condemned to be seated the whole day long, some even to endure the heat of the fire continually, cannot fail to be changed in body, and it is almost inevitable that the mind be affected.” “What honorable thing can come out of a shop?” asks Cicero. “What can commerce produce in the way of honor? Everything called shop is unworthy an honorable man. Merchants can gain no profit without lying, and what is more shameful than falsehood? Again, we must regard as something base and vile the trade of those who sell their toil and industry, for whoever gives his labor for money sells himself and puts himself in the rank of slaves.” [5]

&gt;Proletarians, brutalized by the dogma of work, listen to the voice of these philosophers, which has been concealed from you with jealous care: A citizen who gives his labor for money degrades himself to the rank of slaves, he commits a crime which deserves years of imprisonment.

&gt;Christian hypocrisy and capitalist utilitarianism had not perverted these philosophers of the ancient republics. Speaking for free men, they expressed their thought naively. Plato, Aristotle, those intellectual giants, beside whom our latter day philosophers are but pygmies, wish the citizens of their ideal republics to live in the most complete leisure, for as Xenophon observed, “Work takes all the time and with it one has no leisure for the republic and his friends.” According to Plutarch, the great claim of Lycurgus, wisest of men, to the admiration of posterity, was that he had granted leisure to the citizens of Sparta by forbidding to them any trade whatever. But our moralists of Christianity and capitalism will answer, “These thinkers and philosophers praised the institution of slavery.” Perfectly true, but could it have been otherwise, granted the economic and political conditions of their epoch? War was the normal state of ancient societies. The free man was obliged to devote his time to discussing the affairs of state and watching over its defense. The trades were then too primitive and clumsy for those practicing them to exercise their birth-right of soldier and citizen; thus the philosophers and law-givers, if they wished to have warriors and citizens in their heroic republics, were obliged to tolerate slaves. But do not the moralists and economists of capitalism praise wage labor, the modern slavery; and to what men does the capitalist slavery give leisure? To people like Rothschild, Schneider, and Madame Boucicaut, useless and harmful slaves of their vices and of their domestic servants.

&gt;“The prejudice of slavery dominated the minds of Pythagoras and Aristotle,” – this has been written disdainfully; and yet Aristotle foresaw: “that if every tool could by itself execute its proper function, as the masterpieces of Daedalus moved themselves or as the tripods of Vulcan set themselves spontaneously at their sacred work; if for example the shuttles of the weavers did their own weaving, the foreman of the workshop would have no more need of helpers, nor the master of slaves.”

&gt;Aristotle’s dream is our reality. Our machines, with breath of fire, with limbs of unwearying steel, with fruitfulness, wonderful inexhaustible, accomplish by themselves with docility their sacred labor. And nevertheless the genius of the great philosophers of capitalism remains dominated by the prejudice of the wage system, worst of slaveries. They do not yet understand that the machine is the saviour of humanity, the god who shall redeem man from the sordidae artes and from working for hire, the god who shall give him leisure and liberty.

850,Former boss's twisted view of work,"At a former employer, my boss's wife was pregnant with their 2nd child. It's uncommon, but it's possible for a father and a mother to create a child whose blood type is incompatible with the mother's blood type. I mention this because that was the situation they were in. 

That condition is manageable if they do regular transfusions for the baby (don't ask me details because I'm no doctor!). On one particular occasion they had to go in for an emergency procedure and nearly lost the baby. Then a few weeks later, the baby was born very prematurely and had to stay at the neonatal ICU for a few weeks. 

After those weeks had passed, baby was doing better than expected and got to go home sooner than they had anticipated. I'll never forget, it was a Tuesday...

My boss came to work at his normal time that day and left late morning to pick up his new baby with his wife. He drove the 25-ish miles to the hospital, drove the 35-ish miles back home then... dropped off his wife and baby, and drove BACK INTO WORK!!!

I told my gf at the time that story and she said she would've divorced me on the spot. I left that employer for that and a litany of other reasons. It was clear to me that to get ahead there you had to put the company before literally your own family and that's just not something I could offer.",False,jvmv9l,bballbabs163,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jvmv9l/former_bosss_twisted_view_of_work/,35,14

859,"""This place is over staffed""","Said to us by our new technician supervisor.  

I work at a 24 hour emergency veterinary clinic.  I used to like this job.  I work 10 hour shifts, and I don't expect to get out exactly on time, but I usually am out the door in 30ish minutes after the ""end"" of my shift, sometimes I need to stay an hour or two past to finish a procedure, clean up, help hospitalize a patient, etc.  I eat during the day (and get crap for it) but we don't get breaks.  That's just the nature.  

My limit is basically 12+ hours/ two hours past.  I'm 42, I need time when I get home to walk my dog, eat, and take some semblance of a shower.  Plus I need 7 to 8 hours of rest in order to be halfway functional for work the next day.  

I used to have jobs where I had to routinely stay 2-4+ hours after my shift.   Those places were understaffed.  

I heard her talking about her last job:  I HAD TO WORK 16 TO 18 HOUR SHIFTS AT MY LAST JOB.  OH AND I NEVER NEED TO TAKE A BREAK.  I JUST HAVE SO MUCH ENERGY. 

I'm like bitch that place was understaffed we're not at war we can staff correctly and not contribute to this place having someone quit every month so we're always catching up.  

Meanwhile she works every shift with her husband, the medical director, (they got hired at the same time) she spends half her shift in the office with her husband, the come in and leave together, and they're going to put us on a rotation through 1st, 2nd, and 3rd shifts while they stay on days and don't have to rotate.

862,"I can't get through the workday without crying, I don't know what I did wrong. I need advice","In October, I got fired from a job I loved. I was a PC repair tech at a local store. I had surgery in September, even returned sooner than expected, and walked in to find my replacement, sitting right there, next to my desk. I thought nothing of it and sat down and started fixing machines, only to be dragged away from my work by the higher ups at the company because they ""didn't want two new people (I had been there for 3 months) in the same room"".

They assigned me to salvage and get what I could out of the machines that people had brought in to be recycled. At first one of them told me to just pull anything with valuable metal out of the machines: mostly the RAM and motherboards, if it wouldn't take me too long. They said I could return to fixing machines after the recycling room had been dealt with and all the ""new hires"" could have a ""training day"" where they trained us ""on the phones"" (I had been using the phones with no issues since shortly after I started there).

Then, someone else came to me and assigned me to salvage the machines by ""determining what's worth refurbishing and what isn't"", and that ""I had to make the company 3x what they paid me"". I made 11$ an hour. I said I would try my best (I've never even used ebay in my life) and got to it. They told me to even load the machines with operating systems if I could, a 2-4 hour process for each machine. I would have to run diagnostics, replace (or decide not to replace) whatever was fucked, and then load the OS.

Oh by the way I had to set up a new desk in a back room because I wasn't supposed to be in the same room as the new hire. I refurbished and set up the desk myself with one of the salvage machines, even redid the networking. That took a whole day.

So I'm going through these machines and start sounding the alarm bells. There are maybe 10 machines in the recycling room actually worth anything, and they were worth maybe 100-200$ fully loaded with an OS and entirely undamaged. I start sounding the alarm bells. I want to make it clear to the people above me that this is a situation set up for failure.

One of the higher ups who I was under command of had a tendency to ramble in paragraphs and go off on tangents. They also were not a tech oriented person, they just happened to own the place. They blasted me for bringing this situation to their attention telling me they ""have a plan"" and that I ""don't know their business model"".

Eventually they had a moment of clarity and told me that they wanted me to just sell the machines regardless of how much they are worth, just to get rid of them. Oh and they revealed that loading up the machines with operating systems (again a 2-4 hour task per machine) was just to, *and I shit you not ""keep me stimulated"".* What they really wanted was just an excel spreadsheet with the worth of every machine on it.

What the fuck.

So I spend the next day making the excel spreadsheet and hand it in. The next day they tell me to come in at noon, I do, and they fire me.

And that was the end of that job... I was barely scraping by on 11$ an hour but I was happy, I was fulfilled, I had a purpose.

So I start looking for a new job, thinking about shooting for something in IT. I like computers. I even went out and did half of my A+.

And that brings me to my ""current"" job. I accepted a job as a help desk tech for a grocery store and.... I hate it. I fucking despise it. I can't even keep it together at my desk.

I don't understand. It should be cool. I'm in charge of everything that has a circuit at every store. *I drive the spaceship!*

I hate it. The most I can do on my end is reboot something. Anything further than that usually needs a tech from a company that we outsource to. They have to go to the store and replace the part. And I hate talking on the phones so much. This job, despite being tangentially related to my previous job that I really love, has totally beaten me down.

I don't even know why. The people are nice. They say I'm really good at it. But I feel like I'm in a cage. That cold, gray cubicle, I can't even put anything nice on it, because seating isn't assigned. And I have to spend ten hours a day (on a 4 day /3 day schedule) staring at this screen, and the furthest I can go with any issue is just rebooting something.

I thought I would be a good fit. I think it's my ADHD or something. I think, ironically enough, that I need to be stimulated. I dunno, I was just thinking, maybe what I should have taken away from my previous job is that I like the ""repair tech"" part, not that I like the ""pc"" part.

I don't know what to do. I had to take many breaks to the bathroom today to go cry. I just lost it as soon as I got to my car. My parents are being really supportive and they told me that it isn't worth it, to just quit, they'll help me.

But that doesn't solve that in IT, as you go further and further up, you do less and less hardware. I don't want that. I want the reverse. I want to eventually work up to Louis Rossmann levels of depth with the repair, at least as long as I'm doing this and not my main love which is music.

I'm definitely calling out tomorrow, and probably quitting full stop after that, but I feel like such a failure. I'm not against working an honest job, I felt like my bench tech job, at least when I was actually fixing stuff, was healthy. I was taking walks during my lunch break, meditating before my shift, it was great. Now I'm so low I would be considering hurting myself if I didn't have my girlfriend here to keep me tethered.

Where do I even go from here? I obviously can't progress any further in IT because the starting point *is* help desk. That's just what you have to do. I think I have to work with my hands and use my noggin to be satisfied. I can't just sit at a cubicle all day.

Like I said I could extrapolate on the ""repair tech"" part, but I don't know how, or what field I would even go into... I wanted to get my A&amp;P but I didn't feel ready to drop 45k on the program.

I just feel like such a bum. My job is easy, all I have to do is hit the reboot button and then call and tell them ""Welp that didn't work, time to send a tech"". But it feels like the tasks from Among Us. Just dragging and dropping and clicking and ugh.

- make jokes about people's race
- go on expletive filled rants
- openly make fun of managers to their face

877,"If you believe taking part in an economic system that had your lifestyle predetermined for you is ""freedom,"" then I WANT you to think I'm stupid.","Because I honestly think same of you.

I'm not sure most people have recognized and accepted that some of us really don't hold traditional values when it comes to things like work and money anymore, to the point that we're not ever going to take part in this system. When it comes to what a successful life looks like, more and more people will be teaching their children the exact opposite values compared to those we received growing up. It's not just something we talk about or believe without acting upon. We're actually opting out for good now, regardless of the consequences. In fact, having unnecessary consequences in a man made, post scarcity system is why we're opting out to begin with. Will this have a immediate effect on the economy or system? *Nope*, but none of us are delusional enough to think that ignorance on a scale this massive can be destroyed quickly or easily. 

Though I'm personally an [emanationist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanationism), not a atheist, I believe that the growth of atheism is a good comparison when it comes to idea's like anti-work or anarchism. 20 years ago, atheism was a pretty obscure concept for many people. Atheists existed, but many were closeted and really had no way to communicate with others who held the same beliefs. Two decades later and atheism can no longer be considered a niche topic. We have subs like /r/atheism with 2 million subscribers, and huge increases statistically in the amount of people who no longer identify with any religion. The number of atheists has [doubled](https://www.barna.com/rise-of-atheism/) since 2003. That's a significant increase, and it's only going to continue to grow. 

Clearly it can take a long time for niche ideas to gain traction, but once the seed is planted, they can absolutely have a snowball effect. I admit that as people who don't hold the belief that giving up our lives to work is necessarily ""succeeding,"" we have a long way to go. We're still in the growing process for sure. I don't think we can say we've won until every single human is able to choose for themselves how they live their lives, without being threatened by economic fascism. Until every entity brought into this world has an actual choice, rather than a predetermined lifestyle, we're going to have to fight. 

I honestly don't know if any of us will live in a free country in our lifetimes. Ignorance may reign supreme for the foreseeable future, but regardless we should absolutely do what we can to help fight for true freedom, even if it feels like kicking sand at the waves. I know it can seem like a battle that is impossible to win, but acting uncaring and purposefully ignorant towards important issues to get us to feel hopeless is part of why fascists are getting their way currently. Just use their indifference and ignorance against them, use it as fuel to fight for a free world. The fact that so many people tell you it can't happen should only make you more passionate to spread truth.

I've learned to actually enjoy being so directly opposed to the way most people think. This is because even though they will claim otherwise, we can affect them. I know because I get [made fun of](https://redd.it/iq0if8) enough by Conservative subs to see just how much they dislike hearing what people like us have to say. They know that many people in the coming generations are going to hold the *exact opposite values* as they do. Some of them are even willing to [admit it](https://i.imgur.com/WpChLdD.png), and they are not happy about it.

They know that as time goes on humans are going to become less and less persuaded by propaganda, and that eventually the scales will start to tip in our direction. Some of us are already here, just waiting. Call it larping if you want, make fun of us, because like the title states, I want anyone on the side of fascism to think negatively about me. I want people who think money has more value than human life to think there is something wrong with me, because I think there is something wrong with them. I actually don't value their currency at all. I truthfully do not do things in exchange for money, and it makes me proud when I find people who refuse to believe that. 

Someone in the thread linked above stated that people like me [""would do anything if offered 10k.""](https://i.imgur.com/oVVS8z0.png) That comment made me smile, because it proves that many people honestly don't understand yet that they live in a world where some people literally don't value their way of life to *any degree* anymore. They are so accustomed to money having power that can't accept people like us even exist.  

To anyone downplaying ideas like anti-work and anarchism, **thank you** for your ignorance. By refusing to take these ideas seriously, you're allowing them to grow faster, with much less resistance. Downplay all you want, but understand that you really do look as stupid to us as we do to you. Know that many people now hold the opposite belief about what a successful life looks like. Understand that as time goes on, we're not going to shrink in numbers, we're going to grow and grow until eventually what was once a niche concept will become impossible to ignore. If you want to ignore us for now, go for it, but we're not going to ignore you. We're completely and totally aware of just how big of a threat fascism is to freedom, and we're *definitely* going to be pointing it out to as many people as we can until the values you hold so dear are seen in the same archaic light as slavery.

I know that you're going claim to be on the side of freedom, right up until people try to live in ways that go against your values and way of life. I've said it before and I'll say it again, conservatives and Capitalists ***hate*** true freedom with a passion. They will stop as nothing to make sure *their* way of life and *their* values are protected, even if it means destroying the lives, freedoms and values of the person next to them. They want the Capitalist way to be the only way, and anyone going against this to be mocked and left to die. They absolutely do not want you to have the freedom to wake up each day and live your life the way that doesn't match their worldview. I'm not being sarcastic when I say they are actually directly and openly opposed to real freedom. 

This is why they love ""freedom"" propaganda so much. It's comforting to tell themselves they're not what we say they are. This is why they're able to call fascism ""freedom"" without hesitation. This is why they can actually think they are on the right side when they fight against anti-fascists. They are actually willing to admit that they are **pro-fascism.** It should not be understated how terrifying that is. Masses of humans who are admitting that they think fascism is a *good thing.* Propaganda should never, ever be taken lightly. It is clearly extremely dangerous, and it allows people to hide truths and convince otherwise normal and good people of horrendous things. 

It's exactly like the proud boys changing ""leaders"" from a open racist, to a [black-Hispanic American](https://www.wnd.com/2020/10/black-proud-boys-leader-not-white-supremacists-can-see/). They knew how people perceived them, so they tried to mask the truth, but anyone with half a brain knows that they just confirmed what everyone already knew. It's the same thing as claiming to ""love freedom,"" while also openly declaring that people should have to take part in Capitalism or die. By calling economic fascism ""freedom,"" they are doing the same thing the proud boys did, they are admitting the truth by trying to hide it. 

They don't have a choice, if they want to preserve their way of life then they *have to* hide what they believe, because if they don't, people will realize very quickly which side is actually fighting for freedom. If that happens, things would start to shift in a direction they desperately don't want. They will absolutely fight to conserve their system, their values, even if it means lying to themselves and others about what they actually want and believe. The good news is that with enough time and people telling the truth, lies this big *always die.* Tribalism, slavery, feudalism, all dead. Capitalism is next on the list. Both sides are becoming more hostile because both sides know that the truth is out in the open now. You either accept that you're against anti-fascism, making you a fascist, or you accept that you are surrounded by fascists. Regardless of the side you're on, that is a ugly truth. 

Though I'm not defending him or his actions, I think in many ways Trump accidentally played big role in helping people see that ugly truth. Many people didn't even care about politics before this election, but his willingness to be cruel and proud has opened the eyes of many people. He backed a openly racist group during a presidential debate. Obviously disgusting, but things like that did significantly more bad than good for his own side. He showed us all that people like him really will do anything it takes to protect their way of life, no matter the cost, regardless of truth. He *sped up* the transition to a world where people like himself no longer have power, just by being himself. His side got trapped and they were forced to admit that they are proud pro-fascists who believe nothing is more important than preserving their way of life. 

They really don't care if it means lying, defending racism or spitting in the face of freedom. They don't care if it means people will go without food and water. That it will mean letting children sleep in cars and tents with their parents rather than homes. That there will continue to be unprecedented amounts of suicide, crime and unhealthy lifestyles leading to countless early deaths. They can't care, because to them, their system, their way of life, has to come first, no matter what. 

I read an article about journalist who witnessed a homeless man in New York about to commit suicide by jumping onto subway tracks. People started yelling at him, not to save his life because it was the right thing to do, but yelling because they thought it was selfish of him to consider suicide in this way as it would make them *late to work.* The journalist was shocked by their heartlessness, but I'm not, because I know that to them, their system is more important than doing the right thing, it's more important than the truth, it's more important than a human life.

886,Why Do I Have To Stare at a Wall for 10 Minutes Instead of Doing Something Personally Productive?,"I work in a factory.  Pay's actually good in this day and age.  I don't like the job, but it is what it is.  

My job in particular, requires me to load machines for a cycle, and then sit down for 10 minutes before it finishes.  Then I unload, reload, sit down another 10 minutes while the cycle finishes.

What am I allowed to do in those 10 minutes?  Nothing.  I can only sit.  Or I guess stand if want.  In a completely safe space of the factory.  

Can I look at my phone?  No.  I've gotten a written warning for just doing a ""half pull"" out of my pocket to see the time.  Can I read a magazine?  A book?  Nope.  That is not allowed.  


WHY NOT?  

How does that make sense??

It's just a zero tolerance rule because it limits corporate liability.  

I asked my boss, and he said there were two reasons.  One, is that other people in my job might not pay attention to when the cycle is finished.  

How's that MY problem?  Reprimand THOSE people!  But he said that ""wasn't fair"" and the blanket policy was needed.  

The second reason was, some jobs in the factory don't have as much downtime as I do.  They might only have a few minutes or less on their line.  

Again, how is that my problem?  These don't sound like MY issues.  

The people with less downtime get paid the SAME as me.  Sounds like they should be getting paid MORE.  

And why are other people who apparently suck at their job, reason to fuck me over?  This is the same as public schooling.  Zero tolerance means zero responsibility.

893,I hate work and need help - how should I quit my shitty retail job of 4 weeks? Rant,"I'm vehemently anti-work and it would be nice to hear you guys' perspectives on this haha

I'm in the UK, and we're currently under lockdown. I applied for this job as a temporary measure, as I'm moving to do my masters next summer/autumn. I had a grad opportunity lined up that would have lasted this year but I decided not to move for it due to covid. I'm currently lucky enough to be living with my parents, so looking for something else will not impact me financially.

Anyways, this is not any better. This job is in a pharmacy chain, except I have nothing to do with the pharmacy/any important aspects of it. When I applied before the lockdown, I didn't sign up to be put in danger every day. My coworkers mostly pretend I don't exist, all eat together in a tiny staffroom with no masks, are told by the manager to come in when their partners who they LIVE with have been told to self-isolate, etc. I'm extremely anxious all the time about my health and my family's health for so little pay. I'm constantly asking to complete my training and the manager thinks I'm a bother and just says my 'tasks' on the shop floor come first. The job was NOT advertised as me lifting and moving heavy crates by myself all day for 8 hours. I'm also expected to be on call all the time for the till, as they refuse to have more than one till worker per shift, and as I'm new it's always left to me to be available.

I'm under my probation period so I can give a week's notice then fuck off. I'm meant to go in tomorrow but I really don't want to. The manager communicates with us over text asking for overtime, so I just want to send a quick text like 'Hey, sorry, but I won't be able to stay here. I can do my week's notice then I'll have to go.' The last thing I care about is trying to get his attention in person for a formal meeting.

894,I need to vent. Maybe writing this out will make feel better.,"My job has me feeling worthless, nothing but a number, overworked, underpaid, under appreciated, and less than a human tbh.

I’ve been the only person on staff since, July. Yup just me taking own the load of two other people. Everything rests on my shoulder. 

As for many people, this year has been hard. Who cares if we’re in a pandemic, who cares if we’re such in a divisive time in the country. Who cares if you on the brink of a mental breakdown. Who cares, if you’re in tears before your 10am daily zoom meeting. You just need to go to work, pretend to be happy, make the owner money... but wear a mask of course! 

Last night I was absolutely sick! Shivering in bed, sweating up a storm, but guess what, I can’t call out because I’m the only one on staff. Why not use a sick day? Well I only have two sick days per year. I don’t go, I can’t pay rent.

I think that was the lowest point of my life. When you realize that your are nothing. I just need to be awake by 6:15am, catch the subway, and be in the office by 7am to make other people money. 

Before the pandemic, I was working at a job that I absolutely loved. Living out my passion. 

Now I work in a “wellness facility” that offers no health care plan, and gives you two sick days per year. Pretty ironic.

897,Work doesn't value you,"I am the only female who graduated college in my entire family tree. I am also the only engineer. College was really fun for me because I loved learning about circuits and electromagnetism and all the nerdy engineering stuff you can think of (still wasn't the BEST student though). After graduation I got into my dream job, a pretty prestigious company. I had ambition so I worked as hard as I could and I wanted to climb that ladder and I honestly enjoyed it because I was with a great team. I met my boyfriend through work and when we started dating he would tell me about his frustration about working, not just his current job but working in general. His current job was also his dream job so he thought he'd be treated better than his 2 other jobs that overworked him. I didn't quite understand why he was so upset about working and honestly thought he just needed a day off to relax. Then alas, the real culture around work was starting to unravel before me. 

1. I had a coworker stalk me at work (he sat next to me) and at home (he lived next to me too). I reported it to HR. I was quite heartbroken by how I was treated by them. Long story short, they didn't see him as a threat and moved his desk ONE ROW DOWN. A couple months later a friend who works in the same company reported him to HR because he was stalking his gf. She was treated the same way. 

2. The project I loved so much shut down and I had to join another team. The team lead for that project overworked everyone and verbally harassed certain people in the team and it was uncomfortable so I reported him to HR. He's slightly better, but he still gets away with a lot. 

3. I worked my ass off the first couple years and my name had been going around as ""the person who does electrical drawings"". I became the expert in a certain subject and worked overtime every week to help out a bunch of projects including my main project. I haven't gotten a raise once or a promotion. 

There are other things but the list would be too long. I now understand my boyfriend. I now have opened my eyes to the toxicity of the culture. We are seen and treated as replaceable resources. We are told by work that we are a family, yet we can easily be disposed of. You might say I'm feeling this way because it's my first job, but changing jobs only delays the feeling.

It just adds to the already palpable misery of spending significantly more than 1/2 my time working and doing things that I don't enjoy but then to be purely reduced into a number... it's inhuman.

919,I'm surprised we haven't abolished paying people hourly and started paying people salaried instead.,"Before you downvote me I'll admit this is US-centric since I am from the USA but some things may apply to your country if you are outside of the USA and I am NOT advocating that this happens because this is a terrible idea but I feel it is the way we are heading. I'll admit this is a re-post from another sub (lostgeneration) but I'll make some minor tweaks. Here's why:

* The vast majority of health insurance in the USA is tied to employment. Since you technically aren't ever really off if you are salaried, employers could get more intrusive about your personal decisions like how you take care of yourself and what you eat, if you don't work out etc. I'm aware some companies have certain ""perks"" if you do certain things though. But I could see things getting REALLY nuts if they aren't there already. I remember when I worked at my first job out of the military, some brand new high school graduate in my training class told me I should not drink so much soda and I drank a lot in the class to keep me awake because it was boring as shit. Was it healthy? Probably not but I needed something to keep me awake. I'm not a bad-ass or tough guy by any means but I politely let her know I was thankful for her concern and if you are going to be nosy and judgy you might want to say something to the guy who just spoke to our class who is 250-300+ lbs...

* Working at home has become more common lately for obvious reasons. I wonder if anyone is getting harassed ""off the clock"" or working longer or harder? Even prior to COVID I have heard it is getting more common for employers to bug people off the clock.

* The minimum salary for exempt employees I believe went up then went back down or the proposed increased minimums never were passed into law. Regardless it's pretty damn low.

Yes, some fields like the majority of new jobs created in the past few years prior to covid have been low-wage, low-skilled service jobs like fast food and retail. It makes sense those jobs are hourly because if it's slow or something and send people home or cut hours if sales are down but I'm surprised none of the big companies have lobbied to keep minimum wage the same (correct me if I am wrong) because if you took the federal minimum wage, times it by 40 hours and 52 weeks in a year you get $15,080. That's best case scenario if you get full-time hours. Plus some of those workers are ""essential"" and I can see the companies claiming all their employees are ""heroes"" and want to ""serve"" the populace.

Walmart is the biggest employer in the USA and their minimum salary for hourly workers is $11 an hour (higher in areas where the minimum wage is higher but they don't pay that much more) and if you times that by 40 hours and 52 weeks a year you get $22,880 a year. Obviously not all employees are full time and some jobs pay more and your pay may go up based on years of service but lets say you are at $11 an hour and  lets reduce the hours to 28 in a week and you get $16,016. Yes, it is a little bit more than what the federal minimum wage is right now if they worked forty hours a week but I'm surprised corporations haven't lobbied to abolish hourly wage and make people salaried. They'd save money from not having to pay overtime and they would be able to work you to the bone if they wanted and when things got crazy since all of their employees are ""heroes"" and want to ""serve"" according to their CEO.",False,jwu8f4,davidj1987,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jwu8f4/im_surprised_we_havent_abolished_paying_people/,5,3

You can get a bad survey for a previous person setting false expectations for the customer or misinforming them. You can get a bad survey for something that is 100% not your fault like a customer dropping their phone down an oil well. 

I realized that this mirrors real life to a depressing degree.

I hate that I'm forced to do this shit almost everyday until I die.

My brother doesn't care, he's just doing it. She also said, that I need to make some proper plans for my future and my carreer. I should write down my interests and blablabla.

937,I just started my first job in a long time and something occurred to me,"I’ve been out of work more or less for 7 years. I got hit with really bad chronic health problems and it took me years to get it manageable. I tried a few jobs in that time, but didn’t last long due to mental health problems, physical health limitations or both. A few days ago I decided to try again because my boyfriend and I were in a bad financial place and I got denied disability again

Okay, backstory out of the way; I like this job. 7 years of being essentially a shut in with limited human interaction didn’t do good things to my mental health. Being around people again is scary but good for me, feeling productive again feels good and having money is great, oh and the place is really transgender friendly and so is their health insurance (from what I’ve been told, don’t have it yet)

But then I realized something; All these things are great... but it would be better if I there was a way I could get these benefits without the threat of starvation compelling me, or the fact that I’m just making the rich richer by working for them. 

It’s great that I get these good things out of a job, but it would be better if I could get these benefits without having to take part in this messed up system

Still, the job isn’t bad as far as jobs go, before I got sick I was a nursing assist (and I get paid more fixing laptops than I did taking care of vulnerable humans so that’s disgusting) I didn’t mind being a CNA, but it wasn’t for me.

950,I need an adventure.,"25M. The thing I miss most about my childhood is seemingly unlimited energy and drive. I have fond memories of going deep into the woods , bike racing , making tree-houses , building go-carts typical boy stuff in my remote African village. Now , even though I have a relatively healthy body, jumping over three puddles of water takes a lot of energy. When I turned 12 my parents decided that my good grades would even be better if they took me to boarding school so I could pass the national exams in a few years. This is the last time I did  anything remotely fun and felt alive. 

   I moved to the city two years ago for work in IT. Being an working adult plain sucks . There is no grounds for debate about that . The only good thing about being adult is money and even that is not that good in most jobs. You pay for it in your time and energy. Modern advances in technology are cool and all but there is a hard limit on staged youtube and TikTok videos you can care about in a day . Work has found a way to sip into every crack in your life via IM , text messages , voice calls, emails and sometimes you cant simply ignore them. Maybe the 80s were better in this regard. Employers want you to spend every bit of energy in dedication to the company . You on the other hand want to spend as little time and energy at work and get paid as much as possible.These two ideas are precisely 180 degrees out of phase . Unless you are personally invested in terms of money these two ideas will never be in sync.

All the public land we used to play in my hometown has been grabbed by corrupt government officials and other people who obtained their wealth in dubious ways. Every inch of it has been converted into commercial buildings and houses to let. It is infuriating in many ways and one of them is that they keep talking about how young people are not ambitious enough and are wasting their lives away by being ""afraid of hard work"" . Fuck you . How is me wasting my precious life away at windowless basement so you can take your mistress on a vacation to the Bahamas supposed to give my life meaning in any way , shape or form?

967,On reducing the workweek,"Hi,

As far as I see most people take 40h workweek for granted. That leads to wanting to make more jobs to end poverty. So, my question is why nobody talks about making the workweek shorter and then just having more shifts. For example, 8h could get reduced to 6h, so that there is one more shift. That way a plethora of new places to work would arise. 

There must be a reason why nobody talks about that. As far as I see the reason can't be that the economy would come into troubles because the same amount of goods would be produced, there just would be more people working on it (maybe it would make the work even more productive) and no bullshit jobs. However, it might be the case that salaries would change and become closer to each other, so that some people would get angry because they have less money than before. That's as far as I see the only logical reason for rejecting that idea if we neglect conspiracies. However, I would love to hear what others think, are there any other objections?

Also, I must say that I don't know much about economics, I came to the argument above just by common sense, and by comparison of that potential world and the current one. I don't see that anything could be worse in that potential world than in the current one. Basically the argument is the following:
   
     premise 1 - Compare the world with the reduced workweek with the current one. There is nothing different from the economics side. 
     premise 2 - People would love to have more free time.
     premise 3 - Jobs affect only economies and people's wellbeing.
     
     conclusion - Having the reduced workweek is better than having the current one. 

So, as far as I see people could object four things here:

   1) premise 1
 - As I have already said I am not knowleadgeable about economics, so I may be wrong. I would love to hear opinions of others. However, I think that it is just common sense, if nothing ceases to be produced, economy stays the same. 

   2) premise 2
 - I know that some people would argue that people in general are not that able to spend time on their own, i.e. freedom and free time is dangerous, kinda Brave New World thinking. 
   
   3) premise 3
 - I may be wrong here, but I don't see anything other currently.

   4) coming to conclusion
 - I think that there is nothing to disagree with here. The things are pretty obvious. If we compare two things and they are the same in every aspect except one of them where the new one is better, then it is obvious that the new one is better in general. However, one might say that the number of people who would get angry for having worse salaries is greater than the number of people who want freedom. I think that argument would lead to the discussion luxury vs neccesity, what is luxury, what is neccesity etc, and it may be personal, but in my opinion neccesities are a lot more important than luxury, i.e. luxury shouldn't even exist until everybody has a clear respectable way to get neccesities.

Tell me if I'm missing something. I would love to hear the reasons for people not mentioning that idea that much.

Corporate law firm 

Me: staff (includes paralegals, legal secretaries and file clerks)

Them: lawyers. 

Covid protocol in acted in late March. We all work from home. Then, half of us, including myself, were furloughed. It was glorious!! I lost a bunch of weight and got in amazing shape. Ate well, rested had a great sex life again! I was getting unemployment. Then we were called back. Everyone was saying how lucky we should feel. They took our insurance premiums out of our first two paychecks leaving me with like, 300 bucks. None of my work had been done for three plus months causing a shit show upon my return to the office. 
The kicker?....
We were REQUIRED to come back to the office and dress up dispute the attorneys not having to. They can work from home. The person in charge made it very clear we cannot work from home. This made it super hard for people with kids since school shit down. Parent of autistic kid stays home while parent has to come in, but person in charge has disabled kid and has a nanny and comes in as they please. 

It feels like the titanic to me. The elites can stay home and be safe but we are left exposed. We go and don’t complain because we need money to live and they k ow that. The elites have so much money I deposited over 300k for one of them they are insulated from what the rest of us go through. We are slaves. We have no choice. I seeth with quiet resentment. 

My co prisoners in the cell block won’t speak out. Not even to each other. They make passive aggressive comments here and there but they don’t want to face facts. They will go with the flow even if it kills them. They talk about a vaccine. They hang on what the government says. If you try to get them to see, you become the bad guy. They have kids to feed! They have to play ball. It doesn’t matter what the shit sandwich is, they will eat it. And I’m eating it too, with a fake smile plastered on my face, serving the bougie ass elites who think they are so much better then me.

Every single time he did this, I called him out on it, and he'd change. Until he stopped doing it without me saying anything. Then, he tried to pull this shit where he'd have me work 6 days, by schedualing me three days (including saturday) and then three days the next week (weeks start on sundays at my company).

At the beginning the management looked normal, I wasn’t impressed by some of their choices but not a reason to quit. Over the last 7 months it became a nightmare and home office did not help: zoom calls, community’s calls, hours and hours spent in front of the cam to slow down the workflow. They hired a new member in the management, this person became my nightmare: setting up unrealistic targets with ridiculous bonus system, I ended up with doing most or all of the tasks this person was supposed to do, preparing also every time presentations that he/she will need to present to the big boss and shortly having a glance at all the things I have done without any help. He/she is also impossible to please, and had hard time even for taking decisions for the smallest things that normally wouldn’t take to me much of my time to get these done efficiently. We have community meetings where the big heads blame the teams for lack of ownership (never questioning themselves), during these meetings you are forced to share with everyone where you failed even if you don’t necessarily thing you failed, they can be up to 4-7 hours zoom calls. I work in the middle management and I am realizing more and more that this means do all the job that others above you should do (but they love to call it flat hierarchy) without any gratification. They tell you to be vocal but if you open your mouth they treat you like a fool, they tell you you want to be part of the problem and not of the solution.

I’m sorry. We need better systems. For those of us who got out, big ups and cheers. For those in it still and reading this, keep your head up!

1001,Had my bonus deducted because I was ‘disrespectful’,"3 months ago my company did a Work From Home survey as they were exploring the possibility of shifting roles to a permanent WFH basis. We were asked to indicate the frequency that we wanted to work in the office. I indicated ‘3 to 4 times a quarter’ 
My manager questioned the option I selected and she was clearly unhappy. 

She wants people in the office everyday even though our company has been performing really well in the past 8 months despite everyone working from home. She says we are a FAMILY and such close knit relationships and sharing / teaming can’t happen with people being remote. I gave her my honest view that it would be wonderful if we were given more flexibility to WFH post covid as it promotes work life balance and job satisfaction. I also added that I understand in Asian cultures, WFH is usually frowned upon (we are asians in an asian country) but COVID has shown us we can wfh effectively while still producing good results. I then added that if she wants us in the office, that’s fine too as we have been doing that for years pre-covid. 

Today, during my performance review, she cited this interaction and said I was disrespectful when I talked about Asian cultures and values. I didn’t realize it was disrespectful to try to have an honest discussion about my own culture??? 

Because of this she deducted 2% from my bonus. 
She said while I am good at my work, I need to improve on my teaming and my ‘tone’ during interactions. 
She wants to add TONE and PATIENCE to my career objectives for next quarter. 
How the fuck does one measure tone and patience??

1002,Retire Early,"Wondering about everyone’s thoughts on the FIRE movement (financially independent, retire early). For quite a few years, since beginning my first real job, I have been interested in this movement. Always knew I didn’t have a “passion” for any of the careers out there, and the idea of retiring as early as possible intrigued me. I started saving as much as I could, lived with family to save on rent, bumped up my 401k investments to at least 25% of my paychecks, etc. The concept of FIRE is pretty straightforward, but focuses a lot on investing in the stock market or buying property as assets. 

But now, I kind of don’t see the point. Everything going on in the world has really opened my eyes. What with the virus, the unsure future of the stock market, the widening gap between the ultra-rich and the poor, and of course climate change, it feels like this method is just not gonna work out in the end and is really not worth it for me. Are we really going to have to work til we’re in the grave? Does anyone think a UBI is ever going to happen here in US? Feeling hopeless and would love others thoughts.

1007,I don’t do where to go from here. This was my last roll of the dice,"After years of unemployment from a ‘real job’ (I’m a freelance photographer who’s income has dried up due to the pandemic) I finally got myself back into employment at a local supermarket doing night shifts with 5 of my buddies. They’ve all worked there for much longer , I just started. All the while they talked about how easy the job was. We are the online shoppers, we go in for 4 hours a night, pick the shopping people have ordered and put them in a box on a trolley. Thats it. Pretty simple right.

Wrong.

The managers are pricks and we are all judged on IPH (items per hour), a parameter that needs to be kept on 160 or above. I’m sorry. I really am. But how does one GIVE A FUCK about this. Jesus christ its like everywhere I go to work its just numbers. Numbers numbers numbers targets targets targets. Marketing jobs in the city. Customer service jobs in remote locations. Now a SUPERMARKET?! FUCK ME HOW?!! 

The whole reason I took this job was because it sounded like it would be piss easy. And the role itself kinda is. But no, the system/dynamic/culture there is horrible. E.g. I’m being trained on how to use the little ipad scanners so I was partnered with someone who was doing their shop. Then a manager dragged me off that person because I was bringing their IPH down. So they put me with someone else. Who didn’t want their IPH to go down so they didnt bother to explain what they were doing, they instead just blitzed through it. And I’m thinking jesus christ can anyone just not give a fuck about your stupid IPH for ONE SHIFT so you can train me? 

I don’t know where the fuck to go from here honestly. On one hand I’m broke and would like some money especially over christmas and new years. On the other hand....fuck working. Fuck working for a manager who’s a prick. Fuck working at a place that has such an arbitrary target system that results in all workers stressed af. I mean come on who the fuck wants to be in a supermarket at 3am picking shelves. No one. So why make it that bit harder. My parents are like oh your first day will always be bad. Erm what? Says who?! No. Just no. And its not a case of just tolerating a bad manager. I’ve done that in the past. I don’t want to anymore. Thats not what life is about. Life is so meaningless, why make it harder! Have you ever gone in for your first day at work and realised you’re not coming back? Jesus that was me. I’m trying so hard to just give it another go and plough through it for a bit and get some money but lets just say I’m not too fussed if I don’t make it!

1011,Stupid Customers make work harder,"So this is a rant. Not sure if this is the place for this. I'll delete if it isn't. Nbd

I work as a cashier. My job (and life, as a result) sucks! Customers are often a source of grief. I didn't even sign up for this stupid job, but long story short. 

It's mentally a very hard job, especially if you are kind of shy and possess poor social skills. 

Anyway, I'm checking out this one couple today. I say hi to them but they're too busy talking to each other to pay me any mind. At the end of the transaction I give the guy his receipt and he stands there and gives me this cocky ass stare. I say ""have a good day"" to usher him along and he leaves after a few more seconds of awkward ass staring. 

He says to his wife ""if I pay that much money I expect a 'thank you.'"" So under my breath, while they're already on their way I say something about him being a dumbass mother f***er and other things in the moment because the staring had pissed me off. They stop, his wife and him start talking to each other (I couldn't hear them and I think only she heard me).

So he walks back over shouting ""what did you say?!"" At me. It caught me off guard and having literally forgotten what I said in the moment i said ""I said have a good day."" It's only after he repeats it back to me that I realize what a wuss that made me look like. I looked like a total fucking balless, spineless loser!

I was pissed off the entire day. Not necessarily at that dumb shithead that wanted a ""thank you for making our CEO richer,"" but at myself for being so worthless in these situations. I must have punched a wall every time I had a bathroom break. I even slapped the shit out of myself several times.

1029,The option for some to WFH creating a further class divide?,"Is no one else noticing this??

So now that working from home has become a more mainstream thing since the pandemic started, I can’t help but notice the divide between office-type jobs and (usually) lower level jobs widening even further. This gap always existed, but this is getting ridiculous!

The types of jobs that can’t be done from home also happen to be the lower income type jobs in many cases. Obviously there are exceptions (medical field and such), but the overwhelming majority are jobs like cleaning, cashiers, food service, etc. While I am not against wfh when it’s possible, this seems so unfair. 

I happen to work a hybrid (3 days in person at my branch and 2 days working from home), but even I am noticing some drawbacks. I am always afraid that I will get sick (and then get someone else sick) because I can’t effectively quarantine and be safe. I am forbidden from coming in if I have ANY Covid symptoms (cough, sore throat, sniffles, headache, the list goes on and on) and must use my PTO against my will.

1048,"""Money does not grow on trees.""Yeah, but food does.","In all of the infinity of time and space, by the Creation of a divine being or by a super tiny chance of outcome we have a short amount of time to live before we return into the abyss of nothingness FOREVER. And what do we do? We work all the time and recover for a few hours and then go back to work again. Everyone is obsessed with money. People get so happy when they get to spend 10 days at the beach, but that beach is there 24/7 and it's free. Food and water and the beach and theatre and volleyball and music and everything we really need are LITERALLY FREE. There was a study on some isolated hunter-gatherer tribe that lives in some barren steppe land in the middle of nowhere and it concluded that they do ""life-sustaining activities"" (i.e. gather food, make clothing and etc) for 2 hours per day. The other time is spent on dances, games, joking around, and chilling under the open sky.

&amp;#x200B;

Literally, all we need is food and water and air to live and it's free. 

&amp;#x200B;

Again, another study suggested that Australia alone has enough land to feed all of humanity on a vegetarian diet, granted, but still, I would rather become a vegetarian than work all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

And you know what hurts the most? That even if your dreams come true and you figure out how to make money by working only a couple of hours a day, then again you will have no one to spend your time with because... everyone's at work. 

&amp;#x200B;

It just fucking sucks and I refuse to believe that I am a pessimistic, nihilistic, absurdist little entitled spoiled brat. I love life and I just can't believe that all I have to do is work, then IF I'M LUCKY find someone who is equally depressed and tortured by life to spend my time with for 4 hours per day, even though work is so exhausting that I don't even have the energy for that, and then die.

1049,"What is the point of anti work? (serious post, I am genuinely curious)","So i guess I should preface this in a way, my partner and I are very lucky, not that we were born into wealth (we weren't) but that we are lucky enough to live in a country will good social security and socialised healthcare, both just happened to specialise into very in demand and high paying fields that don't require full time work or any expensive university/college education that allows us to spend a majority of our time at home with our family, When i work I work long hours (60-72 a week) for 2-3 months at a time a typically spend the rest of the year not working, while my partner only works 6-20 hours a week running her own business, and that allows us to live a very comfortable upper middle class lifestyle.  


So that's out of the way, we're very lucky not having to work minimum wage 40 or more hours a week each just to get by.  


But I'm wondering what's the idea with anti work? Is it to live off the land and your own labour? that would require a lot more work then most off of spend at any job, or is it to live off of social security? is it to go towards a socialised society where everyone is provided for equally regardless of job or social status, is it anti capitalism where you don't want to work for pennies making the boss rich?  


A completely work free society can't be the goal, even if your not working for the man and doing it yourself, you'd still need to get food and shelter and everything else and that requires work, its just not paid.

1053,[Taxes] The Argument to Tax Work-From-Home Benefits - Ksenia Galouchko,"Choosing to earn a living from home once the pandemic ends is a privilege that you should pay for, according to strategists from Deutsche Bank AG’s research arm.

“Working from home will be part of the ‘new normal’ well after the pandemic has passed,” the strategists led by Luke Templeman wrote in a note. “We argue that remote workers should pay a tax for the privilege.”

The team propose a 5% levy for those who work from home on a regular basis and not because of a government lockdown mandate. Such a measure could raise $48 billion a year in the U.S. and about 16 billion euros ($18.8 billion) in Germany, they say, to fund subsidies for low-income earners and essential workers who are unable to work remotely.

Deutsche Bank Research undertook a survey to examine the major global shift toward remote work that occurred as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, which may endure as many professionals discover financial, personal and professional benefits of the change. According to the results, more than half of those working remotely want to continue doing so for between two and three days a week even after the health crisis ends. The survey of 800 people was conducted in September.

Working in the comfort of one’s own home saves money on travel, lunch and socializing, according to Deutsche Bank Research, and offers greater job security and flexibility, the strategists said. Yet people who are working remotely are also contributing less to the infrastructure of the economy, potentially extending the slump in national growth, they said.

“That is a big problem for the economy as it has taken decades and centuries to build up the wider business and economic infrastructure that supports face-to-face working,” Templeman said.

The proposed levy would be paid by the employer if they don’t provide their employee with a desk, whereas if the worker decides to stay home based on their own needs, they would be taxed for each day they work remotely, according to Deutsche Bank Research. In the U.S., the strategists calculate, such a tax could pay for a $1,500 grant to the 29 million workers making under $30,000 a year and unable to work from home.

“It does make sense to support the mass of people who have been suddenly displaced by forces outside their control,” Templeman said. “Those who are lucky enough to be in a position to ‘disconnect’ themselves from the face-to-face economy owe it to them.”

1054,I feel broken,"Hey everyone,

I normally wouldn't post something about this but one of the rules said I could post to vent about my current job and fuck I really need to.

I currently work in a call center making $9 an hour. The sole benefit is that I get to work from home, but dear God every time I clock in, I just want to cry. All I do is call people to answer their questions about childcare services. You'd think that wouldn't be too bad, but everytime I quote a price and hear someone go silent before saying they can't afford it, I get irrationally angry at my job and the system in general. Like, it's obvious both, if there are 2, parents are working otherwise they probably wouldn't be asking for childcare, but there should be affordable quality options available for them. However, they're aren't and, out of curiosity, I did some research and the clients my job represents aren't higher priced than most others. It just constantly reminds me how screwed up our society is that not only can parents not afford to spend time with their kids when they're so young(I talk to parents who have to put their 1 month old in daycare because they have to go back to work), but they can't even afford a daycare a lot of the time.

That's not the sole reason I feel empty though. It just all feels so meaningless. Like, I've been here for almost a year and my life doesn't feel improved at all. I'm barely covering my bills and debt. I am paying out of pocket for an online software engineering program and I enjoy that work, but honestly? I don't even care that much about making more money. I'd like to spend my time doing stuff that interests me and fucking living my life. 

I'm currently stuck in my hometown and its a rather small town in the rural south. I want to move. I've always wanted to live in a city, but I can't afford to move. I keep telling myself once I finish this program, I'll be able to find a job and move somewhere else, but it is so draining to know that I can't live my life the way I want without selling huge chunks of it away to someone who already has more money than I'll likely make in my whole life. 

I'm not opposed to labor in general. I mean some things need to be done, but does it have to be so damn soul sucking? I'm 31 now and I swear I'm terrified that I'll wake up 5 years from, now 10 years from now and realize I wasted my time here slaving away to make some assholes richer. 

Sorry I know this probably a better fit for a blog and if it doesn't fit, please feel free to delete it. But if anyone has any advice for coping with this general sense of emptiness, please share because I feel so done with everything.

Our shift system is 9-5pm, 5pm-1am and 1am-9am, which is absolutely ridiculous especially since my country has a curfew in effect for everyone and that starts at 10pm. 

My job is also at least 30% bullshit. I'm supposed to call persons coming in, on later shifts, at least one hour before they are scheduled to come in to remind them, answer the phone, log people in and out, complete a bunch of bullshit logs (telephone, visitors, receptionist shift log, delivery). 

I can get scheduled for a double shift and then get scheduled to come in 8 hours later.  I don't understand why because I'm not a fucking doctor. I've been at it for about two weeks and I am exhausted even though the work is me just sitting there for 8 hours watching TV or sleeping. 

1) The night shift would be so unecessary if they implemented a logging in system that involved swiping your ID card or a thumb print. 

2) No one calls in the night so why do I need to answer the phone. 

3) 50% of the documentation I need to complete is absolutely unecessary. 

4) Even though I provide ""wake up calls"" people are still late. Why do I have to remind people to come to work? Are they not also adults? No one is reminding me. 

I'm literally only doing this job for the money but everytime I think of going to work I want to cry and I'm not sure it's worth it.

Edit: Also my company employs a driver for persons doing these late shifts but you can't use him/ he doesn't want to come for you at 1am. ""The driver is not a benefit"" my boss said. I share a car and sometimes I can't use it because the other person needs to. I don't understand why the driver can opt not to do his job but I can't. I would also like to be asleep at 1 am.

The boss is a cheating psycopath who takes advantage of young women, asking for sexual favours in turn of positions in movies or whatever they do. The focus was more on the assistant girl and how she felt about seeing the man trick young women and nobody give a shit about it. He didn't sexually harass her but he bullied her, called her incompetent, said she was worthless, stuff like that and in the end she had to apologize to him by email and say how much she was thankful he gave her that opportunity. She had to do tasks that were obviously below her position, like cleaning the garbage of the boss office after a meeting, talking to his angry rude wife and cleaning what appeared to be sperm from the couch of the boss office (to avoid vomiting, I just told myself it was some food he dropped there). 


Her coworkers didn't seem to care much, for them it appeared it was just another normal day, not a big deal. She went to HR complain about how the boss was having sexual encounters in the office and preying on women and the guy from HR discouraged her from filling a complaint, ridiculed her, accused her of making a fuss because she was jealous the boss didn't give her attention, made an innappropriate condescending remark about her apperance and then called her coworkers and the boss saying she went there (the HR). 

Also she arrived very early in the morning (way before 8h) and only left way into the night when the boss said he didn't need her anymore. She had to work weekends, ate lunch (a sandwich) at her desk and dinner was frozen microwave food. Everyone in the office was just burried in their computers and phones and all the interactions just seemed cold and artifitial. It almost seemed like a personality cult where everyone was corcerned about what the big boss was doing, at what time he would arrive, where he was, who he was meeting. He btw arrived after 10 (the assistant arrived way before 8am), left when he wanted, including, he left to go abbuse a young girl and missed an important work meeting leaving the potential partners furious (so not only a disgusting cheater, but also incompetent and disrespectful). One of guys from the company was the one who was called to put out the fire everytime things were burning and he was treated as just another employee, didn't get the recognition he deserved. 

So it's fair to say, I just watched an horror movie because honestly all that corporate atmosphere just made me sick the entire time. 

I just wonder, is it possible to be jobs in the world that are so bad as what was pictured in the movie? Is the corporate atmosphere in the US like that?",False,jvigy4,Shadowgirl7,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jvigy4/just_watched_the_movie_the_assistant_and_felt_sick/,14,12

1083,I give up. Work is hell. Get me out of this.,"I can't stand making $12 an hour anymore. To cope with the loneliness and depression I started talking to a camgirl a couple months ago. Idk how it happened but I was very curious as to how much she made per year. She made me pay her $250 to know, and she told me she made about $325k last year. Wtf. I was expecting like $60k or $80k, maybe even a little more. But Wtf!

And idk what to think anymore. I worked so hard in my life and the best I can do is $12 an hour. Some people have it so easy (I'm not even talking about her, more of like people with tens of millions of $, but also sort of people like her too).

They got so lucky and make so much. And I just maxed out my fucking credit card just to know how much some rich person made. I'm going to fucking have to skip meals every other day until the end of the month now. 

My ex told me I was a failure and that my life would be tedious and boring. I told her all my plans for success and she still left me. She makes more than me too, she finished her degree and got a good job. But not me. I wanted to prove to her I could succeed on my own, but a year later she dumped me. And I turned to porn and camgirls to make me feel better.

I thought I was helping them escape poverty. But i put myself in so much debt to them, just to find out they are so far beyond what I could ever make. I get it, people pay for it. I do too and can't complain. But something inside of me just can't cope with it. I spent so much $ just wanting to be loved. And now I am broke, even lonlier, and someone 10 years younger than me tricked me out of any hope of a life that I had. This debt will take me YEARS to pay off. By then I will be too old.

And on Monday I go back to my job. 55, 60 hours per week working me to the bone. $42k per year.. I do get a little bonus and a tiny amount of overtime. But why does it matter. My boss tells me I do good, my family is sort of proud of me. But I have nothing to my name. I will go home and cry probably every day this week. And I'll probably spend another $200 on some online woman who will tell me everything I want to hear. But who doesn't give a damn about me and makes fucking ,$300k a year.

1084,Control Your Own Capital. A Small Solution.,"I wanted to repost/rework as a thread in its own right, my reply to another thread that was deleted by the original author.

There's so much despondency in here.  It can be disheartening to read of so many struggling and faltering.

In parallel to the *anti-work/anti-drudgery* ethic as expressed in this sub's statement of purpose, I'm of the mind that we need to redefine the nature of money and value.  This is already happening in the form of Cryptocurrencies and Decentralized Finance.

&amp;#x200B;

Capitalism as we presently understand it isn't eternal. Like everything else in the world it's in the process of forever becoming. In time, there will be something else. Better or worse, who can say at this juncture.

But it helps to be a student of history. Nothing human is perpetual.

For the time being though, you need to build your own capital.

Learn to understand basic economics and markets ([Investopedia | Education](https://www.investopedia.com/economics-4689800)).  I know it can be a dry-seeming subject but it's *absolutely essential*.

Then save. Save what you can and invest. Forego those little luxuries and save. A dollar here a dollar there. It accumulates.

The bar for entry into the cryptocurrency markets, compared to the classical markets, is extremely low.

For as little as 50$ USD (assuming you're an American) worth of Bitcoin , you can open a free account on any of the major exchanges and begin to lend your seed capital out to others, earning compound interest in the process.

I'd suggest margin lending on Bitfinex, or perhaps a NEXO.io savings account, which is really the easiest of all available options that I've used over the years.

Both methods will allow you to accrue compound interest passively on your principal.

Compound interest is a powerful entity.

There's risk of course. Never forget that.

I would highly discourage actively trading. Buy and hold instead. The key is DCA ([Dollar Cost Averaging](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp)) .

There's admittedly a great, great deal to learn.

But we're on the cusp of a new epoch in finance here.

Where we as individuals, control the flow of our own capital, without the traditional monoliths and gatekeepers.

Here's a primer for the complete newcomer to Bitcoin.

It's an excellent place to start:

[https://startwithbitcoin.org/](https://startwithbitcoin.org/)

&amp;#x200B;

Also, we need to continue fighting for UBI.  

There has been no better time than now for this idea to finally come to fruition. To that extent, the covid pandemic does have a silver lining.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jklk5k/antiwork\_pro\_ubi/](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jklk5k/antiwork_pro_ubi/)

All of this is interconnected.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, get outside.

Go into the forest, climb a mountain. 

Grow a garden or participate in a community garden.

1089,I went across the counter on a woman and tried to slap her at my first job ...,"I worked in a little family owned restaurant at the time, first job I'd ever really had - except for being a cashier for 2 days at a dead end grocery job.

Had a lady come in one night and order a couple of burgers and some fries to go, then sat down on the bench to wait for them.

As soon as she sat down, a busload of baseball players (kids) and their parents arrived and we were SLAMMED! The lady's order came up while I was in the middle of taking a bunch of orders and I called out the order but she didn't respond so I set it over on our little to go table because honestly I'd forgotten the order after being bombarded by about 30 kids and their parents all at once. Most of them were only ordering ice cream but some got food.

When everybody had cleared away from the counter and the chaos had settled down a bit, the lady walked up to the counter and was like, ""Where the hell is my food?"" and I asked her what she had ordered, she said, ""The burgers and fries!"" in a very ""duh!"" tone. I said, ""Oh yeah! They're over here, let me get them for you. I called out the order but you didn't answer so I set them over here."" 

Meanwhile, her order had only been on the table for about 5-6 minutes.

She took the bag from me and sneered at me before leaving. Three minutes later, she's peeling back into the parking lot, barely gets her car parked, leaves it running and comes storming back inside to yell at me that her food is cold.

I assured her that the food couldn't be cold because it was in a styrofoam box and honestly hadn't been on the table longer than 5 minutes. She INSISTED that I touch it and see how ice cold it was. I touched the burger and it was warm. I told her again that it was warm, but if she wanted, we could replace it.

She was like, ""Don't bother, you were too r*tarded to get the first order right, I don't have time for you to fuck up the second one."" 

My supervisor came from the kitchen in time to grab me by the back of the shirt and pull me away just before my hand could make contact with the lady's face. She held me back as she looked at the woman and said, ""She's not r*tarded, she's crazy and I will let her go. Now, do you want another burger or not?""

The lady, dumbfounded, grabbed her food, made a pissed off noise at us and left. Didn't ever see her in the restaurant again.",False,ju8fkm,BiskitMum,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ju8fkm/i_went_across_the_counter_on_a_woman_and_tried_to/,5,1
1090,Honest question with a story,"I dont understand ""anti work"" or the concept of working until 70ish. Here's why. 

So i grew up poor and graduated highschool with a 1.8gpa because from 7-16 i was extremely epileptic. In 7th and 8th grade i was having upto 18 grand mals a day aka i was dying and suffered pretty bad brain damage. Durring that time my brother beat the absolute shit out of me daily. It wasnt brotherly fighting it was horrible abuse. For my 16th birthday i got a lawn mower without an engine. My dad helped my put an engine in it. I was told i can mow lawns and buy my own car...so i did. All throughout highschool i mowed lawns until it was dark. Being a highschool kid i of course spent all of the money on unless crap lol. 

After highschool i started welding dump trucks for $15 an hour. I got sick of that and looked into how rich people became rich. I stumbled across day trading and the stock market. So i studied that while working. I thought it was a ""get rich quit"" thing so i quit my job and traded expecting to become wealthy real fast then quickly learned that wasn't the case. So I went back to work and welding school and practiced tig welding until i mastered it. I landed an aerospace welding job. My schedule was 9am - 11:30am day trade. Noon - 1pm gym. 2pm - 1am welding job. I worked my ass off. I became lead welder, my supervisor and superintendent loved my work ethic and how i pumped out so many parts without failing X-ray or the other weld inspections. So i got a pay raise, more vacation, and i could mess around without getting points or getting yelled at. as long as i got more than enough parts done for the day. 

My old friends from highschool always complained about being tired or how much work they had to do, or how hard life was, yet on snapchat they would be at parties, be high or drunk, they eat like crap and stayed up all night. My co workers would complain about not getting paid enough and working too much but they had new cars, big houses, spent way to much on fast food, energy drinks, alcohol etc. 90% of them didn't have a plan or a goal for retirement. They worked enough to not get fired but thats it. Nothing more, nothing less. I asked my friends and co workers why not spend less money or work more efficiently? Why not keep goals or do something different in life? Why not budget? What about downgrading houses and cars to save money? Spend less on food? Why not come up with a plan to eventually start a business or invest?  But everytime id open my mouth id get looked at like i was crazy. It bothered me and i started thinking hhmmm maybe i am crazy and trying to become wealthy is a rigged game.

I didnt let it get to me so i worked even harder on trading and at welding. I finally started to make money trading consistently and my welding got even better. Then out of no where i was having complex partial seizures. A week went by and i was getting 5-15 a day so went to the Dr. and once again i was diagnosed with epilepsy. My new medicine made my welding and trading stuffer but i worked around that adapting to my new brain. My seizures were basically bad staring spells/run away thoughts and still were happening even with medicine. But a month went by and i was back to where i was with trading and welding. After working my ass off with trading i was confident enough to quit my welding career and take the step into full time day trading. 

Now I trade full time from 9am-11:30am. I have the freedom to do what i want when i want. But I continue to work on myself and my skills in life everyday.

I understand people have to make house payments or car payments or have kids they need to take in account. But i firmly believe anyones ""excuse"" is just that..an excuse. I know a guy who has 4 kids, was 24k in debt and now he's  ""made it"" and he came from ""nothing"". He took a vow to never work for a boss ever again and he sacrificed so much and now he's on top of the world and still grinding...even my sister saw what i did. She broke up with her BF and immediately started working on a fishing boat and became waitress at the SAME time for a long time. Now shes doing her own thing and is so close to being where im at in life.


Questions! Why do so many people hate work? Why not make the sacrifice and escape the rat race? Theres so many options in life so why not explore them? 

Even if you went fully off grid back in nature you still have to put in a huge amount of work for food, shelter, water and more.

Basically why does it seem this ""anti work"" thing is so popular with my generation?? (Im a millennial or Gen Z not sure lol)

1091,I have had more than 100 jobs so far. I'm 26.,"I would go to a temp. Agency, find some warehouse shift and they would make me start from next day. 


Usually I would last a week. My record is 3 months. Sometimes I left after an hour. Sometimes one hour was enough to break me.

In one warehouse I started a total of 7 times before they realized that I'm ""that"" guy. 

Usually I would leave because of a verbal fight I had with a supervisor. I would see an injustice, like a beautiful girl not working and me having to pick her slack and I would ask for justice just to be told ""you're just an employee shut up"" basically. Many similar cases.

Sometimes I would just be so exhausted from all the heavy lifting that I would leave. I would rather be homeless, that's how much I hated it. My step counter had 20 miles per day walked IN the warehouse. With those heavy safety boots.

I was able to make more than a hundred jobs because agencies don't even remember you and their database deletes old entries after three months.


I'm jobless again, living with my parents again, I have no money and I only eat from the fridge, use the internet and actually it's so much better. I'll have to eventually hold a job because I feel sorry for my parents. I guess I'll have to start drinking antidepressants. Or kill myself. Or go back to monke.

1118,To all Karens (Male &amp; Female): This is an Intervention.,"This  is a plea from a grocery store employee. I don't make minimum wage but I  just barely make a livable wage. I have mediocre healthcare that costs  me 1/10th of my wages. My husband and I are both Army Veterans. He was  medically retired 10 years ago. He has COPD and 2 years ago he had a  lung spontaneously collapse. Making him a severe risk when it comes to  Covid-19.

Now I know a lot of you want to believe that this pandemic doesn't exist. IT DOES. We are now leading the [world](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)  with 180,000 new cases a day. There have been more than 245,000 deaths  to date. Even if hospitals are over-reporting double, that's still 5  times the [deaths](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html) due to Influenza Season 2018-2019. Can we please drop this narrative that its anything like the seasonal flu?

There is now data that a person can be [reinfected](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/reinfection.html). That means [Herd](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761320301709)  Immunity will not work like you hope it will. If you get sick with  Covid-19, even if you experience mild symptoms, you could have to deal  with [long-term](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-long-term-effects/art-20490351) complications. Our children, who usually suffer mild symptoms, could have to deal with [Cardiovascular](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/can-coronavirus-cause-heart-damage), Respiratory and [Neurological](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-we-know-so-far-about-how-covid-affects-the-nervous-system/) problems for the rest of their lives.

I understand that you believe that masks are a political statement. [They're not](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-mask/art-20485449).  As the virus surges through our White House, ask if it matters for whom they voted.  All of the medical professionals in the world are screaming  at us to wear a mask. This virus doesn't care if  you voted for Trump,  Biden or Kanye. Your unclad face only tells me that you are selfish.

You  are correct when you say that wearing a mask isn't going to protect  you. You see that masked employee that you are verbally abusing? That  mask that they are wearing is the one that is protecting you. While your  verbal diarrhea could literally be spraying a deadly virus all over  that Essential Person. That person who makes your sandwich, stocks your  food and toilet paper. They run around the store 40 times a day  disinfecting every surface you touch. We wear that mask 8 hours a day, 5  days a week to protect YOU from the deadly virus that is raging out of  control in our country.

We don't  have the option to work from home. Our work is ESSENTIAL. Our population  must eat. You do not need to 'Just Browse'. If you can't wear your mask  due to medical reasons you are likely very susceptible to the Severe  Acute Respiratory Syndrome that is making it's rounds. You should be  staying at home as much as possible. You are at higher risk of the most  serious symptoms and the death. I'm trying to protect you as much as  possible. We provide [3rd Party](https://peoplesparty.org/) home [delivery](https://www.instacart.com/) and curb-side pick-up. Go Home.

I  have worked every day since this all began. We hunted down 15 vendors  to find you toilet paper, hand sanitizer and cleaning products. We are  working so hard to make sure that our community has the food that we all  require. Our crew has no part-time help. No one wants to work part-time  during a pandemic. Our corporate is making money hand over fist. We're  getting a $250 bonus. We are over-worked with no end in sight. The CDC  is [estimating](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/forecasting-us.html)  another 20-40,000 deaths by December 5th. Then here you are, with NO  MASK upon your face, with the audacity to get mad at me when I ask you  to leave.

You have shown time and  again how little you care for me and my family. I have every right to  get an attitude with you. You are endangering my life and the life of  everyone I love. The most important people in my life, my husband and  child, are put at a health risk every single time you walk into my store  with no mask covering your face. Every naked nose could send me home  with a virus that could literally kill my severely compromised husband.  Each time you invade my space with your face open to the air you are  risking my child's healthy future. Don't glare at me like I have  offended you by backing away from you. You don't have to be [sick](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/20-percent-of-people-with-covid-19-are-asymptomatic-but-can-spread-the-disease#Only-20%-remained-asymptomatic) to pass this horrible virus to your friendly grocery store worker.

Since  March I have been wearing a mask. 8 hours a day. 5 days a week. 8  months. 1,280 hours I have worn a mask to protect you from the deadly  virus that has killed more than 1,000,000 people [worldwide](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=covid+death+worldwide).  It's my right to refuse to serve, assist or allow you within 6ft of me.  It's my right to protect my loved ones from your selfishness. It is not  your right to be a public health hazard.

We  could have a vaccine in April. As early as April. Could be Summertime.  This pandemic is getting worse, NOT better. 6 months at best. Another  6-8 months. That's the entire length of the pandemic so far going into  the worst Respiratory season. Cold and Flu season is upon us once again.  That dreaded season of cough, sniffles and Covid. Just like Covid;  Rhinovirus and Influenza can also be contained by being polite and  wearing a mask. It's up to you not to spread your disease to those  around you.

Oh, how I despise your  stay-at-home order and working from home existentialism. As you stomp  around like a raging toddler with diaper in hand. Screaming at the wage  slave in front of you without a thought in your head for anyone but  yourself. Yet I still go to work and make sure that your favorite brand  is well stocked. My family has to eat after all. The VA sucks for any  real healthcare, so I'd rather not lose my benefits. Especially with a  deadly virus ripping through our populace and tearing through our  medical personnel.

When I see you  walk into my store with your face uncovered, it fills me with rage. I'm only asking that you wear a mask while you shop at your favorite store  for your favorite brand. I am a person. I have the right to live and to  make sure that my family lives. You have the right to not wear a  covering on your face. Just like businesses have the right to deny you  entrance. No Shirt, No Shoes, No Pants, No Mask. Of those, the mask  seems the smallest. Just take a breath, put on the mask and breathe.  You'll be OK and the sooner you figure that out, the safer we'll all be.

1119,Boss is conspiring against me to fire me. Should I quit or wait to be fired?,"I have been at my current company for three years. I have never had any warning about my performance and even received a raise last year. We recently got a new boss and a week into me meeting him he puts me on a PIP. I was taken back and very upset because I knew I was wrongly placed on the PIP. A month go by and I have my yearly review. The review will be completed by another director that filled the position for 8 months until a replacement can be found. That director rated me on target which goes directly against the PIP I was put on a month before. 

Fast forward to this Friday where I have my coming to Jesus moment. It was supposed to be the end of my PIP and everything goes back to normal or I lose my job. The meeting was going ok. They told me I was meeting expectations and performing all of the new tasks they gave me to do. Crazy thing instead of taking me off the PIP, they extend it by 30 more days. I was a bit confused but I didn’t fight back because I am simply exhausted about the entire process.

My boss shares his screen to show me the new PIP that he wants me to sign. I simply say ok and I figured we would move on. My boss forgets he is sharing his screen and I see an email between him and his boss about how they need to keep me talking so they can record me and deem me as disruptive. My boss’s boss screamed “Bob you are still sharing your screen!” I read it all. I read how they are basically conspiring to have a reason to fire me. I am just beyond defeated. After 30 days we will address my performance again. Should I just quit after the 30 days are up or see if they will extend it again or fire me? If I get fired, I get unemployment. If I quit, I walk away with nothing. I did some research and every article is saying it is better to quit. I have to consider my payout if I get fired. I want that money. Should I just let them fire me or quit? I figured it’s going to happen anyway after I saw that email. My boss and his boss are conspiring to wrongfully fire me.

Your workplace has a boss, the owner, who watches over you on camera systems. The owner of the building watches over the the whole operations. The owner demands a massive chunk of your life's precious time to put you in a forced labor position. The owner expects you to work as much as possible or as they desire. The owner decides the outfits. The owner decides your right to food, shelter, and resources by paying you a wage which never covers enough thus giving you eternal incentive to return to your slave work eventually....probably on a holiday even. Your OWNER, take the profits, and lives life to it's maximum.

&amp;#x200B;

The owner has managers oversee everyone and judge you personally for how well you fit the job everyday. Managers are oddly are a threat at all times because if you don't impress them....you're fired. Managers are paid middle class wages to keep them in the harsh role of being a mini dictator themselves because they get the better reward. They get the bigger house. They have the nicer car. They get to eat fast food everyday and not feel a dent in their wallet.

&amp;#x200B;

And finally it is you, the worker. The farm animal they work the hardest. You are expected to create the most value for the owner and the owner alone receives most of your profits. You also, keep living as cheap as possible. You avoid spending too much. You claw your way up savings only to have some inevitable disaster to occur to wipe it out. All while debt is eating away at your dollar worth....all while inflation combats you over time. Along with housing costs that are JUST enough to get by as long as you partner up with some random person and agree to pay rent.

taxes if they decide to stay away from the office even

The idea was floated this week by a research team at
Deutsche Bank (of). It proposed a tax on remote
workers once the coronavirus is brought under control
to support the economic recovery and subsidized the
wages of people in low-paid jobs who can't choose

their place of work.

""The sudden shift to [work from home] means that, for
the first time in history, a big chink of people have
disconnected themselves from the face-to-face world
yet are still leading a full economic life,"" rheumatic
research analyst Duke Templeman said in a new

less to the infrastructure of the economy whilst still

I read  “Civilized to death” by Dr Chris Ryan and “ Tribe” by Sebastian Junger. Both which emphasized on how humans lived the majority Of our existence as hunter and gathers . They were  “fierce egalitarian” a famous anthropologist coined. Everything was shared evenly no one had more resources than another. No one ruled over another. No one had more of a right to exist than another. 

Something I read about In “Tribe” was the “ self-determination theory”. 2 Psychologist came up with that involve our intrinsic needs. Extrinsic being food, water , shelter etc. it is made up of 3 parts  

Autonomy- the need to control the course of ones life.

Competence- the need to be effective in one’s environment

We let children live in cars or tents rather than homes because their parents don't have enough of a arbitrary, made up number. 

I am not going through phase of angst. I'm 27. I'm going to be doing nothing but screaming at the top of my lungs for the rest of my life for us to change this system to a fair and free one. I'm not going to be raising a family, living in a home of my own, being in relationships, having friends, owning things I want or need. I have negated myself of preferences and I'm willing to give up everything most people take for granted. Every waking moment will be spent doing [what I can](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/index) to stop this, or in the very least, refusing to take part in it. 

As long as we're leaving people behind, **I'm with them.** Does it suck? Oh you bet your sweet ass it does, I don't enjoy my life, but I enjoy it more than I would if I was doing the wrong thing and contributing to a system that is indefinitely and indiscriminately destroying the lives of so many humans. 

It's sad to me that there are so few people like me. Even people who argue against this system usually take part in it, and that depresses me. I'm not self centered enough to do that. I'm smart enough to realize that the humans of the future are no different than me. **They are me**, and when they look back on this system they will know that there were people who suffered immensely to fight this, in the same way we can look back on other economic systems that died and know that many people had to suffer and give up their lives to change them.

I'm going to beat everyone I can over the head with the [reality that Capitalism needs to go](https://old.reddit.com/r/NonMarketSocialism/wiki/quotes-articles) until we either succeed or I die stressing it.

If you have the ability to opt out of Capitalism without being starved to death, DO IT. Right now. Self sacrifice. Lead by example. Don't for a second take part in this disgusting system that uses a made up number to determine if people are treated fairly or not. Show the world that for many of us it really is over, maybe not for the majority of people, but for some of us the transition to a fair and functioning world has *already started*. 

Their disgusting, anti-human way of life isn't going to last forever. It's going to die for the same reason tribalism, slavery and feudalism did. They were failures, they lost, we won. We *killed* them by doing the right thing instead of doing things in the old way. We can do it again, we just have to fight harder than we are now, a lot harder. Don't be patient, patience is the only thing keeping this system alive. Complacency is sustaining this system and letting humans die. 

**Draw the line.** 

Don't sign future kids up for this. Fight *as hard* as you can for a better world. Do EVERYTHING in your power to stop this. Don't take no for an answer.

My mom got $800 in SSI and $200 in food stamps. She got arrested at home because of probation violations At the end of October. So this month is fine. It’s December I’m worried about. I applied for unemployment, it’s been 6 months and my case is still pending, I’m not disabled so I can’t apply for Social security, I’ve had 3 jobs and quit them all with no notice. I have this unrealistic expectation of work like it’s not supposed to be hard or something. if I indulged in my hobbies I’d just waste time practically doing nothing because at this point if It’s not making money it’s not worth the time. I didn’t even graduate because a few years ago I stopped going to take care of my dad while my mom was in and out chasing drugs. I’ve tried selling stuff around the house but nothing really came from that, all the good shit we actually use. I’ve be home alone for a few weeks now and it feels good but the overwhelming thoughts that remind me that I’m not living comfortably rule my mind 95% of the day. When things get back on track I plan to get my GED at the very least. I just hate that these traditional jobs are really the only option it seems.

1153,"UK Anti-Workers, here's how to turn 24 days of paid holiday into 53 by using bank holidays to your advantage (2021 Guide).","Disclaimer: this is largely only applicable if you work in an environment where you work Mon-Fri and bank holidays are given as time off

For those of you who don't live in the UK, we have a group of national holidays called ""bank holidays"" - which are usually given as paid time off (if you are an office worker). They fall on the following dates in 2021:



//

Friday 1 January - New Year's Day

Friday 2 April - Good Friday

Monday 5 April - Easter Monday

Monday 3 May - Early May bank holiday

Monday 31 May - Spring bank holiday

Monday 30 August - Summer bank holiday

Monday 27 December - Christmas Day

Tuesday 28 December - Boxing Day

//


By timing your choice of holidays around these dates. it is possible to double your yearly time off.

------
 
**Example**

If you take 29 March to 1 April off and 6 to 9th of April off, you will be off work from the 29th of March, to the 12th of April (16 days). You will only however have only used 6 days of leave. Lets break it down:

&gt; 29 MAR - 1 APR  -- 3 days off using Paid Time Off

&gt; 2 APR -- Bank Holiday

&gt; 3 APR - 4 APR -- Weekend

&gt; 5 APR -- Bank Holiday

&gt; 6 - 9APR -- Paid time off 

&gt; 10 - 11 APR -- Weekend

Total: 16 days off work with only 6 days of PTO used

-----

-----
**Example 2**

The May Bank holiday can be exploited a similar way. By taking 4 days of PTO from the 4 - 7 MAY you end up being off work for 9 consecutive days:

&gt; 1 - 2 MAY -- Weekend

&gt; 3 MAY -- Bank Holiday

&gt; 4 - 7 MAY -- Paid Time Off

&gt; 8 - 9 MAY -- Weekend

Total: 9 days off work, with 4 days PTO used

-----

You can apply similar strategy throughout the year to turn 24 days of PTO into 53 days away from the desk. For a full breakdown of how to do so have a look at this article [here](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/uk/lifestyle/travel/a32433563/bank-holidays-2021-double-annual-leave/) (I am not affiliated, I just thought it was useful)",False,jsup5c,SnoopLog,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jsup5c/uk_antiworkers_heres_how_to_turn_24_days_of_paid/,3,1

1161,Micromanagement and meetings nightmare JOB,"So I am working a second gig because I can't pay my bills with the one I already have. It's on the editorial end of a magazine, too focused on making money selling advertisement even though this has been a dead end model of business for more than a decade.  


The first month everything was cool, my boss was nice and my coworkers were pretty chill. Them the nightmare began:   


I realized the company hired me for half of what the person on my  position earned. I thought this was the standard salary until I accidentally got a memo from the higher ups with a salary tab, hearing that they would resume paying back in full after a 50% cut due to Covid-19. I found out this way that now everybody (even people in a position in the same level of hierarchy as me) will be paid a lot more than me.  


Not only that, but in order for people to earn their full wage back, the company started to measure the amount of work everybody does. That includes me. So now we have to fill an excel tab daily with all the things we did on the day. At the end of the week our bosses tie this in with our goals and based on the overall percentage they get paid accordingly (meaning if they reached 80% of the weekly goal overall then they get 80% of that 50% cut). But for me since I didn't have a cut, that percentaGe means how much of my wage am I going to get paid (90% for 90% of the goals, and so on). We also have daily Zoom meetings to tell our superiors what do we have planned for the day and to tell them exactly what are we going to spend our time on.  


Apart from that, we get calls out of nowhere for constant virtual meetings. Just as I was typing this I recieved a call for a Zoom meeting, no warning whatsoever. And they micromanage this: they count assistance to meetings on an excel tab and missing even one means getting short of your goals. We get approximately 3 or 4 Zoom calls per day, which pummels our productivity to the ground. I got one of my superiors mad by telling him during one of said meetings that I wasn't able to get shit done with so many calls, and that most of what we discussed could be summed up on an email. He told me he needed to confirm we were working (even though we are forced to go to the office in spite of the covid rising) and these meetings were a great way for him to know whether we were in front of our computer or slacking off.  


To make matters worse, every Tuesday at 9 am we have a meeting with the sales department to present the rankings of our site and social media. This is a nightmare, because they are always complaining that my team doesn't do enough to rev up the traffic our site gets. Even though they are right, there's another problem there: we don't have reporters, community managers, photographers or an editor. I do all of that, with a quota of 3 articles per day, 3 Facebook Posts, 3 Instagram stories and photos and 6 tweets, with two exclusive interviews every week. Oh and I also have to send 2 newsletters and edit and shoot videos for the magazine.  


I'm still on 3 months ""trial"" but I'll be going out my merry way after that period ends. I dunno If I should tell them their company sucks ass and they do everything there is to do wrong.

1165,"Last week, I applied for a senior position in a Fortune 100 company. This week, they say I'm not skilled enough, even though I surpass the criteria on their advert.","I'm not going to say what company or job it is, as they might see this post (I doubt it, but saving for anonymity). 

Last week, I had a Zoom interview with a Fortune 100 company for Senior Position in the field I specialize in. Their criteria was, as follows:

1. Five years industry experience
2. Postgraduate experience
3. Good, technical knowledge
4. Able to use industry software packages
5. Commercial awareness
6. Experience in training others
7. Experience in modelling data
8. Understanding in Python
9. Ability to communicate with others

So, let's go through them:

1. I have seven years of industry experience
2. I have a PhD, 2 Masters Degrees and 2 Bachelor's Degrees
3. Points 1 and 2 cover my technical knowledge
4. I have trained people to use the software packages they want me to use
5. I have tendered many projects in my time
6. I have trained many people, including undergraduates, postgraduates, and colleagues
7. I have extensive experience in modelling data
8. I have a proficiency in Python (and used it to model and analyze data)
9. I have given presentations, all over the world, at conferences, and liaised with clients

Because of my experience, and exceeding the expectations of the job criteria, I stated that a starting salary of €68,000 (approx. $80,100) would be suitable. Even those salary websites, friends and old colleagues state that this is a good average salary. However, the interview instantly took a turn and you could feel the tension. 

Yesterday, they got back to me and stated that they would like me, but that my experience isn't enough to warrant this Senior role, as they were actually looking for someone with eight-10 years industry experience, and that I am not ""skilled"" enough to be a Senior in their company - as their criteria is different to other companies. Therefore, they could only offer me €38,000 (approx. $44,800), with no negotiations. But, offered me ""bonus"" incentives, such as bonuses for hitting and exceeding targets, work-from-home allowance to cover utilities, and a couple of other things, which ""could double"" my salary per year. Yeah, right. 

I asked why they wouldn't consider me for the role which was specified, but all I received was the same platitudes - even though the job description stated five years industry experience.

So, because they wasted my time, I am going to waste their time. They have asked me to come into their office (bearing in mind, this is in a different country - they are paying for my travel expenses, at least), which is a two-hour flight from my home city. They want me to come in for a ""skills test"" (during the pandemic, I might add). I told them I'd be more than happy to turn up.

Am I going to turn up? Am I fuck.

I just received confirmation that they have booked my flight and a hotel for the night. I'm not going to go. I am going to blame it on the pandemic. Yes, you may think I am a bad person for doing this, but at least I won't be burning any bridges with them. They can waste someone else's time.

I fucking hate working in offices and I detest being around people that are all about the company. I also hate people who don't pull their weight and demand more and more of you - which was the reason why I left my previous company. This lazy ass fuck that would always be on the phone to his wife, getting paid twice as much as me, for sitting on his ass all day? He's probably living the dream, as he does fuck all, but not that the expense of me. Asshole. I also hate the whole culture of office work. I am direct and do not shy away from confrontation. I am also not underselling myself. I haven't been in academia for 12 years and industry for seven to be given a sub-par salary. Find some other sucker.

1169,Get out of the city and leave your corporate job.,"Ok, some of you may have noticed me trolling here lately. My apologies. It’s just that the overall sentiment has rubbed me wrong. I work hard and I don’t know any other way to get through life but that doesn’t mean I don’t enjoy it. Work can be meaningful and it certainly is necessary. Cooking is work. Laundry is work. Chopping wood is work. I hate capitalism just like the rest of you but here we are. I truly do sympathize with everyone who hates their job. I have worked in food service, landscaping, construction, janitorial service, etc. These are some of society’s lowest positions and I have the utmost respect for anyone who works the 40 hour week. I’ve been treated like absolute shit in my life and I don’t wish that for anyone. So here’s my advice: get out of the cities if you can. The system doesn’t care about you and it won’t anytime soon. There is strength in community. Plant your roots somewhere, anywhere, and get to know your neighbors. You can help each other. You’d be surprised how much work can come your way and how many skills you really have. Believe in yourself. If you are young and aren’t tied down with a family, look for seasonal work. Plenty of organic farms out there need help. WOOFing or cool works. Plant trees in Canada or trim weed in California.

Capitalism as it is now shouldn't exist - defined as inidividuals owning brands and factories and undemocratically ordering around employees. **Wherever companies need to exist, they have to be run democratically**. Not necessarily directly, but with enough possible individual input as, say, citizens of switzerland have (being egocentric here) where you're free to challenge individual government (board/CEO) decisions and where a board can be elected by the employees. Secondly, entrepreneurship in and of itself isn't something worthwhile. We need to **minimize the work to be done by humans** and automation and transfer of newly available lifetime has to be one of our primary goals. For this reason, we cannot tolerate a vampiric financial ruling class; however, I can concede that a moderate financial inequality can be motivational for people that produce actual innovation and actual surplus value (think new cancer drug instead of new iphone, more cars repaired instead of more money made for shareholders) - I suggest something like a **1:10 limit**, where 1 is a national UBI and 10 is the limit anybody can make, including ""worth"" and inheritance etc. The whole **stock system, shareholding, investing needs to be illegal**. No more of this category of bullshit jobs. Prohibition of vampirism. Instead, for the remaining companies, if you want to support the development of a product, donate to them, or just help someone start something, you just - imagine this guys - give money without return; let's see how many of these people actually ""totally like starting companies you guys"".

Something like a separation of production, income distribution and market (advertising in the classical sense should be outlawed) would be handy. Business must cater to what people want without psychological intereference. It also must not benefit more from more business - the **profit motive must be eliminated**, it is responsible for so much misery and limitations in this world, from copyright mafias to unaffordable insulin to climate change and kids working in sweatshops. Separate instances should deal with the profit, the market desires and the actual production.

Of course, these things alone still don't solve some critical questions: How do we effectively automate away labour and construct a society where a lot of people just don't need to work? How much should a UBI be in relation to an income ceiling? How much is actual ""bullshit"" jobs and how many do produce some type of worth for society? Could we deal with ego problems and the fact that some people that had a passive, fabulous income are now ""normal"" everyday working folk? How do we reconcile the fact that a big class of society just wouldn't have to work anymore?

Because for the countless flaws our systems have right now, they do provide an awful lot of luxuries and conveniences (thinking easy fast food, decongesting nosespray, pink fur toilet seats, whatever), albeit at the cost of heart attacks, suicides in teenagers, rapid climate change, environmental holocaust, child labour and at most 20 average years of retirement between slave labour and death.

Another important thing is actual political engagement. How do we get our desires and ideas heard and spread across the western world? What can we do to stop dreaming and take physical action? Internet discussions on their own our useless - the communist subreddits can chat until they're blue in the face unless every single one of them put together flyers, start parties and get going from door to door.

1179,Boss bitch tried to commit wage theft because SHE had a bad day,"Writing this on mobile so apologies in advance. So I’ve been working at this particular work place for almost a year now. At my previous job I was a manager for a few years so I know about payroll, handling employee conflicts and what not. At this CURRENT job I’m just a minimum wage worker. Fast forward to current events my boss recently tried cutting my hours. Why? Because she claimed I was leaving early according to the cameras then proceeded to correct my time card without my knowledge or consent. No one told me anything just slashes on my time card (we don’t have a computerized punch in punch out system.) When I saw my time card I freaked out she took off nearly 3-4 hours. BITCH IM POOR AS FUCK EVERY HOUR I SLAVE AWAY AT THIS DUMP I NEED. So to prove my own Innocence I go ahead and check the cameras on my own go back to each and everyday I came into work took pictures of everything. Turns out the cameras aren’t synchronized and giving the wrong time stamps. I wrote the new times down and noted that the cameras time stamps were wrong and casually left my note on her desk to find it the next morning. I came j to work the next day pissed and I just went up to her and said we need to talk. I guess I scared her because she immediately apologized for her wrong doing and blamed on her having a bad day and she wasn’t thinking straight. My time card was corrected and I got paid correctly. And here’s where you think the story’s over right? NOPE THERES MORE. Since I’ve been working here I’ve had a set schedule with a once in a blue moon day switch but I have always been given a heads up. So I make my appointments and errands on days I don’t work. Well this week Ive been given the blessing of being over worked to death? Yeah no days off this week. Which usually I don’t mind because money but I hate this place and my wife works too so we can’t have conflicting schedules as we share a car. So I texted my boss asking what’s up and her response was: “Well your other coworker has kids and needs that day off and you didn’t book it off so YOU try switching your schedule around.” I’m done with this place I feel like I’m being bullied and targeted with no reason what so ever. I’ve never been late to work, when I mess something up I always own up to my mistakes and be the best employee I can. Fuck. This. Place. Y’all don’t even deserve a 2 week notice. Have fun replacing me and it won’t be pleasant because you’re going to miss your golf time. Bless my wife for being there for me or I wouldn’t have made it though mentally.

1184,Potential Alternative to Capitalism and Work? Let me know what you guys think?,"So I was thinking for a future sustainable model in which no one has to work under someone is making some form of a resource based economy. 

Basically the idea is to split (Countries/Cities/States etc) into smaller decent sized communities. These communities are sustainable by providing free food/water/shelter/transport/energy/and a set amount of currency with no strings attached. Basically using things and concepts that already exist so people don't have to work. Major concerns from everyone is who would do the labor?? My solution is to just give the jobs to people who want to work for **more** currency, people with currency could buy non essentials which is very appealing.  

In turn this would hopefully increase innovation and coming together for a common good in order to fully automate things like food production, transport and anything else.

Ideally any businesses would be owned by workers not a sole owner or cooperation in order to keep work and production ethical. 

Also in terms of how these communities are governed there would be no political figures. Instead  I was thinking of something along the lines of a **libertarian anarchy**, ""which mostly focuses upon *the individual*, making sure that each person has the maximum amount of freedom."" Personally I believe by having a community **solely** vote it would exclude the minority creating conflict. Also I believe that less laws are the way to go as long as what you are doing isn't interfering with anyone else. The concept of libertarian anarchism would have to be tweaked but its just a general concept. As an alternate option communities could chose a system until one worked, however in some cases this could lead to ruin.",False,jsrezq,j2ck10465,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jsrezq/potential_alternative_to_capitalism_and_work_let/,0,1

Everyone seems to accept their life will be nothing more than perpetual doldrums of working long hours with little societal advancement. Most people who are born poor, die poor. 

No one seems care that there are literally tens of thousands of people homeless, millions more living paycheck to paycheck, and deciding between rent and food. 

Yet there are thousands living in exuberant wealth. More money they could spend in 100 lifetimes. How does this make sense? There are people born into wealth who will be rich their entire life, by vaginal chance alone. During the 80's they could of put this money in a bank account and just lived off the interest. 

Then I look at sports, which I loathe, and see people getting paid millions of dollars for driving a car in a big circle, or throwing a ball into a whoop. Big fucking deal. Yet people fork over their hard earned money just to *be there.* 

Also celebrities..some people act well, which I can appreciate. Then you look at all the goofy bullshit like Kim Kardashian and other completely fucking useless people..a waste of carbon atoms, who get paid millions just to do normal day to day stuff. People eat this shit up. They waste hours of their life staring at a colorful box on the wall watching other people just..do stuff. They watch other people play video games and these people make tons of money too, or tons of money just opening up new shit. People watch these unboxing videos for hours on end, as if the essence of the Chinese slave worker air inside the sealed box is the queef of a beautiful lady, and the opener has a fetish for it. At least fucking PLAY video games. What is so ""cool"" about watching other people play games? What's next? 

VR taking a shit? VR getting gas?

I just...can not...wrap my head around all the bullshit there is. How much WASTE their is. Every fucking time I buy a donut at the gas station I'm handed a receipt. Multiply that by thousands of stores every single second and that is a giant waste of paper. It only scratches the surface of all the useless wastes of resources in our country. Am I supposed to shit in my hand and return it to the store and proclaim I am dissatisfied with my purchase? I get some people need receipts for business expenses, but that should be ASKED, not ASSUMED. 

There is just soooo much BULLSHIT. 80 percent or more of people either don't care, or they too are just completely fucking inept.

1220,The trick they play on us all,"It was all the  t i m e  under our very noses.

The central capitalist slogan is "" Time is money "".

The more I observed, the more I realised. They don't need your work. 

Think 'bout it. They already have shit-ton of money. 

But YOU NEED them. You want them, you want their lifestyle.

Many people say they hate capitalism, they don't. They actually hate the fact that they are not on the top of capitalism.

They don't need your work, that is the trick. They need to keep you busy with bs jobs.

So the real question is "" Are you ready to burn the capitalistic hierarchy INSIDE of you?"".

Revolution will not do, because another system exactly like that will pop out (or slightly changed).

Because our minds create our reality, and I am not trying to be philosophical here, just realistic.

And also, not trying to give ""advice"" to no one, 'cause at the end of the day, hey, it's everybody's choice how they lead their lives.

I don't hate rich people, because rich people help each other more than poor people do.

1221,I finally reached my breaking point.,"After months of struggling with depression/anxiety I finally had a nervous breakdown on Tuesday. I got up in the morning, got ready for work, and right when I went to grab my keys to leave I started sobbing uncontrollably. I tried my hardest to pull myself together so I could just get the day over with, but I couldn’t stop. I ended up calling off and ultimately I immediately filed a leave of absence request in hopes to receive short term disability for a couple of weeks. 

I moved to a new city a year and a half ago, and on top of the isolation from moving away from the only home I ever knew, the pandemic isolation hit me even harder. So I have virtually no support system here besides my fiancé. I’m away from my mom and sister who I used to see every other day, and now I only see them a couple times a year. I have never felt so shitty in my entire life. I look back on the person I was four months ago and I was stressed then but I was managing. Stress at work on top of everything else was just too much to handle.  

I spoke to my supervisor and basically blubbered on the phone like an idiot and let her know everything that was going on. Oddly enough, she was supportive in a way that I didn’t expect and said she would hold my job for a few weeks and that we could talk about stress management at work when I came back. I have a physicians note to be off work until the 30th of November but I’m already dreading going back because I’m just so embarrassed. People are going to ask me what happened and if I’m okay. Has anyone else gone through this? I *need* this time off so that I can focus on myself, get my meds situated, and feel better. I’m just feeling really down on myself and feeling so ashamed that I can’t even handle life.

1224,Why I'm sad this morning: Story time.,"Earlier this year I ended a job due to a combo of being burned out; hating retail customer service, and pandemic anxiety/ mental self-care during covid.

Back in August I started planning on returning to post-secondary (for the first time in over 10 years). 

My thought process was that I don't have the pieces of paper that I need in order to get jobs that I don't hate. 

(To be entirely clear the fact I need a job angers me to my bones but there isn't much I can do about it and keep a roof over my head).

So I found some ideas of schooling I wouldn't mind/ jobs I wouldn't necessarily mind having if I had said schooling, and could potentially lead to me working for myself or doing a thing I liked. 

But in order to do that I needed government assistance money. Because I live in Canada that's possible. Today I got the numbers back as to how many dollars I can expect from the government...... *And even with that, I can't afford to live and go to school*. 

I came up with a mock-up budget of a scaled down version of what I currently have. And even with that scaled down version I still couldn't afford my life costs and tuition. In order to do that I would have to get some kind of part-time, likely retail job, to afford the schooling.

I haven't done post-secondary in over 10 years. I want to focus exclusively on schooling so I can do as well as possible, and learn as much as possible. 

I've already put in 4 months of my own time (SO MANY FUCKING EMAILS sorting shit with incompetent people/ unclear policies/ etc) and over $300 worth of my own &amp; friends' money (for deposits and transcripts and etc). 

Still after all that-- I'm still almost $200 short on the first term, $4000 short for the second term, and likely $3000 short for the third term at the end of next year. 

Quite literally, I do not know what to do. 

If I was capable of wanting to deal with humans I might have considered a construction apprenticeship but I don't have any money up front for a union fee. I don't have any prior construction skills that I would be able to offer someone willing to train me more. I don't know how to find those people even when it isn't a pandemic. Also I don't want to deal with humans. Except I know I have to...so I figured a post-secondary space would be the most structured and require the least amount of organizing on my part. *Scoffs* well that was incredibly inaccurate.

Credit and other loans are not possible for me (something I've investigated in the past). So that's also a nope. 

So now I have a decision to make. 

- Do I try to find a way to get a part-time job so I can afford schooling? (But in the process risk mental health as well as grades and learning capacity?)
- Do I give up on the schooling process, forget the 300$ and the 4 months of life I can't get back, and cancel everything after I find a full-time job and go back to working (aka hating 5 of 7 days of the week, and anxious the other 2)?
- Do I try to find a government assistance program so I can continue being off on mental health leave because this world is a crapshoot?
- Do I start praying to the aliens to obliterate the universe? (Jokes. I started that like a year ago).

I mean if I had the emotional energy to deal with more bullshit like this I would have kept my full-time job working customer service. But I didn't because I couldn't. 

And the idea of needing to go back to hating my life just to afford to stay alive, when I didn't ask to be alive to begin with, is infuriating beyond words. And terrifying. Especially because I'm trying so hard and keep slamming into bureaucratic red tape walls.

1233,vent about a terrible job interview,"Yesterday I had terrible interview via Zoom.

After booking the interview I looked up the Glassdoor reviews and YIKES.  ""Abusive"", ""malignant"", ""staff driven to stress-induced breakdowns"", ""like death row inmates"".

So I figured I'd chalk it up to interview practice.

But it was bad.  Really bad.

Because of connectivity issues, they suggested I switch off my video option.  So I could see them but they could not see me.

After some introductory waffle and chat, the serious questions began.  I could clearly see that the main interviewer was not impressed with my answers.  She was rolling her eyes and such.

I thought her questions were very vague and broad so I tried to get some clarification and that did NOT go over well.  And then it just went to shit.  Interviewer had about a million ""what a fucking moron"" faces going a mile a minute.  And she KNEW I could see that.

She became increasingly angry and frustrated.  I just ... shut down.  I shut down like a little kid getting berated by a parent.  I thought about just pulling the plug on the interview but I was too drained of life to actually decide.  Obviously I wasn't trying to give good answers by this point and this enraged the interviewer even more.

Finally it ended.

I'm still shaken up.

I'm also thinking... well, so what if I turned out to be a dud? The interviewer has plenty of experience, she must know that happens sometimes.  It makes her job easier - she can just cross me off the list.  That is what the interview is for.   Did she really need to get so pissy just because I stumbled on the first few questions?  Did she think that rolling her eyes at me was going to improve the interview? 

As you can imagine, I find those reviews quite easy to believe now.

1234,I hate my new job so much that I’m considering not showing up at all for my shift on Sunday. Bad idea?,"It’s a local boba tea chain restaurant. Extremely high turnover rates that I now realize are indicative of a terrible work environment. Some really ridiculous anti-worker stuff happening here. You’re counted tardy and written up if you clock in 1 minute late. They say they won’t pay you for work done 30 minutes after closing; meaning if you clock out at 11:45PM you won’t get paid for the additional 15 minutes after 11:30PM that you worked. Pretty sure that counts as wage theft, but I’m not sure where to report it to. 

I don’t know. I feel like an idiot for hating every job that I’ve worked so far, but I’m only 19 and don’t really enjoy the idea that I’m selling my time for a place that’s going to fire me for being a minute late. My last job was at a gas station and I ended up walking out of it. I feel kind of weak for not being able to push through it. Sucks. 

Also, say I were to not show up on Sunday, how would I collect my check? They don’t do direct deposit and they don’t mail the checks.

1243,How the FUCK do people do this?,"Good God. This job is so terrible. At first, being told to sit on your ass and stare at a clock for 8 hours sounds way better than most jobs. But after 4 years, 6 days a week, how in gods green earth do people just come in, sit down, rot and go home every day for 40 years? This is insane. I'm losing my mind doing this. My parents lost their livelyhood when I was in school, they managed to hold it together till I found this job, and now since they sacrificed their health and bodies to keep a roof over my head, they can't work at all anymore. So if I leave, my parents who gave everything for me go homeless.

This place is genuinely killing me. I ""partied"" a bit before I came here, more like just hung out with friends once in a while and drank some beer. Nothing bad or serious. Never had any problems, but I can't function coming here every day. It's got to the point where I depend on alcohol to get me to the end of the day, which drinking before I go to sleep nearly every day ruins mornings therefore no personal projects get done. Twice now I've got sent home on a 2 week covid leave. Both times did not touch a drop of alcohol. Thankfully, I do get 12 days off for the holidays. Never drink on those breaks at all. Alcohol is a problem, but the reason I have a problem with it, it is a coping mechanism to come in here and literally waste my entire life. I come in, put a part in the machine, sot down and wait 50+ minutes before pulling it out, putting a new one in and pushing go. That's. IT. absolutely no thought involved, can't look at phones, not supposed to read, not supposed to walk around. Good God it is beyond maddening.

I have so many goals and aspirations, when not working here for a few days I can spend 12+ hours every day busting ass doing farm work because I love that. I just wanna play with plants and dirt all day! But instead, I'm locked in this oversized concrete box, sitting next to a steel cube that I put refined rocks in so other rocks can rub and grind them till they're shaped like something that can cut other refined rocks. It's soulless, it's destroying the planet and my mental well being, slowly grinding away at any motivation and spirit I have left and leaving me with my only option as numbing the empty pain of starving for purpose with a substance that is further chipping away at my mental and physical health along with any hope or dream I used to have.

I hate this. I hate everything about my life, I hate the world we have created. It is so fucked up to watch this happen on such massive scales, to all of us on the planet, slowly destroying our sanity while we suck the life out of the planet to billionaires can profit and live the most ultra refined luxury in the history of our planet. It is so disgusting to me. I'm not lazy, I love good honest hard work that accomplishes something relevant. I want to build a small permaculture farm that supplies food to local people and can teach them the practice of holistic living. I just yay want fucking help the people around me and do my part to save the planet....I don't want a shred of it for myself. Every thing I do with myself is either to save the parents who care so much for me, or to help the others around me for being a part of this bizzare beautiful planet, we are all extensions/divisions of the earth and all I want to do is help those around me because I love this place and it's inhabitants so dearly....this place is incredible, but the world we have created is actual genuine refined hell. I'm losing myself....my only goals in life have been to help and love everything I touch, but after 4 years of being slowly ground away at, there's almost nothing left in me. By the end of the day in so distraught and miserable all I can do is silence the noise. The means of staying afloat and protecting my family is only possible with totally sacrificing my mental well being and any potential I have. What enables me to take care of my family is precisely what is undoing and destroying me. I'm utterly trapped, and I feel by the time my parents are finally at rest there won't be enough of me left to pick back up and I'll just.....stop as well. This life is disgusting. I hate everything about this world we have created and my own life by now. The world we created around spending at least 1/3 of your life in a factory to make somebody else money so you can barely survive with 1/8 of your time left for ""personal time"" has ground me into oblivion pulp. I'm just......so done with this shit.

I’ve never loved a follow authority workplace, and thought I found a good job I could stick with. I admined for a homeless shelter for women/kids. I was definitely underpaid, but I enjoyed some flexibility and good office atmosphere. One hour lunch. Fast forward a bit, Boss leaves. Appoints new boss. Fast forward a few more months, New Boss unexpectedly leaves. (We deserved better wages,better help,more staff! helping thousands of people) That left me to step up and take on temp boss. They say 2 days, to 2 weeks. I embraced the challenge but realized there was no training. I taught myself and my one remaining staff member what we needed to know. Trial and error, a whole lot of extra hours (was compensated but not hugely, around 36k/yr) 2 days turned into 3 months of absolute stress to keep us from going under, generating monies, keeping grant compliancy, being admin and director. I had this sick feeling they’d use me to stay afloat and then f me over. I could finally afford to get off government assistance,though. I worked my ass off so I could get my kids out of gov housing. I was so close! Given hope that it’d be permanent position,slight pay increase. Interviewed twice and then told I didn’t have the educational experience they wanted.They hired a woman with a masters who was an absolute control freak, clueless, budget-breaking, micromanaging. I had to train her and still be boss,and admin. She started assigning me menial tasks and I explained I couldn’t do those due to me still taking care of the main stuff. She started a paper trail and my coworker and myself. I knew she was planning to fire us. I warned the board she’d ruin the budget and I was fired. They then forced my pregnant coworker to resign. New New Boss was “resigned” 5 months later! It’s now a black stain on my resume. All of my hard work overshadowed. My dreams of getting my kids out of poverty, gone. It completely used me up and is depressing still to think about. This was a few years ago and now I only choose meaningless jobs where I don’t try and prove myself for fear I be fired again.

I'm on the end stages of finishing my PhD and I've realized that I don't think things are going to get better.

1255,The shambles of my work environment (long),"Hello, thanks for reading this, it may be a long one so apologies for that.

I work in a national operations/control room for a global market leading company. Basically a glorified call center for clients, employees and linked business partner companies. 

I work 12 hour shifts, on a 4 on 4 off rotation, sat in front of 4 computer screens.

Our team should be made up of 4 people and our supervisor. However, we have 3 and a supervisor.
I am second most experienced with only 2 years service, then someone with 1 year and a brand new person within last 3 months.

Currently our supervisor is off sick having a surgical procedure then will be off recovering a couple of months. Then another one of our team is also off sick awaiting a procedure but has a doctors note confirming absence from work.

To add to this, our big boss recently left for a new job leaving his second to be in charge. This second is rarely in the offices as he has shacked up with one of his direct subordinates and they now live together.

So, that leaves myself and someone who is brand new to run 5 inbound call lines, 2 outbound call lines that we have to chase up and still work on the email requests we have come through for third party companies and contractors. 
Then they still want incoming call waits under an average of 30 seconds across the team.

We don't even have tappy-click-to-call, we have to manually dial each number. 
Naturally, working 12 hours a day or night you get pretty tired. We only get 1 hour break each, however with the current staffing levels this obviously affects how we can take our breaks if at all.

The company hasn't arranged adequate cover from other staff to help my team, as they refuse to pay extra incentive for over-time, they will only pay flat-rate pay.

So I work my ass off all day/night doing as best as I can, only to get chewed out for making one or two mistakes when I've made thousands of interactions/calls all shift.

But only after I started working have I realised just how screwed over the general population is, compared to the corrupt oligarchs in charge of my country.

I just saw a news story that showed that some politician spent 300k euro on marketing for a hospital that doesn't even exist. Her reply? ""Well there's a model""

300k EURO for bullshit!!! My expenses are at about 1k euro per month. I could live for 25 years on that money. She on the other hand spent on nothing. It's probably lost in some expensive car that has no value any more or expensive trips that last for a few weeks and got her some likes on insta.

So every time I go to leave my minimum wage job I feel like I'm going through bloody airport security.

1266,I feel like almost no one IRL understands - a rant after a terrible day at work,"Some background: I have an office job where I make a decent amount and everyone at my company is WFH due to COVID since last March to at least through next April. Under normal circumstances, it’s a pretty chill (though not exactly enjoyable) job. With an “ideal” or “normal” workload, you probably only do 4-5 hours of work per day unless you’re really bad at managing your time. However, due to COVID, our workload has doubled or even tripled, in part due to the nature of the job, and also due to a lot of people across the office going out on leave / quitting, therefore giving the remaining people more to do. Also, my aunt works there too, in the same position as me, just in another location. 

So the other day I was telling her that after we get back to a normal workload, it would be so amazing if I was able to just work the 20-25 hours a week that I ACTUALLY do. 


Her: yeah, you’d only make half of what you make now though 


Me: yeah, but they could just, not do that. Just pay us what they do now. It ends up being the same. 


Her: but we’re hourly.


Me: right, so they could double our hourly rate or switch us back to salary. 


Her: but why would they do that if we’re not full time? 


Me: but we already sit around for the half the day doing nothing. They’re paying us for doing nothing. So why not just let us go when we’re done for the day? We’re still doing the same amount of work for them. 


Her: but...we’re hourly...why do we deserve full time pay for half days? 


Me: it’s a fortune 250 company, I’m pretty sure they’ll be okay.


Her: *changes subject* 


I mentioned earlier in this post that we’ve been doing double or triple the normal workload lately. This has been going on since March with no reprieve in sight. No bonuses, nothing, except for some “thank you” emails from corporate. I (kind of jokingly) told her that I therefore want triple my salary, the salary of three people, since our employer apparently considers me three people. I said I make $50k normally, where’s my $150k this year??? (I’m not actually expecting this btw lol).  She looked at me like I grew a second head.

1267,"Seems like a simple and obvious thing, but be done with work when you’re scheduled to be done.","I work from home and only get paid for working from 8 until 4, so at 4 I log off. I don’t care what else needs to be done, it can wait until tomorrow. If it was that important it would have been number one on my priority list for the day, and I would have gotten it done before EOD. 

Nobody is going to think you’re more deserving of a raise or a promotion because you stay until 5. In fact, I’ve noticed it’s the people who routinely stay late who don’t get promoted despite working the hardest. I used to be that person who would try to finish as much as I could and I’d be in the office until 5:30. I legitimately thought I owed it to the company to prove myself in this way. I thought people appreciated this and it would eventually get me somewhere. I was miserable and still got passed up for a promotion, it got me nowhere.

If you’re not curing cancer and/or actually saving peoples lives, it can probably wait until tomorrow. The spreadsheet isn’t that important. The paperwork isn’t that important.

1268,Tired of Struggling for a Better Job,"I work a terrible job that pays around $9 an hour. It's at a school, and they recently had an opening in their tech department that starts at $15 an hour. I've been with the school for a few years and have been a reliable and a good employee. I put in for the job and didn't even get an interview or anything. My hobbies are building PCs, repairing them, etc for people I know, the job was very basic, simple, and would have been awesome to get into some form of the tech field and get that work experience. It would have been life changing for me to be honest.  

As bad as it sounds, making $15 an hour would have allowed me to actually have the money to live life instead of just scraping by not being able to spend money on what most people consider necessities. I'm so sick of working 40 hours a week and literally have nothing to show for it other than hating 5/7ths of my life. The worst part is I'm intelligent and capable of so much more, but I'm stuck in this shit job with no way out.

Oh and let’s not forget the 10-25% that go to taxes making it so every 4 weeks or something you’re basically giving free labor. You need roommates to even survive because a damn studio for a single person is goddamn expensive.

And then we got the cat fees, dog fees, hell sometimes you even need to pay their monthly rent; the application fee, the move in fee, the deposit, first month and sometimes last months rent; and I can keep going, but all of this crap for some goddamn poorly designed apartment, rust, dirt, and overexpensive place to live? Bloody hell. 

I swear to fucking god I just wanna get on live or YouTube and just call out every motherfucker and this whole shitty system. I don’t even give a fuck if I’m cancelled, shot in the head, or whatever. 

I’d rather fucking die than to contribute to this bullshit. Why the fuck are we still supporting this crap? Oh yeah cause half the population is dumb as bricks, half of em even dumber than that, and the smart(er) ones are either the psychos in charge of things, being used to further psychos agendas (the scientists, docs, engineers, etc), and the left of the smart ones are poor af or dead by homicide or suicide. 

I d I o f u c k I n g c r a c y we’ve literally bred ourselves to be domesticated obedient little drones. Yeah we’ve got some protests and riots, but it’s okay most of the populous is fed and entertained even though they’re suffering, but that’s okay we’ve invented a whole new means of population control via the drug and therapy industry. And if that fails the elites of the world will just flee to their privately owned land and impose martial law and destroy absolutely any resistance whatsoever because in today’s current world technology and power is in their favor. And before that even happens they’re first trying to create a whole world that looks like China in terms of surveillance and they’ll try to harness the power of robots and AI to create their new world order (I’m not talking about Illuminati— just the rich, people in power, and companies). Possibly at one point killing off any nay sayers and furthering the world into something even worse than an episode of black mirror. 


I wanna blow my fucking brain off sigh. I honestly feel like I’m in the matrix or something.

Life is absolutely hell and there’s no sight of anything that resembles to our fairy tales of heaven besides eternal oblivion, but even that is probably not real considering how we’re already here in the first place and we’re literally a part of the universe, so it’s not like we can actually die just change into another form.

Boring paperwork and a lot of stress combined with a lot of time doing nothing while being stuck in this ""cage"" from 8:30 to 6 and we're also short staffed.


I waited for my commander (my boss) to recommend me to the mental health workers that I'm capable of something better and that I'm doing okay without meds (but I truly hate life like this, is this depression or just shitty situation?) and....obviously he didn't recommend me because I'm needed where I am.

It would be the equivalent of someone asking your boss who needs you to search you for another job, buuut that's how the military works.


I only get paid barely 300$ month and only see my house on weekends.


So I decided that when next week that I'll just....not do my work (can't just quit) and that'll probably fuck me hard (I'll probably get jail or not be allowed to leave the base for a month or two) but it'll probably help me transfer / get out of the military.

We never had anything to lose because what we had taken from capital was necessarily precarious to begin with. Compromises and defensive struggles over time are inevitable because the class struggle is not linear in its trajectory.

Up until this very moment I haven’t realized that this has been going on since my first job at 19, I’m 26 now. For years every time I’ve applied for a job they would always question me if there was a gap.

I’m the type of person who would leave any job that was negatively impacting me in a heartbeat and before I quit I would prepare myself financially and usually take a 1-2 month break in between depending on how I feel.

When did it become a crime to not work every day of your life?

1304,I just need 3 days,"I wore shitty flat soled shoes for 3 months at work because they conformed to the ""dress code"" I was informed of at the interview. 
Because of this I am sure I have some sort of tendonitis in my left foot that flares up if I move it a certain way. A way that I happen to move a lot when working. 

I'm hesitant to seek medical attention for it because right now it's mild and manageable and I don't even want to try and bother with our botched healthcare system right now. But that's another can of worms. 

I haven't been scheduled more than a single day off between shifts since starting. Sometimes my shifts line up nicely and I do get a good bit of downtime between an early shift, day off, then late shift. But what I really desperately and truly need is just 3 days off to myself to keep off my foot and let it heal. Before bombarding it for a solid 8 hours again.

But this stupid system we live in makes it seem like I'm the devil for even considering having something like that for myself. I can try and request time off but my manager will fight me tooth and nail because it's such an inconvenience to them that I have 3 days to recover from the constant stress I put my body under for them. 

I could call Monday off and have my 3 days just like that. But I'd feel guilty because I know someone else will have to pick up my shift. And I actually care about my coworkers in the same boat as me.
Not to mention the guilt tripping that management would also place on me as well.
Oh and disciplinary points for calling off as well.

I'm just fed up with how things are but I also have no choice. Or freedom to protest or advocate for change because I work so much.

1307,Unpopular Opinion: Most Europeans don't know how good they have it.,"The benefits and work-life balance given to the average European worker are unimaginable for Americans. 

European workers get more than 10 public holidays, 5-6 weeks paid vacation, maternity leave for several months, paternity leave, essentially unlimited sick days, virtually no unpaid mandatory overtime, and most full-time workers work less than 40 hours a week.

Here in America, despite chronic pain and numerous health conditions, I am working 60 hours a week (with no overtime pay), with only 2 sick days a year, with only 4 vacation/PTO days a year, no holidays off, and no family leave or paternity leave. And this is considered ""good"" for a job in my industry (for which I had to get a Master's degree to enter). All of my friends and colleagues are in similar positions.

My wife works 70 hours a week and receives 5 days off (including sick days) for the entire year. She is 7 months pregnant and gets no time off for childbirth or maternity leave. The plan right now is for her to give birth in the morning and come back to work later in the day. Read again: SHE WILL GIVE BIRTH AND COME BACK TO WORK ON THE SAME DAY. (And no, she did not qualify for FMLA).

And before you start crying that Americans have higher salaries than Europeans - that's only true for a few certain select professions like computer engineering or medicine. In my field (accounting and audit), European workers generally make more after tax.

So everytime I see Europeans on here complaining about how they are suffering because of their work lives, I honestly get enraged. I hate to gatekeep here, but you have no idea what real suffering is. 

The average European worker would probably have a total psychological breakdown and become violently suicidal if he or she tried living and working in America for more than a couple of years.

The worst part is I cannot even quit or take a break because then I will lose health insurance, nor can I kill myself to end the pain and stress because my family is dependent on me, not can I just get up and immigrate to a better country because getting a job overseas is near impossible unless you are a specialist in some high demand field.

So for the past 6 or so years I've worked all sorts of different jobs at various different places and I finally got a job I actually really liked; I settled down and bought a house solely because I was at this place for a year and half and was starting to feel ""secure"". Good pay, great benefits, and I actually kinda liked working there. Every single other job I've had has been piles and piles of bullshit that end up with me either quitting due to depression/frustration or getting fired for an arbitrary reason. 

So I'm doing great here, most people like me (except maybe some people in upper management, but they don't like anybody) and I get told often by co-workers that I'm the best/most helpful employee and I make all of their jobs easier. Sounds great. I'm happy, wife's happy, I'm making some friends and generally having a decent time at work (even though it was very stressful at times).

Then boom, pandemic hits. Whole company gets laid off (post-secondary education college) in late March.

A couple weeks I receive some news. I need to go home; my mother is dying. I'm 25 years old and my mother is dying.

April 6th, 2020. My mother has died. I make a post on Facebook letting people know. I have a lot of my coworkers on Facebook, including the important bit here: Some of upper management and my immediate boss. 

People send me messages, pretend to care. I'm torn up inside and don't know what the fuck to do, I had my first nervous breakdown of my life.

Fast forward about a month, around May. I start hearing news that my workplace is opening back up. Cool, start hearing some of my coworkers in the same positions as me are getting rehired. Maybe I'm to be rehired soon?

Then months go by. Everybody is back but me. I still have benefits from my government so I'm not super worried, but kinda am freaking out internally. One day I go to get prescriptions for my wife, oh that's weird my benefits don't work! October comes, I call my boss to ask what the fuck is going on.

He acts all buddy-buddy with me. ""Oh hey man! How you doing? Oh yeah if you want to come back to work just send a resume on the company website.""

Uhh... the what? The company website? I already work here, why am I sending in a resume!?

I get no responses to anything. Email my boss' boss, he informs me I'm terminated and says ""your position was filled"" but doesn't say anything else, when I respond in e-mail he ignores me.

I call office admin of company, she says I've been terminated since June.

Fucking. June. Two months after my mother dies and THEY KNEW, they decide to terminate me permanently. They didn't even call me. Turns out that, because of Covid-19, my government allows employers to terminate employees without notice and without severance pay.

I'm so jaded now, and I can't take this workplace-life anymore. 

I'm fucking DONE with this shit. I've decided to be self-employed again, it's something I did years ago with moderate success. We'll see how it goes, I hope I can do well and not have to work to make some other dickhead rich when they're just going to get rid of me anyways 'cause they don't give a fuck about me.

1321,Humanity has no direction and is stuck in mire of never-ending consumerism - There are no winners in the end.,"Whats the direction of humanity? It would seem in the 60's there was a great hope that we would expand our knowledge of the planet and breach the walls of our own solar system but then it all kinda dropped off and as the decades rolled on we allowed a small class of human beings to gain a massive amount of wealth and power, that they keep in private hands - On islands, in foreign bank accounts, wrapped up in stocks and shares - None of which this wealth benefits the majority of people or their governments that are supposedly democratically elected. 

It would seem to me that the world is stuck in mire. The capitalists dont want to move away from a system that garuntee;s them their place at the top, living in total luxurary away from any of life's unpleasantness. Over the cracks of crumbling societies all over the world they pave over broken, underfunded systems with private ones - The ones that require money to access, so that while the world burns, they can ignore all of that with little hindrance to themselves. 

Its not unusual for countries to have 2 education systems, 2 law systems, even housing that is designed to seperate rich from poor. The whole covid thing shows just how directionless we are as a species. The people at the top of the pile have fluffed the whole test by their only focus being on keeping the economy open so that people can consume and keep the system going. 

In 2020, We may not have flying cars or interplanetary travel but we do have the means to house, feed, clothe and educate people up to a university level - And we should be.

We could reduce the working week quite heavily but that would require a change in the economy that capitalists will not accept. 

Capitalists hate change, they ALWAYS have to have their hands forced. In Britain we build the Canals first (1700's) All of the capitalists were wretched when trains came along and did everything they could to stop them from taking off. Then they built the main motorway roads and got rid of half of the railways - Effecting shareholders in the railways etc. 

Anyway, humanity isnt going anywhere. Wealthy people have no vision for the future. politics is rigged (Overton window has been dragged to the right for decades now across the world) and climate change will probably end us all.

Since February I have applied to 150+ jobs, I have been rejected by 90, been interviewed by less than 10 of them, and received absolute silence from the rest.

Today I had a job interview with Burlington. 

The position I applied for was labeled as ''seasonal stockroom associate'', when I mentioned that I would require training using the cash register the hiring manager was confused and told me that I applied for a cashier position. This is not the first time this has happened, it seems that corporations love to pull an ol' switcharoo with positions on job candidates and act like you did something wrong. 

I have been *considered* for the position but there's a bunch of hoops I need to jump through.

First, they will send me an email link to complete an online workday assessment which should take at least an hour. If my assessment is received well, they will then invite me to orientation which is essentially a full day of unpaid work that will determine if I can perform the required duties and undergo any necessary training.

Only after that will they schedule a second interview that determines if I am eligible for the position. 

And lastly, since this is a seasonal position. I only work when they need me too and I am paid minimum wage in accordance to those randomized hours. This means I will be making inconsistent minimum wage.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate American work culture and capitalism so much, the health, economic and political crisis that this nation is going through has violently torn off the already poorly arranged facade that corporations had over them and revealed that American work culture is just pure sadism.

I swear that these hiring managers derive a sick sense of pleasure from forcing their job candidates to go through all these unnecessary hoops just to get a minimum wage job.

Looking for a job in the USA is like running in a maze with 100+ different exits and every single exit has a SAW trap that you need to get through before escaping. 

And the biggest issue is that I have no other choice but to participate in this system. I have zero other options.

1328,"What do you think ""anti-work"" means?","Serious question: To you, the reader, what does ""anti-work"" mean? 

Is ""anti-work"" hating the idea that you have to work in order to survive? In the past, ""working"" meant getting up at the break of dawn, plowing, fertilizing, gathering your crops, taking care of the livestock, hunting for meat, sewing your own clothes, mending/building your own house, etc. You would put in work every single day just to survive on the frontier. You would barter with people in order to attain things that you couldn't provide for yourself.  Your life was in your own hands. You owned your time. If you didn't put in the work, you didn't last very long. Unless you turned to crime and robbed others of their hard-earned fruits of labor. Or relied on others to take care of you.

In today's modern world, the work is a bit different, but the idea isn't. Basically, you're (hypothetically) getting up at the crack of dawn, commuting to work for someone else in order to get paid a currency that has a perceived value which you use to buy the things you need to survive (i.e. food, shelter, clothing, etc.). Your time isn't your own while employed by someone else. You've ""agreed"" to give them your time and work in order to get paid, so that you can survive. You could opt not to work, in today's society, but you'd have a hard life surviving. 

So, in the very general situations I've described above, the conclusion is that in order to survive, you still have to ""work"", whether it's you living off the land or you selling your time and labor to someone else. 

Given the state of our modern societies, how can someone that is ""anti-work"" thrive? What do they expect to be able to do in order to survive? I'm genuinely curious, because a utopian society where anyone and everyone can do what they want with their time sounds very optimistic and unobtainable. 

The thing is, even if you're living on a deserted island or piece of unknown land somewhere off the grid, you're still going to be putting in the effort to survive. You'll still be ""working"", the only difference is that you're in control of your time and where you'll spend your efforts. 

Maybe I'm getting hung up on the word ""work"" in ""anti-work""? Is ""anti-work"" something else? Something like a belief where you're not against work, per se, but against the system that has made a society where your survival is almost out of your control?",False,jr4nnc,USCSSNostromo2122,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jr4nnc/what_do_you_think_antiwork_means/,13,1

1335,Minimum Contracted Time Payout,"Even tho it's still work, hear me out! 

For the past few years, before covid, I've worked as a 1099 contractor doing event tech work.
It's been better than any w2 job I've had for a lot of reasons, one being less work and more pay.
On top of that, all of these gig jobs have a minimum daily payout.

Even if the job only takes 1hr, we always get at least 4 or 5 hours daily payout.  Even better, whatever hours we are booked for, we get paid for even if we get it done sooner. (if it takes longer, we are not obligated to stay but those who do get paid for the additional time) 

I noticed that my w2 friends in the same industry, or just my previous retail experience, sometimes they just want you to come in for an hour or two, Or send you home early bc ""it's slow"".  Or threaten your job if you don't stay late bc they understaffed.

That seems unreasonable. 
With any established company, if you booked your time with them for a shift, and they want to send you home early bc it's slow, they should still have to pay you what they booked you for.  And for the purposes of this booked shift concept, no shift should be less than 4 or 5 hours.

1372,Minimum wage workers cannot afford a one-bedroom rental in 95% of U.S. counties,"Defining “affordable” as spending no more than 30% of monthly income on rent... [Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/14/minimum-wage-workers-cannot-afford-rent-in-any-us-state.html)

\-----

The frustrations about employment, aside from the lack of choices for meaningful and fulfilling work that isn't menial and repetitive tasks, stem from the fact that there is no incentive even to grind if the outcome doesn't beget anything other than spinning wheels for mediocrity.

The majority of time is spent earning the necessities which one can't even afford, let alone the dearth of free time to do something other than stare at a screen and recuperate. 

At what point is it not pessimism but rather befuddlement and exasperation with the reality of things?

1378,I think working for $10.50 an hour added onto my ptsd,"Don't wanna ramble on about what caused my ptsd.  Having to work in a hotel and expected to clean about 16 to 20 rooms in 8 hours for $10.50 has definitely caused me to have trauma symptoms.  Sometimes having a partner, sometimes alone. Didn't matter if the room was trashed or not, it had to be done by the end of shift.

Usually guests only left after the 11 am check out time. Maybe 2 or 3 guests leaving before check out.
To put it simply, the last 5 hours of my shift was rushing to clean the entire room and bathroom.  Loud vaccuum, pressure put on by supervisors, partner may or may not be in a terrible mood or hate my guts.

Every. Day.

I still get pain in my stomach thinking of it at times.  This was a part time job by the time I quit.  Went from 40 hrs, 36 hrs, 24... each reduction of hours from worsening symptoms.  Dread from going in, waking up 3 hours early due to anxiety.

I don't understand how my father, who I've lived with since my mom kicked me out when I was 16, has done this for 15 yrs or so.  I've confronted him about the stress and asked him if he wanted more from life at all.

""No, I'm comfortable as is.""

I asked him if he truly feels happy.  And then I broke down.  From reliving the stress from my school years, from the stress with my mother, from the job I had. I asked him if he was happy or felt satisfied while having to pay about half of his paycheck, maybe 2/3 of it even, on bills, on his car loan, insurance, groceries, streaming services. That I feel horrible for complaining while people who have less than us are suffering. 

That the job I had made questioning the quality of our lives, triggering. Traumatically triggering.

I can do nothing for people who I wish to help because I no longer have income. I can't enjoy my hobbies anymore. I have all the time I could wish for to enjoy and explore hobbies.  It all just makes me feel like a leech because I physically and mentally am not strong enough to handle the stress of a job.

I wouldn't mind working if at least, what I needed for survival had been taken care of for me. Heating, rent, ac, utilities... I'd pay for anything extra with whatever income I would have with those not weighing on me.

I apologize if this sounds like whining.  My point is, I cannot work without getting immobilized from anxiety and physical trauma symptoms before even getting ready to Go to work.

In my opinion, if your entire life revolves around doing things against your will then you haven't in anyway ""won,"" so you have no right to call someone else to chooses an alternate lifestyle a loser. I'm not saying people who work are losers, I think everyone has the right to live how they want, but I certainty don't think wage slaves are in a position that is ""higher"" than a person who just chooses to chill and lead a calm, work free life.

I get a half hour lunch break and two fifteen minutes breaks that I usually skip because there's no time. Because of COVID-19 job cuts, I'm doing the work of three people (at least) and don't get payed more for that work. I get Tuesdays off, and I work Wednesday nights, which my supervisor tried to convince me is just like having a full day off. My fiancee is telling me I either need to get a different schedule at work so that I have at least one day on the weekend off, or so that I have evenings off. She starts work at 8am so the time in the morning I have ""off"" I can't even spend with her. 

So, my supervisor is trying to convince me that having breakfast time with friends is so much more fun than dinner and night time plans. He's telling me that having Tuesday and Wednesday ""off"" means I don't have to deal with weekend traffic and the hectic shopping times. He's saying that having dinner with people during their work week is so much more rewarding than the weekends because they're not going to be complaining about having to go back to work on Monday. He's saying that paying me more now for taking on this extra work would be unfair to the people who they hire after COVID-19 to take back that workload (as if that's going to happen when they now know that they can force more work on fewer employees and cut labor costs).

It's just sad, that he's trying to get me to believe this. I'm 24 years old. I'm not stupid. I know he's lying. I know he's just trying to shut me up and keep me working these ridiculous hours on this shitty schedule. 

I want to have a Saturday with my fiancee where we can actually have some time to relax, talk, and have sex again. Now, our time is so rushed because she has to leave at 10pm so she can get back to her place and sleep because she works early on Wednesdays. We have to cut our time short on Wednesdays because I have to sleep at 4pm so I can start working at 9pm and last through the next day.

I dunno. It feels like I'm boxed in. I can't quit this job with the market being so hectic and unsure right now. They offer amazing benefits at my job, and I need those right now. They pay really well too, but like, I'm never happy. Ever. 
Nobody wants to make plans for Tuesday and Wednesday! They have work in the morning the next day. It makes me feel isolated and lonely as fuck. 

Anyway, my fiancee is saying that I either have to fix my schedule at work, or quit. It's either that, or she breaks off our engagement and we take a break until COVID-19 is ""over."" Those are my options. 
She's not wrong though. This job sucks ass. I'm always tired, I'm always behind on my workload because of how much extra is being put on me, I'm always anxious about when I have to go in again because my free time is so limited, and I never feel like I can just relax.

I don't think you need to read this part but you may if you want the details. I was attached to this company to do my internship but they made use of us and threw us to do jobs that involves customer service and IT skills. I was from IT background so I was placed here. However, we were not trained properly. I was literally sitting there watching my colleague who was my friend from school. He didn't teach me how to do many things and left me on my own the following week.

My boss was my only lifeline, I tried to ask her for help but she has 0 clue on how it works. My boss then sent another colleague who was her brother to help me after 3 weeks. Her brother told me to stop bothering her lmao??? I mean I wasn't taught on how to do this man... his help wasn't that great either and he didn't teach me another crucial component of the job but the admin office issued me a ticket and I had to do the other component of the job. 

This was a shocker for me but hey I attempted to do it as I already voiced out my concerns but they paid no attention and I lost over 400GB of data and hundreds of millions of dollars of the client's data. The boss' brother was so angry with me and he mocked and ridiculed me infront of everybody... like what the actual fck? 

My other intern friends soon avoided me as word got round the office and I was the main gossip point... which is unfair in my opinion but what can I do? 
I was transferred to admin site and after one day of semi-training I was asked to do something that I wasn't taught yet again. I lost a few thousand dollars of the company's money and was getting dropped F bombs everywhere.

What the actual fuck is working for a minimum wage? I worked 3 to 4 hours after my working hours and even skipped lunch to produce the best work I can and only to be shat on. Is this really going to be life? 

I soon submitted a letter to redraw from the internship programme as I was admitted to the mental health institute due to suicidal thoughts.

1407,Work's Toll on My Mental Health,"This morning I woke up immediately angry and ready to throw and destroy things. I ended up pacing around my apartment screaming my frustrations and probably scaring the neighbours in the process. Then I took a benzo to calm down and now im a grumpy zombie. So i still won't be able to do my work properly today. This wasn't the first time this happened and it surely won't be the last.

This is no way to live. And believe me, my coping is better than it used to be. I've been through therapy and was hospitalized for work-induced suicidal ideations and I used to frequently have to leave work because of debilitating anxiety attacks (literally like convulsions). I got fired from one job and my employer would not tell me why, but I suspect it was because I made the mistake of admitting I have anxiety issues and panic disorder.

I'm not built for this world but I have no idea what else to do except suffer for the next 50 years until I die. Theres no way I'll be lucky enough to retire (part of that is my own fault as I tend to spend a lot when I hate life and don't care). To those who say ""start your own company and become your own boss"", that would be taking on levels of stress and risk that I could never mentally handle.

On top of this, for employee reviews we are always expected to give the impression we are ready for more responsibility and more work, whereas truthfully I'm barely hanging on as it is. Preferably I'd like to stay in my current position and learn to deal with increasing amounts of stress (in addition to wanting to gain more technical knowledge on the product I work on) but of course being content in your current position is looked upon unfavorably to a corporation.

The stress I've been through I'm also convinced has permanently damaged my cognitive functions. I make little mistakes and slip ups all the time, and misremember things a lot (although it probably doesn't help that everything I work on is in a rush so I can't properly take my time on things anyway). I'm a barely functional human and I'm consistently pushed to the limits which in turn stresses me out and causes even more mental degradation.

The funny thing is I like this job more than any other job I've had and I still hate it.

I'm so sick of this cycle but I don't see any other way. No matter how well I learn to cope there's always going to be a part of me that despises this system and just existence in general. At this rate if I'm lucky I'll have a work induced stroke by 35 and finally get out of this shit.",False,jrlv7d,EverybodysGrandma,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jrlv7d/works_toll_on_my_mental_health/,9,1

1414,The Best Job I Ever Had (Story),"A while back, I posted about a job I had for years that was absolutely awful, for which I’m actually in therapy.

Thought I’d share the opposite and tell you about a job I LOVED (I know, right?)

Let me be clear: I loved this job because I had to do very little and it made me feel extremely cool.

In 2015, I got a job at Sea World in San Diego. I know many of you will have feelings about that organization, but bear with me.

The first job I had there was in admissions. I’d stand at the front gates, take people’s tickets, have them do the dumb little thumb scan, and let them in. After a while, they had me working in the parking payment booth.

...I fucking hated it.

After a few months, I had an opportunity to apply for the job I ACTUALLY wanted, as a narrator in the education department. I got the job, did the training, and started working.

Here’s what a typical day would look like:
-Clock in/get today’s schedule
-Go to an animal exhibit I’d been scheduled for (sharks, pinnipeds, beluga whales, etc.)
-Talk on the microphone for 5 minutes.
-Chat with guests and answer animal questions until another big crowd arrived.
Rinse and repeat for 60-90 minutes until someone came to take over.
-Do the same thing at the next scheduled exhibit.
-Take a break
Do more of the talking thing for 2 hours
-Lunch
-Work
-Break
-Work
-Go home

Employees are given 2 15-minute paid breaks and a 30 minute unpaid lunch. 

Here’s the kicker: our department did everything on half-hour increments, so 15-minute breaks became 30-minute breaks and our 30 minute unpaid lunch was really an hour, half of which was paid (we would clock back in and just sit back down because we had nowhere to be for another half an hour). We’d just sit around and chill in the outdoor employee area, just outside the employee cafeteria where they’d sell food at cost. $2 for a cheeseburger that costs $12 in the park? Sure thing!

The only part I really considered work was the narrations, which we wrote ourselves. That means I only really “worked” about 2 hours of the day in total for an 8 hour shift. Aside from that, I was either shooting the shit with my coworkers behind the scenes, or talking about animals (which is my favorite thing to do anyway).

Another huge bonus was the uniforms. All of the customer service related jobs involved wearing these ugly button-down shirts with horrible patterns on them. Our uniforms? Black pants or shorts and a blue t-shirt that said “Zoological Operations” on the back.

Made me feel like a rockstar.

 We were also the only department that had contact with guests that were allowed to wear sunglasses.

I’d have done that job until I died if not for 2 things:
-They were pretty much only part-time. 3 eight-hour shifts a week (or 4 six-hour).
-I left that job because I moved to Seattle to start a new life.

The irony is not lost in me that the best job I ever had involved very little work, but that’s kind of the point, right?",False,jqt53r,AnActualPairOfPants,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jqt53r/the_best_job_i_ever_had_story/,1,1

Then my work demoted me after consultants came in and “reevaluated.” Now I actually like being hourly because I don’t have to work extra than my 40 hours a week and if I do I get OT. My company has promoted two people to salary each who has less experience than me. My boss said he wants to promote me to salary but honestly I don’t want the added pressure and not getting compensated for working extra. What would you do: stay hourly or take the promotion if offered? My coworker said I should take it for the extra $ but I feel like it won’t be that much more bc they will go back to working me more.",False,jqdqar,wanttohavehope55555,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jqdqar/what_would_you_do/,6,1

1436,My boss just being straight up rude to me.,"Hi guys, just here to vent a bit.

So my current project is to update some of our web pages. The initial task was to add a few more images that highlight where our product is used, but it's evolved in to a total page rework. We make all changes on a fake staging site, so if there's any critical issues then we've not messed with our live customer facing site. I'm to make changes on this staging site then send it to my boss and 2 others to proof read. Queue their feedback, then I adjust and send again until it's good enough to put on the live site. Simple, right?

Well, here's the email I got back from my boss after sending him the first draft:

&gt; ""Hi (my name)
&gt; 
&gt; Please can you kindly study your work in-detail, as a preview before asking us to do this, it means we don’t find mistakes on your behalf, it makes you look detailed and good at what you do.""

Now, I'm not sure my boss understands what a *first draft* is but either way, I figured this was kind of rude, no? It makes me *look* detailed and good at what I do. To me, that implies that I'm simply not good at my job.

So I kept doing my work and then a few days later (today), a similar issue. I was making another first draft for a different page and sent it to him and two others for review.

&gt; (my name) again, to repeat myself, please can you read through, experience these pages as a customer, before you send them to us.  Make changes, make things read for ownership/communication… The purpose of this whole exercises is radical improvement.  You are to look at the small detail… You are a graphic designer, communication is 90% of your job, please read everything, make changes to communicate.  Things need to make sense.  We do not want to have to do your job for you, it is a bad waste of our overhead cost at the Company.  I have just spent 20mins doing this email…

So now it's pretty clear to me. He's not accidentally being rude, it's pretty deliberate. Saying that communication is 90% of my job as if I don't know how to communicate? God forbid he spends 20 minutes writing an email, whereas if I left then he'd be spending 6 hours making the page himself. 

As a further note, this is my first job out of uni. I am a JUNIOR graphic designer even though I now have 2+ years of experience at this job. I started out with simple image editing, now since 2 other employees have left I've been given all of their tasks as well as multiple more. I'm doing all of this as the sole graphic designer at this company for pennies, and this is how little he thinks of me.

Sorry to rant and ramble, but this has really been getting to me. I want to quit and give a big 'Fuck you' but searching for a job right now isn't exactly ideal, and for Graphic Design it's tough to find decent ones locally anyways. So I'm stuck here for a bit longer, dealing with this shit.

1443,Just walked out on another job after hating what I was doing.,"I recently got a job at a new hospital built in my area as a meal prepper essentially. I took the food the chefs cooked and put it all on a plate and took it to the patients who ordered it. Well I hated my first day so much I said I forgot something in my car and just left. It just reminded me of when I worked at Wendy’s back in highschool and it made me sick to my stomach. Also the thought of me messing up an order could potentially kill someone was nauseating. I really don’t know what to do anymore. Every job I’ve ever had has just been so awful that I don’t know if I’ll ever find one I can at least tolerate. I walked out before this job to when I worked at Amazon. I hated it so much I just left. To make it a million times worse, my mom said she was proud of me before I went in for my first day. The fact that I’m such a loser and do nothing but disappoint her everyday I breathe destroys me. All I ever wanted to do was make her proud one day. She tells me she’s proud of me sometimes but I don’t truly believe it. I’ve done nothing to deserve it. I’m at the point were I’m pretty sure my only option is to kill myself. At least then I won’t be in anyone’s way anymore and my mom can just move on with my brother.

1444,Why do managers inconviently post schedules just days before the work week starts?,"My current jobs - as a part time bank teller and part time server - both like to post schedules one to two days before the work week starts. I don't know if this is typical but ??? Why

I have an opportunity for an interview at another place I'm really keen on working at and all I had to do was give the days I'm available to come in for an interview. Well it's been 4 days now and I'm still unable to set a date and time for the interview as I'm awaiting my shift schedule - which is actually behind schedule now so I also have no clue what my serving shifts are until the day before I might potentially get scheduled.

I'm trying to schedule my massage therapist and chiropractor appointment and hope I get in this week and find time to prepare dinner this week before my red wine and yucca go bad as otherwise it's hard to find the time or energy to since I work 9-5s or 2-12s.

1445,Death by corporate!,"Remember  when you were young and a new day dawned. The adventures of the day  were awaiting you, there were no limits and everything was yours to  explore. Nobody told you what to think, believe or do. Or so you  thought. You still had to go sleep, brush your teeth, wash yourself, eat  your food and do your homework whenever your parents told you so. You  had a nice childhood and your parents let you dream, they were never too  concerned with what you would do in life as long as you were happy. You  thought their message was genuine but now you know it was self  preservation. They never knew how society really functioned, they hated  the game but some part of them still wanted part in that game. A bit of  recognition to their efforts. If you scream loud enough that money does  not bring happiness, even if you don't believe it, a part of you will  believe it. You picked up on the dissatisfaction nagging at the edges of  their existence, not consciously but eventually it spilled over into  the conscious as well. You never noticed their struggle with poverty  because to a child poverty is an unknown concept. You were creative and  you realize now that as long as you are creative you are not poor and as  long as you can dream you are rich. You were the richest little child  in existence. Do you remember?

As  you were made to slowly fit the mold you would fight it more and more.  What were they trying to push you into? Do you remember how you fought  it? Do you still have that fight in you?

Almost  nobody escapes the mold and our dreams are replaced by their dreams.  Their dreams become our dreams. By the time you were done with high  school you fitted the mold perfectly. You promised your parents you  would bring them riches, they would have it all. Everything they were  never able to give you, you would bring them so they could finally be  happy. Marvel at the beauty in the world was replaced with the question  of how someone else was able to have more matter under their control  than you. How did they do that? Why is it not mine? If you would have  been a person of low self esteem you would have believed that these  things were never your right to begin with anyway. You are not a person  of low self esteem, you are a disciplined and all that riches will be  yours.

Although you made many  mistakes, you did pay attention to your parents. Like the illiterate  school teacher, they taught you something they never really seemed to  grasp themselves but maybe knew was there: a possible journey towards  discovering the real value of things. At this point in your young mind  you did not pay attention to any of that though. What counted is social  standing and money. The most impressive human beings had, in your mind,  tons and tons of money. Money is the benchmark of success and service in  society, right?

You kept doing  well, your parents were probably proud but you didn't care anymore if  they were proud or not. It became a whole different beast altogether;  competition. More money than your parents or siblings or friends is not  important anymore if you want more money than your boss, but wait, who  is this person with the big mansion on the hillside? That should be me!  Me! Me me me me me me me me me me me me. ME ME ME ME ME ME ME!!!!!!!

You  became a meme. A meme toxic to it's host. You looked up to the  programmers, the accountants, the lawyers, the neurotic people in suits.  Soon you became one of them yourself. Granted, you thought you just got  very lucky. So lucky to score that prestigious corporate job for that  big famous company. You did not even need to tell people what you did,  you just told them who you worked for, who owned your dreams and they  would respect you. It was great the first year as you did not need to  dream for yourself anymore. Your bank account always had a nice amount  of money sitting in it for you to spent on whatever you pleased and you  liked yourself in a suit.

Slowly  it started eating away at you as you climbed the ranks and made  ""friends"" within the machine. The higher you get the more you have to  dream their dream. Even when you sleep you dream of it, your weekends  you dream of it, your free time you dream of it. You are becoming it.  Management becomes your social circle and you hang out with them around  their large backyard pools. When the wives are inside with the children  they talk to you about that ""chick"" that they fucked. You play along  because you are good at it. The only topics you talk about is your job,  infidelity and golf.

For 15 long  years you climb but it is never enough and you never seem to get there.  It is always out of reach and no promotion is ever enough, no raise is  ever enough, the authority that comes with it is boring and empty. That  new car feels fantastic the first month you drive it and after that you  loathe traffic all the same.

You  remember the little child that was inside of you, full off hopes and  dreams. You tried to kill that child but you failed and from time to  time you feel it in your periphery, a quiet sob. Life becomes evermore  unbearable, your friends start slipping as the political climate changes  and mistakes are laid bare. Not you though, you were always just one  big lie, too lazy for infidelity, too tired to be unscrupulous. As life  starts losing it's meaning you start to experiment with chemical  motivation. The options are unlimited but not much has been tested.

Then,  something inside of you starts to stir and tries to resist your actions  but you overpower it time after time. You are a winner, although at  this point you are not sure what that means anymore. Too tired to  change, too chemically charged to stop and no courage to end it all. End  it all.

1448,From guy who aspires to work 16 hours a day at 20 to you.,"As I said in the title, im 20 , currently learn 4 hours a day and work 8, I add 5 minutes extra learning every day up to the point I reach 16 hours. Hear me out! 

I think a lot of you guys have the same issue that I can 100% relate with. You don't like your work. Easy to understand, easy to fix. I'd take a wild guess that most of you guys work jobs that have nothing to do with your passion, If you're a doctor but you hate people you will hate life too. 

I love coding, I don't love coding 16 hours a day but the fact that it's my passion makes it bearable, the ammount of pleasure people get from working on their passion is the one and only true happiness, most of you guys seem to have gotten used to momentary pleasures , pleasures that don't last past their time-frame. Sex is cool but building a boat is cooler. You catch the drift? 

You get to chose a sacrifice, you don't get to not make a sacrifice, you get to chose which sacrifice you're going to make. You can sacrifice your passion and hold onto your own self by working 8 hours on a job you don't like just to work less or you can sacrifice your current self, work 12 hours and sooner or later you will be able to only work on your passion. Jobs you hate will only get worse with time, jobs you love will only get better with time.

1462,My PTO may be getting cut in 2021. What are some legal/non-fireable ways to give the middle finger back?,"I work a typical 9-5, though I really do 9-4 and I've been working from home since March due to the pandemic (and probably not going back to the office any time soon).  In mid-2019, our parent company sold us to another parent company.  In 2020, we kept our same PTO accruals from the previous parent company and were able to roll over any 2019 PTO into 2020.  So this year (2020), I had a shit ton of PTO.

* My normal 23 PTO Days (for employees in the 3-10 years of employment range)
* 1 Floating Holiday (essentially another PTO day)
* 2 weeks of PTO that I purposely saved from 2019 for my honeymoon in February 2020, which was was cancelled due to the pandemic.  And since we can't roll anything over from 2020 to 2021, I've been using all of it.

So barring my 2 weeks that I rolled over from 2019, my 2020 PTO was essentially 24 days.

But we just got our 2021 Benefits and my PTO is taking quite a hit.  Now I'll get:

* 14 PTO days (for employees in the 3-5 years of employment range)
 * March will be my 5-year anniversary, and the 5-10 year amount is 16 days, but I doubt they'll bump me up or give me another day since my 5-year is partway through the year)
* 3 Floating Holidays
* 10 Sick Days

So although that comes out to 27 days I can take off, it's really 17 PTO days and 10 sick days.  This kinda sucks because it's tough to schedule sick days like PTO because you generally use sick days the day of.  And only 1 person on our team ever gets sick enough that he actually can't work, even from home.  So when do the rest of us have the opportunity to actually use them?  We might not get sick all year.

We did learn that the sick days are decided between the manager and their team with no need for a doctor's note, and our manager is pretty chill and agreeable.  So one of my teammates and I are tossing around the idea of seeing if our team (3 guys + our manager) can agree on a system to use ""mental health"" sick days, like if one of us is feeling burnt out a particular week, we all agree to give that person a day off that Friday or whatever.  That person uses a sick day but we've all known about it days in advance.

HOWEVER, if we can't figure out something like that, I'm losing a week of PTO, which sucks.  So, in that case, what would be some legal/non-fireable ways to give the middle finger back?",False,jrtr5n,AppleHillMagic,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jrtr5n/my_pto_may_be_getting_cut_in_2021_what_are_some/,8,1

1471,Part-time Work,"Hello,

I've been working part-time, only just started a few days ago and have been experiencing and thinking about certain things regarding part-time work and wanted to see if others had similar experiences/thoughts. I've had the same thoughts and issue with previous jobs as well.

Want to start by saying that this isn't meant to be a post about how part-time is as bad a full-time, I am massively sympathetic to full-time workers. Part-time is a lot better, but still it doesn't fix the problems with work/work culture.

Though I only work part-time I spend a lot of the time worrying and dreading going back, of course this is a big issue with full-time work too, but I find that even in part-time and 'less serious' roles that issue is still there. Especially when the job is miserable.

Also, often when working part-time they just spread the hours. So, whilst you do work a lot less hours your day is still essentially occupied by work because you have to prepare for work and it renders much of the day useless for hobbies or other activities.

1473,Retail during Covid and part-time work,"Hello,

I posted a few days ago about starting a new job and how I don't feel grateful for the job, though people tell me I should be. Here is the [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jotj2l/being_grateful_for_a_job_during_covid/).

The colleagues have so far been friendly. The general work atmosphere is fairly laid back, at least by retail standards. However, at the end of the day I'm still paid minimum wage and doing a customer facing job (checkout), where people do not follow the proper Covid protocol. 

What makes this worse is that behind the scenes it is impossible to socially distance from other colleagues and hence none basically do. I don't blame them for this, but as someone with OCD (and other issues) this is fucking horrible for me. 

I'm only part time, about mid 20 hours a week, 4 days on 3 off. Granted this is much better than full-time. I could not cope doing full-time.

However, I wanted to say that whilst part-time is a lot better, it's not a full answer to the problem. If the job is miserable it's still miserable and you spend much of the time off worrying about going back. 

Also, often, they just spread the hours, so whilst you do work a lot less hours your day is still essentially occupied by work because you have to prepare for work and it renders much of the day useless for hobbies or other activities.

This isn't meant to be a post about how part-time is as bad a full-time, I am massively sympathetic to full-time workers. Part-time is a lot better, but still it doesn't fix the problems with work/work culture.

Anyone else feel similar about 'part-time' work? and have similar experiences?

1480,Decided to call in sick today,"Another rant/vent, plus an update to my condition as I described in my previous post. Sorry if this ended up too long.  


I'm not feeling well today, so I decided to call in sick and not coming to work. Fortunately, I was able to go home and preparing myself to go to hospital. The doctor diagnosed my with GERD in addition to exhaustion from working too much, and suggested me to rest for few days before returning to work.  


I regret that I only contacted HR when I called in sick. I should have contacted my boss and superior too. However, I forgot to do that since I was only focusing on my own health back at the hospital, resulting in my boss and superior asking me to submit my daily report. I told them that I didn't come today and probably for few days ""as suggested by doctor"", and fortunately they listened and replied ""get well soon"". At least I can catch some break...  


...until just now, when I was about to go to sleep, my boss contacted me again, asking if I already well enough to come tomorrow, since he needs help on preparing some presentation material and stuff. Again, I replied that my doctor insisted me to rest and not touching my job until I fully recover, and politely refuse his request because of those reasons. I was afraid he would force me to to the work from home, but luckily that's not the case. This is despite I sent my doctor note to him and others, which stated that I need few days to recover.  


See, the problem is that he keep piling one task after another on me recently. I was supposed to do lab work at most, but he thoughts that he hired me ""for something higher"", so he asked me to make a daily report on the ongoing production process at the factory, every day. And he asked me to finish the report during the time when I still haven't even finished with my lab work, which is also an important task and my supposed job here.  


Another thing is he will sometimes tasks me on some RnD stuff which is beyond my knowledge, and other stuff. There was a time when I was asked to re-do some inspection on rejected goods even after the other worker just finished the inspection and submitted the result, ""just to make sure"". Oh, and there are one other instance when I was asked to come on Saturday AND Sunday because of urgent things that needs to be done.

Already consulted to my parents, some co-workers, doctor, and therapist, and the conclusion is I am indeed unsuited for working at factory environment. However, I can't just ragequit because of the reason I stated before. Hence why I'm trying to keep coming to work in spite of everything until today where I just can't force myself because I can't keep up anymore. I even experienced panic/confusion attack few days ago, because I was dreading work, and I felt a sudden fear/nervousness of coming the next day which worried my parents, and they did their best to calm me down.  


I don't know what to say anymore, and I don't know what will happen later, nor I want to think about it. I just want to rest my mind, and I hope I can quit from working faster and safe.",False,js9g0u,tawlon,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/js9g0u/decided_to_call_in_sick_today/,6,1

I clearly had no clue what life was like when I was younger. I wanted to travel the world. But it all seems so far fetched now. 

I'm from South Africa. I've got a degree in Marketing and working for 3 years now. I've been earning R8000 for the first 2 years of work and R9000 now, after practically begging for an increase, since I get new work handed to me ALL the time with my salary staying the same.

I must say, as a 24 year old female, I am handling A LOT at my company. I basically run all the marketing business. My manager (Head of marketing) takes credit for most of my work when it goes to the CEO. He knows absolutely NOTHING going on and I cannot take a day off without being called for help.

Anyway, back to me earning 9k. The average property in Cape Town, SA costs R1.7m. That is the AVERAGE. Like just for a basic looking house that probably has to be renovated completely. I don't even qualify for that. 

Digital Marketing salaries are also so low, like you'll get 16k if you're LUCKY. And even with that, you'll end up constantly working late nights and on weekends. 

In order to at least earn 30k you really need to specialize in something like Biochemistry or Software Engineering or whatever else.

1521,Have you ever watched capitalist greed destroy something before your eyes?,"I ask because I am currently experiencing it and would like to hear others stories.

Here's mine:

For several years I worked at a residential treatment facility for mentally ill and at risk youth(dream job, btw). 60+ hours a week working with ill/violent youth until my body said no more and I ended up with a pinched nerve that had the entire left half of my body numb for weeks.

I quit this year, at the start of the pandemic, and found what I thought would be a nice, cushy desk job to get me through the year of end times. I even thought the company itself wasn't half bad! Small, local company providing health care supplies via delivery. Started by best friends, no one is rich, everyone seems happy and culture is nice and chill. Welp, a week after I start, they announce their 'merge' (fucking buy-out, just say it) by a huge national company.

It took them less than a month to begin polluting everything on a terrifying scale. What made the original company successful: Good time off, decent hours/raises, fast systems to process things, no automated phone systems, and not hunting down folks for copays.

The larger company, has systematically: Made all of the phone lines automated(so that they can record every single thing), which is bad for the elderly calling in. Changed all of the time off/pay scales, planning on increasing/changing hours, so much mandatory overtime, very poor handling of covid, changing the operating system to slower PC's and extremely inefficient programs(Takes me 5 minutes in the new system to do something that takes about 30 seconds in the old) which is all to ensure that nothing can be done but those systems. No music, no google, nothing, Lockers where we are to lock up all of our personal affects(especially cell phones), and signing of papers that say you are to have no expectation of privacy while on property, they can search your car, your bag, your pockets. If you are found to have a personal item on you, you're fired. If you refuse, you're fired. But the real kicker, the worst of the worst, they HUNT DOWN co-payments, BEFORE THE PRODUCTS EVEN LEAVE THE WAREHOUSE. I had an elderly woman call in because she was being hounded for the copay for something that had not even been looked at by the warehouse yet. Guess how much it was? 0.08. That's right, 8 cents. Hunting down grandma for 8CENTS. and if she doesn't pay it? She can't get her medical supplies anymore. Because of the way this company operates, the CEO makes $369 AN HOUR. 

I hate it, and I'm pissed it happened and I'm disgusted at this greed. I just wanted to vent about this and see what others have experienced similarly. Did you do anything to change it? Personally, I've started putting 0 on their estimated costs. It states it's not a bill, it has to go through insurance first, and they will get their actual bill later from insurance, so I'm not lying to them, but it keeps the money grubbers at the big company from hounding them immediately.",False,jmumly,Hannibal5545,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jmumly/have_you_ever_watched_capitalist_greed_destroy/,49,1
1522,"Mirror, mirror on the wall: Who is the worst ""LinkedIn Influencer"" of them all?","Hey guys, hope you're all doing well and staying safe. This is a throwaway account, because I don't want to be identified and traced back for professional reasons. Warning: rant coming up.

The answer to the question posed above is Jonathan Tesser. I'm sure you guys have seen him floating around on LinkedIn, the whole ""VP of Insights &amp; Analytics"" thing at NYC &amp; Co. The ""Career Whisperer for Young Professionals"" dude. But why? I'll tell you about my friends' experience with him: not only does he post shitty, condescending crap on his LinkedIn, he is a narcissist that makes passive aggressive comments about people and insults them.

A couple days ago, one of my friends called me, crying. They had just gotten off the phone with him after they talked about a potential internship opportunity doing some marketing thing. They eventually want to go into a more technical field, and currently have 2 other gigs going on, more closely related to the long term career path they want to go down: engineering and data science. After asking a couple questions about the position, my friend decides the project isn't right for them, and politely tries to decline, saying that they want to go into a different field instead of marketing, perhaps they could recommend someone that might be more interested? They also mention that they'd have to split up their time between their current internship and his project if they were to work for him. He gets mad at this statement and says that wouldn't be possible. What the fuck? How else are you supposed to pay the bills? Does he know that $15 an hour for 20-25 hours a week doesn't cover living expenses? Anyway, usually employers say okay, move on to the next candidate, this person wasn't the right fit for the project. 

This guy gets angry as fuck and literally blows up on them. He says, and I quote, **""Here's some constructive feedback. You know, I know you're a young professional and all, but you mentioning X field makes it come off as if you're saying you're too good for the project. You really shouldn't say that to someone of MY stature.""** Then he proceeds to dangle the full-time offer in front of them, saying stuff like **""you know, my original plan was to have you on as an intern and bring you on full time, which I have the power to do, but I guess that's not possible anymore. Next time, you should just say you aren't interested in the project.""**

Did they literally not just tell you that they weren't interested in your stupid project? How the fuck is a young professional telling you about their long term career trajectory offensive to you? So what if they want to do something different than marketing? Furthermore, your title as VP of Insights &amp; Analytics indicates your responsibility and wisdom. It's not a fucking weapon you can use to terrorize young professionals and threaten to blacklist them. Why is he even acting like NYC &amp; Co is some prestigious company to work for anyway? Young grads would rather work for companies like Amazon, Google, Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, whatever. But guess what, this isn't even the worst part. **He then goes on and makes a PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE POST about their conversation on his PUBLIC PROFILE, with 80,000+ followers**, saying that **""young professionals these days don't appreciate new opportunities, it's not a good look.""** Wasn't he the one that said my friend splitting up their time between their current work and his project wouldn't be possible, and he wouldn't want that? Then he proceeds to talk shit with all his other colleagues and it's obvious he's talking about my friend, saying shit like ""this literally happened to me today, I can't believe people don't appreciate my efforts to help them."" So let me get this straight -- my friend turned you down because they want to go down a different path, and you proceed to belittle, mock, insult, and imply that you'll blacklist them, pull away the full-time offer during a fucking PANDEMIC where fresh grads are already struggling, and then make a petty, public post about your private conversation with them? 

What makes me angry is that my friend is way too fucking nice to stand up for themselves or say no to people. This weird ass dude tried selling them his ""analyst"" program when they first met that doesn't actually teach you anything (no technical coding shit or anything). It supposedly teaches you how to ""communicate effectively as a data analyst"". He called them things like ""mister/missy"" as well. This makes me mad because he literally doesn't know my friend already has it hard enough as it is. They're a low-income, first gen person of color, the child of immigrant parents. They also have a hard time with self-confidence and really asserting themselves in the workplace. My friend literally told me they just thanked him for his constructive criticism and ended the call. 

It's already fucking hard enough breaking into the industry as a fresh grad during a goddamn pandemic, not to mention my friend already struggles with their confidence, just for a douchebag like this guy to shit all over them and threaten blacklisting them. It's just so disheartening to see something like this happen after I've seen them try and grow out of their shell for so many years, and just when they've begun to branch out, something like this happens. I did my best to try and reassure them that this interaction wasn't their fault, it's his. I've spoken to a couple of my other friends that go to the same school, and guess what, this isn't even the first time this has happened. Whenever someone disagrees with this guy or gives constructive criticism, he threatens to blacklist them and wields his title around like it's some sword he can use to ruin young professionals' careers, just because they don't bend to his will. Other people that want to do data science have warned me about what a douche he is, but after hearing my friend's story and listening to them cry for hours because he literally destroyed their confidence about what they want to do makes me fucking furious. Does he even know how many therapy sessions my friend has attended to build the confidence to go out there and face the job search with a brave face? Does he know how hard my friend has had to struggle to get where they are today, recovering from narcissistic abuse and trauma from their parents? I have literally watched my friend struggle and cry about difficult courses, paying rent on time, dealing with anxiety about the future, competing with their peers, pleasing their parents and whatnot. Then again I wouldn't expect a narcissistic fuck-face like him to understand these challenges.

Young professionals are naïve and still figuring things out, yes, but they're not your fucking punching bag that you can just take your anger out on when they put their foot down and disagree with you. They're just as deserving of respect as anyone else.

Hey Jonathan, if you're reading this, you Mr. Potato-Head looking fuck, I suggest you stop threatening to blacklist young professionals, especially female / first-gen / low-income students from the industry. Word spreads quickly and you will find that this is a small world -- people find out about these interactions, one way or another. And if I ever see you on the streets of New York, I'll fucking clock you.

**tl;dr Jonathan Tesser. Not only does he make shitty LinkedIn posts, a portion of them are petty posts about actual people. On top of that, he tries to sell everyone his weird ass ""analyst"" program. Finally, when you disagree with him, he threatens to blacklist you on top of mocking and belittling you.**",False,jo2gg0,throwaway1093483,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jo2gg0/mirror_mirror_on_the_wall_who_is_the_worst/,1,1

1534,FUCK ZANKOU CHICKEN,"FUCK ZANKOU CHICKEN

So, I recently got hired at a place called Zankou Chicken. It’s a LA restaurant chain that sells Armenian food and is still privately owned by the original family, so it’s not a franchise like McDonalds. They hired me for a new location at Huntington Beach, and had me train at their Anaheim location. I worked there as a cashier and on the first day, they told me I needed to be a little faster, but said everything else was good. Then, on my fifth day, they told me to meet them at a time I was not originally scheduled for. I came in and the manager named JOE told me to go to the balcony to talk to these two ladies from HR. I came outside and they told me that they were “severing their relationship with me effective immediately” because I was “lacking enthusiasm” and “didn’t engage in the training process by asking enough questions”. I asked them to be more specific because their answer was vague and they told me the exact same bs. Then, I asked to grab my stuff and they wouldn’t even let me and made me wait on the balcony while they grabbed it. They came outside, gave me my stuff, and I tried telling them I needed to stay since I needed my ride to come pick me up and they wouldn’t let me. I was then forced to go outside and wait for my ride, feeling utterly humiliated. Later I found out that two other people who were hired with me got fired for bs reasons also. One was for not asking enough questions and the other was for letting the lines get too long. This is a horrible thing to do because they preach being a family friendly environment and allowing mistakes to happen, but then fire almost half of us while we are barely in the training process. This was also very out of the blue since none of us actually did anything wrong. This is the Huntington Beach location that just opened. Also imma be ranting about several supervisors in a separate section, so ignore the next section if you don’t care to read anymore:

Joe, some manager dude: Don’t know why he has the fucking audacity to say I didn’t learn the menu fast enough when his dumbass still has trouble using the register. Also, he’s a stupid bald ass kiss ass who would bend over backwards if anyone has a slightly intimidating tone. This man should have been fired before me if y’all want your employees to be so damn perfect.

Elia: She’s so fucking rude and should not be training new people. The way she trained me was probably the reason why I couldn’t remember the menu that well. She treated me like a child even though I’m a grown ass woman who would whoop her ass if she didn’t have kids. She has a fucking attitude and does not deserve to be in the position she is. She also said she transferred because she wanted to start new, which is code for “Everyone at my old job hates my guts because I can’t treat people with respect.”

Erica, a shift lead: same position as Elia. She wasn’t too bad, but wasn’t great at training. No strong opinions, but she she shouldn’t be in a supervisor position after only three months.

Georgina, scheduling: She handles the scheduling and is so bad at that. I kept being told to go to Anaheim last minute when I work at HB. This lady should just drop off the face of the earth because she can’t do her one fucking job right.

1553,I haven’t been working for the past month and a half and I’m dreading going back,"At the end of September I quit my job to move to a different city with my friend. Since then I’ve been making money mostly just off of creative pursuits. It’s not good money but it got me through the last month. Unfortunately I have about 5k work of debt to pay off and my bills still need paid, so I had to get an actual job to be sure I could get this stuff paid. 

I fucking hate it. At the moment I’m about to start working at dollar general because my friends fiancé was able to get me a job after I had applied everywhere without hearing anything back. At the beginning of December I’ll be working at walmart with the friend I live with so I can make better money (I failed their stupid assessment the first couple times and have to wait for it to reset). 

I’ll only be working part time, about 20 hours a week. My first real day is Monday and I want nothing more than to find a way out. After being off work for so long I can’t imagine getting back into the routine. If I didn’t have any debt I would probably find a way to make my own money continuing a creative pursuit but it’s just not reasonable at the moment. 

I don’t really know what the point of this post is. I just really hate the work world and our capitalist society.

This doesn’t apply to him either, I know plenty of people my age group (24-30) who can’t save money. At all. Because they work, pay bills, and are so mentally drained that they just sleep.

Giving up 5/7th of your life is a clearly irrational, unhealthy and unintelligent way to spend your life. People consider those who refuse to work to be ""losers,"" but it's the opposite. People who willfully give up nearly their entire lives in a post scarcity society are the real losers. They can't even figure out simple truths and are afraid to self sacrifice for the freedom of all. They will claim to live in ""free countries"" when in reality their countries will gladly, in a heartbeat, let them die and suffer if they don't live their lives in a very particular way. 

It's almost like giving up your entire life to do unnecessary tasks over and over again prevents people from gaining wisdom or something.

To there's this new cashier at work and she insists on taking a lunch even though its unpaid and
were superunderstaffed and don't really have time for the 2 breaks as it is. Any advice on dealing
with this? Its hard to get everything done and we want to keep her because she’s an awesome

workload then its just a vicious cycle. Am a manager and I don't even take any breaks anymore

getting done like they should be. Sorry I just needed to vent. Thank you

1583,Resigned from job after 1 year and 3 months. Team Director didn't even say bye to me lol.,"Hi all first time posting here, using a throwaway even though i've been following this subreddit for a really long time. As the title says, i resigned from my job last month, and been living off savings since then (not sure how much longer i can go on for). 

I'm 27 y/o and every single job i've ever had I end up quitting, my mind can't fucking take it. It's waking up, starting at a screen all day, come home with no time to do anything and mentally fucking exhausted, have dinner, sleep and repeat. I always put in my best and try to add as much value to the team as possible. I have a long history of depression and anxiety, and the only way i can see myself ever working in that same environment again is getting heavily medicated and be so mentally out of it that I'd need to be put in a BS position where i don't really do anything but stare at a wall. But then what is the point of living like that? That'd be 40 hours a week of feeling miserable and useless.

I just resigned from my job after only 2 months, and i am absolutely done with working in corporate/office environments. I got a really great offer with high salary and benefits, but after I think the second week I realised I was in hell. It was just impossible to do this, i was starting to drink a lot after work just to cope because the feeling of sleeping and knowing i was gonna wake up to the same fucking routine every day was some of the worst pain i've ever had. I mustered the courage and I told them i was gonna take time off and do something else, so i gave them 2 week notice and my last day was mid last month. Big boss didn't even talk to me after that.  

&amp;#x200B;

I don't ever want to see another fucking excel or powerpoint sheet ever again. Not one more BS team meeting. Not one more ""Fun Team Day-Off"" where we have to do team building exercises. We have all become slaves to this system that is giving us the bare minimum to just be able to have food and shelter. I had a very good salary compared to most of the people, but what is the point? It is impossible to buy an apartment or a house where I live, so only option is to move the fuck out of here and commute 1+ hr to work every morning and 1+ hr to work every night. I would forever be renting, paying some fucking bald boomer 50% of my salary for a small 1 bedroom place for myself, while he's chilling in the Caribbean drinking all day, while adding absolutely no value to ANYTHING.

1596,"I’m about to quit my job. My boss just spent $125,000 on a piece of equipment that only I can operate.","Gonna keep things kinda vague for privacy sake.

I kill myself for my current employer. I have by far the most responsibility out of all of my co-workers. I found out a few months back that I was the least-paid employee. I was livid when I found out and confronted my boss. She begrudgingly gave me a raise.

A month ago she spent $125,000 on a piece of equipment, and I was the only one trained on it. I was offered no compensation for learning how to operate the thing, I wasn’t even offered a thank you. It gives me massive anxiety to operate it, and I have nobody I can turn to for advice except for a 1-800 number. I also operate another very large piece of equipment, that only I was trained on.

I most likely have a new job lined up, I’ll be having a meeting about it early this week. If things work out, I’ll be putting in my two-weeks notice this week.

I don’t know what she’s gonna do. The equipment I operate is very very niche, and I don’t know if there’s anyone in my town that can operate both of them. When I leave, she will have two very expensive paperweights.

My heart starts racing when I think about the conversation that I’ll have to have with my boss. I’m super bad with confrontation. But I am so over being taken advantage of.

I'm not the 'pat yourself on the back' type. I don't go to my team or management and scream out ""Look what I did today!"" Every time I successfully do what I was told to do.

But I cannot take five minutes to make a couple fixes on photoshop before I send it off to get printed? He never asks about anything in my life, I'm a fucking pawn. And because of the life I'm settled into (my mortgage, my car payment) I have to take this right up the ass. It's disgusting to me that this happens.  It's also disgusting how disenfranchised he is with this place. Never answers phones, manages smaller issues, talks to clients. Nothing.

1617,I feel anxious cos I don’t see a balance.,"I’m sorry; I know things like this get posted often. But I just needed a place to vent.




I can’t get my head around the idea of how I’m supposed to find balance in my life. I want to give my mental and physical health a chance to thrive, which involves about an hour or so walk each day, and time to cook healthy and good meals. (Yes, I know food prep helps ease some time... lol.)
I also want to sleep 8.5-9 hours. So let’s say that’s 11 hours per day already.




Then getting ready for work and commuting there takes about 1.5-2 hours. Getting home, another hour. So let’s say 3 more hours; 14 total.




Work itself = 8 hours or so. That’s 22 hours.





How am I supposed to get anything else done, including maintaining a relationship (let alone seeing friends, doing laundry and other life admin that I might need to do on weekdays, etc.)?





I feel so stressed thinking about it, and I don’t see how it adds up.




I’ve been thinking that maybe I could get a 6hr/day job, OR a job where I am take 1 day a week off, to allow me to get life admin done, and cope a little better with not always having the best balance on other days.




It just feels like it’s so unfair, and I know I have it good compared to many others!! &lt;3





Just shaking my head a bit. I know there’s probably an answer out there, but right now I feel a bit overwhelmed and stressed. :(

Grocery store workers, janitors, cashiers, restaurant workers, etc are literally the backbone of capitalism. My argument is that capitalism causes and encourages poverty, more people on the bottom are more people to profit on. However a lot of people say it helps poverty rates? Am I missing something?

I also think this can apply to education, as more people acquire a college level (higher rank in society) education, it creates a dropping value for a college level education therefore lowering that persons rank. Seeing someone with a degree working for minimum wage or a minimum wage job isn't that rare now a days. 

In conclusion if more people start acquire a higher salary or more qualifications, the bar is raised higher because the system can't sustain that many higher ranking people before their salaries drop.  It seems almost impossible to have everyone earning a high wage (100k+) under capitalism, higher wages just means prices will increase making the 100k people be on the bottom rung.

Anyone have thoughts? I haven't found that much info in favor of my opinion :/

1661,"Hopefully, I Can Quit My Job Come Next Year - My Boss Is Awful, And I'm Exhausted.","I normally wouldn't recommend playing armchair psychologist, but my boss ticks every box when it comes to a narcissistic personality disorder. I know a lot do, and it's why they're ruthless business people. He cannot empathise with others, and his world revolves around him and money - nothing else. Nothing is ever his fault, and he's manipulative. He's just an awful man and a terrible boss. 

Like so many others, the way my boss has handled COVID has been disgusting, and I'm ready to leave. I'm in the UK and come Thursday, we are back under a national lockdown that is expected to end early December. Government guidelines clearly state that those who can work from home should, and only businesses that cannot close should remain open. Can my advertising agency close? Of course, it can. We can all log into our emails and work from home. At the very least, the staff can be cut back with only the creative departments entering the building to use their computers with specific software. Still, it is possible for everyone to work from home. The government has told us this is what should happen.

Does my boss care? No. He doesn't like being at home (his family hate him which is not surprising), and he is pathetically dependant on his PA who is vulnerable due to her heart condition, but he doesn't give a toss. Earlier in the year, I was lucky that I was allowed to work from home, and was then furloughed (a UK government scheme) but my employer abused government schemes, and he brought in staff to work in the office full-time while paying them less which wasn't allowed. Now, he's going to do it again. I'm looking into ways to report him anonymously because I'm so disgusted, although I'm hoping he'll be caught by local authorities. He'll be in legal trouble if he is but I couldn't care less as he has zero respect and consideration for his staff.

Next year, when things are less crazy, I hope I can afford to quit my job and either go elsewhere or take a different direction completely. I've been meaning to save up and travel (and look into how I can travel as ethically as possible). My boss is a disgusting, selfish person. If I could afford it now, I'd quit immediately and leave my employer in the lurch. I'd feel sorry for my colleagues but to hell with it, it wouldn't be my issue. So, hopefully, in 2021, things can change. Anyone else have any plans? Have you or you also planning to seriously quit your job?

Sorry for the rant. I just needed to get this off my chest somehow. One face is that we don't owe terrible bosses anything. Take from them what you need and what you can get then go. Our life doesn't end once we quit our jobs.",False,jn84mc,eppydeservedbetter,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jn84mc/hopefully_i_can_quit_my_job_come_next_year_my/,7,1
1662,How can I get back at my employer for some shitty moves?,"I work for a contract security company and, lately, they’ve been making some pretty shitty moves and fucking over everyone at my assigned post.

First, they upped the pay to $14 when we did temperature screenings. Apparently, it was supposed to be a permanent raise that would’ve happened around the time I started and not just because of that. When we stopped, it went back down to $12.50 with about as much notification as the raise (answer- none). This pissed off a lot of other guards and a few have quit just because of that. It would’ve been the last straw for me *if* it wasn’t such a piss easy job and I can get away with a lot being on third shift.

Second, I’ve found out that they’ve purposely been short staffing my post and sending one of our guys over to another location on short notice frequently. This presents a problem in this industry because, in a worst case scenario, they can try and force a person to stay for 16 hours if relief isn’t available or calls off at the last minute. The whiny shit bags over at scheduling have tried to get me to do doubles many times, but I’ve always put my foot down and said I’m not available. Sure, time and a half is nice, but I’m not going to put my health on the line because scheduling can’t do their fucking job half the time. As long as there are two people at my post, the place can function- it’s usually just the third person that’s missing or a fill in running behind. Even our supervisor is aware of the bullshit and tells us to just go if we have to.


I’ve been told I’m a great employee (despite what little I actually have to do at my post), and my direct supervisor has been surprisingly understanding. It’s corporate I have the issue with. I still want to find ways to fuck with them other than just doing the bare minimum and taking every opportunity to hop on YouTube and my Switch (idiots haven’t figured out that you really can’t control what we do in the office when there’s no cameras monitoring- I even checked around for hidden ones. There isn’t shit or else I would’ve gotten written up ages ago).

1663,What was the job that changed everything for you?,"The first full time job I had (before that I was always working two part time jobs) was the job that changed my perspective completely on working hard for a company. I was 24 and landed a job as assistant manager at a hotel. I had lots of experience working in this field prior and doing some team leadership roles, but I’d never been management before.

I had a huge realization when I quit that job because I had been a stressed out wreck with no life for 2 years, taking my stress and work home with me, sacrificing weekends and nights and not taking care of myself.... for nothing. I literally have nothing to show for it now. I didn’t even make any real friends there. I vowed to change after that.

I always define very clear boundaries now at work. I don’t do favors or try to kiss ass any more than is absolutely necessary and I don’t get stressed about what’s happening. I have a better sense of perspective now. Ultimately, it’s not my entire life. Success at this job doesn’t define me as a human being. it’s just something I’m doing right now, and like everything else, it will pass eventually too.",False,jpes48,stressernotafighter,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jpes48/what_was_the_job_that_changed_everything_for_you/,5,1
