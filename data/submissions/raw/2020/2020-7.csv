4,"Considering quitting job I got in April, kinda long story","Some background, I was homeless in February, it was a long term situation where I was trapped in a situation where I was working for free. It was so bad that I exhausted myself into a dangerous level of depression. I then escaped because I got really really lucky and someone another friend knew was able to help me move. I moved in with a friend. I have no bills, no rent, no pressure, in fact everyone just says do what I need to do.

I was hired in April.

Hazard pay was cut in May. I've been making almost nothing after commute since then, and I've also been holding off in case a stimulus bill was passed, just to see if hazard pay situation would change. I don't have much confidence in that now, and I'm really burned out not even by the job itself but the commute and the exhaustion I feel as if I haven't been able to relax or enjoy anything. It's so much time to waste per week to not see any gains. I have to borrow money in fact to be able to maintain this job.

I can't keep doing this and honestly? At this point even if we got hazard pay back, I wouldn't feel that much more motivated. The damage is done. That's what decision makers don't realize here. You can't repair something if you broke it too much. Kroger fucked up. Majorly. And it's impacted me especially hard in specific ways. 

During this time I've been drained of so much energy I can barely get up the strength to clean my room in one go. I want to clean. I want to do things. I just cannot make myself do it no matter how much I want to. I'm frequently late because of this. I'm considering calling off tomorrow just because I have a turnaround shift the next day and I don't know if I'll be able to make myself last another week if I do that. Basically I'm trying to conserve energy where I can and they want more of me. 

What I learned while being homeless doesn't apply in this ""working"" world either. I did work while I was homeless btw. I worked my ass off, for free. I am certainly not ""lazy"".

But being in a paid job, I've found that I've inherited these old fears and guilty feelings around work that I used to have, and I know those are not good motives. I know I'm more intelligent and resourceful than I'm really giving myself credit for. I should trust my abilities and the support I have right now... 

But the greater fear, more than not having money, is also something I learned while being homeless: one small decision can ruin your life for a long time, if not, forever, unless someone interferes. 

So I'm afraid to make this decision and yet I know also that not making a decision can have the exact same affect of making the ""wrong"" one. It can be even worse because the people who WILL make the decisions for your, will not care about your interests. 

I think honestly my partner has a lot to do with me feeling pressured to make things happen as well. I'm ambitious normally but, I definitely don't feel like he realizes that I need a Break from the survival mode and that I really am never gonna heal my brain if I continue this work schedule. And my brain. It's very important. 

I need my wits about me if I'm going to be trying to make it without a job, and I need a break. 

Anyways this is pretty rambly, but I think I'm just looking for someone to tell me I'm not crazy here or making some big mistake.",False,hza1vd,mutualaidowl,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hza1vd/considering_quitting_job_i_got_in_april_kinda/,3,1

11,Reminiscing on life as a child.,"Here I am, currently quarantined at home due to taking a covid test yesterday. I have been sick since Saturday but ironically I am feeling almost 100% today. I am sure it was just the flu, but I took a test just to be safe. So instead of enjoying my free week off of work as I would as a kid while being out of school, here is what runs through my mind nearly every moment of the day:

1.) I am missing out on a week of pay. While the pay is not extravagant by any means whatsoever, it‚Äôs still a week of pay. It mentally hurts to sit here all day feeling fine and knowing I could be making some money, but I‚Äôm not. 

2.) Are my co-workers and boss annoyed/upset with me? I wish I was the type of guy that doesn‚Äôt care about what others think and perform all the same no matter how my work relations are, but I‚Äôm not. The moment I start to second guess or wonder if my performance is annoying a co-worker or boss, my performance starts to take an even steeper dive to shit and my anxiety in the workplace sky rockets. And I‚Äôm afraid my absence during this week will lead to something of the sort. 

3.) ‚ÄúI need to be doing something, I can‚Äôt just be sitting here.‚Äù Holy shit I hate this. I can‚Äôt just sit down and relax, and I absolutely hate that this work-worshipping society has molded me to be like this. I can‚Äôt believe I literally can‚Äôt allow myself to just sit down, accept that I‚Äôm stuck at home for a few days, and relax. 

And amongst all this, I think back to how I felt to when I got sick when I was in school as a child. I would get so excited I might as well have not been sick anymore. I would be able to lounge around the house all day not worrying about a thing, feel content with a parent taking care of me, and get even more excited when my sickness wouldn‚Äôt let up by the end of the day granting me another day off. I wish I could feel like this again when I am given the opportunity to be off of work. Work has been so brainwashed into my head I literally start going insane when I am taken away from it, and I absolutely despite that.",False,hzpj1s,WhatDo-I-DoNow,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hzpj1s/reminiscing_on_life_as_a_child/,2,1

Fortunately I am able to live the rest of my life without working (I hope) so financial burdens aren't an issue for me.

21,Been unemployed for 2 months and will have to start looking for work,"I have been unemployed for two months and its been so amazing, as many here will attest to. I have had such a great time to enjoy my hobbies.

I've read so many books, played so many videogames and just chilled so much. Of course I'm still worried about Covid and my elderly parents. Like it's not been a stress free period of my life, but much better than it has been for a long time. I kind of feel guilty cos so many are struggling in today's world.

But starting August I'm gonna have to start applying for jobs. I was supposed to start at the beginning of this month but I decided to give myself an extra month of freedom. Just thinking about applying for jobs is making me sick. I hate the fact that I will have to be working soon or a face some sort of disadvantage if I don't due to a gap in my employment history in my cv. I hate that it's like this so much. I mean I've already given myself a disadvantage as it is by being unemployed for two months.

I fear I won't be able to have such freedom away from work ever again. It sickens me that I will have to look for a job. This system really needs to change because I don't see any happiness for me working.

Working life worsened my already fragile mental state. This freedom allowed me to recover somewhat by doing the things I actually locked and enjoyed. I fear that I will lose this recovery.

23,How to handle a new colleague that make a miserable job 10x worst ?,"So, I don't like my job, but I've managed to make it a little easier : a couple days a week from home,etc.

This took me weeks of negotiation and heated arguments with my boss because he hated the idea at first. I managed to make it happen by saying it would help retain people in the company ( their turnover is INSANE ). Since he was sick of productivity being halted by having to train new people all the time ( lol ) , he agreed.

*Now*, enters overzealous new freshly graduated staff member. 

She COMES TO THE OFFICE on her WFH days and boasts about it. 

Constant brown-nosing. COMPLAINS about WFH. She has a million ""ideas"" that she only voices when the boss is in the room and they land on my desk, doubling my workload : she doesn't realize that we all, the senior team, know this needs to be done but we don't say anything because we're all grossly underpaid. We do what we're asked to stay employed. That's it. 

I would brief her about how it is, but she already snitched on me on a couple minor things. The atmosphere in that office is awful. 

I can already see the boss turning around like "" see, they don't need WFH, back in the office it is"". 

So,how do I deal with her ? Do I wait until she gets f\*cked over on pay or hours ( which happened to all of us ) and opens her eyes ? 

I'm pretty sure the boss promised her the world plus she's starry eyed because it's her first job so I don't want to make it horrible for her ( which I could, I'm her direct manager) but this stuff needs to stop or she's going to ruin it for all of us.

I was told this after I had asked what he did around the facility. I made very clear that I wasn‚Äôt trying to be belligerent, but clarified that I wanted to understand what he does. After he told me, I proceeded to ask him why, since he‚Äôs on salary, that he‚Äôs at work 60+ hours a week. I wanted to know what needed to be done that couldn‚Äôt wait until Monday. 

He has a history of overworking and never being available for anything outside of work. All of this is made worse by the fact that he‚Äôs technically my father. All growing up, he was always at work and when he wasn‚Äôt, he was sleeping or yelling at my mother, sister, and I for being ‚Äúungrateful for what I do‚Äù.

I suggested that steps could be taken to make for fewer hours spent at work and more efficient processes made (obviously he‚Äôs a brown-nosing, boot-licking type). That‚Äôs when he looked me dead in the face and said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an asshole‚Äù.

It was stunning. He and I have never seen eye to eye, but this was something new. I told him that I no longer wanted to speak to him and he stormed away, muttering under his breath.

I don‚Äôt understand why he felt that that was an appropriate reaction, but for the foreseeable future, I‚Äôm not interacting with him beyond what I absolutely have to. I‚Äôm not going to his house, I‚Äôm certainly not going to subject my wife to him, and I don‚Äôt care if he apologizes.

How employers can simply ‚Äúfire someone for no reason at all or for the slightest misdemeanor or mistake‚Äù, yet if an employee were to quit their job, they‚Äôre expected, sometimes even required to give a two week notice, having to politely explain their departure or positively reflect on their work experience, despite whether or not they actually liked working there.

How difficult it is to receive healthcare. I am a massage therapist, and our main objective at our job is to promote health and wellness to our clientele, yet we don‚Äôt receive free or even reduced healthcare from our employers. 

If a manager or higher up is cheating, lying, talking shit, etc they are less likely/takes longer for them to be fired than compared to employees.

31,Had to get rid of this...,"Hello antiworkers 

I live in a small ‚Äúrich‚Äù country in Europe. We have one of the best healthcare systems in the world; we have minimum 4 weeks paid vacations and paid sick days. However, let me tell you something, it does not make it better. 

I am 22 years young and I have
already lost all joy in life and it started 5 years ago, when I left school. 

I did not complain about my first jobs (I still hated every single one), because it was the first time I was earning my own money and everybody else was doing it. 
Then I started in the office of a production company. I stayed there for 3 years and it was during these 3 years, where it got worse. 
I realized, that the only thing I was doing besides working 45 hours, 5 days a week for a minimum wage and always doing shit I‚Äôm not passionate or even care about, was playing call of duty, resting from work and going out on the weekends.

Every morning I got mad and punched into my chair because I knew I was going to throw another 10 hours of my life away. I started hating my coworkers bc they were just a bunch of zombies. They think that working 5 days is the purpose of our lifes and if you don‚Äôt think the same way, you‚Äôre just a lazy, pathetic human being. I had to stay at home for 3 weeks after a surgery and when I came back, the first thing they asked me was: ‚ÄúDid you miss us? You‚Äôre happy to be back right? After 2 weeks off work, you get bored anyway, right?‚Äù. 
I wanted to punch every one in the face. I realized, these people are so braindead, they can‚Äôt imagine a life without going to their 9-5 job. I saw my parents, my friends acting and thinking the same way. I got depressed by the fact I should do this this shit for +40 years. I lost some friends bc of it but I still managed to get through the day, looking forward to Fridays. Until‚Ä¶

After 3 years, at the end of january, I left and took 2 months off, just for me before I would start in a new company. Covid came and gave me another extra month. So I had 3 months to do almost everything I wanted. To be honest, I didn‚Äôt do that much due to the lack of money but I never felt so fucking good in my entire life. I went to the gym in the morning, always cooked for my family, played cod, cleaned the house, if I was tired I could take a nap, going outside into the nature, smoke some weed etc etc‚Ä¶. I was free and you know‚Ä¶ just fucking happy. I finally enjoyed life after a long time of anger issues and signs of depression. 

Then, it was Monday. The 3 months were over and I knew that I had to start this shit again. During the first month, when I was coming home, I always went straight to my bedroom and punched into my desk, sometimes cried. I felt something strange in my chest, I thought I was getting a heart attack. I was so sad and angry at the same time‚Ä¶
 I had to throw up every morning and couldn‚Äôt eat much until 8pm. My whole body felt sick I can‚Äôt describe the feeling, like it was deep inside of me.

I never went to the gym again. I lost all my progress from the last 2 years, I‚Äôm the skinny guy I swore I would never be again. I started smoking again, even more than in the past. I don‚Äôt enjoy music or movies anymore, I don‚Äôt want to cook anymore, I barely speak to my family, lost most of my friends. I was a happy, extrovert and healthy young man and now‚Ä¶. Always inside the house, tired to do anything because I know the next day or next week is gonna be the same 9h shit every day. 40 years.
 
Gaming is the only hobby I can try to monetize. I‚Äôm just too tired and sad to start anything new and if that youtube/ twitch thing won‚Äôt work, I see dark for my future. I have a great family but they won‚Äôt understand it. Maybe I‚Äôm just too weak and a lil pussy idk‚Ä¶I‚Äôm seeing myself ending as a drug addict‚Ä¶

36,How did you realize ...,"How (or when) did you realize that the system of work we live in is just not made for you. I realized it quite late. 

When I was a child, life was kinda great. I have been told that I was an active, creative child with a lot of interests. And I do remember that time with joy. 

But things already went darker when I got into elementary school. Suddenly there were schedules to be followed, tasks to be done (and later on evaluated) and also my parents were putting quite some pressure on me - that I would need to be a good student from the start in order to ""make it in life"". 

So I put myself under a lot of pressure and suffered from severe anxiety early on in my ""career"". But I was successful. I did well and ended up in what would be comparable to College (not my school-system). In the meantime my anxiety got worse, my parents divorced and things turned out to get really ugly. In all that mess I developed severe OCD. There was only one thing I focused on that could save me: I was a good student and would ... ""make it in life"". So I focused on school and missed out on a lot of fun (partys, girls, trips, etc). 

I was immensly fascinated by people like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett at that time. Little did I know... Its sort of cringeworthy from todays point of view.

When I graduated I was finally done with my dull, grey life. I was exhausted. Today you would call that a Burn Out. There has been no joy in my life ... but my grades were top notch. Hurray. Thats when I found out that something went terribly wrong. This could just not be it. My friends seemed happy and my life was a mess. So what did I do? Study. I literally started reading books from Dale Carnegie, Erich Fromm and such in order to ""learn"" what life was all about and how to feel... happy.

But I was still sort of in line with the system. I developed critical thinking and taking care of myself (starting to lose weight, workout, spend my time with different things). As University luckily turned out to be a relatively easy experience for me I got plenty of spare time to spent. And I used that time to educate myself out of the box. And it was great. And I came to the conclusion that I have been indoctrinated by the system and that I lost a lot of years and missed out on so many things. That was when I woke up. Step one: being aware of ones condition. Step two: ? 

To cut things shorter: Right now I am sitting in a 40+ hour per week office job. I am appreciated by my coworkers but the pressure is high and my free time is very limited. I am fully aware of the ""sheep"" life I live - like so many other people. And this awareness has changed me over the years. I am no longer a people pleaser and a ""Yes""-Man. But I am still there, following rules, commuting, living for the weekend. 

And I did not find a solution, yet. You can bet I did read some books ;) on how to do that but nope ... no clue so far.

I'm also wondering that without the bullshit jobs people would be able to actually get paid a decent amount but that might just be wishful thinking.

Anyways if I get the career I'll get paid more and they can't force me to work overtime, which is cool, but the thing that bums me out is the fact that if I do get it, that means I would just have a a pretty boring and mundane life, 8 hours everyday 5 days a week, for the next 40 or more  years until I can retire

We got new ownership who made massive cuts to our perks and benefits and started hiring on friends and giving them preferential treatment. I was supposed to be done in 2 days but I just couldn't take it anymore. 

The second I got in there I was immediately under fire by the bosses, the place was busy as all hell, and my coworkers are just stressed and taking it out on eachother. I was there for 24 minutes, had a panic attack, took a second to breathe and think in the bathroom, did a lil more work, then just slipped out the back after a few more minutes. I got in my car, waited for a green light and then just fucking booked it out of the lot and towards the highway; home, freedom, happiness.

You know that scene in Breaking Bad where Jesse smashes the gates in the car and is crying from joy? That was how I felt. I didn't realized how bogged down and trapped I felt in that job. I was killing myself and all for what? To make fucking burgers for ungrateful customers, get yelled at while I put my blood sweat and tears into the job, and get laughed at when I ask about a raise? No. Absolutely not. I deserve way better than that and I am never going back to that god awful establishment. 

I used to have nightmares where I was at work and it was busy. That's literally it. I wasn't naked or on fire or anything, just at work doing my job while it was busy. I'd wake up feeling like I was gonna throw up, my heart would be going so fast.

2. You need to make the word out . You will have to keep explaining to potential customers why they should pick you from the countless others who also provide similar services to yours.
3. You also need to convince them that the money you are asking for is fair enough while trying to undercut your competition.
4. Some clients simply refuse to pay or not pay in time . It sucks having to spend a lot of your own money on a clients project who does not pay in time putting you in a financial constraint , slowing down other projects.
5. The razor thin margins you get are supposed to pay for food , taxes , child care, medical care business e.t.c e.t.c. You could take out a loan trying to prop up your business but success isn't guranteed unlike the further debt spiral you put yourself in.

49,18 years old and recently fired: My thoughts on work,"My mother was over an HR department in a plant that makes houses. I was out of work and COVID was just then hitting so my mom offered me an office job answering phones, filing papers, etc.

It didn‚Äôt have the greatest pay but it was an office job with air conditioning and easy work so I couldn‚Äôt complain. If I‚Äôm being honest, the company was in rough shape. The owner was a mess, people were worried about the pandemic, and the amount of calls I‚Äôve gotten about someone else in the office not answering their phones was enough to make me hate my job itself. But regardless, it was a pretty nice place with pretty nice people...then we got sold to a competitor.

I was there for about 3 months when it happened and it happened in the middle of the day with no warning to anyone. Suddenly, we all had to ‚Äúwork for our jobs‚Äù and not even the higher ups were safe. It was shocking but I knew enough to just keep working and do what I had to do so I wasn‚Äôt worried. It was at that time that they let 2 people go (one was the owner) and told about 5 others that they had 30-60 days left. 

My mom was stressed. She‚Äôs always been a workaholic and she‚Äôs never been fired before. She told me to pick up the pace so that we didn‚Äôt get the axe, but I knew that they pretty much had predetermined who was staying and who was leaving as soon as they walked through the door. My mom started getting comfortable with their people and their system of doing things, so we figured we would be safe. We were so wrong.

Yesterday, they fired both of us. No warning, no heads up, just let us go in one day. The reasoning was that they were basically reducing the place to bare bones and making it some side gig shithole. Now, I‚Äôm not going to lie, I couldn‚Äôt care less about my job. I‚Äôm not going to beg someone to let me waste my time stapling papers just for some cash just to be stabbed in the back a month later. However, my mom was broken. This was the first time she‚Äôd ever been fired and its like she just then realized that bosses are snakes. 

My mom already had an interview lined up for a way better position just in case something like this was to happen, but until then, we have no income and what little we do have is going to insurance, bills, etc. I don‚Äôt think that the owners are totally bad people. I believe they have their orders and they‚Äôre just doing business in their eyes. 

But that‚Äôs the problem. Every time one of these rich dickheads does ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù they put families in deep shit, especially in times like this. For anyone out there, do not let society make you be as heartless as these people. It might just be another budget cut to you, but it‚Äôs someone else‚Äôs life you‚Äôre messing with.",False,i09z8q,bruh2077,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/i09z8q/18_years_old_and_recently_fired_my_thoughts_on/,1,1

They also rely on my income, given that their combined Social Security and disability payments don't cover their rent and bills, let alone food! My main reason for staying in academia as long as I did was that as long as I was in school, we could live off of my loans and workstudy funds -- and I believed that getting paid for a fulfilling vocation was the reward of all that study. In fact, jobs in my field will either get me hated by roughly half the population of the United States, get me hated by the entire population of the United States, have barely survivable wages...or are in call centers. Inbound call centers handling things that should be done though web portals. I learned the hard way that I can't do that last one because of the sensory overload, so I figured out how to survive on barely-survivable wages. At least I wasn't making enough to have to pay off my student loans, and I figured I'd just be in debt for life. Then the pandemic happened. Those jobs either disapeared or would put me in a position where I had an unacceptable chance of getting infected and exposing my very-high-risk parents.

We've gotten this far on their payments and the EBT card I got as part of the barely-survivable-wages initiative -- even though when I stopped working, my funds got cut from that because I'm young enough to work or starve -- the largess of the local food pantry, our stimulus money, and loans from a relative who married rich. This job seemed perfect for me. My mother was right to tell me that I'm just like my father, too good for anyone who would hire me. I finally stopped arguing that I'm not, and admitted it. After all, she's the neurotypical side of the family. Given that everyone in my paternal bloodline has either high-functioning autism, ADD, or a combination of them, that I have the combination, that everyone in that bloodline has been either ""shiftless"",  ""a grifter"", ""too good to work"", ""too stupid to get a decent job"", or just constantly gets fired, and that I already have a history of being fired for reasons I can't comprehend...why should I torment myself to emulate the other side of my family, the one that honestly seems to enjoy work for its own sake? Because we need me to do so to live? That means I force myself to do something that makes me want to die in order that my parents live, but I can't die because that would kill them (nobody to get the food, nobody to cook it)... Catch-22 that's a recipe for mutual hate. We already fight about money too much.

I wasn't expecting my mother to even listen to that, let alone agree with me. In retrospect, I think it's because she had noticed my isolation-depression abating over the past few weeks, as I had discovered projects that made me feel there was hope for a better world when the pandemic eventually recedes -- and that there was a place for me in it where I could use my education for good causes rather than patching a broken system and getting yelled at for it. My crashing back into that maybe-suicidal desperation (she says it was suicidal, I say just an angry realization that I'd rather not live at all than live like that) about what was objectively the good news of having almost gotten a job gave her a glimpse of what goes on in my head. My father's view of the whole argument was along the lines of, ""Finally you see sense! Let's get to planning your future doing what you want to do, because now I know at least you'll survive this mess!"" (Not as helpful as he thought, and maybe not accurate given that I have a heart defect and may be higher-risk than my age would indicate -- but I appreciate his understanding of my mental state.)

I don't know where the rent's coming from in two months -- maybe another stimulus, maybe more from that married-rich relative, maybe I'll find a way to make money that doesn't make me want to die. The ""grifters"" always managed to live well. I'm determined to eke every bit of silver lining I can out of this horrible year -- it looks like that includes a fair chunk of finding my true self in a way the commercialized self-help business does not espouse, because there's no money in it.",False,hz4vlw,NotTryingToBeHated,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hz4vlw/im_tired_of_pretending_to_be_someone_i_cant_be/,8,1

My parents aren't the best but if I EVER say anything negative about them I'm reminded that they did me the ""service"" of teaching me to be a hard worker.

With my current employer, I used to be an engineer technician, but took a promotion to become an engineer (which I have a B.S. degree for). While I was initially happy for this opportunity, and the salary increase from about $30k to $55k was extremely nice, I‚Äôve started noticing more and more that this position may not be the right fit for me.

The new position is just overwhelming, with the amount of things they expect me to know and the overall added responsibilities. It‚Äôs just too much for me, and I‚Äôve come to dread having to work each day knowing what‚Äôs expected of me. Besides the salary being lower, I much prefer my old position of technician. The technicians are essentially helpers to the engineers, with much less overall responsibilities, which I think better suits me personally

I still have the opportunity to drop back down to my old title, but I‚Äôm torn on what to do. On the one hand, I‚Äôd much prefer just going back to being the helper and not worrying about all these added responsibilities. But on the other, it would make me feel like I‚Äôve failed with this, and going back to $30k isn‚Äôt the most ideal. I just feel stuck currently, and have no idea what I should do. Any help is much appreciated. Thanks.

TL/DR: Took a promotion to become an engineer, but realized it‚Äôs not a great fit for me.

The management has been accessible when we have issues, and tends to listen for the most part. When I started, everyone here told me how great we were treated, and there were people who had worked here for 20+ years, so I was inclined to believe them. 

Since COVID struck, things have happened that have not only rubbed me the wrong way, but have genuinely upset me. We were never allowed to work from home or have flexible schedules, but once there was a stay at home order in place, we all transitioned seamlessly to working from home. The only hiccups were with the older employees struggling with technology. I was told, that I would still have to make special trips to the office on a twice weekly basis to accommodate for one of our clients who demanded special treatment. So, I, and 4 other employees had to continue to go into the office, putting ourselves at risk, when no PPE was available for anyone. 

Then, we moved to phase 1 of reopening the office, and since I had already been going in the office since we closed, you guessed it, I was nominated to be one of the first to go back in. I have now been back in the office full time since June 1st, in an area that is now booming with COVID, and have been required to travel out of town multiple times, work on a Sunday, gotten reprimanded for being 15 minutes late, told I cannot work from home while others are still able to, gotten reprimanded for being on my phone, even though I‚Äôve been here since we closed. 

Now, here‚Äôs where I got upset. An article was published releasing all of the companies who received PPP loans in our area, my company received a $1-2 Million loan. Good for them. We‚Äôre also are an essential business, we didn‚Äôt lose hardly any revenue during the early part of the pandemic like other businesses, and maintained all of our employees. We were lucky. But, at our company wide meeting last week, we found out that no one is getting a raise this year. For the first time in company history. I get that it‚Äôs quite an expense, but due to the nature of our work, we‚Äôve all been working our asses off, and instead of a raise, you know what we got? A fucking thank you letter from the board of directors on fancy paper. 

To make it even better, we just bought a new building, and we were told working from home is done once the new building is finished, so I can‚Äôt even leverage for flexible schedule in the future when they inevitably take our bonuses away too. 

I‚Äôve worked my dick off through this only to get a thank you letter and to get yelled at for sleeping an extra fifteen minutes. I‚Äôm done giving this place 100%.",False,hz1l2e,SousVideButt,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hz1l2e/how_do_you_reconcile_with_the_fact_that_your/,10,1

It seems to me antiwork would be the best place to post for a friend. Having this basic understanding/belief would perhaps lead to better friends? I've tried posting on other subs, but come up with the same blank stares people normally do when faced with someone who is antiwork-minded.

It would honestly be a relief to start a friendship with this in common with someone.

I live in Australia, male, love to game every day, funny memes and music (Retrowave/Synth/Electronic/LORN). Like people who can roll their eyes and be sarcastic (negative even! the heresy!) and tend to care about having honest friendships.

So what can you expect? In my imagionland we message a few times back and forth and if things are looking peachy, we move our chats to Signal/Discord/Steam, then off to a whirlwind adventure where we travel the world together! No. Wait. Too soon. But you get the idea.

Earlier this year, | had the opportunity to be on an Ober ride with a very
interesting and inspiring gentleman in Melbourne, Australia.

‚ÄòA New minutes into the ride, he asks me a couple of questions about what I do and
goes on to share his journey.

He was previously the Founder of a railroad company in Northern Australia and
after working on it for 14 years, he decided to sell it For a New million and retire.

However, after a New years of living the early retired life, he experienced
something that he had never before.

Black of purpose!

He eventually decides to become an Ober driver and with his great work ethics and
unique story, he was able to become one of the top rate drivers in Melbourne
and was Ober's first preference on drivers for major Australian events.

His take on work is this:

Sa society we tend to exaggerate the retire early, get rich quick schemes, but
looking back, it's the connections we build, the good times we've had, the up and

down, and the impact we have on society, that make life worth it

Your work ethics and principles stay for life, regardless of what you do. The money
is just the product.

Most people don't realize it, until they experience it firsthand.

Enjoy the process, that's the real purpose. @

125,"My life, for $89 (before tax)","RANT 

My step dad died of non hodgkins lymphoma he was 34. I remember in one week, he recieved $50,000 ""worth"" of blood transfusions. From 18 years old, he joined the millitary. Served 10ish years before his back was ruined by falling off of a truck. 28 years old: stricken with PTSD and back pain so intense he cant move for days at a time. I have to identify myself when I enter the home because of his PTSD so I am not shot as an intruder. 30 years old: married for the first and only time, and diagnosed with lymphoma. From 30 to 34 years old he fought. Took chemo, and radiation therapy. He even managed to complete a few months of gun smithing school before being completely bed ridden at 33. He never ended up leaving the bed. He would spend the next years in bed, Itching from the treatment, slowly wasting away. We had hand sanitizer at all doors to the house, we isolated him, we were wearing masks before it was popular. When he was taken to the hospital for pneumonia I thought it would be okay. Dr's fix people right? During surgery his lung was clipped and complications lead to his death. My stepdad was 34 years old, and from the day he turned 18 he had less than 6 years of freedom to live as he chose. Our lives are precious, and we only have one. I want to do my purpose in life, music. I want a house to live in. I want food and drink and my pet rats. I want to make a living without throwing my life away. However I'm staring down a situation where NONE of those things seem possible. How can I, in good faith, rent a house when I have no job and nowhere will hire me? How can I afford a working car (one that wont end up costing me more in repairs than I bought it for) when my entire savings is dedicated twards next years rent? How am I supposed to go out and work when our fucking country doesn't give a shit about protecting the poor. They are passing legislation that makes it illegal for workers to sue their employers if they are infected. Covid doesn't just kill 3%. Some that live are disabled, scarring on their lungs for life. Nowhere will hire me part time. Nowhere will hire me above minimum wage. Is my life, or the lives of anyone else, worth $89 per day (before tax)? Not to mention all of my free time that day. So either no music or no relationship (the two things that make my life worth it). And my lease is done in August. During the biggest wave of evictions in this country's history, and a pandemic. I just want a path forward that doesn't involve constant suffering.

Tldr: death will come for us all. My step dad died at 34 after a 10 year career in the millitary. You think he would have spent his life differently if he knew how quick it would end? Knowing you have a limited time on earth, it is an absolute waste of human life to engage in wage slavery.

Common misconceptions

¬© Not all elections are prohibited under international he-
man rights law. The prohibition of forced elections does not a-
ply to elections carried out both in accordance with the law and in
conformity with the provisions of international human rights treaties. For
instance, it may be necessary to displace people from hazard-prone
land to protect lives. Nevertheless, even under these circumstances, the
elections should be in line with national law and relevant international
standards, including due process.

In administrative or judicial decision alone does not
necessarily result in a lawful or otherwise justified evil-
ton. Even if a national court has ruled in favour of an election or if
the election is carried out in conformity with national legislation, the
situation may still constitute a forced election if it does not comply with
international human rights standards and Staterelated obligations.

Forced elections do not necessarily involve the use of
physical force. People may be forced to move out of their homes
or off their land because of harassment, threats or other intimidation.
Putting off the water supply or electricity or other attempts to make it
tenable for someone to remain in their home may constitute forced
election. Of an occupant leaves home for a period of time, whether
voluntarily or owing fo a natural disaster or conflict for instance,
and is then not allowed to return, the situation may also amount to
forced election.

Protection against forced election is not linked to prop-
ety rights. Regardless of the type of tenure‚Äîownership, public or
private rental, cooperative housing, collective arrangements, lease,
emergency or transitional housing or informal settlements‚Äîeveryone
has a right to be protected against forced election. Appropriations that
are carried out without proper justification or in breach of international
law are also considered 'to be forced ‚Äòelections

132,You don't actually have to pay rent in California. A practical guide.,"**Step one**, get a lease one way or another. The ideal way to do this is to step in on the lease of someone who wouldn't mind you doing this, e.g. a foreign student who's leaving soon. Of course, these opportunities are far apart and few between. Most likely, you'll just apply and be accepted like a normal person.

**Step two**, save up for a lawyer. I used legal insurance for this and had to pay nothing, but most people won't have an affordable group legal insurance plan like myself. A lawyer, for the whole case, should run you a few thousand dollars, which should still be FAR cheaper than rent over the period of the lawsuit. Make sure your lawyer is halfway competent and agrees with you in terms of general strategy. Does he know what a *Delta* motion to quash is, and the fact that some courts no longer accept them? Does his fee include writs of mandate, and does he know what a writ of mandate is? Will he demur to the complaint? How good is he with getting the clerk to calendar cases? What is his track record and experience? Is he afflicted with bourgeois sentiment, or will he fight tooth and nail for tenants, right or wrong? Will he file an affirmative lawsuit for you on contingency, or will you have to pay him hourly?
 
**Step three**, go around your house. Start taking note of everything wrong with it. Doesn't matter how minor it seems - you'll find that it often adds up. Electrical problems? Bathtub clogged? Garbage disposal rattling? Heater malfunctioning? Cabinets not closing? Windows letting in a draft? Write it all down and take pictures if you can.

**Step four**, in coordination with your lawyer, start complaining, then withhold rent. If it is a less professional company, the landlord may bluster, threaten, etc. Keep logs of everything, and record everything after the first episode (this is an exception to the two-party consent law), then forward everything to your lawyer. 

**Step five**, do NOT answer the door for people you don't know. If they can't serve you, they'll have to seek an order to post and mail. This will add weeks or even a month or more to the process. Your lawyer should take care of everything else after that - make sure you've discussed strategy beforehand with them. At some point, your attorney will file a lawsuit against them demanding restitution for the habitability issues as well as any harassment you may have faced.

**Step six**, when the trial date has been set, it's time to leave. As long as you deliver possession before the trial date, they cannot proceed and must dismiss or convert the case to a limited civil action. Go get an AirBNB or a group living situation and either reapply for a new place or take advantage of the situation you find yourself in next. 

**Q: What about my credit score or my public record?**

There is no public record of an eviction in California unless the landlord actually wins. Landlords will rarely report to credit bureaus in general. However, you don't know this; as such, try to avoid giving them your SSN in the first place. Your lawyer should be able to get you a full release as part of the settlement for the affirmative lawsuit, so this should not be a problem. However, it's part of the risk you take.

**Q: What if my landlord tries to harass or threaten me?**

There is a risk your landlord might try to do something stupid. You look a lot more sympathetic as a *victim* of harassment, and this can substantially increase your payout. All this said, don't be dumb - be armed in case they try anything and by California law, if they attempt to break in, you may use lethal force against them if you feel your life is in danger. However, do *not* reveal that you're armed or anything of the sort unless you truly need to in order to defend your life. Brandishing, etc. when you are not in actual danger is a good way to get the police interested, which you do not want. However, if you have a corporate landlord, it is unlikely they will do all that much but put a notice up on your door.

**Q: Isn't this his property? What stops him from just coming in?**

Real property is a bundle of sticks. When a landlord leases to you, or to someone who then assigns the lease to you, he hands you the stick of possession. You effectively own the property as against the whole world, including the titled owner. He is nothing but a trespasser on your property, and you can deal with him as if he is nothing but a trespasser if he attempts to come in and fuck with you. While he can, by statute, enter upon giving 24 hours notice, he can only do so if he has a good reason, and he cannot do so if doing so would lead to a breach of the peace even if he does have a good reason.

**Q: How am I going to get a good reference?**

Usually, the landlord will agree to a positive or neutral reference as part of any settlement. If all else fails, you can simply hop on to a roommate situation and get friends to vouch for you, if you can't get good formal references or fake them, or go get an AirBNB, then use those references to sight your next target.

**Q: What about my record? Even if the eviction is confidential, won't future landlords see my lawsuits against the landlords?**

Make sure you sue as a John Doe, alleging fear of retaliation, physical harm, etc. This works better if you are a former victim of domestic violence or something similar.

**Q: How does this interact with COVID?**

In the Bay Area, before COVID, it could take more than 12 months to evict a tenant. Now? Hope you enjoy having a stable, long-term place to live rent-free.

**Q: Isn't this fraud?**

139,genuine question,"im not ""trolling"" i would genuinely like to discuss your thoughts on this so i can be better educated.


i see posts on here pouting out flaws in the system (capitalism) and that many are faced with ""work or starve"". my question is that even without capitalism, if we're in some socialist utopia, at this stage in human technology, how would a society function where people didn't work? i can agree with some points - there is too much focus on work as a central part of most people's lives and it could be cut down significantly but if you think about it, i can almost guarantee that you rely on others to function in your daily lives, without society it literally is work (farm) or starve so someone has to make food and someone has to get that food to you (via shops or whatever) and  there's also water distribution and builders and doctors that you more or less need to survive. electricity and roads and education and medicine research and heating and transport are all other things that technically you could survive without but they're nice to have but you need workers to keep those working.


are you guys literally anti work or do you just think work could be reduced in daily life because im close to the point where id call myself a socialist (still learning) yet i still think most (able) people would work in some form in a socialist/communist utopia. they would be treated better and would likely work a lot less but modern society needs work and although work seems bad it's better than getting everything for yourself. a world where no one works would not be better than present (unless you're a really good thief I guess)

144,Lacking the will to live due to the prospect of working full time,"Note: I'm not currently suicidal nor do I have any active plans. Its more like that im losing my desire to keep living as work will take a more central role in my life...

Anyway, where do I begin?

I'm in my mid twenties, and have dropped out of university. I'm in a unique situation where I don't have to work at all for the moment (I don't wish to go in depth here). I have worked various part time jobs in the past with little enthusiasm. 

However, I know that this is not a long term possibility..and ""have to"" work full time or some equivalent.

In theory, I'm not opposed to the idea of ""work"" in general or spending my days doing something or developing a skill. In a pure theoretical sense, this is all well and good.

My main problem is how it's all set up.

To keep things simple...I'm simply can't do it. I can't.

I find the whole process of work (from the hiring process, to the repetition of mundane tasks, to the simple idea that you need it to live and determines your quality of life) to be utterly appalling and repulsive. 

For example, I used to be a actually enthusiastic about the workforce when I was younger...as I naively believed that my skills would be appreciated and that employers would notice.

Oh what a fucking joke that is!

Despite being trilingual and having experience in library work (as an assistant and volunteer) , I couldn't get through the interviews for several menial bookstore jobs despite: having the experience,  actually researching the company and developing decent questions. 

Contrary to what they say; they care more about apperances and how your image matches the ""team"" as opposed to raw skill. Despite the fact that I'm a genuinely pleasant person (so I think) and would love nothing more than to do a job well done and go home after.. apparently that's not good enough..no.

They want an overly positive , agreeable, people pleasing drone who will say what they want to hear. I've been told in a practice interview that I'm not ""positive"" enough... despite smiling politely, coming prepared, listening and asking important questions, and trying to engage overall in the hiring process. Good forbid that I wasn't born with a rainbow shoved up my ass and that I don't smile like a drooling idiot every two seconds..fuck off!

It all  fills me with various unpleasant emotions such as: rage, resentment, unending sadness , and a splash of general hopelessness.

What kills me the most is that on a grand scale, it's all technically pointless. Life has no objective meaning...and I don't want to spend a majority of my life doing things that I simply don't want to do.

The only hope that I have now is that I'm looking into web development and coding. Now, I'm not naive as to believe that it has no drawbacks...but at least (in theory) this is a job that can be done remotely and that pays well. It also (at first glance) seems to be a workplace culture that values skill (for obvious reasons) more than social savy. I intend to maybe do a 3 year technical program for it or perhaps a bootcamp..still researching. I also intend on tutoring languages on the side.

I also plan on living with the minimum (currently a minimalist)...as all my entertainment is from the library or the internet...yes! Also don't intend on getting married or having kids.

But if I can't succeed in my current plan...I frankly don't know what I want to do..

This looming obligation of eventually having to work full time is driving me crazy and making me lose the will to live. I have tried to ""leave the world"" once...have since gotten a bit of help and feel better. Yet the feeling of dread remains.

Anyways, any solutions, solidarity, or whatever comments are all perfectly fine. I don't expect solutions as my expectations are quite low at this point. Thanks for this sub!

157,Coming back from annual leave... suicidal. Looking for advice.,"I hate my job. 

I hate my incompetent, scamming, egomaniac boss the MOST. 

I normally work two days from home, three days from the office, which I campaigned hard for aka told my boss we either find a middle ground or I quit on the spot when they called me back after COVID ( I was working from home full time.) I, on purpose, took an extra day off to get back to the office on a WFH day. Tuesdays are a WFH day for me. I wanted to make things a bit nicer. Guess who texts me this morning with that "" since you're coming back on a Tuesday and it's three days from the office per week...you'll come in tomorrow in addition to the regular office days."" BS. He has a history of scamming people, not paying people and squeezing people from every single drop of work he can get from them. The company has no HR, it's a shitty start up type of thing. 

Nobody stays longer than a couple months in this company. Even one of the owners' relative who was working there quit. TWICE.  

Now there's some fresh graduates there who are ""super enthusiastic"" and full of ideas/prime bootlicking, they just give me more work and a headache. Their ideas fall on my desk. I can't even vent because there's a 90% chance they will snitch. I miss my old team who all hated the job as much as I did. At least I wasn't alone.

I've been trapped here for a year and a half.  I've hated it from week one. Been looking for something else since then, no success. During my annual leave I was doing so good mental health wise, my depression was gone, my anxiety was gone, my paranoia was gone. I just want to kill myself. I don't see a way out. I can't actually quit, how will I survive then.

164,Personal Experiences with the US Workplace and the Gig Economy,"Warning: wall of text incoming 

In 2006, I quit my first adult job working in a kitchen after ~8 years of employment. My hourly wages at first were $6/hr as a dishwasher, and by the time I quit I was a sous chef making $13/hr - which was pretty decent for a Louisiana resident at the time.

After a short stint in the oilfield where I witnessed the astonishing amount of waste (both environmental and financial) that goes with that industry, I went back to working in kitchens and also returned to college to pursue a degree in 2011.

When I graduated in 2015 and finally left the food service industry, I was making $13/hr at the same exact position that I held in 2006. By that time the cost of EVERYTHING had increased dramatically but my pay remained the same. $13/hr felt like a LOT of money in '06, but in '15 it was just enough to get by... and I was among the highest paid employees in the building.

To make things even more difficult, my rent had risen from $700/month at the start of my lease to $850/month between 2012-2015. Things were so dire that there were times when I had no viable choice but to buy groceries with a credit card. The credit card bill sometimes had to be paid with student loan money, because I frequently found myself with no other means to meet those payments while working and attending school full time.

The food service industry - like most jobs in this gig economy - has a painfully low ceiling for the average employee, and each person who works at a restaurant is completely expendable and can be terminated for just about any reason. Most of my coworkers had to work multiple jobs to get by because they weren't offered enough shifts to be considered full-time employees (so that the employer wouldn't have to provide health insurance). Many of them had substance abuse problems to cope with the insurmountable task of working multiple shifts each day in order to be able to feed their families. Health insurance was either non-existent or unaffordable for most of us.

Lately conservatives have been arguing that $600 a week for unemployment is too much and that it discourages employees from returning to work. They argue that citizens should ""pull themselves by the bootstraps"" and stop accepting ""government handouts."" But without ""government handouts"" like the Pell Grant, I would still be making starvation wages in a restaurant and relying on government services to keep me going. 

Hearing conservatives talk like this upsets me deeply because I have firsthand experience of how difficult it is to reach middle class today, and my experience wasn't nearly as bad as many of the people I had to work with because I was fortunate enough to have had a strong support system of family and friends.

It's also worth mentioning that I first attended college in 1999 and (foolishly) didn't finish my first semester. My tuition that year was just under $1000 for the semester. By the time I graduated in 2015, tuition had risen to $4500 per semester. Last I heard, tuition at this university is well over $5000 per semester.

My personal experiences are proof enough to me that this economic system is completely rigged against the average person. We are all cannon fodder for the companies and corporations who exploit our labor and productivity. In the early 20th century people had to literally die for the 40 hour workweek and minimum wage, but it's not at all uncommon to hear complaints (usually from conservatives) about how labor unions are corrupt and regular people are taking advantage of the system.

This post has no point other than to share my anecdotal experiences with others, but I believe that it also implicitly explains why I am a leftist. If you have experiences like this that you would like to share, please comment because I'd love to hear about it.",False,i112n6,the_alt_fright,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/i112n6/personal_experiences_with_the_us_workplace_and/,2,1
165,Working makes me want to cry.,"I started a job in April. It's a fast paced food place and I hate it already. They're expectations are way too high. Everything we do has to be quick as possible so we can move on to the next task. 

I was on register for most shifts I was there and I was good at it and loved it honestly. We require masks in store and I ask people to cover their noses while they're in the store and almost everyone does it without a problem. One day, I was at register and asked a women to cover her nose. (I wasn't smiling under my mask or anything and had slipped into my normal tone of speaking and didn't sound preppy or enthusiastic.) This women asked for my manager and told him I had an additude and was rude to her, none of which was true. 

That was about 2 weeks ago and they've taken me off of reg since then. My boss shadowed me one day to see how I was doing everywhere else and I was doing fine but now they tend to keep me away from the customers by having my wash dishes, do stocking and things like that. I feel like they don't care if I improve now and are just waiting to hire someone new to take my place. (They're hiring again) 

A few times they've said things that have irked me. We're not allowed to sit unless we're on a break even when it's slow. Sometimes we have to do things that take awhile like write notes and I've asked to sit while doing this and was told me and could only sit if I was going to faint. I got a stern talking to cause I sat for one second while I had water and I didn't know I wasn't allowed to do that.

Another is that we have to ask permission to have a drink of water. That irked me so now I just let them know I'm getting water and not taking no for an answer. 

I once let me manager know that I was going to use the restroom and she let me know my bathroom breaks can't be more than 1 minute long. 
 
I think what bothers me so much about it all is that they're all younger than me (they're mostly shiftleads being between 18-21 and I'm 22) and it feels like I'm being talked down to by someone a lot younger than me. 

And the one thing that upsets me the most is we can't let them know we can't work a certain day. We have to put in a time off request. I let her know I couldn't work a certain day and she told me I had to put in a time off request which she can deny. I put in 2 for certain days I absolutely cannot work about 1  week ago and they're still pending. 

This doesn't seem normal to me as I've never had to deal with this at a job before. I'm not sure if I'm being over dramatic but the way they do things there just doesn't sit right with me. I am going to be starting school soon for cosmetology and hopefully can make a successful career out of it so I don't have to deal with any of this again.",False,i0rbrd,coraline_cross,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/i0rbrd/working_makes_me_want_to_cry/,13,1

Although I've noticed my coworkers ridicule other coworkers that they dont answer their phone or respond to emails after working hours. They do little jokes about the employee being lazy or doing the ""bare minimum"" and how they should be thankful they even have a job.

178,Capitalists are leeches on our society,"If Capitalists insist that market success be the determining factor in the livelihood of all humans, then they are stating that unsuccessful market participants are unworthy of food, water and shelter. 

Nature is in no way preventing us from making sure people's needs are met, but because it cannot be done under their outdated economic system, they do not think it's necessarily moral to try to do so. 

If they want to do it their way, fine, but that means that Capitalists are the ones creating the ""leeches"" we so often hear them complain about. The idea that someone needs to succeed in a market before earning food that is ready to be eaten is a human invention. Not nature.  

This is a rule imposed by Capitalists on unsuccessful market participants. It's how Capitalism works. When you complain about leeches, you're complaining that your system is working according to plan.

184,I hate my work. I fucking hate it.,"Every single day is a fucking struggle against everyone. I receive emails constantly, faster than I can read them. I am the manager of my department, and we have been always one of the best of the company, but since the covid crisis happened, half of the company workers were temporaly fired.

Because of that, we are half of the people we used to be on my team. But the work is almost the same. My fucking bosses spent all time asking why the work isn't getting done. I have explained them, in all the ways possible, using all the data that I have, that we are facing the same volume of work with 4 people instead of 10. They don't listen. They say we are slacking off. I suspect they are acting like that to put pressure in us, so we stay more hours (for free, of course).

I hated my work when things were ""good"". I absolutely despise it now, more than I could ever imagine. I have anxiety all day, every day. During work hours, I am nervous, accelerated, and out of my mind. Everyone is questioning our work constantly, whether is done correctly or not. Emails are flooding. Production stocks raise and raise, with no brakes. We do our work, and the work of the people that were fired.

I can't take this shit anymore. I almost screamed to a client today. Instead, I punched my table. He maybe though my phone fell off. I would have probably punched him in the face if I had him in front of me. He was a dick, though, but I'm angry all the time, even with people that don't deserve it.

In my free time, I'm tired, constantly. My head hurts. Even thinking hurts. How the fuck is that possible?

The worst part is that I don't know how to escape. I'm even scared of other jobs. What if they are worse? What if I'm useless at them? And it's not like there is a lot of works right now, at least in my country.

I want to cut the head of my bosses, and feed their sons their brains, roasted with the bones of their fucking mothers, but that would be quick, and merciful.

I don't usually rant, but I am so fucking pissed. Every day, a bit more. Maybe tomorrow will be the day when I snap and send a memo to all the company consisting of a photo of my penis with a hat.

Operating hours are 8-5 but he's a salaried manager and has been there 7a-7p 5 days a week and went in on the weekend last week. His boss is telling him he can't take a week off even though he has accrued the vacation hours. His boss thinks he's ""trying to stick it"" to the owner and, yeah, that's also part of the reason.

203,"Calling it ""labor"" instead of ""work"" doesn't suddenly make a lack of free time desirable.","This is a smallish rant without real target or thesis, but one that I wanted to post anyways. I mostly lurk in this sub ‚Äì I think I have, like, two or three posts *maybe* in some comment sections here over the last year or so ‚Äì so I'm well aware that there's a pretty wide spectrum of political thought across the sub (mostly from areas of the left, naturally) and that various things are fairly contentious aside from the general distaste we share for the current condition of work under the capitalist system.

But I see a lot of posts that essentially argue for some Calvanist principal of hard ethics ‚Äì it's not the prevailing attitude (save for that one ""we actually *love* to work back-breaking labor, it's just alienation that's bad"" Twitter post that gets upvoted every couple of weeks), though nevertheless I see a consistent number of posts coming into the sub and getting very popular from people talking about how the ideal would be to forego modern technology and return to the farm to work from sunrise to sunset in the fields or how pulling 13-hour shifts at a steel mill is actually the pure ideal of the modern laborer.

And then inevitably there will be a bunch of posts in the comments saying, ""Um, I mean that'd be better, but I still don't want to spend my entire life working just to survive"" and a host of responses going, ""It's not work, it's *labor!* Labor is fulfilling!""

And like, guys.

Be that as it may, which is heavily dependent on the individual and their interests, should we not *also* be arguing that required labor should be tremendously lessened for the average individual as well? Is allowing a more relaxed schedule for everyone involved so people don't have to spend their entire lives devoted to a manual task not ultimately the immediate second goal of removing labor as a commodity?

And that's not even to mention the comments throwing out re-interpretations of the OP, saying things like, ""Well I'm sure there are some forms of labor you enjoy! Like writing or playing an instrument!"" Which, like, I'm *pretty sure* that when said generic OP mentioned how fulfilling it was to labor tirelessly for the good of the community, they weren't talking about improv theater. 

Just, no, man. Not having a boss is still better than having a boss, but regardless of how much less it would suck to have to *labor* for oneself tirelessly each day while seeing the direct results than it is to *work* for a corporation tirelessly each day with no flexibility in schedule and draconian oversight, it'd *still* suck a whole lot. Simply removing alienation from the equation doesn't suddenly make a lack of free time and to have oneself defined by one's work all that much more appealing.",False,hw543u,PurpleKneesocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hw543u/calling_it_labor_instead_of_work_doesnt_suddenly/,10,16

243,My story on how I starter getting into relationships solely for the purpose of making my life easier as a poor person,"I'm 22yo and started university late with my own money that I had made from work and investments. I come from a family where both parents have sources of income, but are barely scraping by. They could have never saved enough to send me to university sadly. But I made up for it by working passively ever since I was a teenager. 

I would save maybe a couple thousand each year. By the time I became an adult I took some free training courses in local institutions but still didn't have money for anything academic. I also took work more seriously by that time and started saving everything I was earning. By 20yo and also  thanks to some investments that performed somewhat I could enter in a decent collage. 

Things were going great working in parallel wile also studying. But I gave up all work by the time studies intensified. Working and studying was driving me nuts. I wanted to focus on one thing and be more relaxed. At least give my self the opportunity to also make friends. 

Thankfully I had left enough on the side to pay off university without debt. The caveat was that I would have to live like a spartan. No eating out. No trips. No drinking. No going anywhere aside of university and generally not much unplanned spending other than maybe a beer and some coffees to drink on a public bench with friends a handful of times a month. 

That was around around to years ago. At the time that I left work, that had also met my now ex, who was soon to become my first serious relationship. We were together for a year and I can say that life was amazingly more comfortable while staying with her. We could order from outside and she would pay. First of all, my academic life became easier. No more spending hours without ad-block on dodgy sites for pirated textbooks anymore, she would just straight up buy two copies from the crazily marked up university library. No more begging at the university librarian to grant access to papers, she would simply buy permanent access. No need to pirate software, she had subscriptions to every useful software for our studies. Anything DRM locked, why spend time to pirate/crack for free when it's faster to buy it? Money is just a number for some after all... 

And there's more... We needn't take the bus anymore. She would pay for Uber anywhere... She would pay for my flight tickets to take trips together and I never had to worry about booking early or spend days looking for the best price, because she would just use miles her parents had accumulated... She even paid for a subscription for both of us in the closest gym (and not the cheapest one). Getting fat just a little? Let's buy two bikes. That didn't work? Call in the family nutritionist! Gym not working? Hire a personal trainer for a few days or a month... Just so much time and effort saved.

But more funny, is that whenever she would have an issue with 'adulting' (for example, taxes, laws and even her rights in many given situations etc.), she wouldn't call her parents, but instead their house keeper. A Filipino woman who, by all means, was a jack of all trades and a true genius... I remember one time my gf got an F by a professor that most probably hadn't even reviewer her paper, and instead likely had marked it as such because I had voiced opposing political beliefs with him (and was her bf). That woman friggin genius of woman, who had never graduated from a university herself, called the school's secretary, and through a series of calls managed to have the university re-evaluate the paper so my gf passed. My gf didn't have to move a finger other than make a 1.5 minutes call. 

Other than that, my GF was extremely shallow. Not a trace of character and absolutely no preferences, opinions or even hobbies aside of what I projected to her. She was smart in terms of math, physics and biology, but also very dumb socially. She could never crack a joke, understand the meaning of politics (she just couldn't grasp the political spectrum no matter what I did to explain it for example) or even make friends on her own. 

I wouldn't have minded staying with her for all my life. And in the long term, even if I wanted to work at some point, her parents could just directly appoint me to the company they were executives at. Not that I would ever need to do work while with her, but just in case I felt like passing time there, maybe feel a little more important, while also on the payroll. This was her projected career path at least. 

Still to this day, I genuinely believe that she took more good out of me other than anything else because I taught her way more things than a person merely looking to take advantage of her would have had. At the very least, she was taking well to advice (at least after her doing some shouting at first). I genuinely and truly loved this girl and wanted to give the best of me. But in the end we broke up because no matter what I tried she couldn't understand the importance of not having mental breakdowns at least twice a day over minuscule things. So I ended up being heartbroken. But this whole ordeal had me never wanting to return to my old lifestyle again. 

Even since then, I've had two relationships. And I think I cracked the code to actually find GFs from rich families. 

1. Prepare lunch home (because poor). 
2. Go to university cafeteria to pretend-eat. 
3. Cafeteria charges a meal 15$ and 2.5$ for a tiny bottle of water, no refills. 
4. Look for girls that go there regularly to eat (water bottle included) and have never been observed talking to other males. 
5. Talk to them. 

First of these two relationships lasted half a year. That one was looking equally ambitious. She had me moved in from the first week and was spending quite a bit whenever I'd whine a little. To be honest most of my subscriptions from the previous relationship were still valid so she I wouldn't ask for that much aside of recreational stuff. We ultimately had to break up because her mother told her to. Apparently mamma's little princess told her parents in what ways we were fucking (because they asked). Her dad was zen about it but then the mom threatened to cut her funding if we didn't separate. Too bad you can't unfuck someone. 

Now my latest relationship seems to be going smooth so far. Her parents aren't mega rich like previous ones but apparently they are ok with her paying almost everything for poor me. We aren't living in the same apartment yet (thankfully I have some friends to support me in between breaks of my long con) but plan to. My worry is that her parents might end up being overprotective like the previous one because I'm seeing some signs already. Like for example her telling everything to her parents throughout the relationship. 

At this rate I'll get to finish college with enough money to buy a car and rural flat. Hopefully one of these relationships sticks and I never have to work for real again.",False,hyhjuo,JuOlNa,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hyhjuo/my_story_on_how_i_starter_getting_into/,3,1

Working out can be  painful but can release endorphins to make it worth it but fundamentally work just destroys me psychologically like a cancer would.

267,You. Are. Fucked. (and here is why),"Alright boys and girls. You are ALL fucked. You may not realize it yet, but you are guaranteed FUCKED.

So, the reason that you are fucked is that you are subsisting either on a wage, or you are subsisting on a fixed income. Both of these are not dynamic in relation to the number of dollars in existence or even GDP. If you want to read more on THAT particular issue, here is an excellent link:  [https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/](https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/)

Anyways, the fed is buying out the junk bond market. That probably sounds like arcane gibberish, and many of you probably don't even know what a bond is. A bond is like a loan, except you agree to repay the full value of the bond (the principal) plus a fixed amount (the interest) at some later date. For example, you borrow $100, but you agree to repay me $110 in one year. So, what makes a bond a junk bond? Well, companies that might default that issue bonds are considered to be issuing junk bonds. For example Hertz defaulted on its bonds. It went into bankruptcy. The US government gave money away to hertz bond holders to buy their bonds to prop up the company value to try to not let it default... and it defaulted anyway.

But this isn't just about a stupid car rental company. This is happening across the entire market. Notice the stock market going up? All that nice slushy corporate money is being used to buy back stocks. Why? Well, when a company goes bankrupt, they have all kinds of legal moves that they can do, including defaulting on bonds. It is free money. Now, it might not make an impact on your life when the stock market rallies by 10% in 3 months... But it will make an impact when the price of food goes up 10% in 3 months. That is 40% inflation.

But wait it get's worse. The stock markets valuation is grossly overinflated, even going into the pandemic. They had absolutely horrendous p/e ratios and if it had a fair valuation, the prices of stocks would be 1000x lower. What happens when all that nice green cash gets dumped on main street? You. Are. Fucked.

You really only have 1 option. You need to buy stuff, or acquire stuff that is inflation resistant. That means whatever you put your value in needs to be scarce. It should not be something that can have its supply manipulated.

Now certain people here are very much against cryptocurrency. That's fine. Year on year it's gone up and it's gone down, but for the most part since inception it has trended up. However, you need to ask yourself if you trust your dollar. Do you trust it to hold its value? Even when you know the fed has injected literally trillions of dollars into the economy, and that they owe their creditors even more trillions? When you see the police acting like the police of a third world country? When canada declares the US as unsafe for asylum seekers? When the people who make our country competitive (young prodigies looking to go to college) are being turned away at the door? When every single nation is tarrifing us, and is also pointing at us out for having a less skilled response to covid than third world countries like cuba? No.

The US dollar is NOT a safe store of value, and neither is real estate in the US. You need to get your hands on the following items:Gold. Silver. Cryptocurrency. Foreign currency that won't collapse with the dollar. Foreign Real estate. Foreign stocks of companies that do not service us customers.

If you can't buy these items right now because you don't have money, think about low interest loans like mortgages. If you can service the interest cost of a loan, the depreciation of the dollar value is going to cause your goods to appreciate in value. You could buy enough gold today to afford a car with. However, in 3-4 years, that gold will be worth 10x the cost that you paid for it... and you will still be only able to buy a car with it. (ok the car market might crash, but you get the idea)

Basically, if you take out loans now, and put the money from those loans into a diversified portfolio of goods and commodities that will not lose value when the US dollar loses value, you will do very well.

On the topic of cryptos. Bitcoin, ethereum, ampleforth, knc are all good choices. Do your own research though. Stay safe, there are many scammers, and there are many pump and dump groups. Cryptos are legit, but they are the wild west.

On the topic of precious metals. Buy gold and silver coins, not bullion. It is illegal to adulterate coins, or to clip them. This way, you know what you are getting. 1 silver dollar is always 1 silver dollar. The silver is what matters.

Right now, it is better to buy silver than gold, mostly cause silver is so low in price. It will pick up though.",False,hwlun0,Ghostcarapace3,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hwlun0/you_are_fucked_and_here_is_why/,33,2

You‚Äôre not allowed to go anywhere other than the office unless it‚Äôs your rushed 30 minute lunch because they can‚Äôt trust you to manage your time like an adult. You‚Äôre constantly watched by bosses like they‚Äôre the fucking secret police to make sure you‚Äôre not ‚Äúchitchatting‚Äù or doing something else that is looked down upon.

Not to mention the passive aggressive bullshit and the inauthentic ‚Äúwokeness‚Äù that seem to be a trend amongst businesses now a days. 

I fantasize about owning a small farm. I understand working on a farm is hard work but it‚Äôs not hard work which deters me.

After my third year in undergrad, me and a couple of my classmates were really
excited about a Summer Internship that we were to do at Porch India.

For us as industrial Engineers, nothing could get better than a hands on
experience at one of the most established production facilities in india, apart
From getting a taste of the corporate world.

‚ÄòA few weeks in, and after a few hours of the Facility, we quickly noticed that our
manager was busy most of the times and had little time to attend to us.

However, he did say this one thing that's struck with me all along,

He said that while in college, students pay the college, and expect professors to
regularly guide them along the way.

However, in a company, we are paying employees to help us grow, and we expect
proactiveness and decision making from them.

By biggest lesson was that in college, grades alone were considered an indicator
of good performance.

While in the corporate world, being a good team player and making important
decisions, apart from good performance, are equally important!

The lottery is an exercise that among countless other activities our society sanctions, that makes it abdominally clear that all individuals are not in reality thought to have unquantifiable value. In our society it is our ability to win a lottery, or by other means produce a stream of cash towards our own person that ultimately decides what society values of your existence.

So covid came and I started working home for three months. I wasn't being productive because my University amped up the amount of work and it's difficulty, and my priority is stop paying that shit first. I'm not worried since there are two people in my sector and I'm the only one that messes with this code since my boss never touched it. In June they called us back, the numbers were too little and apparently controlled on my state.

Then my stupid president happened and the cases raised like crazy. We kept working all through June with the office with almost no one in with. The owner then sent us home by the end of June saying it was too dangerous.

The cases are rising rapidly in my state, then the lady that is home since the beginning of it all says we will come back on Monday. It's so dumb. Our work is the same wherever, actually I'm working better since I get plus four hours without commute, meaning sleeping better, eating better and better mood. But no we need to come back. I live with my mother that is an old lady with diabetes. A dangerous case.

They just want me there to see me working. But do you know what is dumb? They don't give a duck about our job. I don't have someone to go to when something happens, I have to learn by myself, and when I say something it's just ignored. It pisses me off how in their little minds it's ""oh, they've got to be here to work well"".

I mean no. The worst of all is they wanna hire me, and okay, good I need the benefits for my father but I will have to work 44 hours a week on top of studying full time, all so maybe I can realize my biggest dream of getting out of my mom's house.

There's no need for that much time of work when most of time they almost give us no job but we extend it so they don't say ""why are you not working"". And despite this we can't do nothing.

329,Dislike for work and the desire to save money,"I've noticed that the more difficult it is for me to work (a bad day, an annoying assignment, travelling for work, etc.), the more I want to save as much money as realistically possible.

I've noticed that when wanting to buy, I always calculate how many hours would I have to work to buy this and assess the purchase in a way of asking myself ""would I want to work x amount of hours for this item?""

This has resulted in a situation of me deciding to buy only some of the purchases, depending on what I truly want and need. For example, I bought a beautiful french bed (with a mattress) last year, bought a new gaming laptop 2 years ago, bought some gym equipment for when I'm bored, but I've decided against buying a new car, against buying luxurious boutique items that I don't really need.

Because of this mentality, I am in a very lucky position to be able to survive for over a year should I be dismissed from my work (which, in the context of me just having bought my own place last year and settling in (which also cost a lot of money), is a really good situation to be on).

I see the extra pound that is in my bank account as another step towards being freer than I am currently. And while it is not an ultimate solution, it is something that can be done on an individual level.

&amp;#x200B;

I was hired as an assistant engineer intern. So far I have really hated the office environment and what I do. I won't go into details here because it really doesn't matter. Everyone there loves me though and I hide the fact I hate it very well- so much so they have already asked me to come back in the spring.

Am I an a$$hole for wanting to tell them no? I really do not like the job and don't feel like promoting it, and I am not comfortable having that video shared on their social media for my own personal privacy reasons. I was also a little upset that they didn't even take the time to walk over to my desk (or call me to theirs) to talk about it. I think it is a little lazy to send an email when we sit 50 feet apart all day. I also feel like it is really not my job to recruit more interns for them, especially when the company did $100+ million in revenue last year.

Gotta be respectful and not talk back, even when some asshole boss is shitting all over you. Gotta go along with unreasonable demands, and you'd better deliver.

334,Thoughts about depression and the idea of assisted suicide rather than ending the grind,"Hi, tl;dr at bottom

I was just having a discussion with a friend the other day which I would love to hear your guys opinion on. 

I have someone dear to me who has suffered from depression for many years now and pretty much went through all medication there was and all therapists in the area and has just not improved one bit, still wants to die. Something I hear often is stuff like ""I just dont want to do this anymore!"", especially after something stressful has come up at his work. Overall they share quite a few dreads with people on this sub. Before I had started to wonder about countries that had assisted suicide, even for those not necessarily terminally ill. He is also in pain alot both mentally and physically. I was wondering whether it was a good thing.

So thats what I asked the friend: ""would you support assissted suicide as an option for people who have been depressed for years?"" ""Only if everything else has been tried already."" ""But in the case I am thinking of everything *has* been tried, they did all the different therapy and stuff!"" And then she said: ""But I mean *everything*. Have they had the chance to not worry about work before? Did they ever truly get the chance to be free of that pressure, not having to work to survive? I think that as long as the government doesnt provide a right to live they shouldnt grant the right to die first.""

And that I found super interesting because I have often wondererd whether he could be - even if not free of his illness - living a healthy life if there was zero pressure on him, if his basic living needs were guaranteed and there was no stigma againat not working and instead pursuing interests and focusing on self care. What do you think? If you suffer from depression, do you think it would improve if you didnt have to work? Do you think that there should be a right to live before a right to die? That society cant claim they have already tried all options and are giving up if it hasnt tried this?

339,How do you cope with job insecurity?,"I'm European living in Europe, I work in IT in a big American corporation. The high ups tell us that everything is fine and that our jobs are safe, but I don't trust that. I know for a fact that our business is being affected by the pandemic, the goods we make are luxury items so I expect that that will suffer badly in the coming recession as well. Corporate news is happy and cheery, but would they really say differently? Of course not. 

I also have a volatile boss who is prone to randomly throw temper tantrums. He will be your best friend one day and will be cursing you out for minuscule things the next. Does not inspire confidence. 

So I can't trust what the high ups say, I am not optimistic about the health of the company and I am constantly aware that a little mistake could result in my boss canning me any day. I have been in the company for less than a year so it would be very easy for them to fire me. 

I can't plan for the future. I don't know if I will be employed in 6 months time and with the current climate I don't know how easily I would be able to find a new job. The last resort for me would have been emigration, but even that seems to be out of the question with movement in the world being more difficult.

Last year I was not so worried about this since the job market was strong. I actually did move jobs last year and found my current one in only a few weeks. Now is different.

341,Isn't it dumb how people have negative impression on employees who quit and not on the company itself?,"**When someone resigns from a company after less than a year.**

People will assume: He is lazy, he can't take the stress, he doesn't perform, he is entitled, he is fickle-minded, he is a job hopper.

Nobody will ask: Gee... Wonder what type of unfair treatment did the company dish out? Is the salary at that company too low? Maybe there's no career pathway in that company? Perhaps the company doesn't give the recognition that the employees deserved? Perhaps the boss is a very abusive individual?

**When you go to a job interview and the interviewer asks why you spent less than a year at a company?**

Things most candidates would say: I'm looking for a better opportunity, I moved so needed to find a job that is closer to my house, I decided that job wasn't my passion, a family member was sick so I had to focus on taking care of them....

Things you cannot say: My boss was an abusive person. The company doesn't give fair treatment to me. I wasn't compensated fairly. I started to develop depression and anxiety while working there. I was having regular breakdowns and panic attacks while working for my boss.

Quitting a job and saying these things will give YOU a bad impression. Not the boss, not the company. You are the problem. The company is perfect. You are unprofessional. Your boss is alright.

Also, stating bad things about your past employers is looked down upon, either by recruiters or just the regular public. Just ask any career consultant or trainer. They will advise against it.

It's like a grand conspiracy to make sure the workers either do their job or look like crap to other people.

Anyway today when I was leaving a coworker, who is senior sales or something gave me a letter. I thought it was maybe about my pay since they took off stuff that they shouldn't have last month. I went to the car and opened it and it was a letter from the senior sales person complaining about me! It said that I wasn't working hard enough and there were complaints in a few different areas of my work.

I was pretty shocked because I thought I was doing well and the letter wasn't even from my manager, nor had they signed it.

What's even worse, the letter said I only had 2 weeks to improve and if I didn't then they'd give me a formal warning letter, there'd be a meeting and if I didn't improve I'd be fired. I didn't think I'd be fired for working slowly and making a few mistakes. It's really just giving me stress.

They have really poor communication at my work, they post pictures into the group chat of people making mistakes and I think it's very unprofessional. If they're having this much of a problem with me then the manager should've addressed the concerns with me privately.

I really hate work and my first job was even worse than this. After this job I'm never working in retail, I can't be bothered with customers and bitchy coworkers.

374,Do you think society will reach a breaking point and reject capitalism as we know it?,"I believe on some subconscious level, most people with their heads screwed on right can realize that SOMETHING is horribly wrong about American society (and the world at large). We are forced to work for peanuts, given no healthcare or any kind of support from the government, and have to slave away for decades in most cases in order to afford basic necessities like owning a home, having food, heat, etc. Many people realize how screwed up it is to have to work two or three jobs to survive, and how college degrees mean very little unless you have the connections ($$$) to have done unpaid internships and then land a cushy job out of college. And people also realize how scary it is that one medical issue or accident can throw off or wreck your finances and life plans. 

BUT, most people are also brainwashed by our corporate overlords (and perhaps the old protestant work ethic indigenous to the U.S.) into thinking that this is just ‚Äúhow it is‚Äù, and how they should just work harder or find another job and maybe then things will be okay for them. The corporate overlords want us to be undereducated and underpaid so we won‚Äôt even question the system and so we‚Äôll be ~so~ grateful to even have a job, no matter how little the pay or that you have to endure abuse from your employer. 

People are so exhausted from working however many hours that they come home and slump over in front of the tv and don‚Äôt have enough time for whatever activities give them meaning outside of work. Not to mention that there isn‚Äôt much time to study critiques of capitalism. I think a huge reason behind why so many of us are depressed, anxious, and addicted to a myriad of things is that society constantly sends us the message that we have to be the very best and bend over backwards for an employer, and if we don‚Äôt, we‚Äôre lazy and worthless. 

Many americans (including myself) are disgusted with the system and have seen themselves or other people be chewed up and spit out by the system with no appreciation, recognition, or material support. But how long will we pretend that this is just the norm? 

I want to see a 30 hour workweek, increasing the minimum wage to $15, UBI, and MORE THAN TWO WEEKS OF VACATION. Thank god for the unions who fought so that we could have two days on the weekend, but two weeks is not nearly enough vacation time to recuperate from the stresses of modern life. In addition to that, we need universal healthcare and maternity/paternity leave. Too many politicians and ordinary people act like these things are iMpOsSiBlE and UnReALiStiC, when they are actually crucial to making sure life doesn‚Äôt get any worse. 

This has been a rant, but I‚Äôd also be curious to hear your thoughts. People make fun of me for constantly hating on capitalism, but the state of things under our current system enrages me so much and I don‚Äôt understand why more people don‚Äôt speak out about it.

383,Using the ADA to unchain yourself from workslavery.,"Hi I'm a sketchy attorney whose favorite color is darkest gray.

**The Problem:**

You're a 30 year old accountant/customer service rep/analyst/makebelievespreadsheetjobist that dreads the monotonous hell of waking up every morning at 6am to iron your shirts, eat a Whole Foods burrito, jump in your car and drive an hour so you can get to work by 8:00, get patronizing glances from your boss when you actually get in at 8:10, be generally unproductive for three hours since:

1. Other people are dropping their work off on you since you're the only person who knows how/cares to do it, and
2. You're fucking exhausted from getting little to no sleep and are generally unproductive until after lunch, at which point you squeak out the minimum amount of work to stay gainfully employed, and
3. You feel guilty because all the other people you know are struggling to get a job as good as yours; they're all working three part time jobs with no benefits, and
4. **You begin to question why you need to come into work at all given you can do 100% of your job from home in your pajamas. Your company is having you show up because fuck you, that's why.**

Long before I was an attorney, I had a job like this. I spent mayyyyybe 15 hours a week doing ""work"" and the rest of the time was spent surfing the internet and stressing over trying to look busy for when my boss strolled over and SOWHATCHAWORKINGON'd me. I was told for years that if you just kept your head down and performed, you'd get promoted. Of course, these promotions invariably went to management's lunch buddies or the female employees the bosses were cheating on their wives with.

I wish I'd known I wasn't alone in my absolute contempt for my workplace; moreover, that there were ways I could have been significantly happier without quitting, finding a new job, and starting the process all over again.

**The Law:**

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 is, in my opinion, the most radically transformative federal law in the last 50 years. The quick read is that the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability. There are several critical sections to the ADA, but today I'm only going to focus on Title I, which is employment discrimination.

The summary of Title I is this:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*An employer is required to make a reasonable accommodation to the known disability of a qualified applicant or employee if it would not impose  an ""undue hardship"" on the operation of the employer's business.* 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's break that down:

* An employer - almost anyone who employs you, except for churches, international treaty organizations (e.g. the UN), and a couple other outliers. The exception is that for the ADA to apply to an employer, the employer must employee at least 15 people.
* Required - ""not a suggestion.""
* Reasonable - ""not unreasonable"" (see ""undue hardship"")
* Accommodation - This is the fill-in-the-blank section. An employer must accommodate a disabled employee or applicant *so that they can enjoy the same benefit of employment as a non-disabled employee*. For example, a blind accountant must be provided with screen reader software/be allowed to bring a guide dog to work/etc. A quadriplegic employee might need a big list of accommodations. Basically, stick a pin in this idea for now: *an employer is required by law to accommodate your disability.*
* Known - your employer is only responsible to accommodate disabilities they know about.
* Qualified - This is the second big caveat; you have to be minimally qualified to do the job. For example, I've passed the bar exam in my state, but my sister (still a law student) hasn't. My sister cannot use the ADA to secure a job as an attorney because she hasn't met the minimum qualifications for the position.
* Undue Hardship - The third and final caveat, and the place every fucking boss in the fucking world will try and hide behind. Fortunately, courts and HR departments take a dim view of bosses that try and bitch about how it's ""undue hardship"" for you to get to work from home. That's not how this works. The law presumes that it \*isn't\* an undue hardship unless the accommodation requested really messes things up somehow. For example, if you were a construction worker or retail employee wanting to work from home, well, there's really no work you can do from home. If you're a spreadsheetologist, you can easily do your job from home.

&amp;#x200B;

**Rethinking the Hypothetical:**

Let's take that 30 year old who despises his make-believe job.

One of the big reasons he hates his job is because around 10:00am, he gets searing migraines that are so overwhelming he feels like he has to lie down. He doesn't take any medication, and he has no idea what's causing them.

Remember above where we talked about the law? We didn't discuss one critical word: *Disability*. The ADA defines disability as ""**a physical or mental  impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, a person who has a history or record of such an impairment, or a person  who is perceived by others as having such an impairment.**""

Keep in mind that just because our employee has migraines doesn't mean he has a disability. The migraines are only a disability under the ADA if they ""substantially limit \[a\] major life activity."" That's right, it is YOUR job to explain what the major life activity is. In this case, we'll say that these major life activities are *concentration, self-care, self-balancing, walking, communicating,* and *reading*.

Now we've proven that the 30 year old is disabled under the ADA. They are legally entitled to reasonable accommodations.

**Reasonable Accommodations:**

The reasonable accommodations must 1) allow the disabled employee to enjoy the same level of benefits of employment as a non-disabled employee, 2) not create an undue hardship.

*Remember: Deep down, bosses despise their workslaves. They will fight you.*

The employer CAN choose between two reasonable accommodations. For example, let's say our 30 year old hypothetical employee has migraines that are caused by harsh lighting. Rather than let the employee work from home, the employer can simply change the lightbulbs to be less harsh. Conversely, *if the employee doesn't know what's causing the migraines*, changing the lightbulbs is a non-accommodation.

DO NOT GIVE THEM THIS OPTION!!

Stick to your guns. If your disability can only be accommodated by working from home, explain to HR that there is no possible adjustment that can be made to the business environment. Do not compromise for ""fewer"" migraines.

**The ""Good"" Use of the ADA:**

A lot of people are simply unaware of their rights and are agonizing at a job they are qualified to do, but are miserable because of a disability. It might be something they themselves don't know they have, like ADD, PTSD, OCD, depression and recurring panic attacks.

\*Unfortunately, sleep apnea/insomnia is the ""bridge too far"". Plaintiffs have unsuccessfully attempted to sue their employers for not accommodating a later start time because they can't get enough sleep the night before. It's bullshit that it's not considered a disability, I know, but it's just something to be aware of.

\*Phobias have mixed results. Social anxiety resulting from a traumatic event that more closely aligns with PTSD will probably be considered a disability. An irrational fear of going to work probably won't be.

Visit a doctor, have them give you a diagnosis AND have them recommend you for accommodations. Keep in mind that while doctors will recommend you for ""reasonable accommodation"", they're not really supposed to since a doctor can't have an opinion on whether an accommodation is reasonable or not.

Your letter should look like this:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;To Whom It May Concern,  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. ContingencyFees visited my offices on XX/XX complaining of recurring severe headaches and dizziness. He voiced concerns that these headaches are causing a decline in his work performance because he can't control their onsets. I performed XYZ tests and a CT scan to confirm that Mr. ContingencyFees did not have a brain tumor, cancer or other brain abscesses.  It is my professional medical opinion that Mr. ContingencyFees suffers from chronic recurring migraine headaches.  
&gt;  
&gt;His migraine headaches routinely limit his normal activities and can arise without warning. He has an extensive diary dating from the past nine months when he began to track his pain. There appears to be no trigger or immediate cause, but the impacts of the migraines are lessened when Mr. ContingencyFees is at home and can safely lie down and turn down lights without embarrassment or discomfort.  
&gt;  
&gt;I therefore recommend that Mr. ContingencyFees be allowed to perform his work duties from home to the greatest extent his employer is able to accommodate him.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sincerely,  
&gt;  
&gt;Doctor NoMalpractice

&amp;#x200B;

**The ""Bad"" use of the ADA**

**I** don't, in good conscience, **encourage you to fake a impossible-to-physically-diagnose disability in order to work from home**, **because** while it's likely **you'll never be caught**, *it's really unfair to all those other people who also want to work from home but aren't disabled.* You know, like, if your student loans got forgiven, think about how unfair it would be to all those other people who made all their payments already...?

Plus, it's kind of scumbag behavior, right? Having to pretend you have a disability so you can make your life substantially better? Think about how unfair that would be to your boss and your workplace! You're basically stealing from your company.

There are just so many people that would be hurt by you faking an impossible-to-diagnose-disability to get out of work. I can't even think of who those people might be because there are so many of them.

It's also just bad. Jesus would be so fucking pissed at you.

If everyone did it, no one would be a wageslave and how sad would that be? Who would be there to deliver my Amazon packages?

Most businesses couldn't survive if everyone suddenly started working from home (involuntary cough).

Don't do it.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this was a worthwhile read.

Hello everyone how‚Äôs everyone handling those couple weeks?

I imagine that most from this community agree that the labor policies works against the American people and fighting for it was never in our American mind, since the US being the epitome of capitalism for the world. 

We have almost no policies regarding mandatory overtime, vacation time and sick leave. Looking for more options such as unions are 100% frowned upon and can get you fired instantly, not only that, most of the time the employee have 0 resources to work against the employer, since he won‚Äôt have time (having to work more than 40 hours a week) or money to last litigation for that long. 

Since money and time is short from the average American it is hard to ‚Äújust find a better job‚Äù and because of it, most of us are scared to go to ER in case of emergency for our problems since it is hard to get a good job with medical insurance. Besides all that I have to remember everyone that this is the country with the highest GDP in 2019 and our ‚Äúessential‚Äù workers are getting paid in pennies. 

After seeing and participating in the BLM my heart pounded and I realize this is the time to fight for our rights. The only reason we don‚Äôt it is because of this exact system which make us tired and frightened that we have to work no matter what or we will become homeless

For me and many other Americans the American dream is not unregulated consumption but freedom and companionship with others in this country. The same country in which it is putting the life of our kids and teachers in danger, the same country in which leads the cases for the COVID-19, I am not even going to touch about ilegal immigration since it is a sensitive topic...

I think we should start a movement; Workplace freedom, and that it should be taken to the streets. I would fight and die for this cause. This comes from someone that isn‚Äôt lazy, I work hard, I like to make my coworkers and managers proud, I am proud in every place that I work, and even more happy when appreciated. Everyone is threatened with poverty and we are tired of it.

408,I decided not to do anything on my job today.,"Hi, I am at my desk right now, and I just decided to browse reddit and do nothing for the rest of the day.

Usually my job consists of working from 8 am to 4 pm with just a few minutes to have lunch, and when I'm at my desk I work nonstop, this part is ok, not much to complain.

And then theres the clients, many of them are rude, I can't understand why someone thinks it's ok to be rude to someone who doesn't own the company, I am doing my best to help them, but they seem to enjoy mistreating people. My boss is a very unreasonable person, he has this habit of telling us to do something, and then, a few days later, complain for us doing the very thing he ordered us to do.

When we tell him that some client is rude, or treats us badly he says that we need to keep in mind that the client is paying our salary, and we should keep our head down and not say anything. The funny part is that he owns the company, so it makes sense for him to say that, because it isn't any client that pays me, it's him, and his property keeps growing in value, while the workers have to endure shitty clients, minimum wage, unpaid extra hours and rage bursts and absurd requests from my boss.",False,hunx4r,SassyPerere,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hunx4r/i_decided_not_to_do_anything_on_my_job_today/,10,30
409,My relationship with work,"For the last year and a half I've been working at an auto parts warehouse. My job is normally just stocking however on busy days somtimes they get me building orders for stores (picking). I hate doing both of these things especially picking and I don't know why both tasks are beyond easy I even get to listen to my own music but still every second of it is mental agony.

My co workers are by far the worst part of the job. I just want to go there listen to my music do my job then go home. All they talk about all day is sports and alcohol which for someone like me is literal torture. Imagine being locked up for 8 hours a day with people listening to them go on about a topic you hate and a substance you worked hard at to kick. There is one guy there even when i ignore him he just keeps talking I will walk away and come back and the loser is just still going on about whatever.

Now one thing too and I'm not sure if I'm alone with this mindset or not. But I can't force myself to care about my job which has become a big problem for me. Whether it's a manager or not they will be explaining somthing to me about the job and it makes me want to scream at them because they are standing there thinking I actually give a fuck if the company loses money/customers and it just makes me mad for so many reasons. Like first off why do these people care so much for a company that would throw them away first chance they got? Secondly why do they think I should care? It really does drive me crazy I can't force myself to care and as long as I'm not the worst person at my job there I'm happy with what I put in god forbid I'm honest about that fact though.

Since I was a teenager I'm 23 now I've wanted to drive for a living I thought it seemed easy and you don't have co workers. Well turns out the place I work was hiring a part time truck driver so I inquired about it and got the job this was just a couple weeks ago. Did the job for about a week and a half they said I was doing a really good job and I was either early or right on time everyday for the deliveries. Last Wednesday night when I was finishing up my last load I don't know it all just kind of hit me at once that I wasn't happy driving either and no other jobs sound appealing like I literally dont want to work any job and when I realized this I just started sobbing because it's like what do I do? How do I trick my brain into being happy at a place that brings me to tears? My entire day while working is just a mental battle with myself to force myself not to cry. 

I just find it really depressing because I dont see any answers or ways around working. If I was feeling this way because of a relationship everyone would tell me to leave the girl. If I left work everyone would just judge me for not working and my quality of life would go down so what are really my options? I haven't been to work since last Wednesday I had kind of a breakdown we will call it.",False,hv7ntn,Mcfoogle_,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hv7ntn/my_relationship_with_work/,2,8

413,showethought: job dependency is gov't dependency w/ extra steps,"(Thesis). Many conservatives will say that working and having a job is glorious as it's not ""dependency on the goobeermint"", but is dependency on a job any better? 

(1). Dependency on a job just means you're even more in trouble and under water, as you have to adhere to how coercive the power-structures in your job are. 
Noam Chomsky says something similar about how, while we may live in a freemarket/mixed market, crapitalist society, corporations technically often operate as planned command-economies. He makes some really interesting points on that, I'd advise looking into him. 

(2). BUT- Depending on how big the job is, like a corporation, for example, they get subsidies and bailouts from... uh-oh. That's right! The gov't. These jobs are therefore funded and dependent off the gov't, and if you work for them, you are, indirectly/a-few-steps-down-the-line dependent off the gov't. 

(3). Another fact: Gov't prints money, obvi, and to start a business, one need pull out a loan. The loan... that the gov't printed out the money for, for them to pull out. 

(Conc:). In conclusion, a job is just dependency off the gov't with extra steps.

I've finished my degree, and now I'm debating moving into a career where almost all these same people work (unrelated to the degree). I've discussed how I'm interested in doing post grad but I'm going to leave it till after the coronavirus crisis and who knows maybe I'll enjoy/love the work and won't want to. The response to the idea that I'd enjoy/love this work that for these people has been their entire life or the last five to ten years for my younger friends/family is: laughter. They think it's comical that I'd enjoy it, or even love the work.

It's like it's all such a big joke, that the way they've spent their entire lives working is something they laugh at. I can't understand how we live in a world where effectively the bulk of our waking hours is spent doing something that enjoying it is laughable. The ones retiring have spent forty to fifty years doing this and they hate it, but now one of them could fathom why I wouldn't want to do it.

427,The Internet's role in ending work,"The Internet is *neat* because it acts as network of direct access between (almost) every human consciousness on the planet - it is, in a way, human connection manifested - it is collectivism. 

I can hardly think of a better vessel for spreading class consciousness, for example.

The printing press allowed for the production and spread of information on a level never seen before, and its influence on our current collective conditions cannot be understated. It created a whole new set of potentials and possibilities that did not and could not have existed before it.

I think the Internet has a similar function but on a grander scale - now information can be spread nearly instantly and constantly, but the total amount of information at our disposal is increasing exponentially, to the point of absurdity. We can already see the dangers of this 'wealth of information' in the form of dis-information and the difficulty people have in determining what is true from what isn't - in a sense that determination is not based on any external reality, but only our own internal assumptions and biases.

**Seeing isn't really believing - believing is seeing.**

Think about livestreaming - it in a sense has allowed for a destruction of the 9-5 white or blue-collar grind - theoretically, you can point your camera at yourself and turn that in to value, and lots of it - this allows for the commodification of the self in the form of branding a personality and selling it for consumption.

But in that branding you can turn your hobby *in* to the same thing as the 9-5 grind, or maybe something even worse.

Streamers can conjure money out of thin air purely by acting as vessels for advertisement - their value is not solely based on their community, but on their community and the possibility for it to be influenced and sold something else - lots of something else's.

The Internet is weird because we can have this conversation while still being separated by vast distances - it's almost like a rudimentary kind of telepathy between totally separate and distinct people - so are we actually separate and distinct or is that just the surface appearance?

It used to be pretty chill, busy in busy season but this time is different. For the last month and for the foreseeable future, my workplace will be hundreds of customers deep waiting 3 hours or more to speak with us. I work very hard all day long without much other than a lunch hour, it's hard work and our customers are all extremely frustrated with the wait times. On top of carrying out requests and finding solutions for them, I also have to resolve their emotions with the wait times, over and over again and its exhausting, and some of them are just so angry. Don't forget to connect with them on a personal level! Recap! Recognize their business! Use probing questions, SELL!

 I'm forced to work overtime hours after my shift is over because we are so understaffed, EVERY day of the week. There will be consequences for those who log off early before the queue is clear but I haven't found out what that is yet because I'm a poor bastard and want to keep my job that I should be so grateful for. I just got offered to do the support for others like me but then I still have to take calls after closing to help out with that, I feel even more trapped to working like a dog and pretending I love it.

I busted my knee and took a few days off I'm feeling better today and logged in today to clear the emails before my shift starts and among them are so many demands to keep working until the customers are all served, at least 3 a night until about an hour after the shift ends and their all served. I just burst out crying because I know it's getting worse and I'll be working until late into the night, and miss out on spending any time with my family.

And this year is the year I finally paid off my debt, made an investment and put up my parents old house for rent (my parents have another house in which they live in). Below market price, trust me. I know the pain of paying nonsense rental prices.

So the money that I made each month (without any salary) is enough to cover food for myself, bills, gas for my car, insurance, a bit of savings and a bit of allowance I wish to give to my parents. 

I'm not gonna be a multi-millionaire anytime soon, nor will I be traveling around the world or buying a boat. But I can get by without a 9-5 job. 

Yet... My parents look at me disapprovingly when I told them about this. They said it's good that I make some money on the side, but i should just keep on climbing the career ladder and I can have double or triple the money I make now.

My old friends look at me like I'm being weak or giving up on life. They keep telling me that I will regret this decision to leave my career.

My colleagues just think I'm lazy, selfish and a traitor to the company.

The girl that I'm dating thinks that, if I go ahead with this decision, then I'm some sort of a bum who's gonna be homeless soon.

In reality, I'm doing this (letting go of my career and finding other pursuits in life while sustaining myself through my investments and rental) because I'm tired. I'm physically and mentally exhausted. I'm sick of having breakdowns every other week. I'm sick of feeling my heart beat rising and having to deal with anxiety at the workplace.

I want to sleep. I want to enjoy my days. I wanna plant some trees. I want to read books. I want to find my passion in life (which I have no idea what because I grew up thinking I need to work in an office to be successful).

But maybe I've been brainwashed since I was a kid. So even knowing that I have enough money to support myself, I still feel so anxious and so guilty to let go of my job.

458,I'm just playing the game,"In capitalism, it's the goal of the company to make as much money as possible while spending as little as possible. Even the most ""generous"" companies fall under this as the ""generous"" reputation is an investment the helps with worker retention, driving down hiring/training costs. Pay workers too much/give too many benifits and you see diminishing returns, too little and they quit and the company needs to spend money on hiring and training. That's why service workers get paid so little and have no benifits. They are cheaper to replace, so the company won't invest to try and convince them to stay.


By the same logic, it is the goal of the workers to put in the bare minimum amount of time and effort to maintain their career trajectory. Too little effort and they can be fired, too much and best case scenario is they get ""recognized"" for it and promoted, but in general they will just end up under appreciated and under compensated. 


In my line of work (technical field) it's common for management to not notice the difference between hard work and minimum effort, between good results and bad. Because they have no idea what we do.

TL;DR : Got a new job, got new panic attacks, my will to live is gone. 

I started a new job two months ago, amongst the total chaos that is 2020. I took the position because the salary was twice as big as my previous job and I really needed some money.

I won't go into much details as to keep my anonymity, but my duties are mostly related to administration and coordination of projects. 

For the last two months I've been waking up crying, anxious and scared. Each day is new horror, missed deadlines, angry emails, endless talks with clients. Even on weekends I can't keep my head to myself, work is everything I think of. I don't have any hobbies anymore as  my free time is so little and I feel like I'm wasting it by doing what I love. 

My family has old school believes and they think I just have to keep my mouth shut and my head down. 

All of this has triggered my long forgotten anxiety and panic attacks. At this point I've considered giving up, however my partner relays on our shared income and also this would leave an ugly mark on my CV.

Just had flashbacks to when I was an freshly MS grad intern making less than $650 a month living in a mouse-infested shack in the middle of nowhere. 

My job alternated between back-breaking manual labor in the hot sun or transcribing papers to excel sheets that no one gave a shit about. 

But by far the worst part of my job was my stupid boss. She not only would give us no encouragement or direction in our daily tasks, but she would purposely try to turn me and my coworkers against each other with favoritism. It didn‚Äôt work we just hated her more.

She would also tell us off for not doing work when she had assigned us no tasks. She utterly hated the idea of us having fun on the job. Despite the fact that we always completed and exceeded her goals.

So many seem disenfranchised with the system, but you just can't get them to see what you see. They've just become so complacent with it all.

I‚Äôm getting close but could use some inspiration. I run the IT department at a large factory, and I spend my days mostly automating tasks to replace people. It pays well, but it‚Äôs boring and absolutely soul crushing. I‚Äôm just entering my 30s and think I‚Äôm burnt out. I did everything I was supposed to; I went to school, got a degree, bought some land, and found lots of fun new hobbies and friends. The only things that bring me joy anymore is working on my cars, traveling, and of course my friends and family. I need new adventures, new pages to write.

Financially, I could quit my job, rent out my properties, store my other cars, and hit the road in an Airstream trailer or tiny house. I want too, but I just can‚Äôt bring myself to take that leap. What about retirement? What about career growth? What are the risks? It‚Äôs a scary milestone to get past and I‚Äôd like to hear from others who are either planning to do the same thing or have already taken the plunge and gone for it.  Ideally, I‚Äôd rig up a nice vintage trailer to one of my classic cars and live off the road without looking back. I think I need a new adventure, a long one, one from which I may never return.

502,"""Small businesses"" are the worst.","I've been working for one of them for a few (painful) years. Husband is the owner, wife is one of the high level managers (despite having no qualifications for the role).  Basically I'm the only person in a senior position who's not a family member of theirs. I'm also the only one here with the degree and experience for this : I basically fix their messes, train everybody, you get the picture. 

Every newcomer ends up leaving : their work ends on my desk.
Boss expects me to share his enthusiasm and go the extra mile : I'm being paid 30% less than the average for my role. If we count the extra roles that I have to do, it'a more like 50% less. Enough said I think. Bet he is enthusiastic when all the fruits of my labor end in his pockets tho. 

I'm also the only one in management that actually shows up 9 to 5 ( unpaid overtime expected). The family members ? More like 11 to 5 on a good day. 

It's my ""dream job role"" too, like what I wanted to do as a kid. Used to be my hobby and everything, now I hate it. That job really opened my eyes about being anti work.

 I'm not even going to bother looking for a different job, at the end of the day it's all the same garbage. F that I'm just going to be IG-ing and Tiktok-ing and YouTube-ing until I can live off social media fully.

Tl;dr : small businesses will overwork you more, there's no HR so you can't complain, if you're not their family member you will get the short end of the stick.

**Suggested steps needed to change/alter our society in order to move humanity in the right direction:**

* Step 1: Bring awareness of the class struggle within capitalism
* Step 2: Demonstrate the wage slavery concept occurring in everyday capitalism
* Step 3: Using internet propaganda and videos to convince the majority
* Step 4: ???

**A list of solutions contributed by us the Idler community:**

* Solution 1: A Revolution powerful enough to overthrow capitalism
* Solution 2: Transform capitalism into socialism
* Solution 3: Time banking and mutual aid? Build different, preferably local, social structures based on mutual aid
* Solution 4: Immigrate to a different country, away from capitalist societies?
* Solution 5: Waiting for the overlords to automate every single job?
* Solution 6: Become a minimalist? Work less? Participate less in Capitalism? Consume less?
* Solution 7: ???

&amp;#x200B;

Potential ways to practice in our lives by weening from the death grip of Capitalism:

&gt;Do exactly the opposite of what  capitalism demands. Even if it brings you poverty. Capitalism is only  working because we don't want to be poor. And capitalism doesn't like  poor people.  
&gt;  
&gt;Quit your job to care  for your elderly parents. Don't put your parents in a nursing home only  for the reason that you can work furthermore. No, these nursing homes  are a capitalistic invention.  
&gt;  
&gt;Also  kindergarten for infants- better be poor and live in a mobile home or  car than missing your 6 month old baby for a minimum wage slavery. (It's  better to have no children but that's often unpopular to say this)  
&gt;  
&gt;Don't  consume!!! Nobody can promise us big cars - no socialism, no anarchy,  no anything-  only capitalism does and that's why we are in its slavery.  
&gt;  
&gt;Don't  go on vacation, don't buy clothes every month and so on, don't make  debts, don't buy something you can't afford, don't drive a car. You will  become very humble to life, earth, distance, time and the real  meaningful things in life.

Boot camp and A school was fun i will admit but it was all downhill from there. You literally live at your job, when you‚Äôre not at your job your personal life is extremely controlled. There‚Äôs this sort of quasi religious culture that you‚Äôre expected to fully embrace on and off the clock.

Not to mention all the usual negatives of a modern workplace are magnified. Cut throat politics, sexual harassment, discrimination, underpaid and overworked, no work life balance, oh and the fact that in this line of work not showing up or deserting can land you in jail. 

That‚Äôs the part that fucked with my head the most, the feeling of being trapped and not being able to just quit or refuse some order, the penalties are insane.

So many of them still look on their time in the service with pride, and it parallels so closely with the sort of people who brag about working 13 hours a day.

536,An Anecdote about a Mistake,"I was thinking about this recently and it bummed me out so I figured I'd share haha

It was January of 2015. I had just graduated college in December and was on the job hunt.

I had a good long-term friend reach out to me and ask if I wanted to go on a tour with him and his band - they needed a fill-in bass player for a 1 month tour down the East coast. (For some pretext - I played bass in a bunch of high school bands, did a lot of shows back in the day and I was actually at one point in a band with this dude.)

These guys weren't a big band, and we would be driving around in a not great, but not terrible, van (most likely sleeping in the van a lot of nights). Probably not much food either, BUT we'd be playing music together and hanging out and checking out a bunch of states.

Regardless, I thought about it, and I ended up turning it down because I had just graduated and didn't want a gap between me graduating and me actually getting a job.

Fast forward a month, and I had still not found anything. Actually, I didn't get a job until March (a month after they already returned). I remember looking on social media during that month they were gone and seeing all the cool shows and pictures with fans/people and cool locations. They looked like they had a blast and were just making people happy by playing their music.

I was honestly so bummed I didn't say yes to the experience. All because I was worried about something stupid like a ""gap"" in my resume. Even if I did find work while they were still on tour, I would have preferred being with them anyway.

539,I am torn between my resentment and my justification.,"My job is so simple and pays alot, I operate a tractor.  I could live comfortably w/o it though but I have so much money with it!  I hate the responsibility though, I don't want to have a mundane existence, like get up at this time, go to work every day and have very little time for myself in trade for money, it sucks.  But I can justify it by not having much else to do, my hobbies are only so interesting (and affordable) for so long.  

But what I find fucked is all anybody ever asks about me is my job like it is my only defining characteristic or something, I don't know why nobody else ever takes interest in the other things I do, people never seem to be interested in me, unless I can do something for them other than just my well being.  

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be known as a kind person though someone who you can talk to about anything, not something I don't even really want to be doing.  I've never had people show interest in me though, I've always had to be the one who does all the work in a relationship to keep it going, even when the other individual is having problems like I don't take her out enough.  (so like make your plans for us yourself?!) Honestly, I will understand other than selfishness/narcissism why people are this way with me especially when some others seem to just wake up and people are happy to make a birthday cake when it isn't even their birthday w/o even trying, like where do these people find each other, I've tried to, god how I've tried. 

It is becoming really hard for me to continue doing my job though because of things like resentment and feeling exploited.  I don't want to be a part of the system, I don't want to be famous or have lots money, I don't even care if I am liked or not for the most part.  I want to be able to wake up and have people like my family be happy about my situation, I don't want to just hear every time I talk to them, did you find a job?   Why is that the only that matters to people who care about me?  I guess since I was secluded depressed wreck for so long there is alot of justification for it,  but I don't like feeling like they just want me to be a happy capitalist drone, and I've no wanted ambition for my own business or such, I don't want the commitment.  Just once I would like someone I care about to call me up and be like I hope you stuck it to your job today, fuck them and all they stand for!  That shit would totally cheer me up.

We have a 4.6 star rating, and to be honest I believe that‚Äôs a good number especially for being a small business that has only been around for a couple of years. 

Whenever we get a negative review, 3 stars or less, my boss always yells at us in the work group chat. The constant yelling whenever bad reviews are posted have really gotten to me, and I don‚Äôt find it fair since my boss is never at his business anyway. (He lives over 2 hrs away)

Sometimes I feel that my boss doesn‚Äôt take into consideration that some people just might not like what we have to offer, especially if it‚Äôs a speciality item that appeals to a certain taste preference. He immediately ask us things like: ‚Äúwhat happened, what was wrong with the food? You guys need to do better.‚Äù

551,the system is so screwed ! (Rant),"So I‚Äôm back to work tonight after a week off and I really can‚Äôt be bothered. I‚Äôm so sick of working a job that means literally nothing to me for basically no money. As much as I really hate the whole current system of working part of me thinks that if I made more then at least I‚Äôd be a bit more ok with it !

At my current place I‚Äôve not seen anyone get a promotion in 3 years and I‚Äôve been wanting to get out but it‚Äôs virtually impossible to get a job elsewhere without experience. Every job post always says minimum 2 years experience and yet the pay is minimum wage. The only way to get experience is to work for free and then inevitably get let go once trained up or pay a fortune to get a degree and even then you‚Äôll be starting on minimum wage. What ever happened to training people ? Half of these jobs I see don‚Äôt even require experience it‚Äôs like once you‚Äôve been shown how to do it once that‚Äôs it ! 

I‚Äôm not even someone who‚Äôs opposed to hard work in any way, at my current job I‚Äôm probably one of the most productive there as it‚Äôs so mind numbingly boring that it‚Äôs better to just work to pass the time. This obviously goes unnoticed because managers only see the bottom line and as long as it‚Äôs in profit they don‚Äôt care about anything else.

It‚Äôs just insane and it‚Äôs going to get even worse after the pandemic with even more people fighting to get any minimum wage job they can due to being left unemployed !

555,The glorification of busy will destroy us.,"The clarification of busy will destroy us. Without space
for healing, without time for reflection, without an
opportunity to surrender, we risk a complete discontent
from the authentic self. He burn out on the feels of
willfulness, and eventually cannot find our way back
to center. And when we lose contact with our core, we
are ripe for the picking by the unconscious media and
other market forces. After all, consumers press on
the centered. The further we are from our intuition
knowing, the more easily manipulated we are. And the
more likely we are to make decisions and affair to goals
that don‚Äôt serve our healing and transformation. To
combat this, we have to form the conscious intention
to prioritize our inner lives. To notice our breath,
our bodies, our feelings. To step back from the fires
of overwhelm and remember ourselves. It may feel
counter-intuition in a culture that is speed-addicted, but
the slower we move, the faster we return home.

558,Should I just say fuck it and have a bunch of part time jobs and no ‚Äúcareer‚Äù?,"22F here. I thought for the longest time that I was so career-oriented. I went to a reputable private university, am now in grad school, and had so many internships and part time jobs in the past that I did very well in. 

It wasn‚Äôt until this year that I realized how shitty work can actually be. January was the first time I had a 40 hour a week internship as a teaching assistant. I HATED it. I came home crying the first day and knew I didn‚Äôt want to do this for the rest of my life (I‚Äôm studying music education). I thought studying music education would allow me to ‚Äúhave a career in music.‚Äù Boy was I wrong. It‚Äôs just a career for us musicians who realized we weren‚Äôt getting by as ‚Äújust musicians.‚Äù And that‚Äôs the truth. Because it sucks to have to teach a class on something you‚Äôre passionate about and not have one student listen to you.

I have so much I want to do. I want to travel, I want to focus on my personal music, tour and do a ton of shows and open mics, have experiences, have a cute Instagram feed that I‚Äôm actually not ashamed of, BE FREE. I want to live in a van! I want to live in a new city even if my boyfriend and I need to have roommates because we just want to live there for a year! 

I‚Äôm way too young to have a career and I‚Äôm freaking out because the pandemic is going to make it THAT much harder to get by in life without a full time career. But holy fuck. I haven‚Äôt done anything with my life, and once this is over, I‚Äôll be damned if I don‚Äôt get to do the things I want before settling down into a career that I (probably) won‚Äôt even care about. I have so many different things I could do - I have a ton of experience as a writer and editor for publications, so I could be a freelancer. I‚Äôm a certified fitness instructor, so I could do that. I can teach music lessons because that‚Äôs literally what my degree is in, so should I just say fuck it and do a bunch of part time jobs for now til I‚Äôm ready?

568,Losing Faith in My Profession..,"TLDR: sick of working for greedy ass attorneys and being undervalued as an employee. Sick of the burnout of the industry in exchange for menial wages. Thinking of changing my career, but not super confident about what I‚Äôd do or where I could find work in this economy.

I have been a paralegal for the last 7 years. Only ever worked for really awful, selfish attorneys who pay their employees like shit. Even worked for one firm that paid their newly barred attorneys less than some of their staff. Finally got in the door with what I first perceived to be a great firm that paid me well enough to thrive and had a pretty chill work environment - but they hired me under false pretenses. Said I‚Äôd be filling in for someone on an extended maternity leave and then would shift my job duties a bit but remain on their staff after she returned. Then laid me off after she returned from leave. 

Due to being unemployed for a couple of months I felt I needed to accept a job offer when it finally came. Of course, it came with an 800$ a month pay cut to what I was making at the last job that fucked me over. This new job I‚Äôve had almost a year. They originally offered me a whopping 18$/hour - not at all competitive for my profession and level of experience in my area. Like I said though I was unemployed so I needed to take something. I countered their offer and they ended up coming up a bit. 

So after working there 90 days I was eligible for health benefits, which they said extended to dependents only, but not my spouse. However, their new hire paperwork stated that was not true. Shady as fuck. Anyway, they ended up splitting the cost of my spouse‚Äôs health insurance with me after I asked if there was some mistake. 

My boss (the guy whose name is in the name of the firm) has a terrible temper and will go off on people if he even misunderstands something to be wrong when it‚Äôs not. During the quarantine we didn‚Äôt have the luxury of keeping this abuse within the confines of our offices - instead he would just do it on our daily conference calls with the whole office present. I cannot go into work just to be anxiously avoiding the boss every single day. Who the fuck is motivated by that? 

This firm underpaying me and favoring others (pretty much the rest of our small office) who have long standing personal relationships with the boss is already stressful and depressing. It makes it worse since I have billable hours and I know what our clients are billed for my time I can really see how much money I bring into the firm. Only to make so little that I can barely afford to live in a shitty apartment in the ghetto. 

During the first month of lockdown we laid off three people (1 full time employee and two part timers) saving the company an easy 60k/year plus the cost of health care any everything else. Since all of our clients are insurance companies our income hasn‚Äôt really been affected at all. 

Due to the layoffs, my workload has more than doubled.  They didn‚Äôt lay-off any attorneys of course. Meaning nobody else‚Äôs workload increased but mine. I‚Äôm expendable as usual. I have been billing above and beyond my quota consistently, and even more so after the layoffs. I am bringing in about 10-20k extra a month more than my quota calls for. Meanwhile, boss man still owns his three cars, pays his monthly dues to the most exclusive and expensive country club in the area, and all the other luxuries he is afforded in part due to my labor. 

As of Memorial Day apparently I will not be receiving paid holidays any longer. This of course was done without any warning or even informing me. I found out when the deposit hit my account. Does my boss really think he needs that $200 more than I do? So disrespectful and dishonest. And this was no mistake because I have to fill out my time card on paper and my HR manager enters the payroll. Literally still haven‚Äôt said anything about it to me. 

I‚Äôm beyond over being treated like shit. I feel so disheartened by the entire legal industry. I‚Äôve worked for nothing but selfish attorneys just out to fuck their own employees out of money. This month I will be hitting my quota and nothing more. I‚Äôm tired of busting my ass for nothing. 

Thinking of a career change, but no idea what I‚Äôd do. I don‚Äôt really have any other skills besides writing, research, analytics, and organization. Only dream I had before was to be an attorney, but between the student loans, time spent on graduate school, my experience working for/with attorneys, and the collapsing economy I think I‚Äôve decided against it.",False,hts6oq,WhyMe8675309,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hts6oq/losing_faith_in_my_profession/,31,12

574,Going back to work after three months of quarantine.,"I have to preface this by saying that I recognize that the circumstances of my time off are unique and not everyone was given this chance to stay safe at home during all of this. I'm not making this post to brag.

In about two hours, I'll be starting my first shift since being laid off due to the state's stay at home order, which is still in effect until August 1.

I work in auto parts. I hated this job before I got laid off. It made me miserable. It's an overwhelmingly toxic environment and the work isn't meaningful whatsoever. There are a lot of factors that go into why I'm stuck in this job, but that isn't the focus of why I'm writing.

These last three months have been far from a vacation. My wife and I had our first son near the end of last year, and parenting is more than a full-time job with him. On top of that, we wound up getting quarantined with my sister and her two kids (under 10 years old). She was switching houses since she got a new job, but the quarantine put a lid on that. She wasn't able to start work, so she couldn't move into her new place. I effectively became a parenting figure to her two kids. It has been a full house.

Despite not being able to sleep during these last few months, having to now parent three children instead of just my son, and juggling keeping the house in order with entertaining two preteens with cabin fever, I have been so unbelievably happy.

Having the ability to see/hold/interact with my son whenever I want, being able to dedicate real time to home improvement projects, helping my nephew with his distance-learning classes, these are all ""jobs"" that have felt more meaningful than anything I've done since entering the workforce at 16. Going to bed tired every day because I'm taking part in what's happening around my home feels so much different than going to bed tired because I've been dealing with shitty people all day.

It's not like I could have used this time to get into a different job, no one is hiring right now. I did get the ball rolling on some college classes to work towards a degree that I abandoned when I was younger, so that *maybe eventually* I can move on to something different, but classes don't start til the fall. No matter what, I'm stuck where I am for now.

I'm just heartbroken that now I have to go back to a job that I hate, to a boss that doesn't recognize the work I do, working with people I don't like, and dealing with the general public who treats me like dog shit because I work in the automotive industry. I can't believe the amount of time that I will be away from my wife and son, that I won't be able to hold either of them whenever I want.

There isn't really a solution here. I'm not delusional, I know no one is going to pay me to stay at home and take care of my family. I won't magically luck into more meaningful work. It's not that easy, and the constant rhetoric of ""work a job you love"" doesn't make it any easier. Eventually I will get into a line of work that I enjoy, one that won't make me end every day feeling like I'm wasting my life. But for now... ***fuck.***

If nothing else, my experience should serve as an argument for paid paternity leave. I got the opportunity to fully take part in my son's growing up for the past 90 days. The fact that it took a quarantine to allow me to do that is borderline sickening.

I just cannot believe how distraught I am.

576,"And it's go boys go, they time your every breath...","TL;DR: Dutch situation and a guy almost losing his arm in a steel mill.

 Title comes from a song that perfectly describes the daily working conditions here, ""the chemical worker's song"" by great big sea.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edAxujKev1I

 Last year I graduated college as a mechanical engineer, title and all. The first boring half year afterward was spent CAD-drawing specialized depth-variable swimming pools for the filthy rich, because I needed a job FAST or risk being homeless. This paid a whopping 2100‚Ç¨ per month after taxes. Sounds like a lot, until you realize The average rent for a normal apartment here is now about 1200‚Ç¨ in the free sector, unless you want to commute 3 hours per day, a tank of gas is 60‚Ç¨, mandatory health Insurance is 120‚Ç¨ etc, etc you get the point. There is social housing where you pay 600-ish per month, but the waiting lists for that can be 20 years.

 So i decided to look around for greener grass, and came to work at the country's only city sized Steel Mill as an installation manager. 

The wages are much better at about 3k‚Ç¨ per month after taxes. That also immediately means the dutch tax service wants me to pay back 600‚Ç¨/month for the next year due to creative calculation of the assistance I received over the past year., but that's a different story of how the government works here (spoiler: kafka would be proud). 

 But the working conditions for the guys on the floor... holy. shit. I'm lucky to spend 85% of my time doing office work and meetings. It's dark, loud, filthy, cold and outright dangerous. Last week, a guy in the section of the factory that I am responsible for had his arm and part of his leg hit from a water hose due to human error. Doesn't sound bad, except this water hose had about 500 bar (7250 PSI) of pressure on it. Almost cut clean through his arm and part of his leg, his colleague saved his life by applying a tourniquet. And all the bosses said to me was ""well aren't you Lucky that you just started, and it was someone from an outside company, so this is in no way your fault or ours!"" Dude. A man almost died of blood loss and might lose his arm, this happend in MY part of the installation. The fuck. The same happened when a colleague opened a supposedly empty material bunker, and got an eye full of magnesium dust for his troubles. The reaction: ""should've worn the new fully enclosed safety glasses!""

That's just the working conditions here, but there's so, so much more i could say about the state of Europe and especially the Netherlands at the moment for some of the Americans that dream of coming here. 

 Basically it boils down to the fact that there are different massive problems, like the enormous tax pressure on native dutch people (Not for big companies or expats, which is why we are SWAMPED with expats and investment firms buying up all the houses and driving prices to insane levels, think 500k‚Ç¨+ for a normal terraced house in and around large cities), but the impossibility of being paid liveable wages and the top 1% hoarding what they can are still very much the same.",False,hqwarq,Mjollner06,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hqwarq/and_its_go_boys_go_they_time_your_every_breath/,1,1

581,Entitlement of the upper management,"Last year, in 2019, I had to do an unpaid internship for around 8 months to get into a company. I know that's degrading, but I had no other choice, I was shifting careers after dropping out of my Masters due to a mental health breakdown and in India where I live, that was the only way I have to shift careers.

Now here comes the entitlement I want to speak about. After those 8 months, the CTO had a chat with me 4-5 WEEKS after I expressed interest in a full time position. And get this, he tells me that I have the skills but since their company develops data solutions, I need to be able to come up with real world problems that my skills can be applied to.

I was fuming, isn't it the upper management's job to get contracts from other businesses whose problems they want to solve and then tell us that this is the problem, now solve it? This guy was sitting there, asking me to do that complete process, his fucking entitlement was something to see.

Luckily (unfortunately in hindsight), I thought about a potential problem and laid it to him, and made some progress solving it, after which I was hired.

Now, 7 months into the job, I hate it, I absolutely despise it with every fibre of my being, it turns out that the upper management really is incapable of bringing in projects and contracts from other businesses. I am working on a dead end project now and that CTO is taking out his frustrations on me by saying shit like I need to communicate more and be more social with my co workers.

I have been applying to jobs since 3 months now, must have sent around 1000+ applications, have had 4-5 interviews that went till the final stage but no results.

I absolutely despise being a wage slave in the current system but that's all I can do.

583,Your life as a worker starts a few days after you are born,"In most countries, only a few days after birth, mothers are pressured to dump their kids off at daycares so they can continue working due to financial pressures and lack of benefits for new moms.

This teaches the toddler, at a very impressionable young age, that they are not as important as they thought as individuals. It leaves a strong impression on the toddler that the most important person in his life... the mother who birthed him and nurses him, has more important shit to do than nurse him. Unlike every mammal on earth, humans, think they are too good to nurse their own young. They feed them the fish-flakes equivalent of mother's milk.. a fake mix of cow's milk powders and vitamins... every study on earth has shown that formula is not as good as natural human breastmilk for babies... but the CEO's and company owners of the world have convinced us others. They have used their power to convince us to abandon our own children to strangers care, and let our breasts dry off to be useless... all that so we can continue being workers and working hard and contributing to our owners

Then starts school.  Where we will be ritualistically imprisoned every day in an indoor forced training facility/school to condition us to get up early against our will and sit on a bus against our will to sit in a closed building all day against our will being told how to think and what to do and how to speak every day... to prepare us for a lifetime of forced servitude/work as adults. This is how we are forced to spend all of our ""free"" lives, no matter what part of the world you live in. And retirement at 65? A third of us dont even live to 65. And out of those that do, only a quarter or so are free of serious health problems and pain at that age. It's like playing the lottery, but the way employers and companies sell these ""retirement packages"" and deals and pensions... most of those people will never see it.

We just slave our lives away.. and then... nothing. there goes the only existence we have... and it is taken away from us generation after generation ""Voluntarily""... we sell our days away for money... but you can never buy those young/healthy pain-free days back... no matter how much money we made.

But yet we still teach kids from a very early age that this is whats best for them and the world. But it is not. It is only whats best for CEOs and billionaires who need people to work to buy their crap and rent their condos and they need workers to make them money.

590,Here is a 3-pronged strategy for a meaningfully better future,"1. Short term - (~2 months) - Stop the Devos/Trump Death March

The main reason Trump and Betsy Devos want to send thousands of children and teachers to their deaths (and thousands of others via community spread) in the fall is to maintain a social order in which most people are just chattel, i.e. ""human capital stock"" for oligarchs and an oligarchic system.

If the human cattle have too much free time and energy to think, they might start getting ideas about freedom from their enslavement to our oligarchic system.

Better to force march them to their deaths in the thousands to maintain the status quo.  

If there was ever a time for aggressive civil disobedience, it's in ignoring and protesting the Devos/Trump Death March orders.

Conservatively estimated, over 140,000 Americans have already died under Trump, and that could easily be hundreds of thousands more if the Devos/Trump Death March goes forward.  Children and teachers will die and spread the virus throughout their homes and communities.  

If the Devos/Trump Death March goes forward, there should be GENERAL STRIKE to stop it.  

STOP THE NEEDLESS MASS DEATHS BEFORE THE COMMUNITY SPREAD GROWS EXPONENTIALLY!

2. Medium term - (2-6 years) Turn the Senate meaningfully blue

In order to change the country meaningfully long term, we have to take control of the Senate, which disproportionately gives power to sparsely populated red states.  

We should turn the sparse populations of the red states to our advantage by flooding them with civilized blue state people.  

If you have or can get a job that can be done remotely (and maybe even if you don't), if you want cheaper housing than can be found in desirable blue states/cities, and if you would like living in a functional country and a habitable planet, consider moving to one of the Dakotas to help turn them blue.

It's already happening to Texas to some extent, and it's certainly possible with the Dakotas as well.  With a more permanent 60+ member majority in the Senate, a much more progressive agenda on climate change, healthcare, and economic justice/freedom would then be possible.  

3. Long term - (4-12 years) Shorten the full time work week to create a permanent foothold for future labor victories

 In any war, including a class war, it is important to win permanent victories that make further victories possible.  

The working and middle classes need to claw back the last 80+ years of economic and technological progress by implementing a 4 day, 32 hour work week.

This would spread the available work around better, give people additional time to organize, educate themselves, build up their communities, prevent and adapt to climate change, connect with their families and friends and brothers and sisters in solidarity, and enjoy life, which has gone off the rails under the hellscape the oligarchs have forced humanity into.

If we stand in solidarity and fight, we can have a brighter future, a habitable planet, and a functional country without needless mass casualties, without living under a brutal oligarchic political and economic regime, and with a much greater degree of liberty and justice for all.",False,hr0i36,xena_lawless,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hr0i36/here_is_a_3pronged_strategy_for_a_meaningfully/,10,3

Unless you're in something like High Finance, Biglaw, Medicine etc (Aka for the top 5% of people) you 're probably in a shitty job that doesn't compensate you enough compared to the hours,pain and effort put into it. With constant rising expenses, increased rental payments and of course inflation, it seems like you are losing out more each year. Not to mention there are less and less jobs but more and more people. That means the workers bargaining power is getting squeezed out every year. Oh and I haven't even mentioned student loans if thats applicable to you

I was wondering why so many are trying to go intro Crypto, Robin Hood, Dropshipping, Streaming, IG-ing etc. I thought its coz they were impatient lazy fucks who felt like they were too good to get a job and wanted an easy way out.

But as I get older, I realized late capitalism doesn't fucking work. Doing stuff the ""right"" way doesn't seem very good at even getting you a comfortable living. Look how many people are having dead end jobs and still can't even pay their fucking rent. Even when Covid19 is over, the root problems are still gonna be there.

How many rich people actually got rich by working anyway? If I bought BTC 10 years ago and held on, I would be able to retire already. Thats right, I don't contribute any damn value buying some internet coins but somehow I will have more money than several wageslaves combined. I will have my own house, own steady income from using the money to purchase dividends stock, own schedule etc. All of this defies the traditional way of thinking to work for my living. But I don't give a fuck. I'm not here coz I wanna work, I'm here coz I wanna have money to survive.

Realistically I don't expect to be like that and make it big. But I can see why people still try these methods. Because its a great source of additional income on the side especially if you are successful with it. I think in today's world, you have to go to these sort of things just to even get a comfortable living.

Most people still try the traditional way because they are scared stuff that isn't ""traditional"" will blow up in their face. I thought the same but like I said, in today's world I can't even see the traditional way working alone.

BTW you don't even need to be a radical early adopter to make some good bucks on the side. Tesla was 500 in April and is 1500 now. If you put some money in it through an educated guess, you would have made some good side profit. Maybe could even be worth several months salary for way less work.

I guess what I'm trying to say is I used to look down on all those ""Gamblers"" and people trying to find ""another way"" to make a living. But now I realize why they do it.

618,Working is for cuckz; How I achieved a decent life as a DRUGDEALERCEL,"Greetings /r/failed_normies

I¬¥m a 29 year old latincel, living in his own country in SA. A city where the sky is gray.

I had been working through my early twenties. I used to get fired pretty often. My longest job (which was also the best paid) lasted for 6 months. This one was at the only airport in my city; which enabled me to practice my english with native speakers from all over the world.

After my contract ended, I was in a very bad spot: I thought it was going to last more and I would develop a career, how naive of me. I had some shekels left but my health was shit due to the 12 hour day/night shifts.

I was also going through a awful period of my love life. I all converged into a single year and I was almost driven to suicide.

My age was around 24-25 during this dark period of my life. It was either pillz, booze or weed. Im glad I didnt try coke when I was offered in one of my nights out trying to cope with the pain.

I hit rock bottom when I was completel fucked up the whole day. I was almost out of money because I already spent it on escapism. I wanted a way out. I was so desperate.

I called a music teacher I had years ago. He listened to me and suggested I visit a professional. I stated my treatment with desvenlafaxine.

After some months of taking my medicine, I started feeling better. I had so much time (and so little money left) that I had to look for money after 5 years unemployed and NEETbux is completely non existant here. So I started contacting foreigners and tourists who were coming to my country and ofc looking for drugz to have a better vacation.

I realized that foreignerz pay a lot as long as you are reliable, your product is good and make everything easy for them. Oh, and if you know english. It all started becoming better and better and I now sell exclusively to foreignerz.

Im not rich or wealthy by any meanz , but this is my main source of income (being a translator and touristic guide is nothing but a facade)

With the money, I started buying instrumentz, gym equipment and healthy food. I have a never ending supply of weed for myself.

Also, I play the blues everyday to cope. Although I remained in complete isolation aside from two close friendz. I have no social circle and all the girlz I get are from dating appz

Many people around here have asked me about my Incel status. I have to say, I¬¥m a firm believer of the blackpill.

I get bitchez here and there. I get no girlfriend and I wont have one. Because CHAD ALWAYZ WINZ. I should accept thiz fact and move on. Get as many pussy as I can while working on becoming my best self with all the time I have since I dont have a real job. I only spend 3 hours a week on this doing the deliveriez.

The NEET life chose me; I made the best out of it

619,I got fired from my office job this morning. It made me realize corporations treat customers the same way they treat employees. (Long Rant),"I had been working this boring office job for about a year now. We're just like any other business, we provide a service. For the most part I liked this job, easy work, decent pay, it had the occasional office politics which I stayed out of, most of the time I came in, did my 9-5, and left. Easy as that. 

The thing I enjoyed most was working with my customers (or as we're supposed to call them, clients). I was responsible for bringing in new clients and getting them into our system. With phones ringing all day, we were supposed to bring in 80-100 calls EACH per day, with no call going over 5-10 minutes. The service we provide can range from $100-$500 PER YEAR. Now look, if I'm paying as much as $500 per year on anything, I want the full rundown. I want to know what I'm paying for, what that gives me, everything, I'd want every single detail. As did every single client that called in. The issue is you can't do that in 5-10 minutes, and it always leads to clients calling back unhappy, confused, or simply wanting to cancel.

Me, I did everything I could for my clients, I'd answer everything question, concern, anything and everything. Wasn't good enough for my boss as my calls lasted anywhere from 20-30 minutes, cause guess what? I cared about these people, and they deserve a good damn service if it's up to $500 a year. So I was only doing maybe 30-40 calls a day versus the 80-100 we're supposed to do.

Now you could say yeah, you only got half the clients you we're supposed to get. The thing is we have a satisfaction grade every week. The average you're supposed to have is around 85%. Now I don't mean to blow my own horn here, but I was bringing in an average of 92-95% for weeks. I felt like I was hitting home runs every week till this morning.

I get the call this morning saying I'm being let go for poor performance, as I'm not taking a correct number of calls a day, and it's been an ""issue"" for a while. I realized today that even customers are just $ signs to CEOs and your boss. Funny thing is my wages have stayed the same since I started, while my supervisor and boss always go on about their bonus checks and raises. My satisfaction grade meant nothing this entire time, all it meant was I'm bringing in half the pay for my boss.....

I'll miss my clients and I feel for them as I feel only a few of us actually cared for them, and focused on them versus focusing on the number of calls. Corporations don't care about their employees, and I now realize they don't give two shits about their customers either....

637,Calling out of work today after scrolling this sub,"Dread and despair creep in as I scroll through this feed. All true statement that shake me to my core. American greed is insane... Greed driven from exploitation, hate and selfish agendas. 

Here I thought what would make me happy, having grown up with nothing was money. Well I drive a brand new Miata, have a top teir gaming rig, all the guitars one could want and a bunch of other trivial possessions and none of them truly make me happy. (Well the Miata does because I'm a gear head  and honestly only get true enjoyment from spirited drives or track days and my doggo of course).

 I want to gain happiness through what I do. Which would consist of a 4 day work week of 8 hours. None of this ""oh well it's a 9 hour day cause you get an hour for lunch"" I'd rather deep throat a cliff bar in the bathroom than take unpaid lunches. In a society where we are forced to be a slave to the grind, I want to at least have enjoyment or meaning in my work. But of course all the meaningful jobs don't pay nearly a living wage. So I'm stuck in this perpetual dance between happiness and crippling depression. I will likely continue to be wage slave sucking the dick of capitalism. But hopefully it's temporary. Just enough until I can set my life up to pursue other endeavors and use the opportunities I'm given to get to see the world and learn where my place is. 

I work as a engineer at a software company, who recently whored us out. We now work for this Indian company which has an even worse work/life balance. 

Fuck the system, I need a day off for me. I'm not even logging my sick time. My new company policy has our sick days come out of our vacation time. The previous policy was unlimited. It's fucking sickening. 

For fucks sake why couldn't I have just been laid off so I can get paid more...

Side note: with how shitty the US has been I really want to move to Canada. It's easy for me I'm single, 24 and live in taxachussetes so it's not a super long journey. Don't know what I'll find there... But it's gotta be better, or at least more sane than the states... Right?

They said that coming back was entirely voluntary and if you don't want to, they won't make you. Nice one.

I'm happier. I'm less stressed. I'm, for once, kind of enjoying my work. Apparently these aren't accepted reasons.

My parent cannot pay for school for me since they have a mortgage, bills, food, court fees, and three other kids to worry about. I have been working a variety of shit jobs to try and save up some money so I can afford to go to school.

I am miserable. Beyond miserable. The vast majority of my misery comes from work. 

I am looking forwards to school, and being able to learn and meet new people and not live in a shitty small town, but am scared about the future. 

I genuinely don't know how long I can last working these jobs, especially if I have to do it while studying. My desire to live has been hacked at by work so much that I feel as though it is inevitable that I will kill myself if I keep working.

I don't want to stay dependant on my parent for any longer, but I know that I won't be able to support myself, which makes me feel even worse. I'm also either working, being exhausted by work, sleeping to recover from work, or desperately trying to enjoy my little free time left over. I feel as though any possible hobbies or art creation that I could phase into being lucrative are not possible.

Even if I do get through school, I'm afraid I will land in the same position, or find any new jobs I can get just as bad.

I just wish there was a way for me to live a decent life without having to work these awful jobs, I know they say ""someone has to do it"" but with how miserable these places make you, I don't think a society in which someone has to do these things is one worth having.

671,The People's UBI,"Since we cant rely on our elected officials to make this country better, I would like to help start our own UBI system. This ""Universal Basic Income"" would not use dollars or crypto currency but rather a nonvolatile token system (that doesn't fluctuate with the financial market) as a medium of labor exchange, let me give you an example:


You log into a website/app using a unique ID of some sort. The resource is free and would award you a small amount of ""tokens"" each month to be used within this system. Any good or service that an individual can provide (lawfully) could be exchanged for tokens.

Let's say John handcrafts furniture as a side hustle but people are reluctant to spend their hard earned dollars on such things so John uses the aforementioned resource to let his local community know that he's selling furniture. He gets a few hits and a few more tokens in his account that he then uses to set up a massage appointment with Karen. Karen uses her tokens to trade to Nancy for some knickknacks and handmade jewelry. The process repeats..

The more active users on said platform that are providing services, the more useful this ""token"" becomes. Imagine having these kinds of options available. We would only need dollars for our basic necessities and maybe a few splurge items. The tokens would be for services like lawncare, car detail, music lessons, backyard vegetables, etc. Literally anything a local individual could provide.

Granted there would have to be some rules and stipulations to keep things legal and fair. That's where we all come into play. We could make this a community effort with the highest upvoted issues receiving the highest priority for change. A democratically operated and community managed system. 

This would be a great undertaking from all involved. Basically relying on volunteer services to get it off the ground (web devs, coders, app builders, legal docs, etc.) But the end result has the potential for national change if not global change.

The only monetary expense (that I can see) would be to run a scalable cloud server(s) to handle the requests. No outside financial institutions, no ads, no data sold. Donations would the primary lifeblood of the platform letting the people decide when and if this resource should continue. 

Just some thoughts. A lot to process and many kinks to work out but I'm ready to make my own change in this world if you all want to contribute.

I am sick of these expectations that always keep rising, while my salary stays the same. In fact, even if my salary were to hypothetically increase with the expectations, I would still be just as sick of it.

How do you handle expectations at work? My mental health has been torn to shreds by expectations at university and now at work. I want to, and I do slack off and do just enough work that matches the salary I receive, yet when management tells me about my decreasing productivity, my sense of self-worth takes a nose dive off a cliff.  


How do you decouple your sense of self-worth from productivity at work?   
I have tried to focus on my hobbies like gaming and reading novels but it's just a stopgap measure for me because as soon as I am reminded of my low productivity with increased expectations, my self-worth takes a hit and disappears.   
A major part of the reason behind this might be my declining mental health which is directly tied to my productivity (fuck, I hate that word) at work and school due to years of being indoctrinated by a system which demands increased productivity honed by developing a competitive spirit (with the huge population of India, that's the only way to get just your pinky toe, not even the foot, inside the door of getting a job, no execution of labor laws here), with decreasing compensation for the same and I have no words to express how much I despise it.

683,What is the absolute worst job you ever had?,"Back in 2006 I worked as a corrections officer in a medium security prison for $8.25 per hour. A laughable wage for the job being asked of me, but it gets worse. I was in the first class when the state decided to privatize the prison. The state officers that had worked there were making something like $17 per hour.

This place legit had something like 300% employee turnover on an annual basis. Entire classes of new officers would disappear within 2 weeks of finishing training. They just stopped showing up for their shifts.

The shifts were 8 hours, during which you only got 1 15 minute break. No lunch. At the end of your shift you might not get to go home. They had what was called ""mandatory overtime."" You would literally get locked into whatever part of the prison you were working in. Central control would disable the locks on the exit doors in your sector so you couldn't leave. To further prevent you from leaving nobody came to relieve you for a break in your subsequent shifts. Once I worked 32 hours straight with 1 15 minute break about 3 hours into my first 8 hour shift.

You would think that with all these hours worked you'd get a fat paycheck even at $8.25 per hour. You'd be wrong. Only 10 hours of overtime per pay period was paid at time and a half. The rest was given to you as ""comp time"" which was paid time off you could take in the future. Except nobody ever was able to take it. They were so chronically short staffed no request was ever approved.

The fuckery didn't end there. At the end of your employment you didn't get paid for the comp time unless you were in a very narrow set of circumstances. They wouldn't pay out your comp time if you voluntary quit or were fired for cause. The only way you could really collect that comp time money is if you were 100% disabled on the job and being let go for medical reasons.

This place was hell. Since it was a private, for profit prison everything that didn't keep the inmates alive was cut. To make the shareholders richer. The library was closed to save money by firing the staff that worked there. The chaplain was fired, so no religious services. They closed the inmate workshop, education, the garden, gym, everything. These inmates were locked up all day with nothing but 3 channels of TV to watch. The lucky ones were able to get a job in the kitchen.

Which brings me to the food. To increase shareholder value the inmates calorie count was reduced to the minimum level allowed by law. The food was of such awful quality I wouldn't feed it to hogs as slop. Just the absolute nastiest shit you have ever seen.

686,I was anti work all my life and just didn't know it/a rant,"So I'm 28. I still live at home. Work part time retail (full time hours this month though since everyone is on Vacation)

I feel a lot of shame I still live at home. And honestly that's another conversation right there, how along with our society being made to believe being a wage slave is great and normal we also convince young people to move out of their family's home ASAP even if they get along well with their family because being a wage slave and struggling to get by is preferred right?

But anyway... 

Back in high school, this is where I was anti work without knowing it. I would DREAD it when they would force us to open the College/Uni books to try and figure out our careers. 

I don't want a career. I would think. All I wanted to do was write (for myself) read or daydream or play video games or spend time with my friends. But that's not how life is, everyone would say, so I would force myself to read the descriptions and feel miserable with each page flip. Everything either sounded to boring or to hard. I didn't want to be bored but I also didn't want to work hard. A career would suck out all my energy, I would think, and how would I have any time for the things that REALLY mattered?

My mom was also putting pressure on me to find a job in high school which I remember being unhappy about because I went to school Monday - Friday and my mom was basically asking me to give up my weekends. That's life, she would say. I felt miserable at the thought. If I got a job I would have to work either after school or on my weekends off and I just didn't want that at all...

I did end up going to College, since at the time my parents wanted me to and chose to pay. I graduated but hated the program I was in... and I wasn't good at it, just good enough to pass, and I couldn't find anything in it anyway..

Fast forward to now... and I'm feeling a lot of emotions. Guilt. My mom is disappointed in me. I keep saying mom and not dad because my dad is never one to have serious convos and I kinda get the feeling he wouldn't mind his daughter staying forever... But she's disappointed. She thought I would see her (miserable and unhappy in her retail job) and want to do better for myself and actually get a career. I'm single, not dated because I'm so used and comfy being single but tbh I prob could use a man to take care of me, not gonna lie..

Anyway I can't explain to her the truth. That I never had interest in a 'Career' because any 'job' or any 'career' is all the same to me and tbh at least in my retail job I just clean mostly and keep everything tidy and it's boring but simple and I can daydream about things that I like and I don't know if I'd have any daydreaming time in a super intense career

In this society... it's a crime tbh to admit you don't want to work. That you don't want a career simply because 'it'd be to much work' You're lazy if you admit that and being lazy is unforgivable. We're so used to being wage slaves, so accepting of this reality and this normal that not wanting a Career is a sin.

And I get it in a way.... because I'm gonna be 30 in 2021 and I'm still living at home working retail part time and what's worse is like an idiot I haven't been saving my money well. I created a savings plan for myself to stop myself from touching my money since I live at home and don't need too. But I think it all comes down to me just... being so empty I guess with my reality I like buying myself things I like because I can't see much of a future for myself.. so what am I saving for? I guess has been my mindset. And maybe because seeing how miserable everyone is not very motivating for 'career job'

I need to figure my life out. I can't seem to get full time in my job because tbh I struggle at even my retail job and haven't been cut out for 'full time' because fun fact in retail you really have to be good and go above and beyond for them to give you full time. But what else is there? 

I started thinking a lot lately about how fucked up it all is though. Because even getting full time doesn't promise you a good life. Not even just because of all the hours you lose to work but because even that is not enough money to really live. And it's so awful. How is this our reality?

Maybe I've been so bad at 'saving' my money because I know how good I have it right now, living at home. Yes I help out around the house alot. But there's a luxury in living at home that I feel like I never want to leave. And it's shameful.. I don't doubt for a second me staying a home at 28 still as stunted my development a little. Cause while I do think making young people feel like they need to move out ASAP when they could work and save at home isn't the greatest I know being able to take care of yourself without support is vital to surviving in this world.

Gosh I just hate it. I hate it how this is how life is. How nice would a world be if the machines DID do all the work and no one had to work unless they wanted too?

I feel bad for my mom too... she hates her job so much. she much of my mom's misery is because she has to give so much time to a job she hates. I think about how fucked it is, she is forced to go in there and work to make rich people money. And I'm doing the same thing at my job. The rich people on top get it all for our misery.

I think about how messed up it is some people are so filthy rich. On one hand, sure, good for them. Like JK Rowling wrote Harry Potter and whether you like her, or like her books, she did write a book series that became huge and made an impact on lots of kids lives and yeah, totally, she deserves to be rich. But at the same time, it's kinda messed up how in our society, we allow indivduals to hold SO much wealth when so many people are so POOR. 

I realize now that Youtubers, or authors who hit it big, or actors who hit it big with roles... or hell even the owner of say Doug the Pug all these people kinda cheat the system. I mean, Pewdiepie started off making videos playing video games and look at him now. He works hard but he gets to do what he actually truly enjoys. He has full control. He cheated the system. 

I wish I had the talent or courage or luck to cheat the system.

It's just.. fuck I'm anti work. I hate it. I hate myself for not embracing the system and everything and being where I am now. I hate the system for how it forces us to work for the rich. I hate how society distracts us from paying attention - most people don't think about how we should try and change things because they're to distracted either by entertainment (and who can blame em for that) but I mean you'll never see anti work thought trending on twitter because we're to busy with everything else but being anti work...",False,hs5hy9,flowercrownqueens,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hs5hy9/i_was_anti_work_all_my_life_and_just_didnt_know/,7,1
687,Of Brick Windows and Broken Men,"I don't want to write my whole life story, but here is a quick, anecdotal blurb. I graduated in 2003, had no clue what to do, and went to a community college for electrical engineering because, what else to do? For 12 years, I was told that school mattered because I needed it to go to college ... so that I could be ""free"" by choosing whatever soul-crushing job I wanted to, working for some random employer.

I got a job as an hourly technician and quickly realized that I had been set up for a lifetime of disappointment. There was no freedom in my life. I lived for weekends and five vacation days a year (which also were my sick days). I was given a wage to work on products that I would otherwise never know or care about, yet I had to act like I lived and died for these goods. I had to wake up before the sun rose, every day, drive through mind-numbing traffic, take breaks at specified times, wasn't even allotted a chair (even cavemen could sit down), had insurance that covered almost nothing, yet the rates went up each year, watched the cost of living outpace my wages, and quickly realized that nobody had my back. Best of all, I lived in a world where there was a single, opaque window that kept the sunlight out as well as it kept our darkness in.

Then I got promoted to a salary Engineer position. I had finally made it! Then I realized that yes, although I could shift my hours around, each lunch when I wanted to (sort of), and received sick days, I was actually worked far more for less pay. That, and seniority no longer mattered, so the threat of layoffs could be used against all of us and nobody felt safe. Black Friday hit one day in 2012 and I saw 1/5th of the Engineering department get cut, including half of my team. I survived, but did I?

After 12 years, my wife and I decided that we had had enough of this 20th century American experiment. Everything in my life revolved around emptiness. My work did not lead to my survival but to the profits of some other guy. I wasted my time earning wages when I could have been working directly on my own livelihood. So we sold everything. Our four bedroom home (debt). The majority of our stuff. We packed up our SUV, drove to Alaska, and my wife picked up a teaching position in a rural village (a career with tangible results). We use wood for heat. We can hunt and fish for food. I just built a chicken coop out of scrap materials and we will be raising our own chickens (even in the -40 temperatures, they will be fine). Are we still working? Yes, but in a different sense. We don't work for wages but in order to teach a new generation and to implement critical thinking concepts, explore new avenues for growth, and to create an atmosphere of actual learning (openly encouraging questions).

I wanted to take a moment to link a fictional novel I just published, titled ""[Of Brick Windows and Broken Men](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BDK531C)"", based on my experiences in an hourly role in a production environment. It is satire. It is serious. It explores the depths of malevolence that permeate the corporate world today. Finally, it questions how one is to survive in a world where we are not humans but ""human resources"". I will put the link to this story [here, on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BDK531C). Feel free to check it out, review it, share it, or do nothing with it. It is just refreshing to find a community that speaks to the same truths that I have long felt. Most of my coworkers hated their jobs, but still defended the system. I challenged the entire construct and I suppose that is why I left it in the dust.

700,Advice (Can't Find Work After College),"Greetings. I usually do not post anything on reddit, but I have found myself at a complete loss with my current job search. I earned my master's degree (MPA, specialization in economic development) in December of 2019 and also hold a BA in history, political science. I made sure to complete internships related to my career interests and garnered what I thought would be helpful references for future opportunities. Furthermore, I have extensively engaged in service projects/volunteering to help boost my resume. As far as I understand, I have done everything that students are told to do to make their resumes ""stand out."" At the moment I am typing this, however, I have gotten yet another in a long line of rejection letters. I am now about 7 months removed from my graduation, but I have not landed so much as a single interview from my hundreds of applications. Fearing that my application materials may have been poor--despite crafting them with the university career counseling office--I paid to have my resume and cover letter professionally written. Even with these ostensibly better materials, I have had absolutely no luck.

I currently hold the same mundane, part-time, wage-slave job I had to help pay for graduate school, and while I know that having even this puts me in a better position than others, I find myself sinking into depression. The fact that I have been unable to move on from this menial job that I hate is endlessly frustrating. It feels like I wasted 6 years (and tens of thousands of dollars) with my higher education, because it has done nothing for me so far. Positions that require only a bachelor's or associate's degree don't consider me and neither do ones requiring a masters. There have been numerous applications where I have thought ""this is the one. I'm definitely a top candidate!"" but nothing ever comes of it. Just another rejection letter or no response. I don't understand how I am supposed to get any experience under my belt if no one is willing to give me a chance. At this point, I'm wondering if there really is something wrong with me. Do I have no ""employable"" skills? Is my education worthless? Am I trapped in this dead-end job?

Even though I know that a person's worth isn't determined by their economic value, I can't help but feel like a worthless failure. My anxiety is getting worse every day, especially with the end of the covid student loan forbearance on the horizon. While it would solve nothing, I honestly just want to give up at this point. I desperately want to do something meaningful with my life, but I'm sick of going through the roller coaster of hope, anxiety, crushing disappointment, and depression. It's like I'm trying to sell my soul, but even the devil isn't buying. I can't handle my current job--making hardly anything, getting screamed at by customers daily, and feeling like some washed-up college has-been--and I have been unable to find something to move on to. What should I do (and not just for my job search, but also the melancholy and despondency that comes with it)? It's obvious that my current course of action isn't working, but I'm at a loss for what to do differently/next.

I‚Äôm not grateful to have this job during a pandemic.

I currently work at a McDonald‚Äôs in the US. I have hated this job since before the pandemic, but now I am counting the days until I quit (it‚Äôs 42, btw). This is going to be a very long rant but I absolutely need to rant. 

I immediately was told how lucky I am to still be working. I seriously could not and do not understand how anyone could consider me lucky. I was in college and working at the same time, which is hard enough as it is, but then my state‚Äôs stay at home order hit March 25. All classes moved online and the only thing that changed about McDonald‚Äôs was that we couldn‚Äôt let people sit and eat at the store. Didn‚Äôt change hours, didn‚Äôt move to cards only, the literal only thing that changed was you couldn‚Äôt stay and eat in the restaurant. I totally suck at online learning, but I still managed to get straight As in my classes somehow, and learning online was far easier than the hell I‚Äôve been put through at this job. 

McDonald‚Äôs is a typical first job for teenagers. The day the SAH order hit, the parents of literally every high schooler called and one even came in the store to say that their child would not be returning to work until the SAH order was lifted. This meant we lost about 8 employees, or about an eighth of our total staff. Then, because we had to prove ‚Äústaggered shifts‚Äù to the state, everyone‚Äôs hours got cut from top to bottom. But our rate of business literally never slowed down. We were routinely understaffed and could do little to nothing about it because we weren‚Äôt even allowed to pick up shifts. And since McDonald‚Äôs it‚Äôs also a minimum-wage-ish paying job, many people had a second job. Some lost that job, others didn‚Äôt. But then the scares started happening. One of the employee‚Äôs other job was at a pharmacy. She told us she may have been exposed to someone with COVID and had to quarantine for two weeks. Did the store care, slow down, close, do anything? No. Not at all. So we were worrying about potentially having asymptomatic exposure and not knowing it all while serving food to people. Luckily, nothing came of it, but there was a ‚Äúrinse and repeat‚Äù cycle of this for the first six weeks or so.

Then came panic buying. When people went to panic buy and stock up on foods and meats, distribution centers had to do a whole re-prioritization process of who got what products. This eventually affected us. We had to cut the menu fairly severely due to limited amounts of trucks coming in, and also corporate was planning on doing away with all day breakfast, so the pandemic kickstarted that. The amount of customers angry that we couldn‚Äôt give them a sausage McMuffin at 10:40 am were astonishing. However, we are a franchise store (well really stores. The owners have 13 stores), and there is a fairly close store that is corporate. The corporate store did not have to limit their menu at all due to different suppliers. So our clientele was getting confused and angry with us at that, too, as if limited our menu was a choice we even wanted to make. Oh, and when meat became harder to come by, we had to raise our prices on the beef sandwiches. A cheeseburger off the dollar menu is now $1.29. There have been so many people who are furious over $0.29 and too many who have straight up cancelled their order because the cheeseburger was no longer on the dollar menu. 

But how, you might ask, did the owners think to help employees? Here is a very messed up story of what happened: 

1. Because we cut items out of our menu that we still had in stock, the owners didn‚Äôt want to waste them. They told everyone that we could take 12 cookies for our hard work, as cookies were something we took off the menu. This sounds nice, except there were a few issues that a lot of people had with it. Some people working there were the only ones working to support an entire family (meaning spouse and 1 or more kids) as well as themselves. 12 cookies is not enough to feed a whole family and it‚Äôs not money to help pay bills. Then, one of my managers was curious and put 12 cookies into the waste calculating system, and the net loss of 12 cookies is a whopping $1.60. 
2. Many people from across the franchise were insulted by this ‚Äúgenerosity‚Äù (because the waste cost got around, I swear McDonald‚Äôs is a high school). It was also about this time that the first set of unemployment checks and stimulus checks were rolling out, and people recognized that they could literally make more money on unemployment than at work, so people just stopped coming in, prompting managers to fire them, qualifying them for unemployment. This made us lose another 10 or so employees. Almost 20 out of 65 people in a single store were gone. Similar numbers were across the rest of the stores. 
3. The owners finally got worried. Losing a lot of employees but not a lot of business can actually cost money more than saving it because some stores would have to call others to send people to help, meaning they get more hours and some even get overtime pay because they‚Äôre working at multiple stores. This didn‚Äôt help prove staggered shifts, either. In a fragile, last ditch effort to keep the employees they had, they granted us what they call hazard pay, which is an extra $2/hour. This actually worked. It‚Äôs even been useful in hiring new workers who are still out of their original career fields and jobs. 

The owners made it clear that we weren‚Äôt valuable, but it‚Äôs been the customers who constantly remind us that we‚Äôre expendable. Originally, we were supposed to refuse service to people not wearing masks/facial coverings. This didn‚Äôt necessarily apply to drive thru as the order had already been taken and we would essentially need a manager back there doing nothing but voiding orders (as they are the only ones allowed to do it). It has not helped one single bit that people are making memes about ‚Äúyou‚Äôre dumb if you wear a mask alone in your car‚Äù, so people just didn‚Äôt. I really wish this meme and these jokes would die because otherwise we might die. So it mainly became that people coming into the store would need a facial covering. 

About the beginning of April (if I‚Äôm remembering correctly), a McDonald‚Äôs store in Oklahoma City refused to serve someone without a facial covering. That person had a perfectly legal conceal carry license and opened fire on the employees because they wouldn‚Äôt be served. 4 were wounded but I think no one died. So McDonald‚Äôs corporate said that it is no longer mandatory to enforce the no mask, no service rule, but we still could if we chose. Basically, either get shot or get COVID, we got to choose. Nothing says expendable or sacrificial like dying over a McChicken. 

People have also, understandably but also unnecessarily, been more rude than normal. One evening during a dinner rush, 3 kids probably no older than 18 came in and tried to order food from one of my managers. When he told them the total, the kids said something along the lines of ‚Äúwell we don‚Äôt have money so we were hoping to get it for free‚Äù, to which my manager nicely replied that that‚Äôs not how restaurants work and they needed to pay. One of the kids gets up in his face (before the plexiglass came into play) and said, I quote because I heard this, ‚Äúwell what if I f*cking cough on you and give you corona?‚Äù My manager rightly told them to get out and voided their order. This is technically a terroristic threat and is illegal, but there was no sense in calling cops because they were already gone. 

Another point of tension has been the drive thru. We asked that all delivery drivers continue to come into the store to pick up food so that the drive thru didn‚Äôt get even more congested, but some refused. We still technically had to give them the food through the drive thru, but it felt insulting (at least to me) that they think themselves so much higher than us that they can‚Äôt come into the store, but we have to be stuck here and dealing with everyone as normal. Other regular customers thought that the lobby would be closed and walk up to the speaker. Fun fact: our headsets are not motion sensored, they‚Äôre weight sensored, meaning that you physically have to drive over the plates for it to trigger. We don‚Äôt watch the cameras 24/7, but sometimes people look up and see the waving and shouting angrily. Then, because it‚Äôs a drive thru and not a walk thru, we had to tell them to come inside and that we can‚Äôt take orders of non-motorized vehicles (not even bikes, scooters, or skateboards unless it has a motor). I have been cussed at and screamed at for this as if was my decision. It has been like this since before the pandemic, why would I decide not to serve you now? 

Masks and facial coverings have always been a point of contention. The selfishness and downright ignorance regarding masks always infuriates me. I have asthma and an auto-immune disease, so if I catch COVID, a lot of harm will come to me. I wear my mask for 8 or more hours every day I work in this hellhole, you can wear one for the ten minutes it takes for your food to be ready. Masks do not deplete oxygen because if they did, I‚Äôd be dead in the first hour and surgeons literally could not do the surgeries they have to perform. If I, an asthmatic with daily and rescue inhalers, can wear a mask for that long, I can see no other reason than pure selfishness for someone not to wear a mask. I should not have to sacrifice my health to make you comfortable. It‚Äôs not infringing on any right at all, the mandates are not unconstitutional, and you are not special. 

The only reason I still work in hell is because I have almost no savings. I have no cushion. If I got fired and tried for unemployment, that money would get sucked into bills. I wouldn‚Äôt have food for myself or my cats. Since the beginning of the pandemic, I was promoted to crew trainer which came with a $0.50 raise, and then the hazard pay helped. I technically make a little over what the unemployment benefits give, even after taxes have been taken out. It wouldn‚Äôt make much sense for me to quit now. I‚Äôm quitting in 6 weeks because my next semester starts August 24 and I have my father‚Äôs GI bill back, which pays for food and housing as well. But until then, I‚Äôm forced to sacrifice almost everything. My roommates, my boyfriend, his family and coworkers (manufacturing job, he didn‚Äôt quit working either), and my friends because I have been deemed an essential worker in a world full of rude idiots. I have been sacrificing my physical and mental health trying to feed people cheap, unhealthy, not-that-good food. I‚Äôm tired of it. 

If I was in any other industry than the service industry, I might be more grateful to have work. But at this point, if someone else wants my job, they can have it. This job just isn‚Äôt something I can be grateful for right now.",False,hqm2jw,lexi_the_leo,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hqm2jw/im_not_grateful_to_have_this_job_during_a_pandemic/,11,2

720,"Question/discussion; Experiences with co-workers denigrating or disregarding interests/hobbies outside of work. (you know, the stuff that makes life worth living) / mild rant","Not exactly sure if this fits in here exactly, I didn't see anything that says it doesn't exactly but I could be wrong. Apologies in advance if this is the case and point me to where I need to go

&amp;#x200B;

Like it says in the title this is about co-workers (one in particular in my case)  who look down on or outright deride your hobbies or interests outside of work. 

So this person, I'll refer to him as RG (retail guy) fucking LOVES retail. It's almost all the talks about and ***IF***it seems to be a huge part if not all of his identity as a person. Now I admit I could be wrong and there could be a lot more to him I've worked with RG for a little over a year and he talks A LOT. And if someone talks enough you can usually formulate a fairly accurate picture of what they're about.  There's more (quite a bit in fact) I could say about him but that's the essence of it.

&amp;#x200B;

So one of my main hobbies is BJJ (Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu), I love it! I've never taken to just ""going to the gym"" because I have quite an active mind and invariably get distracted or bored but with BJJ (as those who've done it will know) gives both your body and mind a workout. Nothing clears my mind like a good BJJ session. 

Around last august I hurt my knee training, it wasn't too serious, just hurt like a sonofabitch and I had a fairly noticeable limp for about 3 weeks. I could still work albeit not at the same pace. He asks me how I hurt my knee and I tell him, and he responds with ""sounds like the kind of thing you do to get unhealthy"" (let's ignore the fact that unhealthy and injured are two different things shall we?). And follows up with an attempt at a guilt trip, saying I'd be letting the store down ***IF*** I hurt myself so it was that I couldn't work. ***IF*** being the operative word here folks. (just a quick aside this guy is big on reminding you of hypotheticals, he's often told me off saying IF we were at another company you'd be in big trouble for that, etc, cue internal eyeroll)

What got me was that this wasn't in the least motivated about my personal safety but that our boss might make less money (our boss is actually a pretty nice guy, he owns the premises our shop is on so he's not uber concerned with squeezing every last drop of profit out, this guy, however, IS). Let's set aside for a moment the fundamentally dehumanizing core of his message, it was more that he heavily implied I should stop doing something I enjoy to concentrate more on work. (I actually went on Amazon and bought another gi within 15 minutes of that conversation so I could rotate them and train more)

&amp;#x200B;

Another incident happened while I was reading on my break, now I always take my full allotment of break time (even when we're not busy at all and people take an extra 5 minutes here or there he always takes shorter breaks ). He's on his break as well and asks me what I'm reading, I reply that I'm reading a sci-fi novel. He has this perplexed look on his face and says ""what're you reading that for?"", now this was asked more curiously than anything but again I got the vibe that he thought because it wasn't work-related it wasn't worth any time.  While there wasn't an derision implied here it was still indicative of this work-centric attitude that I not only find quite disturbing but also somewhat wasteful. We've got a limited time on this planet and with a world full of music, art, science, etc this guy has chosen work as his passion.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it sounds like a rant about one particular co-worker and in a lot of ways, it is but when I ran into this attitude at my previous job because it was a larger company I was able to put more distance between myself and the person in question. My current job, however, is much smaller both in terms of physical space and staff so it's much harder to avoid people and that has brought this attitude front and center in my consciousness.

  
So after quite a lot of backstory and context we get to the crux of why I posted this today. I want to hear/discuss you guys &amp; gals similar experiences of people denigrating, disregarding or outright criticizing your hobbies outside of work or even having a healthy life-work balance (weighted more towards life of course).

  
So yeah, really looking forward to hearing from you guys &amp; gals, I know it might sound like a somewhat grim topic to discuss but this rant was very cathartic for me and I already feel a little better !",False,hqdurq,justsomemaniac,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hqdurq/questiondiscussion_experiences_with_coworkers/,8,1

724,The punishment for refusing to work is Rape.,"I've been working between 60 and 70 hours a week for the past year or so and I've sometimes felt on the edge of an emotional breakdown from the total hopelessness of the situation like almost every day.. been feeling this way for years, but I still keep going because of the fear of what happens if I stop working.

The punishment for NOT working is homelessness and often the assault and rape that comes along with it. Both males and females get victimized. Reddit is full of such horrifying stories. Slave-drivers/Managers don't need whips anymore, because rape is worse than being whipped, and it's a very real and very immediate fear if you choose to quit your slave job and can't pay your rent.

homeless people are basically runaway slaves that get regularly assaulted and raped by criminals and other homeless... essentially for the crime of having disobeyed and run away from their slave jobs and their tiny slave-quarters.

So basically it's like... Work or get raped... in the butt...? That's what society feels like to me today. And it's like this everywhere in this world... there is nowhere you can go to escape this system. This is a fear-based world we live in. A world of slaves where whips are no longer needed to strike fear in the hearts of workers because they know they will probably get raped in the butt if they disobey their managers and get fired.",False,hrb72k,ElegantDecline,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hrb72k/the_punishment_for_refusing_to_work_is_rape/,10,9

On top of that, experience requirements are bullshit.

732,The 4 Categories of Capitalism?,"Hello fellow humans. I am in need of some help. 

My current head space: 

What do you do, when you mentally cannot force yourself to do work you hate any longer, but are unsure what you like, or that you will be able to do what you like, without it hurting you?

What options exist for humans, who still need to afford necessities to be alive, but who are unable to explore ""traditional"" avenues because/ not limited to: frustration, anxiety, inability to express oneself in those places or to handle being trampled by Karens &amp; Kens; unable to agree to stressful deadlines, arbitrary citation formats, or word counts. 

To me, it seems in a capitalistic structure one has limited options to maintain their survival and existence: 

1) job: No/ low benefits, pay, and desire to do. Usually just to pay the bills. Often soul crushing. E.g. Dollarama, Hardware store, Grocery store, Shoppers.

2) career: Requires significant time and monetarily consuming education. Pays well, once acquired. Is desired and typically comes with benefits or is a salary position. Helps the person feels alive. E.g. archaeologist; vet; metalsmith; teacher. 

3) school: university, college, or apprenticeships.

4) self-employment: Working for oneself. E.g. bespoke tailor, YouTuber, writer, horse ferrier. 

*The Questions* 

A) Other than these four above, are there other categories I've not thought of yet? 

B) Based on your knowledge of yourself, and other atypical humans, who are shit ass tired of being drones for corporates who are unempathic bastards, are there any specific things under the 4 categories I listed, that you would recommend I investigate to trial? 

IMPORTANT: I'm usually all for doom &amp; gloom, but if in this post, folks could refrain from commenting that I'm an irrational dreamer, or saying there's no such thing as what I'm asking for and it's hopeless---
*I'd really appreciate it* because saying those things will hurt me more than help me/ I'm gloomy enough on my own, that's why I'm here.

I look younger than I am and I was one of the youngest employees, and most customers were middle aged or elderly, so I got talked to like I was 12 years old even by managers. Demeaning and annoying. 

I had a manager who said shit to me like, ‚ÄúI decide when you get your lunch break, not you.‚Äù The schedule listed what time my lunch break should be and all I did was ask. Fuck you, dumb bitch.  She talked to me like she was my parent.

I wasn‚Äôt motivated for myself. I haven‚Äôt been motivated for myself in a long time. Probably since elementary school.

Pre-employment  screenings are now usually the normal prerequisite before any  employment offer is made, and many of these investigations can and do  occur without the applicants‚Äô knowledge or permission. If you‚Äôve ever  been arrested you probably won‚Äôt get the job, whether you were convicted  of any crime or not. If your credit history has any significant dings  it will most likely be held against you, regardless of whether the job  you‚Äôre applying for involves handling money. Your driving record is up  for grabs, as is your Twitter account. And this doesn‚Äôt even include  drug screening, which recent studies by the Centers for Disease Control  have proven are inaccurate 37 percent of the time or bullshit  psychological tests which are so transparent that even the most  theft-oriented psychotic can pass. Prospective employers aren‚Äôt under  any legal obligation to inform you why your application was rejected,  and most will lie anyway if asked. Without even knowing it, many of you  have undoubtedly been victims of being denied employment based on  information unearthed in a background check you never authorized.

 ""Many companies are now also demanding around-the-clock servitude even  when their employees aren‚Äôt punched in. It‚Äôs no longer uncommon for  employers in the service sector to remind their hires that they are  ambassadors for the company even when they‚Äôre out and about on their own  time. So if prudish Mrs. Jones happens to see you on your day off  getting your drink on in a neighboring watering hole to her  dissatisfaction and complains about it to your employer, you stand the  chance of getting canned for essentially no more than living your life  the way you see fit. Other companies have placed similar lifestyle bans  on the people they hire, reserving the right to terminate people for  things such as smoking, being overweight, maintaining certain political  affiliations or engaging in hobbies deemed too risky such as  motorcycling or skiing. So much for that freedom thing.""

I graduated a year early at 17 but had to immediately move out and get an apprenticeship. I have to commute to work about an hour each way. Two hours a day. Three hours a day when I have to go to school. I work all week.

I can't live off my wage. I can't. Even with a very cheap apartment in the suburbs (luckily I got anything as a minor back then) I can't pay my bills and food / clothing. So I had to apply for governmental assistance (great we have that here, I'm sorry for everyone who can't get that) but I have to rely on my father who's an ass to give me fucking paperwork because no one considers that your parents can kick their children out.

fuck this. Im so tired and without getting governmental support i wouldn't be able to survive on my own. my coworker has to take a second job. i know im in training but I have to do all various shit that doesn't have anything to do with what I'm learning so you could at least pay me fucking minimum wage AND NOT HALF OF THAT THE FUCK STOP USING ME AS A CHEAP STOPGAP FOR ANYTHING YOU WANT ME TO DO IM NOT A FUCKING TOOL FROM A DOLLAR STORE IM A HUMAN BEING

Happy that I spent my days doing what fulfils me, happy because even if I die young, my life has been well lived. I only fear death because in my twenties I am yet to feel allowed to truly live. Most of my life has been eaten up by depression, most of my depression comes from an enforced way of ""living"" that actually takes all my life away from me. I'm constantly missing out on things, leaving them for later, for when I'll have the time, for when I'll have the money. But maybe that later will never come.

748,"The Movie ""Office Space"" - have you seen it? What thoughts did it bring?","Have you seen this movie? Basically, it is about a guy that got sick of his ""BS job"", his moron bosses, silly BS tasks that are busywork, the general inefficiency of large corporations and how the current corporate system is wasteful. 

One of the topics that were mentioned in the movie was a question ""what would you want to do if you won 1 million dollars?"". He answered that he would do nothing and would just enjoy himself.

It reminds me of me: I had a privilege of not having to work until I was 25 due to university bursaries (I'm 30 now). I was terrified of the idea of work - I was truly genuinely content with just chillin' at student accommodation with a few buddies of mine with whom I've lived, playing video games and a bit of poker while also drinking dark ale. That was life. And, thankfully, I came out of uni without any debt.

However, after uni, I started working and I've forgotten how it feels to have a lot of free time. I even started thinking that having too much free time might make me unhappy because I would not have meaning in my life (yup, exactly. As if meaning came from work).

This yeah, however, I had some good experiences: I've been working from home for a few months, eventually averaging about 3-4 hours of actual work per day. Then I was put on furlough with 80% of pay for 6 weeks. They were absolutely amazing... sleeping in, playing video games, talking with friends via Facebook using voice chat for 2-4 hours at a time, having baths... that was the life. Now I am back at work, but, other than catching up on stuff which I did in a week, I'm back to working 3-4 hours a day on average. This is absolutely amazing, I love it.. 

I consider myself very lucky to have been in this position. For most people, it was a difficult time. For me, it was a blessing. Even for the people who have been furloughed and successfully came back to work, they said that disliked being furloughed as ""they had nothing to do"". It is really sad to see that people can be so uncreative with their free time...

I wish I could prolong my current situation - which I think I could if I've done FIRE. But that would mean that I'd have to pay off my mortgage first, then buy another property for renting out purposes and paying the mortgage off of it, too.   It might take a while, but least that's something.

795,im a teen and my mom keeps pressuring me to work and it's irritating the shit out of me,"for the past two summers when everything was normal, I had a restaurant job. I hated that shit because all of the waitresses were catty, 1/3rd of my managers was a huge bitch, my boss was dismissive, I was overworked. So many reasons why I truly believe in antiwork rhetoric I learned at this job working the counter at a local place. I had so many shifts, working Thursday thru Sunday and then sometimes on tuesdays and wednesdays. Whenever my scheduling manager thought I should be on.

Now, COVID-19 is coming through. my mother keeps pushing me to get a job. she wants me to apply at grocery stores. you know... one of the only places that is actually open right now, and one of the places where i'll have to interact with several people for hours at a time, touching shit that they've touched with their hands which may or may not be clean. 

it's like she fucking wants to kill me and i don't understand why she's trying to force the idea down my throat that I should go out and work. I don't need the money. She has access to all of my cash which is about 12k from an inheritance I got. I don't NEED MONEY. I don't NEED to do anything and as we are all experiencing a collective trauma, she's barking up my tree talking about how ""You're 17 and you can't just sit around all summer doing nothing."" 

Ma'am do you realize that's how we're going to stop the virus, right? By not going outside? By doing NOTHING?

This was (and is, i‚Äôm only 24 now) my only job after graduating. The pay is top notch, sure. And at 22 it gave me access to some financial stability that people my age don‚Äôt have. I thought i was happy.

Today, i wake up and i realize i am not happy. I was too focused on reaching goals which now i realize were all career oriented. And it‚Äôs perplexing because these are goals i‚Äôve had since childhood, why do we teach children to dream of jobs? But as i went and i reached and surpassed every single one of my goals, i made me so unhappy. I feel so empty on the inside, i cant feel joy, excitement, happiness, nothing. Everything feels bland. And i hate it. I thought i was making myself proud but i feel so disappointed.

I dislike the idea that we are confined to an institution our whole lives. First, you‚Äôre bound to a school. Then you‚Äôre bound to a cubicle, to a company, to a career, to an income. Then, to a retirement home, and that‚Äôs if you‚Äôre lucky to live long enough after retiring. So, when do i get to be free? To enjoy life?

806,Even thinking about getting a ‚Äònormal‚Äô job makes me feel physically sick and the work culture for working class teenagers here is disgusting,"Just a warning, this is really long. The jist of it is, is basically in the UK kids who are from deprived areas who have lazy or neglectful parents are shamed and forced into work at a young age and there‚Äôs a ton of businesses willing to take advantage of that due to the age wage gap and get around the law by not having a clock in system and paying kids cash in hand and not having them on their books, thus forcing and manipulating them into working really horrendous hours while still in school. 

My working life started from 11 years old where my dad pressured me to get a cash in hand job delivering magazines. It was door to door and similar to a paper route but I done 3 rounds and had to deliver 6 stacks of magazines, each stack being 250 magazines and all I had was a flimsy bag to carry them, and the weather is freezing and wet here. This was all because I wanted snacks and toys (I was still playing with toys) and my dad didn‚Äôt want to pay for them. He told me I had to do it because my sister done it and ‚Äúshe was fine‚Äù. My sister was a high school athlete playing rugby and volleyball and was 5 years older than me, she could lift the heavy bag, I couldn‚Äôt. 

When I turned 13 I worked in a cafe and I enjoyed the work for the most part and miss making coffee however, my manager done some really iffy stuff like training a 13 year old on a coffee machine when you have to be a minimum of 16 or paying me ¬£2.30 an hour. Working after school and one weekend day, believe it or not my work schedule got worse than that. After 3 years I was fired for no reason and without being told, 2 weeks later I actually went in and asked about my shifts and they just said ‚Äòoh the PA fired you‚Äô and that was that. When I worked there I got one 15 minute break for a 9-10 hour shift (also illegal, both how much I was working and my break time). They didn‚Äôt have a clock in system so I couldn‚Äôt prove it, but my break was supposed to be 45 minutes and my manager shamed me into taking a smaller break because another girl took a small break. 

When I turned 16 I worked in McDonald‚Äôs I considered harming myself every single day, I was miserable. I was pressured to work there because my other 3 siblings had worked there and my sister invalidated my feelings and opinions and enabled by dad‚Äôs behaviour by saying ‚Äòwell we all got treated that way, you‚Äôre not special‚Äô. The reason why I was complaining is because my dad was taking ¬£220 month off of me to pay him rent since I was 15 AND making me pay for basic necessities like sanitary towels and safety razors. The was increased to ¬£380 per month when I turned 16 because I was an ‚Äòadult‚Äô, but I was a stupid child when it was convenient for everyone. My managers would scream at me and force me into situations that I was highly distressed by. I have a really bad audio processing problem due to autism although because I‚Äôm a girl I was of course undiagnosed and I am 20 and still not formally diagnosed. I was constantly forced on headsets even when I‚Äôd break down in tears and beg to do drinks or lobby instead. I hated the headsets because I couldn‚Äôt understand what the customers were saying. They would scream at me causing the shift manager to scream in my face and if I cried they would just scream even louder. Ah yes, just like home. Every school day I‚Äôd get in at 6am to do supported study for art (so I‚Äôd actually pass), leave at 4pm and work until 12pm, which was unannounced and forced overtime that I wasn‚Äôt paid extra for, I was supposed to stay in until 10pm but I was always pressured to stay and was made to feel guilty when my shift was over. I‚Äôd throw up on my breaks from the stress and then do my homework, I didn‚Äôt even relax on my break. My colleagues bullied me and stole from me. 

I stayed there for 2 miserable years until I finally handed in my notice. What drove me to do so was when I collapsed from a severe migraine on my bathroom floor at 4 in the morning. I usually get stress induced migraines but this was the worst one I had ever had. I went to A&amp;E and I had crazy high blood pressure, nothing bad came up on my MRI scan but my doctor said that I had to be less stressed and wanted to prescribe me diazepam, he was pretty surprised when he found out I already took quite a high dose of diazepam. In fact at that point when I was 18 (and doctors actually started listening to me) I took 4 different medications for anxiety, ptsd and depression which were diazepam (Valium) and Alprazolam (Xanax) as well as Sertraline (Zoloft) and Amitriptyline (Elavil) to treat migraines. 

I have an intense fear of people that was fuelled by working in my younger years and being around so many aggressive and toxic people. My fear of going out if the house is considered a disability by doctors but the UK government doesn‚Äôt feel that way hence whenever I know I‚Äôm going to hit a dry spell of student loan money I try desperately to get freelance work because even after all that shit and experience I would be paid not even close to a living wage because I‚Äôm 20. Literally. Let me remind you that this horrible feeling crazy work hours started from when I was only 13 and just got worse. No kid should have to deal with that but so many did who didn‚Äôt have parents willing to pay for /basic needs/ for them. You were lazy if you were over 14 and didn‚Äôt either have a cash in hand job or a part time job. 

So now when I think about getting another job that isn‚Äôt something to do with my degree, animation, I feel physically sick all over again. I just can‚Äôt do it, I can‚Äôt go back to living my life like that. I still have nightmares about it to this day. This is so commonplace where I live where kids with middle class parents got bought cars and didn‚Äôt work a day in their life and working class kids were forced to get jobs lest they be lazy, the class division is so blatant and leads to overall bad health. I have chronic pain that started when I was 14-15 and has gotten progressively worse, standing up too long is agony and the doctors don‚Äôt know what it is, some think it‚Äôs fibromyalgia which you are stuck with for life (and also another illness that people don‚Äôt take seriously), I‚Äôd be money that I don‚Äôt have that I am in pain constantly and my hands are fucked up because I had to work since I was a literal child. No child or young person should ever have to work a job while in full time education, especially if they are neurodivergent. I‚Äôm just glad that I have some socialist and liberal friends who wholeheartedly agree with me and support my anti work stance and my desire for UBI instead of just telling me that I‚Äôm just making excuses to not do work and be lazy which is literally what a girl in my art class told me when I was 16 because I wasn‚Äôt getting folio work done on time because I was so exhausted. This girl and her twin sister have a record deal in NYC, got tons of free shit and their mum bought them a car. It always these privileged, neurotypical individuals that are the biggest bootlickers honestly and claiming that they have worked for everything they have gotten. And if you got this far thanks for reading my story, this is the reason I appreciate subreddits like this.

807,Went from the best job ever to a pretty meh job to a shit job all within 6 months. What do?,"I‚Äôm not sure why exactly I‚Äôm making this post. Guess I just need to vent or something. 

So a little backstory.  Last summer I graduated highschool. Shortly after, my parents started getting on my ass about getting a job.  They threatened to kick me out unless I worked at this local grocery store near me. I lasted about 3 months there. After a lot of fights with my parents, and threats of getting kicked out, I finally just decided to stop showing up so that I could Doordash full time back in October.  When my parents found out, they were pissed, and started charging me rent (only $125 every two weeks, not much, but too much to handle without a job).    The Doordash thing lasted like 3 days,  I made bank in those 3 days,   Then some update happened that allowed anyone to Doordash at once,  so everyone got a lot less orders in my area.  I went from about $150/8 hours to $20/8 hours.   I was crushed,  and still had to pay $250 a month.    I lasted until December,  when my bank account was a little too slim for my liking.  I decided to go to an open hiring event at Allied Universal, the security company,  and that leads me into the next part of my story.


At the open hiring event something amazing happened. I sit down and fill out an application,  and after about 20 minutes a manager pulls me for an interview. He says he‚Äôs been looking for potential candidates for a new position they‚Äôre starting at the company. I didn‚Äôt exactly understand exactly what it would consist of at the time, but it was $15 an hour,  3pm-11, weekends off, and was a driving job so I accepted.  


The next week I started training with one of the manager‚Äôs (not the one who hired me) son who had the morning shift for the aforementioned job. The first day consisted of checking on two sites‚Äô security guards,  dropping off some paperwork,   and then STRAIGHT CHILLING FOR THE REST OF THE 8 HOURS.  We took our hour lunch (hour lunches,  yes,  and paid),  and then went to micro center,  then Yamaha to look at motorcycles.  I knew this job would be fucking amazing right then and there.   


I can honestly say that some days I would rather be at that job instead of at home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about any job before.  I was able to test drive cars (they always rented the cars for some reason, and sometimes they would be cool),   I lost my virginity while on the clock (one day I was chilling in a parking lot and matched with this girl on tinder who asked to meet up right after matching),    I‚Äôd go home and play video games if I was particularly bored, and then drop the car off at the office later,   I‚Äôd go out to eat with my family whenever,    I‚Äôd pick up my brother and hang out,  I‚Äôd sleep,  I‚Äôd go to my friend‚Äôs house and watch standup,  You get the picture.  


I should have known it was too good to be true.  It lasted about two months,  January to March.  One day in March the manager comes up to me and says that some corporate guys caught on to what he was doing (I guess this job wasn‚Äôt supposed to exist and he was basically legally embezzling money (he didn‚Äôt phrase it this way)), and that I would have to go to a factory and take the employee‚Äôs temperatures because of Covid-19.  I was disappointed,  but even this job was pretty chill.  All I had to do was sit in a room on my phone from 1-6,  then at 6 when the shift would change,  about 18 employees would come in throughout the hour and I‚Äôd get their temps. After that I‚Äôd just sit for a couple hours and go home.  Only issue I had was the commute. The place was about an hour from my house,  so add 2 hours onto my day.   The other guards there were super nice,  the site supervisor (highest ranking guard) was really sweet and accommodating with the schedule, and I was relatively happy there.   Oh,  and also I was making $17.50 an hour for hazard pay. 


Two nights ago that ended though.   The manager decided to move me to a Lowe‚Äôs warehouse where there‚Äôs trucks coming in and out, and the manager‚Äôs son (guy who trained me) is site supervisor. I‚Äôm now making $14.50 an hour for 10x the work.  Basically constantly going back and forth signing in trucks and filling out like 3 different forms for each of them, while the manager‚Äôs son gets the cushy job at the front desk across the place. But they said multiple times ‚Äúyou‚Äôll be busy it‚Äôs great‚Äù. How the fuck does anyone have this mentality? 

I really want to quit, but I‚Äôm gonna see how Doordash is this weekend before doing that. I used to love Doordash when it was actually worth it. Not sure whether or not to put my two weeks in. I really want this on my resume, but I don‚Äôt want to do this for another two weeks,   Although I‚Äôm not even sure if I‚Äôll ever need a resume.  My long term goal is to become a trucker when I turn 21,   Save all my money for 6-10 years (easy if you‚Äôre living in a truck) and retire on rental properties.  I‚Äôd rather not be a trucker though,   I really want to start some sort of service business;  power washing maybe(although it‚Äôs seasonal). And then retire.  (When I say rental properties I mean commercial by the way.  I couldn‚Äôt live with myself if I was a residential landlord.)

However, employees are **not allowed to work from home after. We MUST use PTO and take off 2 weeks.** I.e. the hourly employees without pto are basically fucked over if they have to travel.

How can I find a livable wage and not be miserable at the same time!","This may or may not be long, but I feel like ranting and hopefully this community can shed some light or perspective on such issue. I will try to not make it long though with details.  


I just feel like I am getting the short end of the stick. Living in a city where I am dependent on others for my living situation, hoping to find a job but with my lack of ""work experience"" I can't even get a simple job like cashier or whatever.  Even with a degree in humanities, stupid job posts say like ""you need x amount of experience required including the bachelors"". How am i suppose to have prior experience if I am trying gain said experience at the job I am applying to.  I just constantly apply and apply to the online applications all over the city. With COVID-19, the situation doesn't help in terms of finding a job.  Even if the companies are on hold or whatever, I still get rejected from the application process. Pre-coronavirus, I still get rejected.  And I somehow managed to have a 2 year gap in my resume.   


To make this post relevant to the Anti-work reddit, working to me feels pointless. But not just pointless, but very anxiety induced stress.  Thinking about work, being at the work environment, or just any feedback that isn't positive makes me sick, like an anxiety attack.  How am I suppose to function at all if I have such feelings. The conflict with working is that I am all for a work-life balance, less hours working and some how getting a livable wage.  But it seems that I was born being told that having a job is the only means to making money so that I can survive.    


I don't even know what I am good at.  I hear all the time about finding your passion, or create goals or just picking something that I would enjoy. The problem is that how am I suppose to fund such ideas when I can't even get a job.  But does a job even exist where I can cope with my mental health long enough to endure the bullshit and save enough money to pay for my hobbies and dreams.  It just makes me depressed that I have to somehow figure my life out and people constantly tell me that ""I am not getting any younger and I need to pick something or I am just wasting my life away"".",False,hoknjy,dragazoid66,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hoknjy/i_dont_know_what_to_decide_on_my_path_with_work_i/,1,1
836,Did I just get blackmailed at work? Please help :/,"Hey I hope it‚Äôs okay for me to rant here because I‚Äôve been stressed for the past hours. I‚Äôm currently doing a commercial apprenticeship (office) and I live in Europe. 
Its been 1 month that we have a new boss. I tried to be nice to her but she turned out to be a fake b*tch (long story). Our other boss has vacation this week so me and other workers were alone with her. Also the new one is extremely confused, misunderstandings seem to happen EVERYDAY with her. Yesterday I went to the toilet for a minute and she came and asked me why I‚Äôve been 30 minutes here. She‚Äôs the person who sees you doing the smallest or nonexistent mistakes, corrects you and then goes to the other boss to tell her how she saw you doing this mistakes. 

So me and a coworker talked a bit too much during work because we don‚Äôt take her seriously. Today I got called into the office of a higher boss and he told me that the boss reported us for talking a lot AND me not being productive at work (complete bullshit) He told me I have to write everyday the time + tasks I did on a list and show it to her boss and wanted me to sign an objective agreement or else I‚Äôd get a warning (at 2 warnings I get fired). I told him that I do agree with the talking and that I‚Äôll stop but how I don‚Äôt agree with being unproductive.   Ive worked the same for months, never had a problem and now that this new boss is here, it‚Äôs suddenly a problem? so far every coworker here doesn‚Äôt like her, 2 others even had bigger problems with her.  I defended myself and the guy had to plan a meeting with me, him and the boss to clear it out.

I thought I could continue defending myself in that meeting but I was wrong. It went for 30 min and the only thing that basically happened was them dodging questions and blackmailing me.
For example:

They wanted me to write the tasks I do everyday. I told them this is humiliating, degrading, destroyed every trust. Then they were like ‚Äûbut this could be very helpful for all of us! Its actually very helpful and beneficial to document your tasks‚Äú and I said ‚Äûif it‚Äôs so beneficial, then why do only I have to do it?‚Äú they both immediately went defensive mode and said ‚ÄûNo this meeting is about you, not others!‚Äú 

I told them that I do agree on talking a lot with the other guy but that my productivity is still the same strong and I‚Äôm a fast worker so there‚Äôs not much loss when I talk for 10 min with someone else. I agreed on signing the agreement ONLY with the point of stopping to talk. But they kept insisting on how my productivity got down, I replied with ‚Äûit‚Äôs always been the same but I don‚Äôt think the new boss sees all the work I do everyday, she‚Äôs clearly confused and it‚Äôs not only me who sees that so I‚Äôm not at fault‚Äú  Once again, they dodged this.

I got tired because clearly, all my arguments were dismissed and I had no free speech. At the end the higher boss said I have to sign this agreement or else I‚Äôll get a warning. About 3/4 points were complete wrong, talking about how I have to be respectful to others including bosses at work even though I ALWAYS was. One other was to ‚Äûcontribute to a good positive atmosphere at work‚Äú even though I ALWAYS did. I was almost crying and signed up, like my depression that was gone for a while is all back.

I cant even quit the job because I‚Äôm in that apprenticeship like study thing and I can‚Äôt find something else (also long story) I‚Äôm planning to message an union for students for a free consultations. Ive been mistreated so long in my life and I‚Äôm not gonna take any harassment anymore, especially not from a boss who isn‚Äôt in the position to judge me.

842,Is this even legal?,"Recently spoke to a friend about her experience leaving and then going back to work during this coronavirus crisis. She worked as a waitress at a local restaurant. 

When the quarantine began, many people (myself included) were ""furloughed"" meaning I was never technically fired. I'm still ""employed"" just not receiving pay. Since this dearth of work is due to covid I can still collect it unemployment benefits. Since they haven't called me back to work, I'm not refusing any work. She and her co-workers, according to her, were not furloughed. They were fired. No longer working for the company. 

When my state began opening back up and allowing outdoor dining, she received an email from them, threatening her in order to force her to come back. She was told that, if she did not return to work, the employer would call unemployment and tell them she was refusing work. Essentially, if you don't come back and work for me I'm going to cut off your only other source of income. 

My issue with this, if what she says is true, is that *she was not their employee at this time*. How could they report her for refusing work if she had been fired?

This is an excellent example of the lower class being exploited and coerced, and forced into labor to make others money, even when doing so is a danger to themselves and others.

851,"""And this is what you call living?"" by √âmile Armand","Wake with the dawn. Moving quickly, taking cars and trains, hurry to work. That is, enclose yourself in a more or less spacious spot, more or less deprived of clean air. Sitting in front of a machine, transcribe memos the half of which wouldn‚Äôt even be compiled if they were written by hand. Or, fabricate, working some mechanical instrument, objects that come out the same every time. Or, never moving away from a motor, watch  vigilantly over its functioning. Or, otherwise, mechanically and automatically, sitting rigidly in front of a loom, repeat the same gestures continually, the same movements. And do so for hours and hours, without any variation, without distraction, without any change in  atmosphere ‚Äî every day! Is this what you call ‚Äúliving‚Äù? 

Produce! Produce more! Always produce! Like yesterday, like the day before yesterday. Like tomorrow, unless sickness or death surprises us ‚Äî  produce? Things that seem useless but whose superficiality is hardly ever discussed. Complicated objects which are mostly of a terribly low quality but which can be used unsatisfactorily for some purpose or another. Objects, the process of producing which is rarely understood in  its entirety by any of the workers that share their fabrication ‚Äî  Produce? Without knowing what is to become of one‚Äôs own product. Without being able to refuse to produce for those who we dislike and oppress  us, without being permitted to take the smallest autonomous, individual initiative; Produce: now, hurry! Become an instrument of production that gets itself going in the morning, that drives itself on, that takes on  too much, that stretches its capacity until the point of complete exhaustion ‚Äî This is what you call living? 

Leave in the morning on the hunt for a juicy clientele. Cajole the ‚Äúgood client‚Äù; doggedly. Run from home, to your car, from your car to work, from work back to the commute. Make fifty sales pitches a day. Spill sweat and blood so your commodity becomes preferred, and the commodity of the next salesman becomes devalued. Come home late, overexcited, fed  up, agitated, make those around us unhappy, deprive yourself of all interior life, of all the feelings that pull you to seek out a more beautiful, full humanity ‚Äî And this is what you call ‚Äúliving‚Äù? 

Dry yourself up between the four walls of a prison-cell. Feel the unknown of a future that separates us from what is ours, what we feel to be ours at least, because of solidarity or because of having shared risks together. Feeling, if condemned to death or prison, the sensation that our lives are fleeing from us, that there is nothing more we can do to determine our own lives. And do so for months, for whole years. Incapable of struggling anymore. Nothing but a number, a toy, a rag, a  thing ‚Äî caught up, watched over, spied on, exploited. Everything punished with sentences totally out of proportion to the crime. And this is what you call living? 

Put on a uniform. For one, two, three years, repeat incessantly the act of killing men. In the exuberance of youth, in your fullest virility,  become a recluse in immense buildings where people enter and leave at fixed times. Consume, parade, awaken, sleep, and do everything and nothing according to an established schedule. Train yourself to die, or to produce deaths. Become a tool, a robot, in the hands of the privileged, the powerful, the monopolists, the hoarders, only because you yourself don‚Äôt happen to be one of the privileged, nor one of the powerful, nor an owner of men ‚Äî is this what you call living? 

Incapable of learning, loving, being satisfied alone, of spending time according to your liking ‚Äî having to be shut up inside while the sun shines and the flowers invigorate and intoxicate the air with their scent. Not able to go to the tropics when the snow covers the windows, or to the north when the heat becomes terrible and the grass dries in the fields. To find, erected before you always and at every turn, laws, borders, morals, conventions, rules, judges, offices, jails, and men in uniform who maintain this mortifying order of things. 

And this is what you call living? 

You, who are in love with the intensity of life, you, who adore ‚Äúprogress‚Äù, all of you, you who push forth the wheels of this blood-guzzling machine of a ‚Äúcivilization‚Äù ‚Äî I  don‚Äôt call it living ‚Äî I call it vegetating. I call it dying.

857,Not wanting to work almost feel like having a mental issue,"Everyone around me is just saying ""If you don't have a job, you're just a fucking loser"". It make me feel like an alien or something.

I can't understand how people see it like it's good for you. They try to make it looks like it's an hobby. Like if spending all your time for money make you more valuable.

And for me it's only the beginning. I'm only 16. I left school, felt like I was completely wasting my time. If I don't find a job, I'll be kicked out of home.

They're trying as hard as they can to put me somewhere. Just to say, he's somewhere now. Them, they are my parents, my school, the social assistants, and a lot of other people. Wherever they put me, a school, the army, an hospital. They don't really care as long as I'm doing something. That's stupid.

I'm a really big introvert. The perfect cliche. Shy, awkward, paranoid, with social anxiety and all shit you could think of. I'm posting on reddit because I just won't talk about it irl. 

I'm someone who really need time and school didn't give a shit, even thought they act like. I've been pushed in this system and it kinda destroyed me. Took all my self esteem apart, all my sociability, my mental health. And here's the result. I became really cold, paranoid and extremely pessimist. I never go out and I deeply hate working.

There's a time when I was even thinking about suicide. Not really seriously but enough to wonder where would I hide my body and stuff like this. 

I even had a friend who once said the worst think I was ever told: 
""You really think I would like to be friend with someone who's doing nothing with his life? Think if I see you later in the street homeless I'd stop? No, I would just be ashamed and act like I don't know you""

I knew he didn't really meant it and it's because he was afraid I make bad life's decisions. But god it hurt. It show me how work took over people's mind.

Hopefully since I left school I'm getting better. I start to laugh at things. Start to be a little more extraverted and less cold. Learning guitar and other little things. Going out taking the bus, which I never think I could do before. I'm slowly getting better but it won't last a years. Life will alway catch me again because everyone need money.

That's why I really really deeply hate school for what it did to me. I hate everything that's close to work. I hate the way people see it. I just hate how all the system globally work.

Working in HR/recruiting. Prior to graduating I knew the corporate world wasn‚Äôt for me. Yet, someone let me major in business when I was 18 (plot twist, it was me). I racked up 80k in student debt and I have paid off a good chunk of this (40k). I have 17k left on a private loan and then 25k on a federal loan (not too worried about federal loan as I can make the min. payment).

I make 55k a year but I don‚Äôt enjoy my job. I dread Sunday‚Äôs bc it means one day closer to work. I don‚Äôt like the fake corporate relationships. I don‚Äôt like being micromanaged at times. I don‚Äôt like not having freedom and forced to be online at certain times or go in the office and being stuck there at certain times. It‚Äôs all fake corporate BS. Don‚Äôt even get me started on performance appraisals. To me, my job is to pay bills but it‚Äôs not my passion. I actually miss the days I worked retail now bc back then it was only a job and treated as one by management, vs. now, they expect me to live breathe and sleep the work I do (Ha). In terms of what I enjoy it is animals, traveling, and couponing. 

A couple of months ago I got offered a job to be a front desk receptionist at a doggy day care but it paid $18 an hour (currently I make almost $27). I declined bc of the pay but looking back now, I almost wish I‚Äôd taken it bc I know Id be happier with this. 

Has anyone sought a lower paying job but enjoyed it because it was actually something you enjoyed doing? I‚Äôm trying really hard to pay off this 17k by Christmas and then considering applying to work somewhere with dogs but I‚Äôm also stressed if I do that, I‚Äôll feel like a failure bc I basically got a degree for nothing.

I have always been a student who gets good grades without any effort put in. I spent my entire education playing video games, but my CV is jam packed with average to impressive grades. NONE of them are remotely useful without experience, but I guess that's life. 

What I am absolutely terrified of is work. I have worked one job in a restaurant before at 16 and it is absolutely gruelling. Asshole customers taking the piss out of me juggling 15 tasks while my co-workers take selfies. I reported it to my boss but she gave them a tap on the wrist and they continued. The worst part of the job is that the customers can endanger your job stability and complain just for a superiority complex. The customer is always right I guess, but it blows to be put in a situation where nobody even considers you a human being anymore. 

I am off to Uni hopefully and I will see where my life leads me after that. I can't help but feel a great sense of bleakness and lost hope about the future. I have no idea where I want to go with my life, and I'm expected to know the details of it. I hope that I will become an entrepeneur or programmer in the future, but every day I lose more hope, and the job market is even more fucked now than ever due to COVID. 

I know people who have degrees that have struggled to prosper in the job market. A family member works in a supermarket with someone with a Masters degree. Another family member knows someone with a degree who still couldn't find work after that. My entire family work unskilled jobs apart from my stepdad who managed to work his way up to a white collar job after 20 years of unskilled work and being in the military. 

I have friends who aren't going to Uni, and even they are struggling. Both of them hop like bunny rabbits from apprenticeship to apprenticeship hoping it'll get them somewhere.

892,"""Choice"" is an abstraction of language and a myth we use to cope with Powerlessness. ""Choice"" is a Lie that confuses work with value and success with something that happens to good people. There is no choice, only context.","I can't think of a single decision I've ever made in my entire life - I can think only of the ways I've acted in accordance with my character.

I find no distinction between *Me* and *My Choices* - I **am** those choices, not a separate entity in the pilot's seat of my skull that ""chooses"" - that stands separate, considers, and then finally pulls the lever that corresponds with the **choice I‚Äôve made.**

Those last three words are superfluous - to me they all reference a single thing - a localized *happening* from my specific perspective.

I think the belief that me, or you, or anybody ""makes decisions"" is quite backwards - it‚Äôs partly a product of the language we use to speak about ourselves and the world (a confusion of the symbol with The Actual Thing) and partly just our basic instincts. It's plainly obvious that I am alive and aware and can consider many possibilities and think rather abstractly about present, past, and future, so it only seems to follow that I **must** exert some basic influence over the course of my life but I think if we really examine that thought there‚Äôs no good reason to assume that necessarily follows. 

We might *feel* that it does, but perhaps that is a sign to be skeptical of our most basic unexamined assumptions.

This idea is naturally unpalatable as it would seem to absolve one of all responsibility, for both wrongdoing and ownership of good acts and artistic creations, but I think this is nothing more than a knee-jerk reaction to protect our sense of *I* as something distinct and in control, as to accept the opposite comes with a great and terrifying sense of powerlessness. This terror is multiplied further when coupled with the additional quality of randomness, and the ordinary and pervasive accepted fact of our ""free will""  is an attempt to reconcile this powerlessness with our instinctive need to be in control. 

Even when faced constantly with the reality of circumstance where one life is destroyed based not on any choice of its choosing, but the simple act of existing at the wrong point in time and space and colliding with the wrong other does nothing to dissuade us of this familiar and comfortable illusion.

Responsibility is not something we *take*, it is what we **are** by sheer virtue of being.

You may have felt *It* when engaged in something everyday and ordinary, yet struck as if for the very first time by the majesty and totality of all there is - all experience happening right now, billions of distinct and separate simultaneous happenings - connections - disconnected only by virtue of the limitations of our own collective conceptions of what is real, what is true, and what is possible.

What is possible?

Does Jeff Bezos really have billions of an actual, tangible currency, or is his currency really in the form of power and influence as represented by money?


Is the standard work-week from Monday to Friday or Monday to Thursday?


Whatever the answer, is it because this is simply The Way the World Is, or might The Way the World Is be directly shaped by our collective ideas about it?


Wars are no longer waged on an actual battlefield - our modern war is a psychic and spiritual one, set in the space of the collective human (un)conscious, and the targets of annihilation are not only people but possibilities - the target is Truth, and the creation of Truth As it Serves the Manufacturer - we are in an era of memetic warfare and unless we can understand that and figure out how to turn it against itself, the collective human spirit will be swallowed whole, outlived by the last piece of manufactured shit we can sell for a dollar.

893,I did it. I finally deleted my LinkedIn account. Some thoughts from a recent law graduate below...,"For months, after resonating with many of the principles and words of wisdom on this sub, I had kind of been in a bit of a crisis...

As a recently graduated law student, I have, in hindsight, constantly (over the past 4 years) been forced fed discussions surrounding 'the grind' and how it is 'normal' and 'expected' of us to work 70-80+ hour work weeks, to always make personal sacrifices and to essentially never have a work-life balance. For most of this time, I was content with a definition of success garnered towards making lots of money and climbing up the corporate ladder as it was all I had ever known. I was obsessed with the fact I thought I knew exactly what I wanted to do in life and believed spreading myself thin was what was going to help me get there. I did so many extra-curricular activities related to my degree, on top of volunteering and my part-time job - not including all the god-awful networking events I went to because 'it's not what you know, it's who you know' was hardwired into my central nervous system. I tried to be naive and oblivious to the mental toll this lifestyle could take on a person, particularly when senior counsel would drink themselves into a bout of misery at these events and come back from the bathroom with powdered noses... 

However, late last year, this all came to a grinding halt. I completed my first ever internship in a law firm and absolutely detested it. The environment, the culture, the work, the politics, the commute. All of it. As soon as I finished the internship, I decided then and there working as a lawyer was not for me. I just wish I had realised it sooner. I knew I wanted to look back on my life knowing I had done what I truly wanted to do with it, and that did not include slaving away behind a computer for 10+ hours a day, slowly deteriorating from dealing with awful clients and even worse bosses. I knew I wanted to prioritise my family and my mental health which had definitely fallen to the wayside within the last few years. But at this point it still wasn't clear to me what avenue my thoughts were stemming from.

Fast forward a few months, and I decided in my last semester to take some political science and philosophy classes for credit rather than doing more law electives. It was honestly the best decision I could have made, as it genuinely was like a light bulb moment for me. I knew I had a few socialist tendencies in me, but had never really researched or explored them to a great extent. I had great, in-depth discussions with my lecturers who seemed far more willing to converse with me than the law lecturers. Through these conversations (which led to research that ultimately led me to this sub) I realised how toxic capitalist society has become and that working yourself to death to put coin in another's pocket is not the only way to live life. It was kind of world-rocking to know I can still find contentment in a lesser-paying, more fulfilling role that frees up more of my time to pursue hobbies, travel and most importantly, spend more time with my loved ones. Through this mindset, I have also found simple living, minimalism and anti-consumption. I have fallen in love with the thought of living life again, and that is not something I thought I would ever say. All I care about now is being in a job which will allow me to live comfortably and within my means. Some might say I no longer come across as 'ambitious' enough, or 'driven' enough, or 'committed' enough; but I believe there has to be more to life than this.

As for what that job is? I currently do not know. Doing a degree in law does not open many options, particularly here in Australia, where the only pathways seem to be working in a firm, in a massive corporation or in government; and I am unsure if I want to study another degree... All I know is that living this 'fake professional' life is not going to lead me to happiness. I am so tired of people telling others 'the hustle' or 'the grind' is the only way to succeed. I am sick of constantly having to come across as overly productive. I am tired of putting myself out there and getting nothing but a lack of respect towards me in return. I am genuinely over trying to one-up my 'competition'. All of these, as you might already be aware, are baked into much of what makes up LinkedIn. 

Sometimes I feel like I am the only person in the world that feels this way, particularly in this ever-present 'hustle' culture we live in, but then I come and peruse this sub and I feel somewhat at peace again. Of course I still have a few thoughts in the back of my mind which I have to unlearn (particularly with regards to allowing myself to relax and not feel like I have to keep up pace with the busy world around me all the time), but for now, I think stopping myself from feeding into this degrading cycle by deleting my LinkedIn is a great start.",False,ho95x7,SadGrad451,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ho95x7/i_did_it_i_finally_deleted_my_linkedin_account/,12,5

900,How to help brainwashed friend,"Hello everyone! I recently found this sub and it blew my mind how much I relate to the stuff written here. Now, I already had a strong anti-capitalist sentiment, I just didn't realize to what point I had internalized that idea that my value as a person = my productivity. I thought some people could be happy with their careers in a corporate setting, just not me. Now I'm not so sure, and that's what I want to inquire.

 My friend works at what he calls his ""dream job since he was a tiny child"". He was a brilliant student in finance, landed an internship at his so-called dream job and burnt out badly. Like, he wouldn't sleep for weeks out of stress. The wages were so low, that he was actually *paying* to work there because he had to buy expensive clothes. But he pushed through, finished his masters and then got hired back full time. Now, he makes a lot of money, but he still works 70+ hours a week. His life is basically the job. If he has lunch with me during the week, he needs to keep looking at his phone. Most of his close friends are his colleagues and his one extra-curricular activity is done with said colleagues. I thought he was happy, though, because he loves talking about his work and what he does. But after lurking here I don't know. This guy has very little introspection skills, and just came out of an extremely abusive relationship which he endured for over 3 years (basically what I'm saying is he's an expert at sticking his head in the sand). Two of his colleagues seem to be real good friends of his, but the rest just sound so fake. And they're all hardcore capitalists, except for my friend, who identifies as left-leaning, but that's beyond the point. 

Should I do something if I care for his well-being? Could he really be happy there? If I should do something, how do I make it get through without him shunning me out due to his fear of acknowledging bad things/feelings?

914,"VP Tried to Ambush Me In a Meeting, and I Put Him In His Place in Front of Everyone","Around 3:30pm today I was called by boss and he asked me if I would be apart of a meeting so I can explain our special order system. First off I was trying to finish up two reports I have to distribute on Friday, and the meeting was impromptu but I digress. The meeting consisted of my boss (Vp of Merch), the VP of Sales, a District Manager, and my coworker who managed to weasel his way into the inner circle so he think he is big shit. As soon as the meeting started the VP of Sales (I will refer to him as he moving forward) was ready to rip me a new one, or at least try to.

He starts screaming at me telling me that special orders are piling. Mind you I have been over the special order process for two years now with no issues. I calmly told him that since we have put the new process in place of all special orders needing to be approved before I can process them, this has contributed to the pile up of special orders. 

I also told him that because I receive approval for EVERY special order, I have to go though those emails and process specific special orders vs before this new process was put into place I could process all of them without any barriers. This has slowed down the processing of special orders tremendously. 

He then tries another angle. He screams ‚Äúwhy aren‚Äôt the special orders being closed after you say you process them.‚Äù I made the suggestion to share my screen and show everyone on the call what I do with a special order. He then starts yelling again before I can even get started. I take a one minute pause because I am fuming. I was so pissed I was shaking. My own fucking father don‚Äôt talk to me like that. 

I guess it was more than a minute because my boss thought I dropped off the call after the VP of Sales stopped screaming. I calmly said may I continue? My boss said yes. So I go through the entire process from A-Z. I basically prove that when I complete the order, it leaves my queue completely. He starts screaming again, why is it showing up on the report???!! I snap and said ‚Äúlisten I have no control over what you see in the system. I also have no control over what shows up on your little report. All I know is the order disappears from my queue when I process and close the order!!‚Äù It gets quiet for a second because they can‚Äôt believe I yelled like that (I normally try to be respectful to everyone). After that he says ‚Äúlook at your queue!!! It has 200 plus special orders!!‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy are there so many in there?!!‚Äù I raised my voice again and told him I am doing the job of two people with overtime, I can only do so much!!‚Äù I then mumble under my breath ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sick of this shit.‚Äù I guess I was louder than I realized because everyone got quiet. My boss tried to be the voice of reason, and he tried to explain what the overall objective of the meeting was. I honestly believe my boss had no clue the VP of Sales was going to try to set me up like that. 

After that I abruptly stopped sharing my screen and I started working on the report I should have been done with by now. While everyone was saying their last piece I just hung up the phone and went back to doing what I was doing. My boss sent me a message via Skype, and I said ‚ÄúBarry I apologize, but I really need to collect myself.‚Äù I finish my report, published it, and logged off without speaking to my boss and I could care less. I‚Äôm a grown man, and I refuse to let another man talk to me like that especially when I do my job. I made the decision to officially start looking for another job because they got me fucked up.

What role do they play in an anti-work world?,"I am very anti-work, mainly from the perspective that we work more for less despite a major increase in productivity, showing us that many of our livelihoods are based on greed and not a common goal of survival and happiness. 

However, I work in government (public transit operations) and I'm struggling to understand my role in society and whether I'm doing the right thing. I am proud to work a job that is mainly there to support lower-income individuals, help the environment, promote healthier lifestyle for citizens. The goal isn't to make money - we ""lose"" money every year but are considered an essential service.

On the other hand, I feel public service has taken a lot from the private business handbook. It is an incredibly bloated oeganization, slow to adapt and change, many people only working to collect a pension. I'm required to put in my 40 hours/week even though the work might take 15. I still feel like a slave to work, even if the work is more noble than slaving away so someone can get richer. Not to mention the amount of corruption within politics.

946,HELP - First office job and I can‚Äôt take it anymore.,"Hi, I‚Äôm a new graduate and just got my first office job recently and I really don‚Äôt know how people do this 8 hrs a day, 5 days a week, for 50 something years. It is beyond depressing. 

I feel like I should be so grateful to even have a job given these shit circumstances (probably half of my graduating class hasn‚Äôt found a job yet) but I‚Äôm miserable and can‚Äôt stop looking at the clock. It involves relatively simple skills but is not really an area I‚Äôm super interested in. My first day there, I felt like a brainless monkey doing random pointless tasks, and felt like everyone thought I was an idiot. My immediate supervisor still thinks I‚Äôm an idiot and micromanages me. This job involves some simple skills I have so it‚Äôs okay but it‚Äôs not an area I want to be in really. The pay is not great, but I will accrue some time off which is good.

I feel so pointless and resentful and absolutely hate the idea of spending 8 hours a day doing menial work and twiddling my thumbs. It‚Äôs not a bad company, but it‚Äôs not meaningful to me. I miss being in college, where I was excited about the material + good at what I did. I love reading, researching, and writing. I want to go to grad school / law school and save enough money to retire early.

I would also love to go study in Europe. I studied abroad there for a year and would love to get a Master‚Äôs/job/move there permanently, but I have a family and a relationship here that wouldn‚Äôt really support that. They want me to stay in the US, work, go to school, and continue to stay here to make money. 

Is there hope for me? Should I quit this job and keep looking for another one or stick it out until my next move? I have to pay my rent somehow but it just sucks so much. I used to be so idealistic and hopeful but now I just feel sad and confused thinking about the future :( I just want to enjoy my life and not have to work at a job that makes me feel stupid and pointless and work for peanuts. 

TL;DR: New grad who just got a mind-numbing office job that makes me miserable, I want to go to grad school/law school, do I try to switch jobs or do something else before my next step? Do I ignore my relationship &amp; family that says to keep my head down and stay in the US at this job?

948,Always keep those tips in mind,"\- **Dont let them manipulate you**: Companies often try to manipulate unmotivated workers with compliments, cheap sweets, ""fun events"" (bowling, field day, basically cringe and mandatory stuff). Their goal is not your wellbeing or your happiness, not at all. Their goal is to boost company sales and that's best done with brainwashed workers who believe their bosses care about them.

**- Don't show them your potential:** This is an irreversible mistake I sadly did. When I started in a new office department, people saw I was good with computers. I was a fast worker, not because I wanted to impress anyone but I was just like that. So now I get way more tasks than others here for the same pay. I told my boss that I don't like how much things I have to do while others don't and she told me that its ""balanced"" and when I tried to list examples, she said that work is just like that and basically I need to stop having extra wishes lol.

Always work at the absolute minimum. You're not going to get a rise if you give your 100% and even if you do get a rise, it's probably going to be only $2 more if you're lucky.

\- **Don't fall too deep into the ""corporate slave"" mindset:** The corporate slave mindset is believing that work is your purpose in life and that time not slaving for your boss is wasted time. I fell into it and now I get bored at home when theres long periods of not being at work. I'm trying to get some sick days off but my brain is like ""what are you going to do at home then???"" and this is such sick thinking. 

Even if you're at home on your couch, eating pizza and watching Netflix you're not doing anything wrong. We're programmed to believe that we're being bad or useless when doing this but thats because we've been brainwashed.

I hope these can help or remind anyone. We're in this together and we may not be able (yet) to change the system but we can definetly try to make our lives easier.",False,hkfi75,kommsussertod1,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hkfi75/always_keep_those_tips_in_mind/,3,1

954,What else can I do if I don't want to work?,"***The Problems:***

I have been working since 2014. Jumped ships due to bad management and workplace several times. I can't say I have enjoyed working anywhere at all. Long hours, abusive bosses, etc. I work as a writer and designer and it breaks my heart seeing my work being torn apart by critics and editors. And when it does go well, they take the credits for it. I had breakdowns every few weeks. And worse of all, my work gives me anxiety. Just unable to focus, heart rate going up, etc.

***The Ideal Solutions:***

UBI sounds amazing and it also sounds like something we should already have 10 years ago? But as nice as it sounds, I doubt we will be getting it anytime soon. People who are not used to the idea would probably be against it (because they want to work, or they make more than the UBI, so why should other people get off so easily?) and I doubt employers would want their staff to be getting something easily (""you lazy pieces of shit!"")

Same goes for automation. With machineries and AI coming along, logically, employees would have less to do or get higher income. But fuck that. Employers would just get rid of you so that they can eat by themselves. Yay!

There's so much that I want to do if I had UBI. I'd like to travel, to continue my studies (not because I need it, but because I love learning), write a book and so on.

***The Solutions... for now?***

I don't know. I'm not sure.

* *Talked to my friend about it.* We agreed that the only way out of ""work"" is to have our own business. Of course. And we made a pack that, if we ever manage to start a successful business, we will help as many people as possible (in terms of hiring, training and motivation) and that we will never ever be liked the greedy bloodsucking abusive monsters our bosses are.
* *Talked to my mother about it.* She told me to start my own garden. Grow plants. Useful plants of fruits and vegetables that we can eat. At least that way, that part of our meal is sorted. So I've been looking into growing my own fruits and vegetables. 
* *On my own part.* Being single and living alone, I saved lots of money since I started working in 2014 (I used to eat plain rice with egg and broccoli for weeks and rarely ever go shopping). So last year, I decided to put almost all my money into a savings account which generate interest every year. And from the interest alone, I have just enough money to cover all my basic needs every months for this year. And when I say basic needs, I really mean what I need to keep on living.

I still have my extremely soul-sucking job as a writer. Last week, my boss told me I'm a bad writer, and that slow worker, and I'm the cause of the company losing money (yup, nothing to do with a viral pandemic we're having, just me). She rejected 2 of my proposals and told me to redo 5 of my articles because they didn't excite her. She's also ""reminded"" me several times that I better work hard because there's no more jobs out there. Sounds like a threat. Also, whenever I do put out good work, I will hear top management giving all the credits to my boss. Honestly, I just want to get the fuck out of there.

She tries to make snide remarks about my lifestyle because I have chosen a different path.

I am in my early 30s and don't have any real debt other than rent and utilities which are hard to get away from.  I am very frugal, drive a used car and have a credit cards but only use them if necessary and when I do I pay them off in full. I also have 40,000 plus in my bank account.   I want to eventually purchase a home, but want to put as much down  as possible leaving a cushion in the event of emergency OR outright buying a home in cash.  Does anyone else share my sentiments? I hate working just as much as anyone else, but started to think owning a home outright would reduce much of the stress we have and give us more freedom.   

Sure, there are the damn taxes, but I think it would relieve a lot of the stress of that comes along with capitalism.

980,Calling the Workers Back,"So at my job, they're bringing people back in larger than ever before waves. Despite the fact that our county has seen alarming rates of new cases. I drafted up this letter to the CEO and spoke to a few other engineers to see if I could get their support. So far that's been few and far between, but I've still got more to ask. Though I expect by the end of the day I'll be signing it alone. If it even gets sent. 

Regardless, it took some work to write up and instead of just hitting delete, I thought I'd share with you all and see what your thoughts on it were: 

*(Names have been changed for obvious reasons)*

&amp;#x200B;

 

**A Letter to Mr. Boogerton Considering Our Safety**

Boogerton, 

This is a letter of concern from your engineers in *""Booger Department 01""*. I think it should come as no surprise at all that most engineers (or any staff for that matter) chose not to sign this letter not because they don‚Äôt believe in it, but because they‚Äôre scared. That‚Äôs the world we live in today. People would rather risk their health than their job. While they believe in what‚Äôs being said here, they are too scared to stand up for themselves.

However, this letter is not about the inadequacies and imbalance of the world. It‚Äôs about Booger INC and our safety against the current pandemic which you seem to be ignoring. 

New cases in *ImVerySick* County alone have been spiking through the roof at an alarming right. Your response to this was ‚Äúwe‚Äôll wait two weeks and see what happens.‚Äù After two weeks and new cases still soaring high, your response was to not only continue bringing us back to the office, you‚Äôre bringing us back quicker. 

For some reason, you have deemed yourself and your HR worthy enough to determine whether or not we‚Äôre worth risking. I can‚Äôt even begin to explain the moral conflict with that, considering the only thing we‚Äôre at war with is production. 

I‚Äôm not the youngest buck in the room anymore, which means my parents aren‚Äôt exactly young either. I do, however, enjoy seeing them every weekend. If your response to this is ‚Äúyou have to work and you‚Äôll just have to not see your parents until this over,‚Äù then you, sir, are wrong. I would gladly choose family over any job, for any job that suggests I don‚Äôt see my family is not worth keeping. 

Both you and *VP Booger* have said you have seen no drop in productivity out of us since we‚Äôve been working from home and that ‚Äúyou‚Äôre very proud of us and impressed.‚Äù Yet on the same token, you are requesting that we come back in the middle of a pandemic. Hospitals are overrun, nurses are wearing PPE for weeks at a time when they‚Äôre supposed to be replaced daily. People are dying. I‚Äôm not sure how much more clear I can make that last point, but I will say it again. People are dying, sir. People are dying, and you are requesting that we come back to work and risk dying, for what? For money that‚Äôs being made anyway if we work from home? Or is it so you can feel good about yourself having an office full of worker bees?

This isn‚Äôt an argument to work from home for eternity, this is an argument to stay safe. An argument we should never have to have with our employer, yet here we are. We have proven we can get the work done from the safety of our own homes, yet you demand we come back into harm‚Äôs way. I, personally, cannot even begin to wrap my head around the selfishness of that decision. 

*Booger INC* is not a one in a million job. By your own admittance, *Booger INC* is one of the hardest companies to do business with. By the admittance of other directors and staff, *Booger INC* is 30 years behind the times. While we do appreciate getting paid, let's not fool ourselves here into believing *Booger INC* is the only opportunity for employment. There are countless other establishments looking for talented individuals. In short, *Booger INC* is not worth risking my wellbeing for, especially when there is zero need to do so, which brings me to my next point.

*Booger INC* preaches every day how important safety is to them and how serious they take it. Yet when *Booger INC* has the perfect opportunity to prove their statement, they do just the opposite. They request that all their employees come back to the office during a pandemic. And not just a pandemic, the second wave of a pandemic. After we've proven we can work from home just fine. If you‚Äôre going to talk the talk of safety, then you should also walk the walk of safety. No amount of pins and stickers and safety speeches will bring back the people we‚Äôve lost, or might lose. 

You‚Äôve also made mention that break rooms will be closing. So what are we supposed to do for lunch? Sit outside while it‚Äôs 100 degrees? Sit in our cars during the heat? Sit in our cubes and eat? Or perhaps you expect us to go out to eat which I hope I don‚Äôt have to explain why is a bad idea. Or maybe your silent hope is that we‚Äôll just skip the break altogether. 

You have also made the comment that it‚Äôs not fair office workers get to work at home while factory workers don‚Äôt have that option. If you want to be fair then, I suppose we are all working the same hours for the same pay, correct? Should you and I compare paychecks to check for discrepancies? 

Nobody made them work at your factory. That is a choice they made, and it‚Äôs a choice that none of us should have to pay for. We‚Äôre free to work wherever we want, and while this is not a threat, I honestly believe it‚Äôs worth noting that some of us might not continue to work here should things continue down the path they‚Äôre going. It‚Äôs also worth noting you had trouble keeping engineers BEFORE the pandemic. 

Again, this is not a request or an argument to work from home for the rest of our lives. This letter is out of concern and is an argument for our safety and wellbeing. An argument that we should never have to have. 

I feel incredibly silly and even stupid for saying these next words, as it is something I should never have to request, but here I am: 

Please let us continue to work from the safety of our homes until this pandemic is over and we feel it‚Äôs safe to return. Not when you feel it‚Äôs safe for us. Closing break rooms yet sharing bathrooms, having to wear a mask all day, constantly sanitizing work areas, and practicing social distancing means it is NOT safe yet.

982,How to get through a shift without losing my mind? Kind of vent but kind of need advice too,"Does anyone have experience or advice on getting through fast food or even retail shifts and coming home not completely wrecked?

I have to go back to my fast food job part time for the first time in a while, it's only a six hour shift and I've already had several anxiety attacks in the past couple days. It's normally very stressful but it's increased by so much due to covid-19 and I haven't even clocked in yet. I start in 7 hours and I can't sleep, my heart is beating way too fast. 

Outside of work I'm a design/visual communications student. We have to meet tight deadlines, do critiques of our work, present in front of an audience, handle clients, research, make draft after draft after draft till we get the best the design can be. Which is a lot of work, also stressful, requires a lot of time, organizing and creative thinking. Top it off with ridiculous art history exams and giant papers you'd think that it'd be more stressful. But no, working fast food is somehow the toughest, scariest, most stressful job I've ever done. I've worked as a cleaner for a community centre, I've pulled all nighters, I've been slammed with work and somehow fast food drains the most of my energy. I come home from a six hour shift and pass out. I don't understand why a minimum wage job is so difficult. It shouldn't be, it's *retail.* It's not the work itself that is hard, it's all doable. I don't know why it causes me so much mental turmoil and just tears down all my self esteem. 

I need the money from fast food to save up and kickstart my online business. I just don't know where or how to get the mental and physical energy to get through one simple shift. There's two bad regulars in the morning shift that I'm *praying* are not going to show up. It's making me crazy and I'm so jittery. I don't want to come home tomorrow on the verge of tears, exhausted, angry, re-evaluating my life decisions or swinging back into depression. I want to go to work, have a normal day and come home feeling fine.

My politics are left wing anarchist. I support basic income and housing all the homeless. I'm also somewhat antinatalist. Like the title suggests, I think society needs you and I the individuals for economic reasons (to pay taxes and rent and to keep the population high) and emotional reasons(our families and friends would be sad without us) more than we need society. What do we get from society anyway (temporary pleasure such as food and sex)? This has implications, among them that society has to feed and shelter each of us, or we die (and maybe dying isn't such a bad thing in this society). The leverage is on our side. Society hates the people it sees as lazy/unemployed, and it hates the suicidal/mentally ill. Those who are unemployed deserve to die, and those who commit suicide will go to hell, so believes society. Well fuck all this. It is society's responsibility to take care of each of us, or suicide is our right. And I say this all as a very happy person, though I am currently unemployed.

1007,Can we take a second to acknowledge the terrifying irony that money isn't even fucking real?,"Or is that too bleak?

'Real' isn't *exactly* the right word, but it's probably the most impactful - it incites a reaction, anyway.

[&gt;Like, omygod, like, wouldn't it like, be great, like if, people didn't, like need money and stuff? Like, all those kids in, like, africa wouldn't, like, starve if money didn't, like, exist, ya know?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shitstatistssay/comments/6x0762/money_isnt_real_and_scarcity_is_almost_always/dmc5il4/)

This, but unironically.

Of course money is a real thing that performs a necessary function, but our shared collective *understanding* of it shapes both its form and power (it **is** power), and in this way we can alter its command over our reality through a collective psychic exercise - memes manipulating money.

We can't function without money, but we *absolutely can* function with a new way of distributing it in hopes of lessening (not eliminating) the total amount of suffering in the world directly related to poverty and the soul-sucking and exploitative nature of selling your labour.

Ask Google, ""how many billionaires exist?"" - Answer: 2095.

Do any of them *really* have billions of an actual, tangible currency or is their currency really in the form of power and influence as represented by money?

Is the standard work-week from Monday to Friday or Monday to Thursday?

Whatever the answer, is that because this is simply *The Way the World Is*, or might The Way the World Is be directly shaped by our collective ideas about it?

Wars are no longer waged on an actual battlefield - our modern war is a psychic and spiritual one set in the space of the collective human (un)conscious, and the targets of annihilation are not only people but possibilities - the target is Truth, and the creation of Truth As it Serves the Manufacturer - we are in an era of memetic warfare and unless we can understand that and figure out how to twist it against itself our collective human spirit will be swallowed whole, devoured and outlived by the last piece of plastic manufactured shit we can sel.

2095 problems and one crucial error stands between us and a better society, and building that society is as simple as building, believing, and spreading the right memes.",False,hk8a14,thegreatself,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hk8a14/can_we_take_a_second_to_acknowledge_the/,17,1
1008,Apprenticeships are a con,"Just a short post to vent a bit. I am 26 years old, I have a degree, and I'm currently an Apprentice for the NHS. I'm paid ¬£502 a month and am paid so little that I get Universal Credit to boost it. I've had four instances of sickness since I started due to depression, anxiety, and a toothache so had an 'informal chat' with my manager, where she suggested I use my annual leave instead of my sick days.

I work really hard because I'm so anxious about negative feedback. Maybe I was so deluded that I thought the relationship was an equal one and that I'd somehow get something out of it at the end of the day. The qualification I'm getting is utterly useless and was only tagged on to make the idea of being cheap labour more appealing. There is no job at the end of this, it's just a way for my department to fill the second, much needed assistant position without paying a full wage. It makes me so sick that my future job prospects might be jeopardised because a future employer might check my record and see that I've been depressed and anxious for a few days and refuse to hire me because of it.

I had a job interview on Wednesday. The position was advertised as a fulltime one but in the interview, they told me that it would likely be a job share. Is this my future? Am I going to be juggling multiple jobs at a time because employers don't think it's in their interest to hire fulltime staff? 

I'm going to start relaxing at work more, make an attempt to even the scales somewhat. I have a longterm plan to retire ASAP, but until then I refuse to be such a willing sheep. I've always known I was being taken advantage of but I think the events of the last few days; specifically, the interview and my manager telling me to use my annual leave instead of sick days, have really brought home to me the fact I am being exploited.

People tell me that I knew what I was getting into and that it's just a fact of life. I couldn't give a shit, it doesn't make it right. I'm not stupid, I know life isn't fair, I've always known that the current work system is fundamentally bullshit, but I've never felt it as much as I have done recently. I feel like I was always aware of my situation but now I've had my eyes fully opened. 

I don't want people to read this and think that I'm new to hating work or realising that I'm being taken advantage of; I'm not, I've just never seen the ugliness of my situation so horrifically exposed as I have done lately. 

My manager isn't in on Monday or Tuesday, Everybody else dislikes her with varying degrees of intensity and I think everybody feels basically positive about me and my work ethic. My job involves leaving the office loads so I'm absolutely taking advantage of that and smoking whenever the fuck I feel like it. I can't describe how I feel right now. I've wanted to be done with work since my second day when I realised just how soul-crushing it was. I've been stealing time in little and irrelevant ways. I suffer from really bad social anxiety so I can't really steal time by talking so I'm basically working non-stop. No longer. 

I'm pretty sure some of my colleagues realised this about my job from day one. There's one older lady who is always saying how hard I work. I'm fairly certain she does it to remind my manager that I'm doing her a favour. I feel so stupid for working so hard for so little.

I'm going to wrap this rant up now because I feel like I'm repeating the same points. Thank you for reading.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Manager told me to use annual leave instead of sick days. Interviewers lied about the job role, I put way too much pressure on myself, gonna steal me some time back. Also, I knew this was all bollocks very early on, I just never had such a raw experience of it till recently.",False,hl2a0v,onelongsigh94,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hl2a0v/apprenticeships_are_a_con/,3,1
1009,This is my story of wanting to get my life together,"I quit school because it caused me a lot of stress and constant anxiety, I was blinded and at this time I worked a full time job for about 3 years. I wasn't happy but at least I could get money to eat sometimes, pay my family rent, buy some things that made me temporary happy. When I quit my job, I was the happiest. Didn't have any notice because they didn't treated me like an human being, I felt free. After a year, I wanted to have a goal so I looked at what I love to do in life ; creating food. I then processed to give my admission to the school and I was admitted. In my country, the gouvernement pay for your study and is supposed to help you with loans and bursary. I had no money whatsoever, 1300$ of debts. My family is having a hard time, living with less than 500$ per week. We got refused for the helps 4 times, it was their mistakes at first. Four times. Now they called us and told us they can't help us anymore. A girl on the phone told something that made my dad go crazy mode "" Sir, just do what everyone is doing, work during your full time study formation. "" I actually quit school because I couldn't do it and it was part time. Is it me or everything is crazy ? I will never get myself sick mentally and physically for some piece of paper. The girl processed to told me to do like any other citizen and go to the bank. It was our last hope and I got an online appointment. They told us that they can't help me with my study, it costed too much for "" what it was a false-non-manly-job "" aka being a Pastry chef / cooking. She proposed with the biggest enthusiast to do a credit on ... 10 YEARS. That's it was "" normal and everybody do it. "" My dad really tried to get his shit together to not insult the poor privileged lady on the phone... Is it where we are now ? If you are a poor lost soul that want to do something in your life that you THRIVE for and you don't get help in your country, what are you suppose to do? Work till you can't walk, die without living a passionate life ? I'm really not okay with this. I still don't know how I will find 20k$ in less than 2 months, but I will not be a puppet.

1013,I a 14yearold have a 60 hour work week,"Send help. 

I hate school, I wish I was prepared to be actually productive, hardworking and benefit society instead of being prepared to make a billionaire richer than he already is so that he can buy a 13th fancy mega mansion in the countryside.

I study 12 hours a day. I had to give up dance to do this shit because I had to become at math although I'll probably never get a profession related to math in my life. I work more than most adults with 8 hours. I spend 12 hours a day sitting in a chair without moving at all and I take random 30 second breaks with the excuse to get water just to move my body cause I hate sitting on a chair all the time. 

I don't mind labor, I'm not lazy, I have dreams of goals that I'm willing to try hard to achieve, one of my hobbies is literally learning foreign languages. I also want to help my caregiver with her household chores and cooking but she insists I'm too young. I don't have an issue with productivity, I want to make that clear. While I support universal basic income I still think that people should take care of their homes, families and land and get an education, so that they can raise their children, eat their own food and sustain their household. I would still work with ubi. So I'm not against labor.

I am against the modern system of it, the system of ""work"", also known as jobs. They're capitalistic, they only profit the rich, they are unnecessarily hierarchical, and there is no proper work and lfoe balance in today's man's life. People see their bosses and Co workers more than they see their family. I see my classmates and teachers more than I see my caregiver. 8hours is just a couple of hours less than the work hours some people who work in sweatshops have. How is one inhumane, but the 8hour is okay? Don't get me wrong, it is great that got invented, it helped workers a lot at a time when there were simply no sane work hours and employers could do whatever they wanted and exploit their workers even more than today. However, just like many old ideas, it was a produc of its time and isn't perfect, cuase it doesn't help the family life, mental wellbeing and overall happiness of workers.

I hate how school forces me to he good at things that I'm not good at when I'm only going to use what I'm good at for life anyway. Isn't school supposed to prepare us for life? I am good at psychology, philosophy, history, literature, languages, geography, biology and physical education. I am average at physics, and chemistry. I am God awful at math.

I am probably either gonna end up a social worker, a psychologist, a full time historical fiction writer, or a circus performer or a dance teacher. I don't need advanced math, I only need general knowledge of them. I could as well be a language teacher. I don't need to have such extreme knowledge that I'm not going to use anyway. I definetly need general knowledge and a proper education, but I think that the only useful subjects right now, in my middle school are house economics, informatics, P.E., and english, plus literature class but I don't agree with the way it's taught since there is no objective right way to interpret literature. I don't need to know ancient Greek, extreme algebra, or some bs like that and I don't like how this system expect people with different talents to be good at the sake things and rewards perfection and therefore promotes perfectionism. I nearly cried last year seeing all the perfect students who had gotten straight 20s. I work 240 hours a month and hey my studying doesn't pay of, it's simply because people have different abilities and learn in different ways. But I'm not a bootlicker so I'm not expecting a reward from a system I hate.

I feel depressed, numb, empty, anhedonic, and like almost all the things I enjoy doing were ripped from inside of me because I've lsot every single trace of social skills and life I've had. I am with people I love and I simply don't know what to say, what to talk about, how to speak, how to enjoy any thing, and it's super painful and uncomfortable for me. I've lost most of the pleasure from my life, because of this and because of shunning/bullying. Anyway, that was my rant for today.

Recently we have been told that even if off sick, we should contact our team mates to let them know about urgent deadlines. Basically I have no escape unless I'm on my deathbed.

I have tried \*everything\* I can to change my body to survive on less and been to multiple doctors about it but it is pointless. This is just how my body is and I have to accept it. 

People talk about the 8-8-8 split (which never happens in reality), but of course, I'm expected to take the extra 2 hours I need to give to sleep of the ""free time"" pot, \*never\* the ""work"" pot and how \*dare\* I want to take it from the work pot, you lazy entitled millennial snowflake.

I'm not asking to get paid for 40 hours while working 28. I'm perfectly willing to get paid less to work less, because I am willing to be more frugal because my time is worth more to me than commercialism. I don't feel the need to have a ton of stuff. I just want a clean place to sleep, food and the clothes I need. I'm a homebody anyway. Some second hand books, a laptop, and a Netflix subscription is all I need because time spent with friends and family doesn't have to cost much, if anything. I don't feel the need to buy a ton of shit I don't need. Holidays don't have to be expensive either - I stay with friends who live in other places and they stay with me to have holidays.

I am sick of having to choose between being exhausted for my entire day and getting to have a couple of hours free time or not feeling like shit the whole day but having the whole day sucked up by work. By the time I wake up, get ready, commute, come home, eat, shower, poop, do necessary chores.....I basically have to go to bed if I am to get my needed 10 hours.

Behind most of the things that we consume there is a dark process which many of us don't realize. We blindly consume because that is how the system is built. People die from working in slave like labor conditions even today.  The capitalists just throw in some people that would fill their pockets. Products we consume would be so much better if the system we live in focused more on the individual potential of a person.

His machine allows anyone to work for minimum
wage for as long as they like. Turning the crank on
the side release one penny every 4.97 seconds, for a
total of $7.25 per hour. His corresponds to minimum
wage for a person in New Work. His piece is brilliant
on multiple levels, particularly as social
commentary. Without a doubt, most people who
started operating the machine for fun would quickly
grow disheartened and stop when realizing just how
little they're earning by turning this endless crank.
A person would then conceivable realize that this is
what nearly two million people in the United States
do every day...at much harder jobs than turning a
crank. His turns the piece into a simple, yet
effective argument for raising the minimum wage.

1037,Boss is a hivemind of dunces,"About two weeks ago my Boss failed to pay me. I asked about fixing this, and the resulting email chain became a rapidly escalating self-own of contradictory bafflegab that continues to this day. Amidst this, it feels like my 'boss' is having her email run by a number of other people, all with different terrible ideas about how to avoid paying me my tiny paycheck. I keep forwarding this stuff to the Department of Labor to strengthen my back wages case, which I informed them about but they haven't shut up long enough for me to brief them on.

For example:

I just got three emails from her, all with the same font, size, and text color as the finance director who mailed me as well. Those letters, from both email addresses, have been calm. He was asking me for something my boss asked me for, so I bet he asked her for it, but he was also asking me if I'd seen that email she sent me--despite that she had sent him part of my response to it, and she somehow failed to send the other part of my response? What in the world?

Some of these strange emails have huge shifts in tone and phrasing. They would demand things under a tight deadline that previous letters thanked me for sending days ago, or bizarrely contradicting new 'facts' they had only just laid out in the previous letter's attempt at CYA maneuvers. Some of those mails had text which was clearly copy-pasted because the bulk of the mail had one text type and specific sections had an alternative one, and those letters had the belligerent energy and phrasing of the HR manager, who hasn't contacted me but who I know has been involved for a while now because of an email the finance guy forwarded to me maybe accidentally. In just one of these mails, my name was misspelled and a lot of the writing was garbled.

Last week I got a paycheck at least, but for *three hours* of work despite my supervisor having approved the timesheet where I recorded 42. I can no longer rule out some kind of cryptic code being sent to me in the only language that a boss knows, abuse of the worker.

I will not quit, because I want my UI benefits, but oh my goodness is this a carnival of aggressive failure. How can all these bosses, VPs, and department heads be so bad at this?

1041,It‚Äôs sad how it‚Äôs normalized that getting a job is hard nowadays,"First time poster here, been lurking this sub for a while and im glad to have come across people who can understand me.


Basically, to get a job nowadays you‚Äôre required to have a strong portofolio, have ten years of experience right after graduation, know atleast 5 programming languages, speak at least 5 foreign languages, have extra skills that aren‚Äôt related to the job anyhow but are strongly preferred etc. 

Suppose you have all the right skills and you start looking for a job. You send job application emails to 10 different companies, each email being unique because you know copy pasting is cheating and god forbid you use a wrong word only for it to end up on their spam folders. At a best case scenario two respond and one of them is an invitation for an interview. 

You get ready for the interview, you need to have the right clothes with the right brand, show up on time not too early not too late, you go to the interview room where you are expected to be good with body language, verbal language, be charismatic(but not too much) and other unrealistic requirements that no one needs in their everyday life. 

Then you‚Äôre up for some stupid questions such as ‚Äúwhy should we hire you?‚Äù ‚Äúwhy do you need this job?‚Äù Because im fucking broke dude, why else? Oh but you can‚Äôt be honest in a job interview you must be good with words and not give dull answers, not give long answers either but just be perfect, all of which in the end won‚Äôt matter anyway because the decision to hire you or not was made from the start and you just wasted your time. 

You go home and repeat this mundane process over and over again until you finally get lucky and land a job where you‚Äôre underpaid. 

What‚Äôs more sickening is how this is normalized nowadays, it‚Äôs just ‚Äúpart of life‚Äù and ‚Äúyou gotta work hard to be successful‚Äù like no shit but no one says it‚Äôs gonna be harder to even find a job.

Went about as well as you'd expect - the state is basically in a second wave and it has been revealed that a lot of the security guards were going about their normal business outside their shifts, hanging out with family and friends, going and getting KFC or McDonalds mid shift on break because they didn't want to eat the provided food, didn't care if guests left their rooms and went and hung out with family in other room, would let them go to the gym etc. A couple of them were also continuing to work for Uber as another job. 

Now of course, people are up in arms all HOW COULD THEY DO THIS? HOW COULD THEY NOT TAKE THEIR JOBS SERIOUSLY? WHY COULD THEY NOT JUST EAT THE PROVIDED FOOD? WHY DID THEY NOT JUST GO TO WORK AND GO HOME AND STAY AT HOME OTHER THAN THAT.

Well, it's really very simple: **THEY WERE NOT PAID ENOUGH TO CARE AND DO THAT.**

It has also been revealed that these workers were paid fucking peanuts for this job, yet you expect them to have a ton of fucks to give? You expect them to give up their social lives outside work for minimum wage while working? You expect them to be super dedicated to this one job when paid so little that some of them still needed to drive for Uber on the side? 

There are a few lessons that are going to be learned from this pandemic and one of them is that most people are not paid enough to give a shit about their job and at the end of the day, their family and friends are more important than any job and that the price tag to allow work to dictate how you live outside of work is much higher than 98% of companies are willing to pay their workers. 

I'll say it again: THESE GUYS WERE NOT PAID ENOUGH TO CARE WHAT THE GUESTS DID. THEY WERE NOT PAID ENOUGH TO BE TOLD THEY HAD TO EAT CRAPPY UNAPPETISING PROVIDED FOOD. THEY WERE NOY PAID ENOUGH TO FORGO THEIR SOCIAL LIFE.

My entire life has been so goddamn shit thanks to capitalism. My parents want me to make money because, to them, that equals happiness. And I can see why they fucking understand that. Theyve never been able to fully satisfy me or my sister because theyre always working, and they arent even able to spend that money on us. Its always one bill after, one broken thing around the house after another that costs and entire months salary. Weve have to go to bed hungry for a couple months every year because we just straight up do not make enough money.

It shouldnt be like this. They work full-time. The only reason my dad cant get a raise is because he doesnt have a college degree, same for my mom. I have ADHD and CPTSD and a plethora of other mental illnesses that make me incompatible with capitalism, it is hostile to my existence. I cant hold down a job because they work me to death and i burnout in two weeks. Ive always had to quit for the sake of my mental health. And it just makes things worse because now I have even less money, spiking my anxiety and anger even more. Meanwhile billionaires just had an early christmas.

And more than half the people in this goddamn country worship capitalism like some fucking religion. Ive had friends who have told me to stop being lazy and blaming other people for my problems. They just act like im faking all this. They arent my friends anymore for obvious reasons. Some chud is probably gonna make a comment on this post exactly like that, dismissing my problems without even thinking about them deeper than a kiddie pool. Some future chud is probably gonna stalk my profile because i said something provocative, and be like ‚Äúhaha spineless pathetic soyboy, i feel bad for your pathetic existence!‚Äù as if they actually think theyre hurting my feelings. 

My anger is what keeps me going. I have an absolute hatred for everything that is unjust that appears as love on the surface, but I can assure you I‚Äôm angry all the fucking time like the hulk. I just know myself really well so I can control it and point it where it needs to go. At the same time I feel despair and hope. I feel connected to all workers of the world all throughout history, we are connected through our struggle. The spilling of our blood, our sweat, and tears, is what connects us all and its what makes the fight worth it. I can‚Äôt stand this shit anymore. I have to do something about it.

And to the future chud reading this, you have deadass been brainwashed by capitalism. I wish I was joking. There isn‚Äôt anything I can say that will convince you otherwise though.

1066,"Five Reasons to Hate Your Job. From ""Automation and Utopia"" by John Danaher.","Give Reasons to Late Your Mob

The structural badness argument has two parts to it. The first
part consists in identifying the features of work in the modern
world that make it bad for most workers; the second part con-
lists in arguing that these features are difficult to reform or
change. I'll start by rousing on five features of work in the mo-
den world that make it bad for most workers. In brief outline,
they are:

The Problem of Nominating Influence: Employment contracts,
and, more generally, the state of being employed, typically give
employers an unjust dominating power over the lives of for-
hers. His significantly undermine the freedom of workers.

The Problem of Fissuring and Precarity: The working environs-
men is becoming increasingly fissured, and working conditions
are becoming increasingly precarious for many workers. His
makes working life more unpleasant and distressful.

The Problem of Distributive Injustice: Work is distributively
unjust. Technology is resulting in an increasingly polarized for-
force in which a small number of highly paid individuals reap
most of the economic rewards, and these rewards are not, in
any obvious way, proportional to effort or merit.

The Problem of Temporal Colonization: Work colonies our
lives. Most of our mental and physical effort is taken up with
preparing for, performing, or recovering from work. That‚Äôs mo-
re, this colonization is getting worse as a result of technology.

The Problem of Unhappiness and Dissatisfaction: Most people
are dissatisfied with their work and think they could do better,
and this makes it difficult to justify the other bad-making feat-
yes of work.

1077,Applying Online is a BIG Waste of Time,"It doesn't matter how good your resume is, how qualified you are, how much  time you spend to painstakingly filling out the application perfectly  and key wording your resume you still won't get the job because chances  are a real human being won't ever look at your resume once the  Application Tracking System parses it into gibberish and even if they  did, guess what?

Bob Bobberson who  has worked at the firm for 4 years already has his son a shoe in for  the position so them looking at your resume is just a facade to deter  any allegations of nepotism or discrimination. Companies actually are  required by law to post to these positions but by the time you see it  Bobbert Jr is already in the 2nd phase of on boarding.

What's  worse even if they did humor you and give you the time of day and  consider you for the position, guess what? You don't qualify because you  need to be a RECENT college graduate with a Masters Degree from a top  University and have 3 years experience for this ""entry level"" position  so you you can hIT thE gRoUnd rUnNING. Is Bobbert any of these things?  No but his Dad knows the hiring manager so f you.

That's why in College they stress *""Well, tsk, you have to Network (Ass kiss).""* If you don't *""know a guy""* that can get you in through some back door deal or some such flim flam scheme forget about it!

What's  worse if you're in America they'd probably just trash your resume and  look at applicants from overseas since they can hire them quicker,  cheaper and with less risk since they don't have to pay them benefits,  do salary negotiations and can fire them without any Unemployment  Insurance Claims so there's that.

Utter nonsense.

1094,Antiwork activism in a capitalist world,"Let's not kid ourselves, capitalism is king. Everyone from extremists in Iraq to billionaires in China buys and sells with US dollars or the local equivalent. This is a huge barrier to large-scale change that benefits the average Joe.

We want to get rid of mind-numbing work, of the heartless efficiency where we trade our time for money. In most cases our work doesn't even contribute to useful production. The wealth we produce funnels up to the ultra-rich. They make decisions that impact the world, and graciously pay us to do their bidding. This money goes back up and repeats the cycle.

Now that I've said what you already know, I'll make post #5,000,000 asking ""what do we do about it?"" 

The pandemic is accelerating changes in industry that would have taken years to happen (cutbacks, rolling out new technologies, etc.) This is an opportunity for social change as well. As we saw during the last recession, the rich will get richer since they can buy everything at bargain prices. If we sit back and do nothing, it will happen again.

1106,I realized capitalism and the working industry was broken during my first management job.,"I wish I had realized sooner. 


At 17, I worked at a pizza chain and climbed the ladder from delivery driver to assistant manager. 
I realized after how little regard for the rest of the employees management was supposed to have. Their lives, energies, desires, were all worthless under the bottom line of profits.

Assistant managers weren‚Äôt treated much better. We were pushed to work 60-70 hour work weeks, and being in the store working feverishly for 12+ hours at a time. I don‚Äôt just mean sitting at a desk, we were lucky to get 5 minutes to sit down. There were nights when we would leave the store at 3am, then come back to work for 9and continue working til 3am again. There was barely enough time to sleep so usually eating would be done in the few slow moments within the store. That was the expectation, and any unwillingness was met with the common mantra of ‚Äúyou just don‚Äôt want this enough, stop being lazy and work harder‚Äù. 

During a 60 hour work week, after an argument with a very stressed out co-manager,  I abruptly quit and left. I felt bad for my other managers, I left them with my scheduled 50+ hours for the coming week to divide up and try to get people from other stores to cover, but I was done.  

I took two more management jobs in other places in the coming months, and after a month into lockdown I left my newest job. A few of my coworkers had caught the virus, and upper management threatened us with termination if we told anyone in the public about the risk of half of the store being infected.  When I got sick myself, upper management began pushing me out. 

Now, after the peace of lockdown I‚Äôve realized that life should not be about working. We have to work to survive, but I never again want to return to any building under someone‚Äôs feet. 
I‚Äôve started my own retail business and I am studying web design and beginning to gain clients. Hopefully, if all goes well, I‚Äôll be safe in my new chosen path.

1114,Do I pick the free law school or the elite law school that could possibly help me not work later in life?,"Thank you in advance for reading, ANY advice or insight would be very helpful to me right now as I must make a decision soon. Law school deposit deadlines are coming up.

Hey guys, I have a dilemma. No one in other subs seems to get me like you all do. I value my personal  freedom, being financially independent, work-life balance, and enjoying my life a lot more than the average person. I do not want to regret wasting so much time on work when I am old. I don't want to be that person putting off their dreams, travel, and fun plans until old age. I have seen so many around me ruin their health and lives all for the sake of work and I have no intention of doing that. I want to be able to have a family, pursue hobbies, and just \*live\*. I want to do that in my youth too, where it's important, not as a senior citizen. At the same time, I have a big opportunity here to possibly increase my earning potential a lot and retire earlier! 

 Here is my dilemma. I want to be a lawyer. I got into a respectable top 40 law school with a full tuition scholarship. I also got into a prestigious top-14 law school, but that would cost me about 135k in tuition. Family will chip in with the living expenses. The promise or dream that the elite top-14 law schools sell students is that you can get a 200k starting job at an elite firm, after graduating, and be on the path of being a high-income earner the rest of your life. Because the top firms paying top dollar only want to hire grads from these fancy schools to boost their image. These high-paying jobs are around 60 hours a week, however, and can be high-stress depending on the law firm, I hear some law firms are better than others. It increases to half a million like five years in, although many opt-out of the big firm lifestyle by then to achieve better work-life balance. My idea is if I go this elite law school, I work a few years, live frugal, retire early. I could possibly acquire enough to retire by 45 or so.

This trajectory is less certain from the top 40 school, where you're not really guaranteed high income right off the bat. But the education would be free and I would be increasing my earning potential from just my bachelor's degree, and I do want to be a lawyer for a living. I could also luck out with a decent paying job from here if I do well academically, and work my way up, and have more freedom to pick less demanding jobs that won't eat up my work-life balance without the stress of debt. At the elite law school, I would kind of be forced to go the corporate law route in order to pay off the student loan debt initially. 

For those of you outside the legal profession, I'll just say it's insanely elitist and you can look up the statistics which are all public-the 200k corporate starting jobs are basically only available to those at the top 14 law schools according to the US News Rankings, or, if you're lucky, the top 5 or 10% of the lower ranked schools (14-50). All this data is published in the NALP report so it is not a rumor. You don't even have to be above median rank in the top 14 law schools, they will take the *majority* of the class into the elite firms. Unless you are truly horrible at interviewing. Northwestern isn't the school I got into but comparable, you can see the salary info of their 2018 graduates [here](https://www.law.northwestern.edu/professional-life/career/stats/documents/northwestern_pritzker_nalp_employment_summary_2018.pdf). 

Schools that are not the top 14 have more varied salaries reported. This is not the top 40 school I am referring to, but here is a comparable top 60 school for a look at their salary [report](https://www.law.temple.edu/site/wp-content/uploads/Class-of-2017-NALP-Report.pdf)

I am at a crossroads, I can kind of see my life going two ways. Either I put the investment in myself and get the fancy degree which would put me in a 130k+ hole of debt where I'd basically be forced to work an intense job a few years after, and then I could have freedom, fuck-you money, and the ability to go my own way with my fancy credential. I could retire early and stop working earlier. But I would also be a figurative slave to debt and *forced* to work a high-intensity job for a bit. I also heard these 200k+ jobs (you make like 500k your 6th year in by the way), which are the whole appeal of paying over 100k in tuition, destroy people's marriages, give people strokes, alcoholism, heart attacks and are utterly soul-crushing as you give your life away to the almighty billable hour and can't say no to more work because you're paranoid you'll be replaced by a younger associate attorney. But I also hear some firms are enjoyable to work in. Plus, once you have two years experience in these corporate firms, the world is your oyster, you can go corporate in-house, you can go federal government attorney, you can go back and dominate your hometown, you have that line on your resume to then do whatever etc. Also, I am in a better boat than a lot of people who didn't get a scholarship at this school and would be paying closer to 220k for the elite law school in full. The elite law school also has a program where if your income happens to be less than 75k (aka you go into government work to start) the school will pay your loan payments, and after 10 yrs of that ""low income"" government your loans are forgiven? I don't know the details off the top because I want to go into private practice, but it's a nice idea to fall back on if you end up with a lower than 75k but comfier public interest job. 

Or I could take the full scholarship, feel grateful I am becoming a lawyer for almost free, and make my own way that route. I am not certain that the work life balance is better this way, lower paid lawyers do work very hard,  but I hear it is less demanding than at less prestigious firms. But the pay would also be a bit less. I would also have flexibility and go an different way in my career without being financially ruined given the full tuition scholarship, and I would not essentially be forced to work to pay off debt. I could even dip out and move to a cheaper country and do remote work (long time dream of mine) and live well on lower income in a LCOL area. 

I will say the free school in question is very respectable and the best in its state. It is not like a joke of a law school, it is solid. And no, I have no option in between the two like a 25 rank because the in-between ones waitlisted me or had tuition rates even higher than the elite law school (wtf?). A lot of people pay good money to go to the top 40 law school.  There is also a great chance I can dominate academically and make the top rank there even though everyone says law school grading is a crapshoot, and still get that high paying job from there that way. I did manage to be high ranked at my huge university, graduated with a bunch of honors, and definitely am capable of putting in the work required for high grades. I financed my entire fancy undergrad education on scholarships for high grades alone. 

On a personal level, my personal expenses are not very many. I do not live extravagantly, never have. So I do not need to keep up with the Joneses. A house down the line would be nice, but I am not looking to spring on cars, mansions, clothes all the time. My expenditure is like maximum 30k a year in a HCOL city and I'm inflating that number so that I don't fool myself. I don't drink or party at all, super homebody. So I am more apt than the average person (imo) to be able to save, I've just always been like this and don't care about material items as much as freedom, travel, work-life balance, not being enslaved to debt. If I get the high paying job, most of it is going straight to retirement, saving, and investments for my future financial freedom and I'll try to pay no more than 1200k on rent. What worries me however is there is no guarantee of the high-paying job, it still depends on your interview skills and resume, and things can happen quick, health, circumstances, family, etc. I don't like the thought of taking out so much in loans when life is uncertain. After the 2008 recession so many top law school grads lost their offers and left the field completely, in hundreds of thousands of student loan debt.

One last thing I'll mention is that I don't see law as a get-rich-quick scheme. I legitimately want to be a lawyer, that's why I was going to go to the non elite school before getting accepted to the elite one! I know I'll enjoy the work more than anything I have done yet, and I am tired of working jobs below my capability around awful, catty, disrespectful managers who think their master's degree gives them license to condescend everyone. I want to be the one in charge, autonomous, and a legit professional, and have the ability to start my own practice. My old toxic manager would shit her pants if she knew I got into this top law school, she treated me like such a dunce. I need to advance my education, get a graduate degree, to get away from the fuckery that is available to bachelor's degree holders. I could use the legal education to create my own income as well.

 I never thought I could get in to the elite law school, but I did recently, and now I am thinking about whether by being penny-wise and pound-foolish about tuition, I could be hurting my earning potential and throwing away an opportunity. But the demands of the high-paying big law firm job worry me as I am not trying to give myself a stroke or spend the majority of my life as a slave to work. 

People have been very mixed advising me:

* my parents think debt is the devil, jobs are uncertain not guaranteed, and are pushing the cheaper school on me
* my prestige-focused friends are projecting their desires on me, telling me to get into debt for the elite school
* my poorer but very spiritually in tune friends tell me to take the cheaper school and relax debt-free
* the attorneys I know who went to the top law schools tell me to take the scholarship because their debt payments are a pain in the ass and they are jealous of debt-free people, they are also bitter their top law schools didn't help them enough with the job search
* people in medicine or non-law fields think a degree is a degree and discount the intense elitism in this field, they tell me to take the scholarship
* people who I trust for advice tell me to take the route of no debt because that is what will me more mentally freeing and more empowering, and allow me to be more flexible
* guys who are underemployed and underpaid tell me they regret their decisions not to go big, go elite, and get paid, they push the elite option out of bitterness for their own situations and think it's an instant way to be rolling in money
* my rich friends think 130k is no big deal at all and tell me to take the elite school
* my friends who live abroad and are unfamiliar with the elitism in the US tell me a law degree is a law degree and that they'll hire people from the top 40 school, they tell me not to get into debt
* people who went to non-prestigious undergrad schools seem to be trying to compensate by being hyped up about elite graduate schools and what it says about them, I can't relate as I am not trying to make up for anything or front on a resume, my undergrad institution was good and I am not that insecure about my skills or qualifications. I just am trying to do a cost-benefit analysis here.
* my most recent ex, a lawyer, who tried to sabotage my application process the whole time, told me to take the free school because he couldn't stand I got into a higher ranked elite law school than he did. I believe he said that just to sabotage my career because he prides himself on his grad degree (went to an unknown undergrad, trying to compensate for something) and was mad the law school I got into was a few spots above his alma mater. Jealous fuckwit. He thinks he is one of the unlucky ones who should be more successful rn considering his 300k degree, bitter
* another ex, not a lawyer, but a financial advisor, told me to go for the elite law school because investing in myself can never go wrong
* laypeople impressed by the name of the law school tell me to go to the elite one because ""I'll never be broke or unemployed"" going there, but being employed at a stressful job can't be that much of a prize either

Just really conflicted, feeling pulled in all directions. I will say however I am grateful for these opportunities and I know that I am in a privileged position to even be talking like this about acceptances. I don't want to sound ungrateful. 

Give me your best anti-work, pro living your best life perspective. Because at the end of the day, I know my peace of mind and time are most important. I would especially love to hear from people who left high paying jobs or have already made it through the other side and realized that you can't put a price on work-life balance and not being in debt. 

Logically, I know the safe and free route is great, but if the elite one offers loan re-assistance payments for below 75k public interest and the majority of grads get a job that exceeds 130k, doesn't it pay off?? I am at a loss as to what to do right now. Would the top 40 school be a waste of time if I end up with a job offer less than what I could've made with just a bachelor's, worst case scenario?

tldr: Do I spend 130k for fancy law school tuition in hope of quicker financial freedom (but those jobs are often intense and demanding), or do I go to the law school that offered me a full scholarship?",False,hmgwfs,laww54321,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hmgwfs/do_i_pick_the_free_law_school_or_the_elite_law/,4,1

Oh, and the password requirements always vary from none, to ""use a letter, number, symbol, lower and uppercase"" and there will be a cute bar below this part letting you know how garbage they think your password is, unless it looks like ""8J^√ó86√∑Bhsi0en83?/$/5""

Okay next page...Upload the resume. Beautiful. Ive uploaded the resume and...Oh wait, they dont accept that file type. No biggie, ill just resave the resume as another file that they accept. Oh, looks like ill have to convert my resume to a specific file that my word program cant do. Thats okay, ill just google it, sign up for some free trail to some file conversion site to convert the file they specifically need...

Great, resume is uploaded and good to go. Next page...

Fill in your work experiences

But...Its all in my resume...The one I had to hand over in a digital silver platter... I have to now deconstruct my entire resume? Good grief, okay, let me fill out these 2 sections and take a break

.....

Comes back, fills out the rest. Hits enter...

Page timeout? It then reloads the page, erasing all the work you put in deconstructing your resume. So you rifle through and do it all again. Youre probably at 60 minutes in this application now. Now you fill in your availability...Ofcourse im going to tell you im available all day everyday...If i put that id like Sundays off, then im not as appealing as the others who put full availability.

After your profile and everything is set up, now you can ""apply"" for the job you originally came here for. This took over an hour...Lets just preview what the resume looks like before we apply

1129,Indoctrinated Since Day 1,"The day we are born into this world we are already indoctrinated,

DOB, Name, Gender, Ethnicity, Address.

During our adolescence years  we get taught what our parent's knew from their upbringing and want to provide the best for us to survive and enrich through this world. We don't know better during adolescence ages as we are very ignorant to the world and our surroundings. 

We get put into pre-school, primary school and high school, during those years the teacher's have no control on what they teach to future kids but it's what have been handed down to them from government standards. Say one wrong thing they will get punished by the system. 

Do you ever wonder why the school does not teach people the truth about money ? Where does it come from ? Why was it created ? Why do we slave our lives over it ? Why does the rich use money to work for them while the proletariats work for money ? 

Principles and question's that are never to be revealed but at the same time one can't question the system because it is what it is, until one reaches a finalised conclusion for them selves. 

After high school most of us will either try to find work if not try and pursue something align in our interest in college, take out debt to get a degree to find work to pay off our debt. Once we get enough credit and good rating we can later pursue to purchase/rent vehicles on finance and leverage into property, our idealism isn't sometimes align to what we perceive but it's a combination of who we hang out with and a conjunction of bullshit propaganda to formalise of what we perceive as the American Dream... 

We go to work working 8,10,12 hrs ""x"" days/weeks/months/years/decades/ to pay of our debts as we need to formally justify our purchase and validate that this is what we want and we did the right thing... We can't question what we do at work, we always obey to our bosses and if we don't our justifiable purchases on credit will be taken away from us or we will be thrown out on the streets for going against the system. 

Being enslaved in this capitalist system is considered being a productive member of society... It's a idealism that we accepted during our adolescence years as when we are vulnerable we tend to adapt to our surroundings. 

I don't understand how people find babies and kids cute while being happy that they have finally pass onto their genes but with out thinking that they are setting up their off spring into a life through of misery, pain and bullshit just to keep the machine ticking. 

I always wonder why humans are the only species that have to work for money and pay for rent while the rest of the animal kingdom don't have too... 

Depression and anxiety is a big killer as we are not design to be apart of this bullshit system, it is causing so much stress on every single one of us but if we try to bring this up we get thrown with meds to suppress our emotions which is trying to mitigate us from what is the truth... 

There isn't much around this capitalist society except for having a shit load of money when it works for you and you are not working for the system.

We try and find things to do to justify our reasoning of being alive and what we can contribute to this system but in the back of our mind time and death can't escape us because one day it will come... 

There is so much in this world that there is enough for every ones need but not for ones greed.  

I always wonder what would happend if there was a reset. A reset back to the old ages where we get to free roam and explore this planet called home. Perhaps when we die we will find out what's next installed for us...

Now, after getting 3 university degrees (one undergraduate and two graduate) in STEM, I feel wholly disappointed. I thought about becoming a researcher, but those visions were crushed once I got to experience everything around it. People are stuck in old patterns and don't want change, and there's a shitload of rivalry and bureaucracy. Don't get me wrong, there are good people there too, but overall I'm just disappointed.

I did math, fairly abstract math that's only interesting to a handful of people. At this level you're just defining new things the way you want to make stuff work, and while it can be fun, it also feels a bit pointless.

I also got a professional degree in engineering. Is it more fun? Yeah, but there are issues here too, most often with methods being pulled out of the void. Why do we calculate it this way? Because it works. What if something else is better? Then whatever.

I'd prefer to make video games and build stuff, like my own boat. Also, I like food. I want to do research too, but in things that interest me and not what gives you a job or pays a grant. What options do I have?

Acquiring sustenance (water, followed by food), is the simple act of staying alive, and once achieved, is sufficient to be the sole purpose of most any creature‚Äôs life. Sustenance gathering is only surpassed in importance by the avoidance of physical harm.

Even a very, very hungry man will not jump in front of a bus to pick up food in the street. This securing of safety, then sustenance, is the basic algorithm of all life.

I now work a job that‚Äôs more peaceful but I get paid virtually nothing. Seriously, it pays almost nothing and I‚Äôm soon going to be drowning in costs of simply being *alive*.

Everyone around me has this attitude that ‚Äúit‚Äôs just what you have to do‚Äù and ‚Äúworking is just part of life. You just have to do it‚Äù and I wholeheartedly resent that.

I had this friend who quit his job and then lived off his parents income [to pay for the bills in his house, car, pets, food, weed, etc) for almost a year to ‚Äúwork on his mental health‚Äù. Imagine the privilege. I *wish* could do that but even trying to work a simple part time job now means I worry heavily about money which does *not* help my mental health. Christ.

So I‚Äôve decided to put ‚Äúfocusing on my mental health‚Äù on the back burner for now and find new work that will most likely be of high stress but pay much better than what I‚Äôm doing now. Which, hey it‚Äôs more important because capitalism.

1167,"Waxing Pretentious, College, &amp; Loneliness","I chose the username ""Ging\_Freakz"" after the namesake of a fictional character from a series called Hunter X Hunter. In the series, the man Ging Freecss represents both a goal for the main character as well as this out-of-reach yet fascinating and mysterious ideal of a man. Despite there being good reason for the MC to not actually like or want to find him, he goes on because he wants to know why Ging made the choices he had made. Hopefully I haven't already spoiled too much about the series and you'll go to see it for yourself. Why do I bring this up? 

&amp;#x200B;

Because Ging represents to me an ideal of both strength and freedom that wasn't tied down by the trappings so many of us are caught up in, whether we want to be or not. I write this as a college student having finally gone back to school and get his life together after 2 years of drudgery, self-destruction, and poor choices that damn near made me homeless. I was lucky to have the support net that I do - to have a family as loving and forgiving as the one I have - because I otherwise would have wound up as another statistic. I write this as a young man who has already been through 6 jobs in less than 2 years, either because I hated the job and bounced or was fired for asinine reasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

I write this as someone who has no fucking clue where the hell to go - because the dreaded question of ""What do you want to be when you grow up""/""What do you want to do with your life?"" carried with it an existential baggage that weighed on and wailed on my psyche since middle school. I've come a long way from where and who I was in the past 2 years, and I am excited to think about what the future may hold for me. And yet I am worried. I am worried that that glee and anticipation will have me from hoping for the best to only ever expecting the worst. What the hell do I want to do? Where do I want to go?

&amp;#x200B;

In all honesty, I'd rather much work at some kind of brewery or dispensary while I'm attending classes and perhaps even after I'm done with my higher ed. It brings me a great relief however to know that there are others out there who share the same sentiment: ""I don't have a dream job, and if it were my choice I wouldn't be working this bullshit to begin with.""

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing is, I wonder just how many others there are out there whom I may never know of or meet. I wonder if I may ever know the relief that others hold this similar sentiment, and whom I may enjoy the company of. Money makes the world go around. So does labor. But work doesn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know where the hell I was going with this begin with. I could have just as easily put all of this into a notepad text file, deleted it, forget the time I just spent on something only to do away with it, and go back to whatever I was supposed to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

It just feels at times as though I'm already running out of time - that I'm too short on time - yet I'm only so young. There's 24 hours in the day, yet it feels like there's always this vying for that time and so in the end we may end up time impoverished as well as cash impoverished. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not a writer. I'm not a good writer. I'm not a good worker. I'm not a good college student. I'm not a good person. I'm just trying to make sense of what's going on half the time and any time I try to my mind just draws to a blank. I'm just trying to make sense of what's happening around me. I'm just trying to be the man I want to be. It seems rather unclear. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the end, what's the point of money besides just spending it? But it's hardly ever that simple, and at the same time it's complicated in a way that quickly turns ugly - not the kind of complicated like the brilliant science behind the physics of Raleigh scattering.

1175,"This sub talked me out of moving to the States, thank you.","I'm from an Eastern European shit-hole of a country, and my north star in high school was just moving to America and working as a medical researcher.That is, until I learned the truth about the American dream, largely thanks to you guys.The new plan is to move to a Scandinavian country or the Netherlands, somewhere that at least somewhat appreciates human life.",False,hjguu3,DJschmumu,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hjguu3/this_sub_talked_me_out_of_moving_to_the_states/,175,1
1176,Quitting during covid,"I work at a very small CPA firm (me + a boss and 1 coworker) doing essentially the work of a cpa without actually having my license. My husband is high risk for covid &amp; works from home at the time for a tech company owned by an equity firm (therefore his job is very precarious). I am still going to the office as my boss and coworker are both very old school, understand very little about computers and technology and don‚Äôt see wfh as an option in our workspace. The firm is very busy as next week is the last week of tax season.

Pre covid my job has been an insufferable place to work and is exacerbated by 2020 events. My boss makes racist ‚Äújokes‚Äù and on a weekly basis asserts political discussions which consist of him regurgitating pro-trump Fox News garbage edging on boogaloo rhetoric. The things he says are hateful and violent, and he simply throws statements into discussions and laughs about it like it‚Äôs nothing. I realize my personal history with abuse has enabled me to ‚Äòendure‚Äô this for 3 years. 

As soon as the pandemic broke out, he constantly has been diminishing the severity of covid and importance of safety, and follows trumps safety advice over that of medical professionals. (Everyone should take hydroxychloroquine as a preventative measure, doctors should inject people with disinfectants, and all). We were able to keep clients out during the shelter at home order. As soon as it ended, he removed our sign and replaced it with a ‚Äúmasks encouraged‚Äù one, now clients enter with or without masks, our office neighbors constantly enter the office without a mask. He has returned to meeting with clients and doesn‚Äôt wear a mask. Neither he nor my coworker commit to social distancing in the office and talk about going out on weekends. Suffice it to say I don‚Äôt feel protected.

My husband is constantly encouraging me to just quit my job because he doesn‚Äôt feel safe with me going to the office with covid still being prevalent and the number of cases increasing in our state. I‚Äôve been on a serious job hunt since April and have only had 4 interviews, no offers. 

Financially: I‚Äôm the breadwinner, rent is 53% of my husband‚Äôs income, and we have 3 months of my income months saved (could stretch it out a few more months). We have a lot of student loan debt and about $7300 in credit card debt. 

I‚Äôm looking to just send an email to let him know I don‚Äôt feel comfortable coming back. I want to weigh outside feedback on my situation as I am trying to make the right decision.",False,hjcjxe,pooorvegan,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hjcjxe/quitting_during_covid/,11,2

1181,Software consultant during the pandemic,"Working your way to a job with little work, low stress and decent pay is possible. I've struggled all my life, come from a really poor background and haven't finished high-school. I've had over 15 jobs and been fired from at least 7 places.

My typical week looks like this: 

3 days I work about 3.5h with the rest of the day spent on stand-by with the occasional DM in Slack. 

1/5 days I work fairly hard - 6 hours

1/5 I don't have any scheduled duties at all. 

Since the pandemic I don't have a commute either and can sleep until 8.30 AM every morning. 

So in summary about 16h/week with no commute. For this I get about 130k CAD. 

I feel guilty when I see how much everyone else need to work for their money. I think I hacked the system.",False,hj51dm,1998hiphop,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hj51dm/software_consultant_during_the_pandemic/,1,1

1184,"I'm scared for the future of my partner and I. Both of us are disabled, but not yet on SSI. What can we do to keep our heads above water? I'm very afraid.","Both my partner ad I are disabled and seeking SSI, but as it stands currently, w don't have any income. I have been able to keep a job for a month tops before everything goes to shit and I am unable to keep going at it, regardless of how dire a situation is, my brain and body just can't do it. My partner is in a similar position. The only reason we'll be kept afloat at all is because we're going into public housing and we'll be on food stamps, but that's not enough to sustain us alone, and I'm so afraid. 

I wish I could just be neurotypical and able-bodied and just suck it up and work but every time I try to do that I end up in the hospital and once I'm out I'm worse for wear. I haven't been able to get a break in years, let alone get back on my feet after some trauma I won't go into detail with here.

I don't know what to do. SSI can take years to pass, it's already been a full year since I started my application. There's general assistance here to help out, but that's only $200/month max, and if I get on it some will be taken to pay rent in public housing.

I want advice and a listening ear, I guess. What can we do? How are we supposed to survive? We don't have any family we can fall back on, and a lot of our friends are a few bad days from being in the same boat as us. They can only help so much. We've had to beg online for money to make ends meet once the food stamps run out, and people are only willing to give so much so often before they're fed up with helping.",False,hjor79,alumirust,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hjor79/im_scared_for_the_future_of_my_partner_and_i_both/,9,1

1196,Great representation of minimum wage work," 

His machine allows anyone to work for minimum
wage for as long as they like. Turning the crank on
the side release one penny every 4.97 seconds, for a
total of $7.25 per hour. His corresponds to minimum
wage for a person in New Work. His piece is brilliant
on multiple levels, particularly as social
commentary. Without a doubt, most people who
started operating the machine for fun would quickly
grow disheartened and stop when realizing just how
little they're earning by turning this endless crank.
A person would then conceivable realize that this is
what nearly two million people in the United States
do every day...at much harder jobs than turning a
crank. His turns the piece into a simple, yet
effective argument for raising the minimum wage.
