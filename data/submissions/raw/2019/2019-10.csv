I'm also quite puzzled by HR asking me to do more research about their company before the screening tomorrow because there isn't enough information on their website. A lot of grandiose words with no meaning being thrown around that's all. 

I was in a bad condition and had two panic attacks after that phone call.

[https://newmedia.calcalist.co.il/magazine-24-10-19/a04.html](https://newmedia.calcalist.co.il/magazine-24-10-19/a04.html)

(The writer is a journalist. and at some point was the editor of TimeOut Tel-Aviv. It might seem like a dream job from our perspective. And then you stumble upon this column).

\*\*\*

**“I bought a car to get to work.** I insured it, and I pay for gas to get there. 

I purchase and prep food to have at work, and when I shop for clothes - I buy ones that would be comfortable to wear at my workplace. I rather not go as far as saying that I pay rent so I’d have someplace to rest before work; but unfortunately, it's true. Soon enough, I’ll have children, and I’ll be paying for daycare and various other similar arrangements for them, because I’ll be at work.

In order to escape this vicious cycle known as “**adulting**”, or in less flattering terms: “**life**”, I could take various classes in what little time I have in the evening, after I stood in traffic on my way back from work. I could learn flamenco dancing or martial arts, or go to a movie to consume some culture, and once I’m done with those enriching activities - I can go to sleep and wake up early, so I won’t be late for work.

I can also participate in all kinds of mindfulness movements, “live in the moment” and “choose to be happy”; statements not dissimilar to ones often uttered by prisoners: “you can put my body behind bars, but as long as my mind is free, I remain free”.

Alternatively, I can decide that it’s fine that I live at work, and do the following: dress up and go to the office as if I’m headed for a festive event, or get the food I really like for myself to have at work. They call it self-care in America, when they actually mean the **commercialisation of self care**. I can decide it’s oh-so-much-fun to chat up my coworker in the office’s kitchen, about what kind of salad she made on Friday; or establish an elaborate opinion on some reality TV episode everyone’s talking about, to create a genuine and meaningful moment. After all, those are all tried and true methods to maintain one’s humanity, even during the darkest times in history. Even in murderous sects. 

Truth be told, I don’t even know why I bother going to the gym, or apply anti-wrinkle creams on my face, since the only people who get to see me in full daylight (well, fluorescent light) are strictly forbidden from ever being attracted to me. I’m not actually required to look good, just “presentable”.

**Who is to blame for all of this?** Certainly not the cost of living alone. People have been working since the dawn of days, often times more than the 8 hours of full-time employees, or 14 hours of IT slaves, or the bizarre limbo of always-working and never-working of freelancers. Every population in this country is working all day long. Even the loaded ones are at work all day, every day. They just have to drive a more expensive car to get there. 

The blame lies in **the illusion of free will.** 

If I weren’t tricked into thinking I get some kind of a choice here, I wouldn’t have complained. But I was always expected to **“acquire an education”** and **“build a career”**, a satisfying career even, to strive for **“self-fulfilment”** and other damned lies. **So many wasted words**. Just tell me to shut up and go to work, I’ll understand. Tell me in advance that life is what happens for 3 hours every evening, and I’ll set my expectations accordingly. I’ll treat that time as sacred, I’d prepare for it, I’d *work* for it. 

And I’d be utterly, truly happy.""",False,dp4jsc,Styro33,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/dp4jsc/i_work_for_my_job_meytal_shapiro_opinion_piece/,3,73

13,A Brief Review on This Subs favorite Billionaire,"Welcome all. Today I’ll be discussing the one CEO who gets a pass. The one who is almost God-like and is single handedly saving our lives. The underdog according to some users (in this sub, actually), or the only ceo who doesn’t care about $$ (yes, still in this fucking sub). Well I thought I’d throw together some info on this supposed savior. It’s early and I haven’t had my coffee or nicotine so I might leave out some of his “highlights” or my writing might not be perfect. Apologies. 


I spent a decent amount of time in a thread trying to inform other users of this sub (yes, of THIS sub), that Elon musk is no different than any other billionaire. All replies to top comment [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/dmym5s/selfmade/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)


Instead of responding one at a time to his boot lickers, I figured I’d just make a big ole list of reasons why you should stop worshipping him. 

First maybe we could look into why so many people are worshipping him and only him. Like most billionaires, he has a team of workers who monitor his PR. He even came out and talked specifically about reddit and his team working there. 
(Only link-less claim, couldn’t find it. If anyone has info on it please send it to me. From about two-three years ago).

People in the thread were defending him for Tesla’s “break throughs” and how much they help the environment. I’ll touch on this last, but first let’s talk all things not Tesla. 

Hyperloop: an idea birthed by the thought that “you could be standing by anybody on a subway”. He has completed a mile of tunnel that was supposed to be offering free rides last December. He now hails it as R&amp;D and not the actual tunnel. He had a plan to sell the dirt as compressed bricks, then someone pointed out the housing crisis in his state, now he’s going to sell them at 10/c a pop. 

That was May 2018. I’ve seen small demonstrations of the bricks being used. If any musk stans who are lost and still hanging out in this sub have any info about the houses he built please PM. 

More specifics on [the glorious tunnel](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2018/12/19/elon-musks-tunnel-project-in-los-angeles-is-bad-joke/)


He’s info on what the bricks [could have been used for](https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/a20874588/musk-boring-company-dirt-bricks-cseb-affordable-housing/)
Hint: they shouldn’t leave the tunnel. 

Phew. Well musk fans probably downvoted and moved on by now. For those of you still with me let’s talk maybe they’re reading the good news of Musks New Solar Roof! Literally just launched v3 yesterday.  And idea that originally launched in 2016. And don’t worry, these aren’t the same ones from earlier this year![poor Walmart](https://www.businessinsider.com/photos-walmart-roof-tied-to-tesla-solar-panels-lawsuit-2019-8) I kinda hope they are going to be like the ones from 2016 where thousands of people paid for a reservation and dozens received a product! [outstanding](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/24/tesla-solar-roof-tiles-where-are-they.html?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
(There’s a video of a poor sap who paid a huge reservation and is waiting for a third year if anyone has it)

Now some people might come in and say musk is revolutionizing solar panels and making them used by the common man. Users also responded to me and said the same thing about Tesla’s batteries...
People fail to realize, musk bailed out solar city in 2015 and bought out his cousin, fellow South African billionaire. The tech was their before musk. Same with Tesla using Panasonic batteries. He isn’t making them accessible for the common man because the common man can’t buy from him. He isn’t the only business offering solar and most business are going to look elsewhere after the wal mart lawsuit. 

Does musk get new people to use greener methods? Yes. He is a salesman. Selling things he didn’t invent. Does almost every other billionaire who owns any stock in any energy company get people to use greener methods? Yes. Why is musk different? Because he’s a meme and acting like he is your eco friendly buddy is way easier than being realistic. 

Are environmentally conscious people following musks lead? No they’ve had solar panels for a decade.  They drive a 10 year old used car that doesn’t need raw materials and lithium that Tesla doesn’t even know how to recycle. 

Now here’s what really gets me. People tell me all day that Elon doesn’t care about profits. He only cares about bettering the world. If you are in this sub and you believe this in your heart of hearts, take three steps back and literally fuck your own face. This is [AN ANTI WORK SUB](www.google.com/search?q=musk+labor+laws&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-us&amp;client=safari#sbfbu=1&amp;pi=musk%20labor%20laws)

So many fucking results. You could spend a day reading up on this union busting piece of shit. Tell me why he doesn’t care about money and then explain why someone who has no needs for profits milks every last penny from his workers? This link alone should tell you all you need to know. 

Now on to tesla. I’ll start off by saying what Tesla, not musk, gets credit for. Making an Electric vehicle that a younger crowd and not environmentally aware crowd wants. 
Tesla made the first electric vehicle to most people. While this is far from true, many see it as fact. 
The battery is made by Panasonic, so don’t be like users in the first thread I linked and praise Elon for his battery break through. The battery is also the best feature of the car. Don’t get me started with other issues I have with the product. (Worst paint &amp; panel gaps in the business, interior feels like the plastic from a Honda oddessy, “self driving” bullshit that his idiotic customers believe and then pull some shit like reading while driving.etc etc.)

I have him credit where credit is due, yes? If any musk stans actually read all this please tell me what you think. I’d love to hear you still justify his praise by telling me how he is still different than the others. I am 100% sure some one out there will. I am prepared to answer with other CEOs that maybe we could worship instead because ThEy HeLp MoRe ThAn HuRt. Why is he helping so much? Because space X? Do you miss the days we used to praise the astronauts and engineers and not the billionaire over lords who let them use a small fraction of their money? Or is he helping because rich people are buying Tesla’s then trading them in three years later for a newer Mercedes they’ll drive for three years. Maybe the new Tesla roadster would help too. Why make the cheapest EV you could for the masses when you could release an Uber expensive one that goes fast?



Honorable mentions: Thai cave incident, SEC fining him over damaging tweets, his Twitter is more comparable to Donald trump than any other celeb, [reddit user spilling his beans on Space X](ttps://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughMuskSpam/comments/c7pmaf/yes_spacex_really_did_falsify_test_documents_no_i/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) , his claim to help flints water crisis, claiming to be socialist while union busting and being the largest donor for a republican PAC, people believing neuralink is coming in a year or so, being a “green CEO” to all his lap riders and then selling them flame throwers they used once and forgot about.

20,I quit. Feeling bittersweet about it.,"Hey Reddit,

Cross posting this. Should have posted here first. 

I quit my job. It feels so good. For months, I tried my hardest. Absolute damn hardest to make it work. I was a manager at a big company and was extremely proud of my position and it was a big part of my identity. Until I realized how difficult it was to manage people who are double your age and don't care about you or what you have to say. Until I realized that people will call in for sneezing and then managers who are salaried have to always stay.

Until I realized that companies are eager to short staff their branches despite posting profit over profit each quarter. Sometimes managers managed multiples branches with a minimal raise. Until I realized nobody cared about what I had to say and just began to feel like I was a robot. Nobody remembered the good I did. They remember the couple times I had to say no. I remember putting together gift bags for holidays and barely getting a thank you. I remember trying to get them to sign sympathy cards for other staff members losses and it was a bother.

I took calls on vacations and off days for anything work related. I came in on days off if needed too. But it wasn't enough.

I had to humble myself despite the fact that my family and friends were concerned that I would be stepping down from the great paycheck and title I worked so hard for. I quit. I feel bittersweet. Happy the stress and toxic environment is gone but I feel like a loser. Like as if I couldn't handle it and just walked away. Like a failure. I feel like everyone is looking down upon me and I wish things could have been different. But money isn't everything when it's impacting your health and nobody wanted to work together as a team. 

And I am glad I am done. I just wanted this off my chest. Just looking for support.

21,Even as a child I considered 2 days out of 7 to be absolute bullshit,"I honestly feel like school is simply meant to brainwash people into being obedient wageslaves who will then attempt to silence and attack any one who questions the system.

You have minimum wageslaves defending their own mistreatment. And everyone always has the same excuses, word for word too which is why I believe brainwashing is involved. 

""Well that's just the way it is!""

""In this other place this other person has it worse!"" Always gotta use the ""somebody has it worse"" shtick. Imagine thinking like that for everything. Imagine getting a 40% on your test, feel bad about it, but then get told that because someone got 20% you're supposed to be grateful. So now you've been fooled into being grateful and happy ... over failing your test. This is what they do to keep you complacent and sedated. 

I think it should 3 days off MINIMUM. I think that should be law. People should be standing up for this. This is our lives, do we want to waste it doing things we dislike for so much of our time we neglect what's really important? Some people have nothing outside work to the point where they die a few years after retirement due to a lack of purpose in life.

32,On my way out,"My job as a Designated Service Provider or DSP (I support those with mental disabilities at their group homes) sucks and I can't take it much more. I love supporting my guys, they're like my kids at this point but of course the management and certain co workers have made it unbearable. I do my best to take care of my guys, but management and certain coworkers always got some criticism to make me think like I'm incompetent or callous and cruel. Hell today my boss threatened me with writing me up which usually leads to firing soon after so yay. 

What keeps me sane is I was already planning on finding another agency so I can go from full time to part time in a better environment as I'm planning to go back to college for my masters. The thought of working less and in a non abusive environment feels like I'm dreaming of a fucking paradise.

I realized this pretty early on though not early enough considering how my dad's ""dedication"" to his job destroyed our family and any stability I could hope to have as a kid by putting us through endless ridiculous moves. And for what, my dad never even PRETENDED to enjoy his job. It was a corporate job that always promised this time would be the last time we'd all have to move, sometimes to different *countries*, that he wouldn't have to travel as much, just wait another year. I almost feel sorry for him if he actually believed them. The first and only corporate internship I had, I usually babysat for money but my dad figured that wasn't good enough (I never had any complaints, I love kids and it's fun easy summer work for me) and got me some job where his friend was the boss. It was clear there was no actual work for me to do, it was all bullshit, but they still had some girl ""mentor"" me. One day she asked me why I never asked her how i could ""improve"" my work, I told her that she'd never given me any indicator that my work was less than satisfactory. She said that I should be trying to do more than was asked of me, I laughed and told her this was just a job and I didn't really care about \~honing my craft\~ or whatever she was trying to sell me. She was so offended, treated me like shit for the rest of the time. 

My social skills aren't great (probably has to do with moving constantly for my whole childhood!) and I just can't give what the corporate environment wants. Honestly though even if I did what amount of money could make me give up so much of my life for that. For nothing! If every corporate job disappeared tomorrow every jobless worker would be left with next to nothing in terms of actual practical skills for normal human life.

44,On Work and Appearance,"I've been thinking a lot lately about the ways that work follows us even after we've clocked out.

Specifically, I’ve been dwelling on how our jobs dictate the way we look inside and outside of work. For context, the majority of my experience comes from retail and office jobs. My current office is relaxed in its dress code, and most people adhere to something in the realm of ""business casual"". Mostly I see jeans or khakis (and even shorts in warm weather) paired with anything from a basic T-shirt to a button down. There is rarely anyone wearing a tie in the office, let alone a suit jacket, yet like most offices it still feels like there is an unwritten acceptable “look” regardless of how relaxed the standard for clothing is.  

I am aware that my company is not in the norm regarding many of our appearance policies, and I am grateful for that. Many employees have visible or semi-visible tattoos, and a few have their hair dyed “non-natural” colors. Many companies would not allow even this level of expression be visible in the workplace, though it still feels like there is an unwritten understanding that being too far outside the mainstream is basically asking to put a freeze on your advancement/mobility (or at the very least asking to get asked frequent questions about why you look different).

Obviously the dynamics of gender presentation, “professionalism”, client facing roles, cultural tradition, and many more factors impact how we look at work, however the way we present ourselves to our bosses leaves a lasting impact on how we are permitted to present ourselves to others in our lives. Because dying my hair or getting an “unprofessional” hair cut or getting a visible tattoo might offend a potential employer, I’m not allowed to alter these totally superficial parts of my body for longer than a weekend. I have no option other than to look within one standard deviation of every other drone in my office with no visible personality. Even when I am in a situation outside of work where I can wear my own clothes, I feel like I still just look like a yuppie asshole wearing a costume. 

Our bosses usually have an oppressive amount of control over what we look like at work, and because of this effectively control the limits of what our bodies can look like outside of work. The only choice we have is to slave away to afford clothes that will make us feel more like ourselves.",False,dp9l2x,TheCaptainShithouse,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/dp9l2x/on_work_and_appearance/,4,3

47,Oliver Hart was a true underrated artist,"No one really understands the experience that jades logic
And paves an agnostic place to lay and decay in toxic waste
So most carry identity paraphernalia to familiarize with smiles neatly
Painted on a robotic face
But not this man, he played the bucket with his hands
And got paid by whatever change people would drop in his can
Twenty-three years ago he was a lawyer by description
But I guess all of a sudden he resigned from that position
But I've never seen the sky quite as clear as his eyes
As his blistered fingers beat down on the plastic
And in a twisted sort of way it all makes sense
While they rush to die he provides the soundtrack so tragic
He sits on the corner of 7th and 1st
And I was thirsty for the answer to a question anyone would nurse
One day I asked he why he gave up his career
He said, ""I didn't, I just took off the name tag"" then he added

Make Money and die that's the American Way
It don't matter what name you gave the bucket that you play
Make Money and die that's the American Way
It don't matter what name you gave the bucket that you play

So I took in what was said but I didn't accept it
Well maybe I did I mean I just wouldn't admit it
I was too committed to the belief that all the hard work from now would
Improve my future existence somehow
So I said, you don't accomplish nothing sitting in the street
And I'm sure you barely survive off the pennies you gather
He said, to your surprise I make enough to eat
And I accomplish just as much as you only I stop pretending my job matters
He looked me in my face and told me I was a puppet
And what I do is no more important than playing a bucket
I still hear his voice when I set my alarm before bed
I never could wash what he said out of my head, so fuck it, it goes

Make Money and die that's the American Way
Make Money and die that's the American Way
Make Money and die that's the American Way
It don't matter what name you gave the bucket that you play
Make Money and die that's the American Way
Make Money and die that's the American Way
Make Money and die that's the American Way
It don't matter what name you gave the bucket that you play

See I can dress myself up in a white coat and say I'm a doctor
Carry a knob on my belt buckle with a gold badge and say I'm a copper
Maybe I'm just a sloppy lazy crazy carbon copy part of the heartlessly
Deranged nation that gave me the generation ecstasy under water, I forgot
The survivor of the mind washed and slaughtered. I've watched your offers, caught your calls and
Called your forefathers my bosses, lost it all in the name of gaining enough
To spend, consuming the youth since those pray in doom for the hand my friends, see
When I saw my man playing away on his drum
Something clicked in my brain and I became less dumb
I'm working for bread crumbs
Pretending there's a meaning
But my employment is just a bucket, I'm desperately beating
And one day, I'll be old and retired
Looking at my life like what a waste of good fire
All because school never taught me how to be inspired

We supply gas stations and grocery stores, markets etc. We have everything from candy, chips, snacks, to frozen meat, frozen breads, frozen pastries, to tobacco products, beauty products, and even chemicals like car fluids, and a lot more.

I work in the freezer, in -20 degree temperatures.

Obviously, it’s fucking shit. When you start, you’re promised 4 10 hour shifts from 4pm- 2am. That NEVER happens. You can’t leave until all the orders for the next day are picked, and loaded onto the trucks. During the summer months, 15 hour work days were not uncommon, every Monday we were there until 7am  at least. The rest of the week was about 12-13 hours.

Now, the hours themselves I can deal with. But we have been at least 20 employees short of what is required to do the job since I’ve been there. The middle management knows this, relays this to the upper management, but all they say is “have a better attitude and it won’t be so bad.” Like really? The job is impossible to do with this many people! The management lies to their employees, telling them what they want to hear, but then going and literally doing the exact opposite of what they said. 

Recently, it’s gotten worse. They are hiring a huge amount of new people, however they don’t make them start until 7-10pm. Everyone starts at different times, and it leaves the rest of us to do 70% of the job ourselves, while everyone else gets to come in late and still leave at the same time as us. I don’t know what they’re trying to do with this “new shift.” But it’s supposed to take some of the workload off the rest of us. And recently they’ve just fired someone because they “made a scene” and drilled the president about the horrible health insurance. 

This place is just a fucking shit show. None of our equipment works properly, no one comes into work, the night shift managers do literally nothing all night and just sit in the office and fuck off until something breaks down, then they fix it and go back to sitting down. 3 person jobs and pawned off on 1 person, and they expect “better attitudes” out of everyone. I don’t know how people have been working here and being ok with it. I’m quitting before the end of November, and I hope it fucks them good. With 60% of the freezer being new people now, it’ll be funny to know that I, one of the most knowledgeable working in there, will leave, making everyone else work harder.

some suggestions: 

1. starting a commune? finding some land or a place in ur own or another country to imigrate to, pooling resources to build and help build some idealistic socialist (or other) place where we could live sustainably.
2. starting up buisnesses or self employment advice, like do people have marketable skills and/or ideas for things that could be used for such ends? (i do software development and are making video games in my spare time, i'd welcome other people with game devs related skills to contact me if they are interested in working on a some projects, maybe some day we could sell some games and break into self employment that way).
3. off the grid living advice, how to's or directions to/where to find such resources. Like the details of buying land and getting planning permission, I know there are curtain kinds of mortgages in some places for the purchase of land with the intent of building your own house on it, that are cheaper than buying a house with a regular mortgage. For some of us, some savings and a good credit rating isnt to far out of the realm of reason.
4. bit more wacky of an idea but crowd funding (charity)? maybe if UBI isnt going to be government funded people would be willing to contribute to creating a UBI fund, of course who would be eligable for payouts and so forth would be a complicated matter, but prehaps some sort of small scale regional experiments could be done somehow?

It took two years from that point for me to find an entry level position at a company that hadn’t even opened yet. 

When I got the job, I was employee number five on the payroll and the first hire to my department under the manager. My starting wage was $15/hr, which I thought was amazing because I was only making $8.50/hr before. Literally felt on top of the world. After my first week, I had this crazy sense of opportunity at this company - it was a huge motivator for me. 

I made my job my priority and passion. Because this was a brand new company, there weren’t really any procedures in place. I started thinking about the best ways to run the storefront, typed up all my ideas and consistently presented them to my manager. 

Six months after I started, there were now 7 employees working alongside me in the same entry level role. The manager was an older man, and had become less present over time. I figured that since he was gone most of the time that I could help the other employees get oriented. 

Fast forward a couple months later and we were open. I was working 12hr days, doing everything I could to make the business successful. Was I making the owner of the company a lot of money? Yes. But, I knew that he had put in 5 years of work and dumped his life savings into starting this company without making a dime before this point. 

A year goes by, and I was promoted to “supervisor”, making $20/hr. Again, I was THRILLED. I never thought I’d be making this kind of money in my entire life. Motivation was through the roof. However, I was also irritated because the department manager hardly did anything and was certainly making far more than I was (he got a new car, new clothes...). I was jealous, but that drove me to push myself even harder. 

Two years in, the department manager resigned. We had no one leading the department except for me. I figured that I would be moved into his role right after he left, but that didn’t happen. I stayed at the same wage and same title. Nothing. I was furious, and thought about leaving because I thought everything that I had done had gone unnoticed and unappreciated. I began drifting back to my old mindset, that the world was against me and I had no direction. But I had put in so much time and so much effort that I decided to stick it out. 

Another year goes by, and now we’re getting acquired by a corporation. Son of a bitch. Now, I was going to have to prove myself all over again to these new people. I was ripshit, but stayed on and continued to try my best. 

A few months later, the acquisition was final, and I was approached by the Executive Vice President of the corporation’s operations division. We had just lost a couple managers from other departments because corporate thought they weren’t a good fit, and I thought I was next on the chopping block. But to my surprise, they had offered me the position of Operations Manager with a probationary salary of $60k/year. 

Two thoughts went through my head in that conversation: “Finally!” and “Holy shit, am I capable of this?”. I had no idea what was going to happen, but I pushed on and worked my ass off. Still 12 hour days, and now working from home on my days off. I was non-stop and started burning out. 

They saw what I was doing, and shockingly after my probationary period was up, I got a review and a MASSIVE raise to $80k a year. Again, I was on top of the world and now responsible for the success of a team of 60 people, including 5 managers below me. 

Last month, over 4 years after starting at the company, I was approached again and given a heads up that they want me to soon take over as the Regional Director for my corner of the country. This role will put me in charge of 4 locations and almost 200 people, and is sure to send my salary somewhere into six-figure range. 

I know my situation is unique / rare, and progressing this quickly is nowhere near normal. But my outlook on life has changed, and my sense of self responsibility has skyrocketed. I no longer look at the wealthy and think “fuck you”, now it’s “I want to BE you”. 

Yes, there are some filthy rich scumbag motherfuckers out there that don’t deserve what they have, but I don’t compare myself to them anymore. I’m not jealous. I’m in charge of my life and how it turns out, and hopefully I’m able to make others lives better along the way. If I ever am fortunate enough to enter the ranks of the 1%, I won’t be selfish because I get it. I came from almost nothing and know how it feels to struggle every day - rent or food, gas or medicine. Helping others is what I really want to do someday.

She is a kind and loving person but completely oblivious to what is going on with our generation. Basically she was trying to persuade me everyone was normal but it was me who is having a problem. I started this kind of smalltalk that quickly spiraled into something very ugly.

* You should be taking antidepressants. Everyone takes them. So what we barely know how human brain functions. Let's all eat this toxic garbage to better cope with the capitalist hellscape.
* I know you are a night owl and it's hard for you to wake up at 6AM on weekdays. You should be taking sleeping pills... like everyone else. Again, who cares this shit is highly addictive and literally makes you a junkie.
* You want to have a home? You should take a mortgage like everyone else. Bitch if you own a real estate in Europe you are basically mini Bezos. The prices are astronomical. Even if I wanted this extra level of enslavement in my life the banks wouldn't be too happy seeing I could pay that shit off once I turn 90.

So here I am. I haven't slept for days because I wake up at 3AM now even though I am hardcore night owl. Why? Because between 3AM and 6AM are the only hours I can use for myself and my hobbies (art). Well I can't cuz right now I am having terrible headaches and my heart is going crazy, probably heading towards its failure. But I am trying to make it work because after work I am so drained I can't do shit. I stopped sleeping completely. My body refuses to enter sleep. The hell at work I am experiencing right now is unimaginable.

So it pisses me off, given my generation's circumstances, that this boomer who owns fucking 2 real estates in Europe = is set for life and beyond basically tells me to stfu, take the pills and keep hustling. Like I am the mad man, while the rest is sane.

I recently moved across state from a rural town to a city. I’m lucky enough to have family here that is letting me stay with them until I can afford a place of my own. (21, btw.) I’m a creative person and I was hoping it would have more opportunity for me.

After being turned down by a few places and ignored by many during my job search, out of semi-desperation I filled out an application for UPS. At completion of the form, I was automatically booked to meet with them for a tour at 5AM in a few days. After taking the tour, the guide asked us pretty much point-blank who was in. I originally wanted to give it a day or two to think it over but since this seemed like a take it or leave it sorta deal I raised my hand. (In retrospect, I believe this is the reaction they were banking on.) 

Fun fact, the job is pretty bullshit. They said so up front, didn’t beat around the bush on that. Which I admire, in some respects. But yeah, getting up at 2:50-3AM, driving 20 minutes and stuffing 1,200 boxes into four trucks by myself for five hours with a 15-minute break is pretty bullshit. Especially for a skinny shrimp like me who’s not really that physically minded in the first place.

So needless to say, this is taking quite a toll on me, mostly emotionally and mentally. I’ve always try to do my best for my employers and this job isn’t an exception, so it’s disheartening when it feels what I do isn’t good enough to get the job done well. Emphasis on “feels” there, because deep down I know that it isn’t a problem with me. They’ve literally said that I’m in a “shitty situation”, somewhat apologetically. Most other workers load three trucks with less packages going into each.

All I do now is sleep, dread work, spend money. I think the money component is an effort at escapism. I’ve been investing more in things that make me happy, like my art, or books. But this means I’m quite literally living paycheck to paycheck, no real savings to fall back on. I’m pretty desperate to get out of there, (especially with Christmas around the corner), but I just don’t feel I should consider that option until I have other work/savings lined up. I’m doing my best to get other work but I’m worried that the longer I wait the worse for wear I’ll be.

91,Job position was blatantly misleading [RANT],"I've been working at a company for over a year now and every year or so have to switch roles. My first year has been pretty bad. The role I was offered was not at all like what I got, in fact I barely was given any work at all, but because this is my first job out of college I've stayed in fear of what damage it would do to my resume if I left a company a couple months in. Here I am again, I chose a few positions I found out what my job will be next year, it sounded amazing on paper, the job title and description were what I wanted. After it's secured I found out the actual job title does not at all reflect what I will be doing. I'm just stuck here not knowing what to do and pretty depressed. The only thing that's been keeping me going in the past has been the possibility of actually having this type of job and I feel lied to and misled. I don't think there's anything I can do about it either... I could leave the company, but I want to leave the state and my SO is stuck here until the end of 2020. 

Worst part is everyone IRL has told me ""welcome to the real world"" and been completely unsympathetic. Im not whining about it, I've only told a couple of close friends and they don't seem to get it.

To jaded right now on hiring. Simply can't explain how frustration it can be to
process 100's of applicant.

While this is work you have to do, what really grind my years are people who
switch jobs yearly, year after year after year.

Dozens of candidates have literally had a new role every year for the past decade,
When asked about it they say “bad leadership"", “was promised something else” and
“Was laid off.”

 

| am sorry, but if this is you ten times in a row you suck at the interview process and
are not asking the right questions.

Take sure the employer is good for you and good overall

On't just accept any offer that comes your way. Being an employee is a two-way
street.

Both parties need to do the due diligence.

You don’t ever have to feel guilty about

REMOVING TOXIC PEOPLE
FROM YOUR LIFE.

It doesn't matter whether someone is a relative,
romantic interest, employer, childhood friend,
or a new acquaintance — you don’t have to make
room for people who cause you pain or make
you feel small. It’s one thing if a person owns up
to their behavior and makes an effort to change.
But if a person disregard your feelings, ignores
your boundaries, and “continues” to treat you
in a harmful way, they need to go.

123,Hate my new job,"I took a 50% cut in pay to leave programming in favor of something that would require less hours and provide a better work/life balance. After seven months of looking for a new job (after getting fired the day I returned from disability leave for depression from my last job), I got hired as an admin. It's not the kind of admin job where I'm reporting to an executive or answering phones or scheduling travel. It's purely behind the scenes reporting, and things along that nature. I thought it would be a good transition, with the goal of having more energy outside of work to focus on turning the things I love into sustainable work-from-home freelancing- so that I can get out of corporate America for good.

Well, this is my fourth week and I *hate* it. To say I was misled in my interview is a HUGE understatement. It's making my depression unbearable. I wake up in rage mode because I don't want to go, and have nausea every morning. I'm angry when I leave, and I cry every night before bed because it means having to wake up and do it all over again. My nights and weekends are spent in bed or on the couch, because I'm emotionally and physically shot.

My plan was to give it a year while I figured out how to work for myself. After being here these few weeks, I don't know how I can do that- especially with the depression. I simply don't have the energy when I'm home to do basic things, let alone work on the possibility of being able to work for myself. 

I can't just quit, because my husband and I need the extra cash. At the same time, I don't have the PTO or flexibility to go to interviews for other jobs. I feel completely stuck with no options. 

Meanwhile, over in the depression forums, I get told to ""reframe my thinking"", to be ""happy that I have a job"" and to ""try to find purpose"" in it. That I need to ""give it a few months"" and ""schedule more therapist appointments"" to get through the ""growing pains."" That I should wake up an hour earlier to exercise or meditate or cook myself a nutritious breakfast or take my dog for a long walk to enjoy nature. Or my favorite- to ""talk to my doctor about additional medication that might help me through this transition."" Seriously!?

124,Celebrating a decade of burnout and exhaustion.,"I'm 29, going on 84.

I'm so god damn tired. I have worked myself into a relatively cushy office job but that makes no difference. I work the same 40 hours as everyone else, doing tedious mental gymnastics for a local health board's IT department.

It's, on paper, the best job I've ever had but all I can think about while I'm at my desk is crawling home to spend an hour with my kids before they go to bed.

I had a taste of a ""free life"" when I was still a kid. I was homeschooled between the ages of 11 and 15, and the sense of freedom to be able to up an leave the house any day of the week and go anywhere I wanted was massively under appreciated by 12 year old me.

I had the same freedom in 2008 after the recession hit at I was unemployed. Besides degrading myself for an hour or two a day by groveling for a job I had total freedom over my time. It was amazing.

I've been constantly employed since 2010 and I've never had the time or money for a holiday. Every day is more exhausting than the last and not even weekends are a rest because those two days are my only chance to maintain my rental property to the standards laid out in my tenancy agreement.

I have retired Boomer family who advise me to work extra hard in order to stand out at work. To push for more responsibility in the hopes of promotion, to strive for my dream job. But no matter how many times I spell it out for them they don't get it.

My dream job is to not ever need to work again. To spend all my time exploring hobbies and chilling out with my wife and kids. To finally feel rested.

It's never going to happen for me.

But on the bright side, only 37 more years until I reach New Zealand's retirement age and get to just keep on working because in what world are we going to be able to afford retirement?",False,dpeduw,Wompguinea,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/dpeduw/celebrating_a_decade_of_burnout_and_exhaustion/,11,44
125,I don't now what to do,"I don't know where exactly to post this. I'm sorry if this breaks some rule, but I really need it to reach someone.

I've spiralling down into a cycle of existential doubt, hatred, rage, depression, lack of motivation, discipline, anxiety. I'm a huge recipient of negativity. I'm a member of [r/antiwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/), [r/antinatalism](https://www.reddit.com/r/antinatalism/), [r/ForeverAlone](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/), [r/ABoringDystopia](https://www.reddit.com/r/ABoringDystopia/), [r/collapse](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/), [r/misanthropy](https://www.reddit.com/r/misanthropy/), etc. I would be a member of [r/sanctionedsuicide](https://www.reddit.com/r/sanctionedsuicide/) if it still existed (I occasionally lurk their forums)... My view of the world and my life is one of anger, regret and shame. I can't find any hope, and I'm constantly coping and procrastinating due to having no willpower, motivation. I'm not suicidal though, which I guess makes me ""sane"" enough not to be thrown into the psychiatric system or medications right away. I don't have delusions, I do have mild anxiety. I'm more of a melancholic.

The point is that I don't think any of this is due to having ""negative thoughts"" (like it were something I can change magically) or me ""having an illness"" (I think the cause to be the state of the world). Things don't work for me, and I just can't get out of this negative state I've been over the last years. I think my melancholy and my rage against the system, people, my past, my lack of romantic partners and my social anxiety are too much to bear. There's just no way back for me, it's like I've discovered some truth, some hard and dark truth, about the world; everything loses its mystery, its magical properties, and becomes meaningless. There's no point in pain, there's no point to self-improvement, to keep going, still I keep going forward, like inertia. The state of anhedonia is everywhere. I want a partner, yet I don't care to go out or plan dates; I want to study, yet I procrastinate; I want to write, read, exercise, yet I game for hours without feeling much better.

I'm tired of the common sense advice of ""go see a therapist"", ""exercise"", ""eat healthy"", ""wake up at 4AM and make world peace"". Those things may work for ""normies"", people who are stable enough and alienated enough so that they don't see life as something bad, that have, all in all, a sense of progress, a sense of hard work and pain paying off in the future (protestant ethic), a good social circle, success in their romantic lives (they can, at least, relieve their sexual impulses). But for the many who are left out of the ""normal"" pleasures of life, who are left out of hope in the future, hope of finding a ""good job"" or ""buying a house"" (because they realize those goals are nonsense), etc. What's left for them? For them, therapy is useless, and medication is almost an insult. You can't change reality and your life keeps sucking, so you are drugged to ""calm down"" and become a cog in the machine once again. Therapy can't do anything against systemic pressures, bad luck, or huge feelings of anhedonia and depression. The same goes for the other advice (exercise, play an instrument, go out). I'm miserable everytime, and I don't think life is worth creating or living in the slightest. My life is like a collection of numbing alienating breaks in between of pain, boredom, stress, sadness.

I really think there's like two different worlds people belong to, and at least I am in the world in which no matter what I do, what attitude I try to take, nothing matters, nothing gives me any kind of realization, any kind of joy. I've been humiliated, bullied, rejected, treated condescendingly, forgotten so many times that I have no will to try in social life anymore. I don't care about meeting new people. I would want to have sex and a relationship, and this may look contradictory. I just don't want to deal with the process anymore. My interests and my personality are not made for this ruthless system of competition, I don't care about jobs, making money, having a good resume. I literally hate the way the world functions and I can't accept it, I can't ""fit in"". This system is madness. The only thing I look forward to is to do nothing at the end of day: to lay in bed for hours indulging in entertainment, porn, music. Maybe I'm horribly desensitized by this consumption, I also have symptoms of ADHD. The point of the matter, however, is that my worries and thoughts about life by far surpass anything that could be explained by mere addiction theory, or so I believe; as I also have a lot of other fronts to cover.

Reddit is an escape mechanism. I get to comment and read posts from people like me or that think like me in some areas, it's a safe space, safe from all the bullshit media culture, social media pages, social ostracism or social judging. I can write whatever passes through my head, no repressed emotions, ideas. If I hate working, I can vent, if I feel depressed I can go look other people who are going through the same thing. If I'm angry about society, I can complain and share ideas freely, without being afraid. Bless this webpage and some of its communities... However, I cannot but think they've radicalized and veered me off some ""good path"" of obedience, discipline, positivity. I was bitter and angry before, but I never had this kind of existential hatred and philosophies and/or groups of people truly dedicated to understanding it.

I don't know what to do. I don't know which attitude to take, how to be motivated. I don't know how to even begin to work on my goals and not return to a cycle of hatred and hedonism. I've tried the usual diet + exercise + going out combo for months. I've tried [r/NoFap](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/), [r/StopGaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/), [r/nosurf](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/), etc. I've turned off my PC and uninstalled everything more times than I can count. I've tried meditating, learning languages, changing countries, travelling, making new friends. Nothing does it for me. I am not consistent. I'm always back at square one, with a horrible sensation of despair, always unable to do what I'd like to be doing, always being a shadow of what I could be. There's something about people who succeed in fixing their lives and achieving really big changes in their way of life and their social/romantic lives, something that I don't know if I have because I don't even know what it is. I've always felt I was incomplete, like I wasn't like the rest. I didn't have that easiness about work, friends, studies, romantic partners, etc. that they had. I had the existential doubts and despair that they didn't. But I'm sure I'm missing out on some key factors.

I don't even know why I'm posting this. To cope? To seek help? To vent? To share my experience? To motivate discussion? I have no idea.

Despite the fact that I met his quotas and completed everything he wanted, it was simply ""not okay"" for me to take an occasional 3-4 minute break to respond to messages on my phone.

While this puts a serious damper on my plan to leave the state and to become more of an independent person, I can't bring myself to be upset for anything other than my inability to leave. The man was an absolute nightmare to work for and I was only a step above being a slave to him. The aforementioned demand that I not take bathroom breaks, his constant monitoring that would keep Eric Blair up at night, a workplace that was hellish to try and work in, it all came together for the worst job I've ever had.

128,"automation of jobs, and an idea","ever since i was a kid, my parents have always told me that robots were gonna come and take all the low-end jobs; they're easy to produce, cost way less than having humans there, and are far more accurate. and they were always scared of it. it didn't make sense to me then, and doesn't make sense to me now. if all the menial taskwork we need done can be done by robots, then why not just give people money and let them do what they want, and let the robots do their job? 

like, i'm wording this weirdly, but it seems like ""robots are going to take all the minimum wage jobs!!"" should be something to be celebrated, but because capitalism, it means people have to work even HARDER to not only find jobs but keep them, because they're competing against perfect machines to be paid $15 an hour. it makes no sense.

idk, automation has always been super interesting to me, and it seems like a combo of 1. higher taxes on the rich, especially ceos, 2. automation of minimum-wage jobs, and 3. redistribution of the wealth from the ceos to those who were laid off by the robots should at least give people time to pursue something that they enjoy doing, instead of work. the robots are cheaper to maintain, so if prices stay the same (or even drop), the ceos and robot managers are making more money at the same rate of sale, and then that can be funnelled back into the pockets of the working class.

it's not as complete-anarchy as i want it to be, but it's the best explanation i've found that my dad (a hardcore capitalist, who still believes in capitalism after having to file for bankrupcy when his store shut down last christmas) actually believes might work, so. thoughts",False,do2721,hunterwhomst,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/do2721/automation_of_jobs_and_an_idea/,3,7

166,Why is food insecurity still a thing?,"Exactly what it says. I get a very strong feeling that the farm industry is still privately owned because it keeps food expensive and keeps us ""slaves"" in line, and insecure. Imagine a socialist country with state owned mega farms.

Imagine a country where food is abundant and free. Maybe a part of that 700 billion US spends on its millitary can go to massive public eateries where everyone can go in, have a meal, and be on their way. I am not saying gourmet food but a basic hearty food. Some hot oatmeal, cornbread, soup, basic, filling stuff.

Imagine how much crime and countrywide mental heath would improve if people had basic food security. Its not expensive, its 2019, we have the technology, we have the money. Food is a basic need, and any society that wants to be called modern needs to be food secure.

This email is to inform us of the passing of one of our coworker who died as a result of a heart attack he suffered last weekend. The email goes on to say that if a condolence card is to be filled out, that it needs to be turned in to HR. Nothing more, very cut and dry. 

Later today, we had an all-employee meeting regarding our health insurance for the upcoming year. Which I feel would’ve been a great place to address the death of a coworker that had been with the company for over 10 years. Instead, the only time it is brought up is as an example for setting up your life insurance. He did not have any beneficiaries listed. So it became a “don’t be like this guy” type of thing. His name, not even mentioned.

Most of the emotional issues I deal with is due to their somewhat toxic behavior. 

I have never had a job due to being somewhat picky and not wanting a worse life. There is a lot of terrible advice online when it comes to job submission: don't complain, work hard, don't think you are better than the position (anyone want to work for a toxic chemical plant or a factory that destroys your hearing? Or Amazon that lets a person die from a heart attack?), just be glad you are employed at all. 

To me, the rants, mantras, and justification towards wage-slave labor feels very similar to how people justify buying Apple products. 

It is a cult. 

Anyways, I want something that will give me the skills to progress within a healthy dynamic within work. For example, if I get ""any job"" and end up in retail/fast food, then 5 to 10 years down the line, I will only be qualified for more fast food and retail work.

Due to the forced selectivity, I could not gain better working conditions because there are many more desperate people willing to work for less and work longer in these positions. 

Basically, my goals are more inline within the ""So Good They Can't Ignore You"" mindset than the cult of work mindset of employed (any at all) = good.

185,PTSD-type fear of time clock systems?,"This may sound a bit weird but I thought some people here would probably understand. I am very afraid of the fact that my job is now out of nowhere using a fingerprint time clock instead of allowing us to report our time then have our managers check over it. I know this is normal for most workers but I have a weird fear and probably privilege for being in a field (digital marketing) where we are supposed to be professionals and having a college degree from a well regarded school.

This job is way better than my last one but I am already scared that this is going to be used to fire me because I know other people have said that “time theft” is an excuse for firing many companies use. 
At my old job, every minute and second of our work day was monitored through a computer application time clock that required us to log when we used the bathroom to have it deducted from our breaks, took screenshots of our computers, alerted managers if we visited a non-work-related website then tried to clock us out for it, and clocked us out if we stopped typing or moving the mouse for more than five minutes. It was apparently used against many employees to build a case to fire you or force you to quit, not to mention to dock people’s pay. 

After this experience, I became traumatized (my doctor actually put me on disability from the panic from this job), so now when my new, better job added this time clock out of nowhere, it makes me feel like the world is closing in on me. It feels like this is the first step to “cracking the whip” and workplace tyranny starting here. This is even though my boss likes me, compliments me, and has given me more hours. (Though some of my duties did get changed a bit for reasons not related to performance.) 

Obviously punctuality, time on task, and not taking breaks are not the kind of metrics that bode well for me so I am really scared of the consequences of a mess up, especially since this is the closest thing to a good job I have had in years and I may never find a job as good as this one.

187,I feel like my job is holding me hostage.,"I work for a police department in a mid-sized suburb. Ive been here for 5.5 years and I'm about to put a hot one through my frontal lobe. Its absolutely, unceasingly, consistently soul-sucking. I work third shift, and my entire job consists of typing reports that the officers have recorded on a little voice recorder and uploaded. Not only is it third shift, but the schedule rotates so I never have the same off days. It's like the work equivalent of Chinese water torture or sleep deprivation torture.  

I have a wife and two little kids at home and I have absolutely zero semblance of a routine or a schedule because my entire life revolves around meeting their schedule when I'm not at my job. I have to be a dick to get any sleep and it causes a ton of tension in my family. I sleep maybe 30-35 hours in an entire week. I never have time to shower, or eat healthy, or get any exercise, and I've gained a ton of weight from it.  

This job pays really well for what it is and its probably the most I can make in my current situation. Ive been doing this for 5 years so my family has built our life around this income, and the baller health insurance they give us. I've even been told by my boss (who is a cop, btw) that I have no grounds to complain about my job because they pay us too much. I feel so guilty about hating it because if I could stomach it it would be a great gig. But I hate it. I hate my schedule, I hate most of my coworkers and I fucking hate cops.  

All I want to do is quit and be a bartender. I feel like I'm fucking seeping into the chair and floor below my desk and my mental health is shit. My therapist even told me to quit my job. I want to do something less... corporate? government? structured?, responsible? But in order to quit, my family will take a financial hit. If I don't quit, I'm gonna end up not being very useful to my family. How do you balance paying the bills and not wanting to put my head under a squad car?

188,Can't believe this is it until I die,"A bit of a rant, I guess. 

Can't believe that life is just going to be working an unfulfilling job for people who don't give a shit right up until the day I either die or physically can not work anymore. And in the latter's case, I'll likely just end up homeless anyway.

I work full time and take something like 14 credits at school. It's not even a sustainable schedule - I give up the possibility of a full night's sleep every single night during the week so I can make sure I'm putting in all of my hours at work and getting all of my homework done. It's wild to me that we live in a culture where doing this make you look like a hard and dedicated worker in the eyes of others when the very idea of it should be fucking insane to any normal person. I'm not doing it because I want to do it. I'm not getting an accounting degree because I just \*love\* the thought of dull accounting work for the rest of my life. I'm doing this because I'm trying to grab at the slight chance that, one day, I won't have to worry about one financial crisis being the complete death of me.

It's insane to me that we have to cling on to the hope that, someday, things maybe won't be awful for us. I don't understand how I'm just supposed to be okay with being miserable and working most of my time away for the rest of my life. 

I've been sick recently too and by the grace of my corporate overlords, I've been granted a reasonable health plan that allows me to get myself screened for various ailments. Lo and behold, I may actually have cancer. 26 years old with the possibility of cancer, and I've done nothing but serve a corporate master for most of my adult life.

193,Confessions of a Soon-to-Be Wage Slave,"I’m currently in school pursuing the general field of industrial maintenance. I’ve been living in the South and observing the rhetoric around work. So far, I’ve learned many things but below I’ve listed some of my favorite life lessons:

1: 99.999% accidents in the workplace are avoidable and can be traced back to human error, and thusly, they are your fault. If a machine breaks down and injures someone or impacts company profits, it doesn’t matter whether or not you slept last night, if you even had time to eat breakfast this morning, it is your fault and you will be fired. 

2: You will not have a life at home. This is okay though, as it will help you work your way up the food chain with the constant promise of finally having enough money to make it. In reality, you’ll be drinking applesauce from a tube by the time you can afford the home you wanted, but that’s your fault. 

3: Your company is always there for you until they aren’t. You’re a valuable resource and they will always be willing to take care of you until you need to be taken care of. 

4: If you have complaints, you’re acting entitled. Nothing is free in life and if you expect it to be, you’re part of the problem. You wouldn’t show up to work if you had a house and a roof over your head, right? Because everyone is perfectly happy living with the bare minimum, incredibly basic needs to live like health insurance, some kind of housing and food. It’s simply unimaginable that people would bother going to work for better amenities if they already have what they need. 

5: If you can’t find a job then you’re not trying. If you can’t get a job then you aren’t looking. If you need a car to get to the job, ride a bike. If you don’t have a bike, walk. If it’s too far/rainy/cold to do either, you should’ve found work somewhere closer. If you can’t find work closer to you, nuh uh. There’s always a job. If that job doesn’t pay well then that’s your fault. 

I’ll be honest in saying that I used to buy into the idea that we need to work for everything. Now I can hardly utter the words “Why should I have to work to live” before I have every set of eyes in the room trained on me. If I had a livable apartment, no health insurance costs to worry about and no college tuition, my ass would be working double the hours I am right now. 

There are things I want in life and I’m fine with the idea that I need to work if I want to build the home I want or buy the car I like. As far as I’m concerned, nudging people closer to the things they want is a great motivator. Having been an athlete for many years, I’ve found that I’m always sprinting the fastest when I see the finish line.

Long story short, I didn’t get the job because I struggled on one aspect of the interview process with them. It’s literally the very aspect of the job that they would be training me (it’s a graduate role btw) to do. 

I’m sick and tired of getting rejected by these stupid companies for things out with my control. Just tell me that you didn’t like me but don’t make up some bull shit excuses about “oh you just struggled” cause I know I didn’t and my immediate feedback was very very positive.

198,i can’t tell if my boss is walking over me or not,"up until recently i’ve enjoyed my job quite a bit. i work at a car wash and the basic premise of what we do is cashier and then guide the cars in, with cleaning involved of course. i have a good relationship with my boss and he’s a good guy, but whenever i disagree with him it’s like i’m a complete fuckin idiot and clearly don’t know what i’m talking about. we’re not a busy store so majority of the day is spent doing not much of anything. once we’re done cleaning we have nothing to do other then clean the shit we just cleaned. so my regional manager (my bosses boss) is always up his ass and consequently my coworkers and i. he always wants us doing something no matter what. 2 ish months ago he checked the cameras and watched us do nothing after completing cleaning and kinda just wait for cars to come in for a wash. like i said we aren’t busy so we’ll get maybe 20 cars in 2-3 hours. so once he saw that we didn’t have shit to do my man went crazy about our chairs calling us lazy pieces of shit and physically throwing out chairs because of how angry he was. no we clean and are more organized then before yet we still spend most of our time in our office since everything is normally always done. the only difference is we stand for around 8 ish hours doing absolutely nothing, after finishing everything. this takes a massive fuckin toll on me my feet have been hurting like hell my hip has been giving out and my back has been giving me problems too.

at this point i just want to point out i am 18 years old and this is my first real job. 

my boss doesn’t let me sit down anywhere and if i complain he either makes fun of me or says to go take a 10 minute break in the break room. let me also say that i put in so much fuckin work and i come in on my off days if i get called i’m the main opener i go above and beyond what i’m meant to do even so far as actually doing my boss’s job (training a new store leader) and pretty much all of my assistant store leaders job. i applies for it yet he got picked for some insane fuckin reason and he hasn’t done shit but make me clean up his mess. 

in my honest opinion i feel as if i’m the hardest worker in my job and i don’t mean to be like sucking my own dick but i try my hardest while most people do not. and i just want to know if i’m being taken advantage of or not ? i enjoyed the job prior but now it’s gotten to the point where it’s a slog. and during the winter my hours get cut almost in half while still expecting the same amount of work and not being able to take any sort of break short of a 10 minute “rest”",False,dlbe0r,CHIEFXx,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/dlbe0r/i_cant_tell_if_my_boss_is_walking_over_me_or_not/,2,8

200,Productivity and self-worth,"I'm facing an entirely new situation: I'm not busy at the moment. Basically I'm having some time off as I'm in between jobs and have enough savings so that I do not need to work for the next weeks. 

And it's harder than I thought. I discovered that in my mind my self-worth is tied to my productivity, productivity meaning here working to earn money. I feel useless and at the same time know that this feeling does not make sense.

I'm wondering why I feel that way. I'm using my time off for all kinds of things: seeing my family and friends (I've lived far away from them for the past 7 years so it's special to have the opportunity to simply meet for a coffee and spend some time together. My parents are getting older, who knows how much time I've got with them), I'm helping my parents around the house, I'm working on a novel, roam the woods for mushrooms, knit, read the books that have been sitting on my shelves for years, visit workshops... But I do not earn money. I am not productive. 

In this time with the glooming thread of climate change producing masses of unnecessary goods and selling them all over the world is a huge problem. As of now I am not participating in that game. I do not produce anything. I do not cause harm. That's more than many people can claim for themselves. Yet I feel useless.

205,Am i burning out ?,"Hello friends,

I recently decided to make an account for reddit and came to this subreddit. At first i wanna tell you something that is something inside my heart.  


I worked around for 3.5 years now  (2.5 years are my apprentice ship years) as an IT System engineer more likely i am being used as IT Support and i started to feel more empty as usual, each day became a challenge to me, waking up becomes a miracle and my productivity at work is decreasing slightly each day passes and i can't focus on things well anymore. Actually I don't care what I did at work and just move on until I get home. Despite that i am only 23 years and already feel like that i am getting burned out makes me worry. After my apprenticeship i had holidays for 4 weeks which was actually nice or not ? I spent most of the time sleeping and even felt exhausted after hours of sleeping, even taking a walk outside or doing things i enjoy became a burden...and now i am here working with my new job and always think about that i wanna quit. I am in my probation and i could quit easily now, but i would feel like a failure..  


The job is unfulfilling and I don't know what to do. If i would ask myself this question I would answer with a yes no matter what would happen now since i am unhappy and the only thing I hope is to find a job which doesn't involve of IT Support more likely in the area system engineering since i enjoyed to play around with my homelab.",False,dlwrj0,BudgetCartographer4,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/dlwrj0/am_i_burning_out/,8,7

210,"Guys, a question. Please help me out.","So, I left my toxic job!
Relaxing, to say the least.
I gave the resignation a few weeks back. 
After 7 months, I was still in probation, so there was no need for me to serve the notice period. But I wanted closure. So, I agreed to the notice period.


2 weeks before, My senior, aka an idiot had asked for something. I had taken leave between those days and when i came back, there was a network issue the whole week. 

I promptly was unable to do it.
Now this guy called me up and started yelling at me at which I cut the call and left office, taking an impromptu leave. 


When he called me today, I didn't pickup his calls nor respond to his messages. 
Well, he escalated this to the manager, who called me and told me that I'm an incompetent idiot. And told me off. 

Now, my mental health, I'd have to say that, isn't always the best. I'd had breakdowns due to this job earlier and his telling me off just pushed me off the edge quite a little bit. I was on the verge of depression again. 
If I was the way I was before, I definitely would have killed myself. 

Now after this, I didn't pick up the call at all. From anybody. I was not feeling good enough to pick up any calls at all, so when they called, I didn't pickup any calls.

Now the manager has whatsapped me asking me what happened, why I am not responding etc. His last message was threatening me, saying that if i don't pick up his calls, he will report me as missing me to the police. I don't know if that's legally possible, that is one part of my question.

223,The main problem with the 40hour work week (for me at least),"TLDR AT BOTTOM

I see a lot of people complain about the 40 hour work week and a lot say it's bad for different reasons. Some state it's cause it tires you out so much which is true, some say that it doesn't pay enough for the amount of work which is definitely true, and most state the lack of breaks which is really true. My main problem is how it effects experiencing life. I've always been a I would rather have a experience than a expensive object sort of person, so I've always liked enjoying life. The problem with work isn't that it stops you from enjoying life, plenty people will argue that you can just plan around your work, work gets rid of spontaneity and that's it's biggest crime. When I was working minimal because of school, about 16 hours, I loved being able to do something on the drop of a hat. Dad wants to get a beer and watch the game on a random Tuesday? Sounds awesome. Parents have tickets they can't use so they're up for grabs? Sounds like a fun night. Work gets rid of moments like that, either because you're working, you have to wake up early the next day for work, you have a family so your free time is spent watching the kids, or you're so exhausted all you want to do is sleep. Life shouldn't always be planned out, life should be an experience that changes and grows. We shouldn't be stuck in a rut and fill out forms to experience life

225,I feel so guilty for writing this.,"I am a doctor. I shouldn't complain should I, because I am paid quite well and have a respected job title. 

However, it hit me during my final year of medical school, that this is not what life is meant to be like. 

I forced myself through horiffic exams,  presentations, mandatory ""wellness trips"",all nighters studying, losing all my friends due to increasing anxiety and panic attacks related to exams and performance. I'm a very introverted person, all those examined patient examinations in front of audiences killed me. Having small talk with hundreds of members of health care team and during lunch kills me. I go the toilet to get a second to myself to breathe multiple times per day. 

Everyone told me, it will be better when you're earning and when you're working in the hospital as a real doctor. 

Well here I am. Is it better? No it's worse. And the guilt I feel for thinking like this makes me self harm. I put my parents through hell with all my mental breakdowns, crying, constant complaining about how hard medical school is. I was called to constant mandatory meetings with faculty, whose answer was to put in more teaching sessions after hours ""to help me"". They made me go to counselling for student doctors also. But did one person question whether I was happy? No. And I truly wasn't. 

I can't cope with the fact that every day I wake up at 5.30am and don't come home until 7pm. (I know some people have far worse hours). And then every 2-3 weeks, I have my stint of on calls/nights, just two weeks ago I had 6 night shifts in a row with one day off where I was expected to just recover and come back in the next day. 

When I come home, I force down a bowl of porridge because I'm too exhausted to prepare food and don't have the time not energy/passion to search for healthy recipes to cook. I then fall asleep in the living room almost instantly in front of the tv. But just manage to squeeze in a quick shower and prepare my sandwiches for the next day which I might not even get the chance to eat. 

I shouldn't complain should I? I am being paid well and my job title is respected. But I don't even have the time nor energy to spend this hard earned money. Every second in the hospital is draining, I constantly look at the clock waiting to leave. I listen to colleagues happily exclaim how they only had three hours sleep last night. Enthisuastically discuss how broken and exhausted the hospital makes them feel. But that shows how hard working they are and that's all that's expected of is humans now isn't it. To be a productivity machine. Then there's all the reflections, more exams, appraisals, portfolios, electronic mandatory learning (60 hours) to complete when? Oh,when come home or on the weekend. Get f***ed. 

I can't tell you how pathetic I feel to be writing this because I should be grateful. But all I feel is trapped. And the moments on the bus and train in the morning and evening where I am squished in between all these people on the morning commute makes me feel even worse. We are all just drones, zombies. 

My personality was sucked away as soon as I hit college. I had no time or energy for my hobbies, I lost friends due to anxiety and panic attacks. My personality disappeared. I am a shell of my former self. 

I need... I need... I don't know what I need. I should be honored that I am helping save people's lives, but I am emotionless now. And I never used to be. I just want to spend time with my family, own pets (I love animals more than anything but have no meaningful time in the day to care for them), have children, go to the gym, have hobbies. Honestly, I blame the feminist movement for a lot of this. Women were praised to be housewives and mothers, it was the most important job. They too care of the groceries, money management, looking after children, while the husband earned the money. That's the way it should be. But forcing/encouraging females into the work place, took away jobs for men, putting prices up for everytning. I'm now expected to plan having children at some point in my thirties when my specialism training is finished. I do not want to wait that long. If it was up to me, I would be having children in my early twenties. I would have animals and a modest home to care for. My house has become a wreck because I have no energy to properly care for it. 

I'm sorry if this isn't written coherently. I just need to get this out there. I feel dead every day. All I am thinking about now is how it is Sunday tomorrow. The day where I try and get all my housework groceries, errands, appointments, mandatory e learning done before it starts all over again.

I feel trapped everywhere I go, doesn't matter if it's a new city. you work and come back to ur studio/apartment. It's not possible to go outside and just make friends, everyone seem to be content that life is about working. People's lives are dependent on working.

Although I only pull 30 hours a week at my minimum wage job, I also attend college full time in addition to sports/hobbies. I have dealt with an injury I got doing said sports the past couple weeks, and my workplace has been very unsympathetic. Its not a serious injury, merely a wrist sprain but its difficult to perform simple tasks like taking out the trash or carrying boxes. Some members of my store treat it as an inconvenience for them and don't even care that the work is causing me pain. I can only imagine how people in their 40s-60s feel. I know people who pull more hours than me, take more classes and do more things but that's not me. I like to take my time and chill out. I get overwhelmed easily, and it's hard for me to keep up with the strange demands of our society today.  I'd much rather be at the gym or spending time with people I care about. It's gotten to the point where I've had to drop a class just to keep up with the demands of life. Now that it's all been stewing in my brain I realize that all I want out of life is simplicity. Im seriously burning out and I can't even muster the motivation to get to work/class. My anxiety has gotten so bad, at my last shift I had a panic attack and puked.

There are plenty of people out there with the skills necessary for the job who would be happy to take a job where they’re paid what they’re worth! This is ESPECIALLY true for jobs that don’t require complex training, like cashiers, hostesses, etc. Yet THOSE are the jobs that are chronically understaffed, go figure! 

The perfect example is my company right now. Our staff was halved when people just started leaving. I’ve watched my managers interview literally dozens of people for the job over the course of 8 months, and almost all of them were highly qualified. They have hired no one, and keep saying that there’s a “skills gap :(.” Yeah, the GAO is between what people are worth and what they’re willing to pay them, which is too damn low! 

My managers now keep trying to trick me and my one other coworker into working 12 hour days, 6 days a week. They’ve declined virtually any time off request with the excise that we’re too understaffed.

293,I think I can escape the rat race. Here is my story and I need your suggestions please.,"I'm (35M) originally from a India and I live in a first world country for the last five years and have acquired citizenship. Our (my wife and no kids) current net worth is 210K USD and 30K USD in a fund similar to 401K.  I may inherit 50K USD from our parents. I'm working since 21 and work has never appealed to me. I'm on /r/AntiWork, so enough said. 

I can live in India without working for rest of my life with the money we've got. My wife and I could do some simple work back home with very reduced hours/days to continue saving or if we are bored. I'm pondering now if that's a good option. Living in India obviously comes with a hell of a pollution, corrupt government, bribery, and you know the rest. But working 9-5 everyday is more shit than that. 

I have to tell you my work here is a breeze. I work 9 - 4 and work from home one day a week (I watch movies and get drunk on that day). My actual work is less than 8 hours/week and sometimes I can go to work with out doing any actual work for weeks together. The worst I've done is 20 hours of actual work. My wife's work is cool too. We don't know if we want to keep doing this stuff for few more years and save more money (we have simple lives) or to stop doing it in a year and move back. But sitting still 9-4 everyday has given me depression and I sometimes want to kill myself. I can't do things I like here because work and commute drains all my energy.

I see a 4 hour workday with enough time for me to pursue my hobbies in India and I have a big family there so we wouldn't feel alone as we feel here.  And I can always go back to my new country if this set up sucks. 

I love this community and I strongly feel /r/AntiWork is not about being lazy but people with a heightened sense of ways of living and don't succumb to the stupid idea that life is about buying a house and a fancy car and impressing people.

I know this is an odd request for this sub, but I thought who better to answer then those here? As we all know, work sucks and being in the corporate world can be a drain to your soul. 

I've recently started working for a company who wants to do better by their employees. We take quarterly anonymous surveys with every employee so they can rate the company culture and make recommendations/comments to help us make the necessary changes to better our company. 

Today, a few of us are having an ""employee retention"" meeting to expand on the benefits we offer our employees to encourage them to stay with us. Tuition reimbursement, higher wages, better healthcare, incentive programs, ect. are all going to be addressed, but I'd like to post the question to you guys:

I'm soon going to be forced out of school because my teacher's pretty much a workaholic, 1 days ill a year and can't endure that I'm having too much sick days. 

I'm searching for a job for a while, but the only things open are things like caretaker or any artisan job. I'm horrible, far more horrible in these kind of jobs than in my internship.

301,Seizing automation?,"**TL;DR** Automation worker walkout day when?

Automation has not really benefited the lives of workers so much as it has benefited leadership and shareholders who enjoy the extra fat which has been cut by making someone obsolete. Just look at the stock market's graph (type ""S&amp;P 500"" into google) and observe how it has grown in value since automation really became part of our lives since the 90's.

Automation is not a bad thing. It could greatly improve our lives; however, there seems to be no protection for workers. The lives of the people at the top are great though!

My company laid off 10 people because of an efficiency I created. One of them was in the hospital when he was fired. =( I feel like my skills can be used to make mine and others' lives more wealthy, in terms of both time and money, but because I'm stuck in this system where I need to survive I need to do what they tell me.

The reason why work sucks is that it's not on our terms. We won't have jobs in a better world, just occupations where we control the value we produce. Until then, we have to use our work as a threat of strike action against capital.

Taking your UBI check and staying home is a bribe not to strike. It's a pacification.

While I did leave out that I'm going through a serious depressive episode I did mention why I'm planning to quit. I was not surprised to hear ""You should voice your concerns and kick it upstairs""

To list some of the things that happened:
- The entire building was plagued by flies.
- The entire building smells like dead rat because a rat died in the ceiling. 
- I've been a supervisor for 10 months and do not have a seat.
- Requested a laptop so that I can roam and do my work (grading 26 agents at a call centre)
- An agent got stabbed right outside of work
- Agents striked because of concerns over safety (I'm really proud of them for this) It was only a half assed half day strike but it crippled operations enough for HR to come and talk to us. HR talked a lot of bullshit and we are hoping for a change but are yet to see it. 
- A different agent got robbed a week after the stabbing...right outside the building!
- Got put on 3 different projects that need to be done along with my grading requirements. I have to work with other departments that are not pulling their weight and I'm stuck trying to all the work. 
- Have to study a long ass piece of literature re banking law by the end of the coming week and do some tests. Boss told me to take it home. I ain't doing that because of 13 hours of doing work related shit I am not going home to do more work. 

I'm just thinking to quit and take a break for a couple of months. I still don't know what I want to do so I don't even know what job to look for.

Personally I fucking hate this stupid reason for working. I'd be bored not working? Fuck right off. I can't pack all I want to do into a lifetime of not working, let alone when I am working.

Topics such as [Overpopulation driving down wages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_army_of_labour) or Improvements in technology only working to increase the profits of the capitalist at the expense of the worker.


It's a very long time intensive book which at times can be confusing but it's well worth the effort.

314,How the F Did This Happen?,"Ok, so this story is long, about five years long, but basically, I was hired in 2014 by a guy from indeed. I worked for him for three years and he was horrible at being a manager and would leave work and never be there and people would be mad and it was always my coworker and me. Well, I quit and fast forward to last year. He calls me and tells me that he valued me as an employee and was hoping I would come back to work for him. I was hesitant, but he said things would be different and he'd pay me more. I was needing money, so I joined back up. And things were good for a while. But, then things started to be horrible again. He had me do tasks that weren't in my job description and I got injured doing them and he told me,""Well thats what good employees do."" He was very unprofessional and would say things that were off color or racist. Well one day he pulled me into his office, this was about a month ago and said he wasn't going to be coming to work anymore and that I would have to answer to my coworker. I was confused and he told me that I didn't need to understand and to NOT TELL ANYONE that he would be gone. If anyone asked I would tell them he was in a meeting. I thought this was so odd, so I talked to my dad about it. He saw my coworker as a client and he mentions it to her and asks her whats going on. My coworker tells my boss and then this happens. I am sitting at my desk doing work when my boss comes flying into the office. He starts screaming at me and cursing and pushes me into my desk. He tells me that I should have just kept fucking quiet and that I was stupid and he was furious. He leaves and I am shook the fuck up. A week later I made a simple error and my boss blew it out of proportion. He told me he had to fire me because of my mistakes. I was so angry that I told him he knew I didn't do anything serious. He ignored me and told me he had to fire me. I immediately went to file unemployment and even though I was fired, I wasn't fired for anything in writing, so they said I would most likely qualify at the unemployment office. A week went by and my family encouraged me to file a complaint with Labor and Industries for a hostile work environment and unfair termination. I went and told them the whole story and my caseworker was shocked at my bosses behavior. This was all on Friday. Well, now I don't know whats going to happen and I am kind of nervous, because I don't like screwing people over and I know my boss could lose his whole business because of this. But, why do I feel bad?  It's because I still care and forgive people and thats my mistake. My boss doesn't care what happens to me, but I don't like doing the same to him, yet its too late. Is this some sort of Stockholm abuse thing I am going through?

316,Just got a job where I do nothing for 90% of my day,"For the last 5 years of my life since I entered the workforce in earnest, working has been the #1 cause of my worsening mental state. It's not that I'm lazy at all, I'm just  not the kind of person who feels okay about throwing so much of my life away making money for other people, which I'm sure a lot of you can relate to. 

Then about two months ago, I got a job at a university dispatch center. I have never had a job like this before, where I could just go in and read a book or draw and get paid for it. We have a low call volume and my boss doesn't care what I do with my downtime. Everyone else there hates how boring it is, but I love it. It's the only job I've ever had any positive feelings towards. I've been taking some online programming classes in my downtime there and I've read more books in the last few months than I have in years. The pay isn't very good, but it's enough for me to pay my bills and have a bit left over, which is all I really need.

I think I was so stuck on finding a job that I would enjoy that I hadn't even considered that there are plenty of jobs that don't really require much of you except to show up.

Should I even look for work anymore (and just become homeless/wilderness hermit)? It feels like there are only shitty jobs.,"Since I was 13 years old, my goal in life was to get a job. I never knew how people got a job though. Finish highschool, do college in a good major, get depressive, have bad grades, drop-out, spend years recovering from trauma. 

The thing is once you are behind, you tend to become stuck there forever. Society has an expiration for people. If you didn't do what they did, it is too late. No re-do. Live with the consequences of your actions forever. 

That continued until I turned 30 and I have still never had a job. I just get stuck in so many rejections and inability. I have no skills and no worth. Most of my time has been spent being depressed, sleeping a lot, and having zero direction. I get up, eat, nap, watch videos, eat again, nap again, read stuff, and then sleep. I don't even really exercise either. 


I still live with my parents, have no friends, never had a relationship, no college degree, and cannot drive a car. I have nothing to show in the real world.

I am basically anti-work because it feels like I am worthless, that no company really actually cares any more. They just more and more for them and less for others. Community isn't profit. Health isn't profit. Leisure and free time isn't profit. The only good in the world is extracting profit and underpaying and undermining everything else. 

And so I feel like I have nothing. No worth. No value. And that will lead me to getting jobs that treat me like I am worthless with no value getting paid $10 if I am lucky to work (if, again, lucky) 30 hours of ""wild whenever scheduling because we own you.""

I have found it. I am a medical laboratory scientist. I help save lives. I run labs that identify heart attack and stroke. I crossmatch blood to save people in traumas. I prepare platelets for cancer patients whose own platelets have been destroyed by chemo.

And I am burned out. Most of us are. While I'm at work, I'm fine. I don't feel the burnout so much. I love going in ever day and making a difference, plus I just think the job is cool as all hell. I get home *energized*. But after the extra shifts drag on, the stress starts piling on. Eventually, I break down. It feels like I wasn't meant to work this much.

324,should I join the military at mid 30?,"no one is hiring me and I can't get on disability. I'm going crazy here, no money, job or any bright future in sight. I just don't see the point of joining, at this point it feels like my life is already over. Here are all the cons of military. airforce age limit is late 30s, so I'm still ok.

- I'll be hanging out with bunch of 18-19yr olds. almost half my age.

- 8year contract

-taking orders from 20-22yr olds

-no freedom, you will have to deploy every 6months or so. you don't get to choose ur location. I could end up in alaska.

-male dominated, can't meet any women and my time is ticking. If I don't find someone soon, I may reach the point in no return. Doesn't help that I have no freedom, so I can't seek women from civilian world

-millitary high turn over rates tells me that most people hate it and only doing it for the benefits 

-I'll be in my 40s by the time contract is up.

pros:

-money, healthcare, all money related.



I can't believe I'm stuck like this. I must be lowest 1% in my age group, I feel so worthless and I'm so miserable.

330,Job hopping like a happy bunny,"Hey everyone! Last night I stumbled upon this sub and read as many posts as I could and I think I want to share my thoughts. This will be a long post so here's a TLDR:

Job hopping helped me gain perspective on what is ""normal"" in a workplace. 

I am an almost 25 years old woman. I have attended university and the years I was there were extremely busy but also extremely fulfilling. I studied Classics and Linguistics (in my country this is a kind of prestigious degree, not on par with lawyers or doctors, but close in a way). I also tutored children and teens for little to no money but I covered my expenses. I was so happy. I woke up every day at 6:00 with no alarm clock, exercised, took care of my diet, went to my classes, had the perfect notes I would share with anyone who needed them and after 9 hours of class I would tutor for 2 or 3 hours. 

In 2016 my family had some financial problems. I live with my mother (my father has passed away) and the government cut almost half her pension, which was not large at all to begin with. For two years I tried to push through with cutting my expenses and tutoring in order to help us, but it was not enough. So, when the father of one of my students told my that their business was hiring, I took the opportunity and got my first job. 

It was okay. I was not passionate about it like I am with teaching, but the money was good enough and the hours were fair (no overtime, paid vacation etc.). After a year and a half it got tedious and some things came out of the woodwork. I was the only young person (and woman) in there so I had to endure many absurd comments. My work was not fulfilling. I was a bad fit and I do not say that as a bad thing. I just didn't click with this job, no big deal. That's how I see it now. At that moment I was rather sad and frustrated. 

So, I applied to any job I thought would be a better fit for me. I was lucky enough to find a job as a secretary for a private school. I loved everything there except for the owner. My boss was horrible. He would swear, insult me, use vulgar language for the shock of it. Everyone avoided him. All my co-workers said that they had cried at work and that it is normal to feel frustrated in there. So, I tried to do my job and ignore his insults. That was until he told me I would be working 12 hours on Saturdays and Sundays. We had a ""discussion"", meaning I presented my arguments and he yelled and barked at me that I was lazy, entitled, the whole nine, just because I wanted one day of the weekend for my family and friends. 

The next day I didn't go to work. One morning when he was not there I went to sign my papers and take the money he owed me. I had already found another job at a publishing house, again as a secretary. My feelings were not good for this one since the interview but I needed the money. They didn't match my previous salary, they expected me to stay overtime (no extra money, of course) and the owner (an 83 year old man) was a handful. He would storm in 2 hours before closing, swearing for no reason and expected me to do many things out of my duties and stay overtime because he arrived late. He would also go on long, passionate speeches about my generation and how difficult we have it and how we must fight The Man and claim what is ours (all that while he didn't want to give me 10% above minimum wage)

I stayed with him for 10 days. Why? When my cousin went into labor and I asked to leave an hour early because things were not going well, he told me that my cousin would still be in the hospital in one hour and I could go then. 

I had another offer by a young man and his sister who operate an e-shop with decorative items and furniture. I took it on the spot. When I went to quit my boss told me I was unethical, that no one would want to hire me and give me more than the minimum wage, unless I worked in a brothel and that it is a good thing my father is dead and he can't see what his daughter has become. 

I cried on the pavement outside work and took 10 days to myself where I mostly sorted out the garage and drank. I was afraid of my new job but I couldn't admit it to anyone. 

Yesterday was my first day. No one yelled. No one cursed me when things didn't go well. Even though I have experience on the job, they didn't expect me to know everything. They trained me by showing me everything and answered my questions. We even joked and shared some stories. When they told me I could use the coffee maker if I wanted coffee (something the other bosses didn't allow) it clicked. This is what normal is. At least for work. Not crying, not yelling, not swearing. Just working side by side, tackling tasks and having a laugh along the way.

I am still not too optimistic but things finally seem to go well and with my new peace of mind I will try to make more of my life and pursue the things I am passionate about.",False,dldkb5,Natakori,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/dldkb5/job_hopping_like_a_happy_bunny/,0,2
331,Boss ruining my day in one sentence; questioning my sanity sometimes,"My boss at my minimum wage slacker job (I picked this job specifically because I only need to be physically present and, aside from that, can do whatever I want with my time) just noticed that I read a book and asked me what it was. She then flat out asked me whether I ""wouldn't want to make something out of"" my life someday, which triggered a lot of anger and shame I guess.

I am 25 and had good grades in school but always felt alienated, got kicked out of three schools and after graduating, five years ago, got hit with depression really hard. I've come a long way since then and realized a lot about our fucked up culture, how conditioned we all are, how most people have their self worth tied to their success in the system, in job titles, reviews, credits etc...

In Our family we had the good fortune of growing up with a father who came from ""nothing"" and ""made something out of himself"", all the while not gaining an inch of inner peace or doing anything really worthwhile for society or anyone but our material welfare inside the family. He still drank himself to near death, had a stroke, was overweight and neglected his mental health and spiritual wellbeing, essentially emotionally neglecting us in the process of it all. I consider that a gift and a curse, since I realized early that the rewards of modern capitalistic society are mostly empty. He also was very permissive and tried to never shape my opinions in any way, always respecting my feelings and never judging me, which is probably the perfect breeding ground for someone with ""adjustment disorder"" lol.

Now, I don't know how I want to proceed from here on out. What I don't want is to make these decisions out of status or monetary fear like almost everyone does (I luckily don't have to pay rent for the foreseeable future) but God the fucking pressure is almost unbearable sometimes.  Everyone questions you all the time and you internalize that voice in school.

 I sometimes feel like I'm radicalizing and deluding myself with those ideas instead of ariving at a more accurate picture of reality, so I guess I'm just looking for validation and reassurance that I'm not going crazy.",False,dlfkop,ae_oe_ue,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/dlfkop/boss_ruining_my_day_in_one_sentence_questioning/,15,15

334,Does anyone else think the Mars colony is undesireable?,"I understand why people are excited about Mars being colonised by itself but not why people would still sign up and be excited knowing that a private company is involved. It doesn't seem futuristic and sci-fi, it feels tired; just another century of ""whoever has the gold makes the rules"" gone wrong.

1. Straight off the bat, a private company owning the colony means there is no space that is 'publically' owned, and belonging to you, a citizen, by right. Where do you go when you want to get away from Elon Musk's corporate colony culture?
2. Because the colony is owned by a private company and it's on another planet, the laws of Earth don't apply, the corporate laws created by Elon Musk apply. In order to gain the most profits for Elon Musk's company, the working and living laws will be created to get the best out of Musketeers who are willing to work 80 hour workweeks to prove their undying love to Elon Musk. Best of luck to non-white people, women, transgender people, disabled people, old people, and families. 
3. It will be densely populated with Musketeers who think working 80 hours a week for Elon Musk's personal legacy is the pinnacle of their existence. If you have any issues with the way things are run up in there you cannot breathe one word of it to anyone else, because you're surrounded, and you cannot trust corporate drones.
4.

344,Stressed Out and a Bit Worried,"I hate unloading and ranting on an anonymous forum, but I need some sort of outlet right now. Hope you all will bear with me.





This week has been stressful. Really stressful. Like, if the Apocalypse shed light, and you could use a magnifying glass to focus that light, my stress would be akin to an ant being crispy-fried by that Apoca-beam.





Not getting into details because they're too mind-numbing to even list, but folks should have a clear mental picture of the work environment right now when I say ""white collar job, during a project crunch.""





Anyway, on top of that, we have Big Wigs in the office this week with their entourage. As in, my boss's boss's boss and all of his team. On top of *that*, the Big-Wig-ening has now required me to have two days of all day meetings - 8am to 6pm - with a ""generous"" 15 min lunch to break up the monotony. Oh, and a single 5 minute restroom break allowed in the afternoon. Can't forget that kindness.





On top of all *that*, last night we had a ""Team-building Fun Event"" scheduled. I said and meant ""night"" literally, because it went from 6:00 - 9:30pm, during the majority of which it was dark out. Oh, and this event (golf, drinks/schmoozing and a ""light dinner"" at an indoor putting range) was being held one city over, 45 min - 1 hour away from my office and home.





No offense to anyone who likes golf and alcohol, but I hate them. I hate schmoozing even more. I hate being out late, 45 min away from my house at 9:30 at night, even more than any of those things.





I didn't go and didn't give any excuses.





The evening was much less stressful for not having gone, but now I'm a bit worried as to how much Ass-kissing points I've lost by not going. It's close to end of the year and the attendant annual reviews that go with it, and I, the pessimist I am, can imagine how easily the swath of good work I've done could be overlooked and count for nothing in light of me not being a ""team player"" at the Big Wig-ening.





That's about it, I guess. I wish there were a better end to the rant and some nice ""but everyone was okay with everything and work worked out"" closure, but instead I'm stressed and wondering why I took 5 minutes to write out a message board post when I should have been doing something work related. And then I'm feeling a bit dejected and mad at myself that I'm paranoid enough to be worried about taking a 5 minute break.

352,Toxic Bullying culture at work,"I’m in the U.K., currently signed off work for stress. I’ve been in my retail job 11 years. In that time my managers have tried unfairly dismissing me, and have blocked me moving up, both in and out of the company, through lying or being wilfully inflexible. In the last three years I was placed with an older colleague. He claimed the management were trying to bully him out. His mental health began declining. He became increasingly difficult to work with. He would rail at me over trifling differences of opinion on procedural things in front of customers. He would be absent for months at a time with stress. Because he was in litigation with the management, they began managing at an increasing distance. That meant responsibility for running the shop all but fell to me. 

In June last year, my colleague completely lost the plot and started swearing at me and physically threatening me. I’d never reported his behaviour before as I knew he had mental health issues and issues with the management. At the same time I couldn’t continue being abused by my colleague. He’d crossed the line so I reported him, but asked not to raise a formal grievance. I thought that if I gave him the space to reflect he’d realise I wasn’t his enemy and he’d have room to climb down and apologise on his own. My manager had a different idea and decided to raise a formal grievance as a matter of his “duty of care”. He convinced me that I effectively had a similar duty of care to ensure the issue was properly addressed so no one else would be bullied. I provided a statement. He was found “guilty” after an investigation. He wasn’t fired, but told he would have to apologise and that there would be an external mediator brought in to the shop to work with us. 

Whilst my colleague considered his position he was off from work. I told my manager I had serious concerns about working with my colleague again. He had had altercations with several other members of staff and tended to hold grudges after the event. My manager said he expected my colleague to hold a grudge against me, and that that was the reason he wanted me to continue to work with him. I would be a trap. He told me once again about my “duty of care”. If I were transferred to another branch, someone else would need to be brought in, meaning the whole cycle would repeat itself. If I stood firm and he acted out again it would be brought to an end. Whilst my colleagues own concerns about the management trying to get rid of him were in the back of my mind, I was still raw from what had happened between us over the preceding 2 years. The thought of allowing someone else to go through that swayed my decision to back my managers plan. My colleague did not return, but resigned. 

My manager immediately came up to me and thanked me profusely, saying he’d been trying to get rid of the guy for 18 years. My heart sank. What had I allowed myself to be a part of? 6 weeks later, a new manager steps in. All the responsibilities that had fallen to me in the preceding years were taken back, but so too was the small freedom to self manage my day that had gone along with that responsibility. I was being micromanaged on every aspect of the job. My colleagues told me the new manager had been criticising me to them behind my back, saying I was arrogant, useless, had an attitude problem and needed putting in my place. All the while, to my face, he kept calling me buddy, and was constantly patting me on the back. He then moved me to another branch, adding an hour to my day and extra travel costs, giving me no real consultation. I asked him to reconsider, but he was unmoved. I’ve never had a bad staff review, nor failed to honour my contractual obligations in 11 years. In retrospect it’s easy to see I was naive, but I genuinely hoped that, after my colleague resigned, things could get a little bit easier. A little less stressful. It’s been anything but. 

I’ve gone through my union, but the bar for constructive dismissal is so high that, even with statements from colleagues and years of email and WhatsApp transcripts, which clearly show what was going on, there’s nothing that can legally be done.

I have to leave, but I can’t afford to expose myself financially. All I can hope is for is a “negotiated exit”, which is completely uncertain and could drag on for months.

353,Fifty People Blindsided at My Workplace Today.,"Work had been getting slow lately but we were still keeping up with production and everyone seemed busy. 

This morning 50 people were rounded up one by one and shown the door. No notice whatsoever had been given. It was horrible seeing adults choked up and teary eyed.

I thought this company was half decent with it's flexibility, benefits and usual transparency on operations but this was brutal. 

I have been planning on quitting in two weeks to go travel and was contemplating when to give notice but after today fuck them.

The crazy thing is people feel lucky to still be there and are working harder than ever and are taking time for breaks. This lay off has had the opposite affect on me as I am completely demotivated.

There is no loyalty. It's all a race to the bottom.

A really good example of hypocrisy in the corporation realm.

Why are the standard employees so envious of the soon-to-be retired employees? Don't they work here on their own will? Nothing would force them to work, right? The could stay on welfare, or imagine alternate life plans, like entrepreneuship, but no, they stay there and will keep looking for job red flags, such as antiwork speech.

Small topic to say what I 'can't say to my line manager : if you're so envious this other guy is retiring soon, then you should be softer on people who claim that working is a complete mess, because in your heart you know it already, that it's a living hell. Even with your bunch of various responsibility, you can't just shut down people criticising their working conditions, when yourself you are not convinced you're living your best life.

366,Discovering this sub tells me I am not alone,"So I am 16 still and go to school. I don’t like going to school, I love socializing and the comradery aspect of it, I also like learning and educating myself but the more I progress I feel school develops more to a place that wants to squeeze out as many people as fast as possible to create an endless stream of workforce thrown onto the job market. Why give the students more time and less hours, when you can pump them put a year faster making them work a year longer? I go to school, do my homework, dread the next exam, go home and just wait till my next schoolday starts. Free time isn’t free time it’s just downtime from school, even weekends are a downtime. Everyone in school can’t wait to go to work and get a job. I don’t understand, I already feel this much pressure and performance mindset in school, how will I ever work a job?? In the past I wanted to become a lawyer, since I genuinely like the job but all this working and torture for it doesn’t seem worth it really. At this point I just want a job which minimizes the time I have to spend creating surplus value for a person, whose only accomplishment is, to own the place I am working at. I don’t want to work hard for my degree, whats the point? It won’t change the fact that I will be slaving away 50 years of my life for a capitalist, no matter the degree, this will happen. The worst part is that work doesn’t habe to be this alienating, work is actually fun when you do it for recreation. We have the capacities for a 25-30 hour week in an environment where we own our workplace with the cowokers. Automation could reduce work hours drastically, life could be so fulfilling!! But no, we have to do depressing wage labour.

I offered to help but she obviously thought she would be quicker without me, so in the end I stopped offering...

The TV was on in the background, with some boring programme droning on....

I could not sneak a check/read on my phone because phones are not allowed. (You have to keep it in the staff room/your bag and can only be checked on your break time.)

I could not have a normal conversation with any of the residents because they all had varying forms/scale of Dementia and would just talk nonsense.

So, I just sat there in silnce, listening to a lady who could not be consoled (even after how many times...) going ""Help me!"" ... Help me! ...Help me!"" On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on...

My job was to sit there and make sure that an elderly man did not try to get out when someone would open the door to enter (on a lock system.) And to tell the lady going ""Help me!"" ""It's alright, just relax. We;re just waiting for \[breakfast/lunch/dinner\]"" and to ""sit down, please"" every 5 minutes (she is not allowed to walk off on her own) and not to take her top off.

I'd adverage that this was for about 5-6 hours of my day yesterday.

382,Rough Week,"This is a bit of a rant, I need to blow the steam out. TL;DR at the bottom.

My workplace is split into many manufacturing departments, but I tend to bounce around between them. I've been working for almost three months, almost to the end of the ""probation"" period (which is kind of a crock of crap, but okay). Since I bounce around a lot, I sometimes don't work in a department for a while.

At the beginning of this week, I went to a department I haven't worked at in about six weeks (important for story). As such, I couldn't remember exactly how to read the specifications for our products. I double checked with my supervisor, and he asked me ""how long have you worked here? Because you should know this by now"". I explained it's been a while since I worked in the department, but he was still upset. Sadly, I worked with him pretty much all of that day and the next. It was very obvious that I was bothering him for some reason.

Yesterday, he pulled me aside to ""test"" me on the paperwork. The test went fine, and I only overestimated one part of the material we would need to build the product. He was surprised and told me I did much better than he thought I would. Internally, I was pretty pissed off because literally *every* job I've ever worked, 80% of my coworkers think I'm stupid. But I'm used to it, so I just vented to my wife when I got home and that was that.

This morning, he comes to me and says that he's been asked to notify my that if I don't improve I'll lose my job at the end of the month. Of course, I'm pissed. I diplomatically asked why, and he explained that the two big things are efficiency and the paperwork. I will credit him that he's very honest and up front, which I appreciate. He assigned a whole page of work to me (which is quite a bit). I did fine and surprised him with some of my abilities (facepalm).

At the end of the day, I asked him for more specifics. I pointed out that it is difficult for me to know how to improve when I meet the requirements on the checklist for the probation (yeah, I meet the hard requirements just fine, except maybe some paperwork stuff. I'll definitely admit that I'm not perfect and should work on the paperwork). He told me that he was ready for me to get fired earlier in the week over the paperwork, so he notified the owner and lead supervisor. Then he said that the next day he told them to disregard what he said after I showed that I'm not fucking stupid. I asked on a scale of 1-10, 10 being I keep my job for sure, where am I? A strong 6 or a 7.

I told him that I am having a hard time seeing why I'm on the chopping block when I easily outperform many of the other employees. I might not be the all Star, but I'm certainly better than others by a long shot. He agreed with me about that. He said he had told the upper ups that he wants me to stay. Then he acted like it was fine. He also recommended I talk to the other supervisors since they have a say in my employment too.

I'm pretty confident I'll keep my job. I don't suck at what I do, and I'm *not* stupid. What really pisses me off is that I'm in this situation because I made someone unhappy then he gave bad feedback about me. And he just acts like it's fine and we're cool. Now I have to go through a round of ass kissing (which I know some of them don't like me. I'm quiet and don't talk to anyone really, so they aren't very personable in return which is understandable). Another issue is that I was supposed to get a raise if I did well on the review, which I was pretty sure I would get. Now that's out of question. No raise, maybe no job.

I would just quit this job and find something else, but I live in a college town and this is the best hours / paying job I could find.

TL;DR supervisor thinks I'm stupid, complains to boss. Boss says I have till the end of the month to prove myself. Supervisor says next day that I'm doing better than he thought after I show that I'm not dumb. Now I have to kiss ass to the other supervisors and hope I don't lose my job, but I definitely lost the raise I was going to get.",False,djfmaz,gladman7673,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/djfmaz/rough_week/,6,9

385,Bosses who are jerks for no reason,"Hey guys, new to the subreddit. Great reading so far. I wanted to make a post about bosses who are jerks for no reason. It seems every job I've ever had, the boss was a jerk and/or had a hot temper if things weren't done ""his way"" or if you made the fatal mistake of doing something wrong because the idiot boss failed to instruct you properly. In other words, you didn't read his mind and got chewed out for it. I just don't understand why bosses are like this. 

In my experience, it pretty much NEVER inspires anyone to do a better job. In fact, it lowers moral and makes your job HARDER causing you to do shittier work. When I think back to all the times my boss got angry at me, almost EVERY TIME he could have just calmy explained to me how he wanted a certain thing done, and the results would have been exactly the same. In other words literally EVERY TIME they blow up, it's for nothing and all it accomplishes is to stress the worker out which will DEGRADE their work performance.

I can honestly say there is not one instance at my job (that I've had for 15 years now) where my boss ""needed"" to chew me out, yet he's done it countless times. This for me is one of the biggest reasons I hate the idea of going to work and dread it with a passion. Never knowing what stupid ass thing my boss will flip about next. And it's not a question of ""if"" but rather ""when"" he's going to flip out. Hate it so much yet I have to put up with it and I'm ""not supposed to complain"" because ""he's the boss"" as my idiot co-workers always say.

Apparently going to work means you have to have stress and just accept the fact that your boss treats you like shit at any given moment (usually when he's having a bad day and takes it out on you) just ""because that's the way it is"". Shit is completely unnecessary and adds NOTHING of value to the company or anything else, and I'm sick of it. Anyone else feel this way?

389,Finally gave my 2 weeks notice.,"Thought this sub might like to celebrate with me. 

I posted here a month or two ago about my shitshow job and how I feel like I’m the only one who cares to do anything, I feel like I’m being taken advantage of, I have no time to do anything and I’m so tired all the time, etc. but I was petrified of quitting because of how lucky I was to get the job.

Well, I finally worked up the courage and turned in my two weeks notice. I told my manager it’s because it’s too far from my house and I can’t keep hitching rides from relatives or blowing my paychecks on Lyfts coming to and from - I didn’t want to burn a bridge, and that was partially true anyway.

Funnily enough the straw that broke the camel’s back was actually something that happened at home - the night before one of my opening shifts, where I have to get up at 6AM, I didn’t get to sleep until 3 because my cats were going ballistic all night and nothing I did could calm them down or block out the noise of their very loud playing. It seems to happen every night before I have an opening shift and combined with my already miserable sleep disorder I just couldn’t take it anymore.

My last day is Halloween. I’m going to take a couple months to focus on finally getting my driver’s license so I don’t have to rely on anyone else for transportation anymore, then I’ll try to find something new that might treat me a little better. I will be without income for a while which is scary because I don’t have much saved, but I’ll find a way to make it work. I’m an artist, maybe I can try to take art commissions in my spare time.

392,My Story," 

I'm a 35 year old male and I live in Canada.

I work a job I hate; a deli in a grocery store.

I work 5 nine hour shifts a week.

It's exhausting.

Yet I'm afraid to cut my hours because I need money.

Even if I don't want it; I still need it.

For example; I've had this pain in the left side of my body for two weeks now and I finally went to the doctor today (90 minutes at the clinic ) and got two prescriptions and paid $59.

My living expenses aren't too high; less than a $1000 a month.

I make plenty of money to pay my expenses and save 20% of my income and still have enough leftover to have ""fun.""

I put fun in quotes because I don't find things fun lately.

I bought a Nintendo Switch and was all excited to play it and I've barely touched it in months.

I'm just so tired.

I used to go the gym and do yoga; was relaxing, fun, and healthy.

I don't go anymore.

I'm just so tired.

If I could work part time or not even work anymore; things would be a lot better.

I would go back to working out; doing yoga, learn to play piano, reading.

I used to go to the library for hours on end; losing myself in books.

Now I waste time in front of my PC watching Youtube videos; can't even bother to go out unless I need to.

I've wanted to learn piano forever yet I can't find the strength and time to do so.

All I do is work. come home, then work again.

393,Colleagues who make the job even worse than it needs to be,"Why do people do this?

I work a retail job and on Sundays there is only two of us working.

We dont have many customers that day so the first two hours of the day its just me in the shop, and its the best 2 hours of the week. Hardly any customers and i can just dust the shop while listening to a podcast.

Then the other staff member comes in, i go to take the rubbish to the compactor, and she questions me on it and says she can do it later. Um excuse me im the shift supervisor and im taking my 3-4 minutes out of the store thankyou.

Then when it comes to customers and sales. Im going to let you into a secret, I dont care how much money the store makes, i dont care.

I'll always greet customers, ask if they need any help then leave them alone. This is enough to make enough sales that I wont get fired, and thats all I care about.

My coworker on the other hand harrases people and will say to me ""why dont you try again"" 30 seconds after a customer had told me tgey just want to look. 

Like why do you care, we arent going to be fired, our sales are fine, we dont need to harrass people to squeeze out an extra 5%

Then when the weekend to come and you shove all your life in two days except you can't because you've got to prepare to do it all again.

406,"""Flex off more hours""","I work in a hospital. Administration keeps track of the hours we are clocked in vs. productivity. They measure productivity differently for each area of the hospital. For us, it's how many lab tests we ran that day vs. how many hours people were clocked in.

This would seem reasonable if it were used as a tool to determine how many people to hire.

Instead, it's monthly harassment.

I will explain.

Back in June, July, August, and September, we finished the month with a 40-60 hour surplus, meaning we had enough testing for an extra 40-60 hours of labor, but we did it with our barebones staff. We were busy. Summer was insane.

October slowed down. We now ""owe"" them 31 hours. Do they look at the entire summer and recognize how much money we made them? 

No. 

Do they now demand that we use PTO and somehow 'flex' our barebones staff down to almost nothing?

YOU BET!

They want October to be perfect - either we ""owe"" them zero hours, or we have a surplus. We can't dip below break-even for a single month regardless of past performance. Even if I hit a 100 hour surplus 11 months out of the year, they will pitch a fit because I ""owe"" them one month.

421,The people with the “dream jobs” at my company hate their work.,"
Last week I had to help out a different department than I normally do in my company. It’s a very interesting department which is almost impossible to get into and the employees each have over 20 years of experience and titles in coveted positions. I was basically just shuffling paperwork of course. As someone who is rarely jealous of other people’s work, though, I have to admit I was feeling a bit envious of the city views from the manager’s office window. 


However, any time another employee would come and greet me and they felt like we were alone, every single one of them told me how much they hate their job, how they’ve been understaffed for years, how they had no idea “what the fuck their manager did all day,” and how they wish they had saved more for retirement when they were younger so they could leave. One woman went on and on about how everyone in the office was an alcoholic because there was no other way to deal. When another guy came and talked to me, he said the exact same thing and told me that he’d been commuting for almost 4 hours a day for *over ten years*!!! Another employee told me that she’d just picked up a second job to help pay for a higher degree.

I was dumbstruck. To be honest, whenever things aren’t going well at work I usually see if there’s anything I can change first. I figure that if no one else seems upset, then maybe my expectations are too high, I’m being too lazy, or I’m suffering from some kind of lifestyle inflation. My experience last week changed that. It really made me feel like I could work as hard as possible and still be miserable.

These idiot authors don't realize that Correlation ≠ Causation.

&gt; among all three groups [it was] revealed that those working full-time reported significantly lower stress and depressive symptoms

DUH, because it's fucking stressful and depressing to not being able to feed your family, or keep a roof over your head!

&gt; A randomized household health survey was conducted in six low-income neighborhoods

&gt; Participants received a $10 grocery store voucher

&gt; This study was conducted at the height of the recession in 2009

So you go and survey people super poor, give them pittance grocery coupons for their time, and conclude that WORK and LABORING for an employer 5 out of 7 days makes people HEALTHY?

&gt; This study supports past work suggesting it is vital for the health and well-being of all people to increase not simply employment, but specifically full-time employment. 

NOOO. It is vital for the health and well-being of all people to be able to afford BASIC NEEDS, you morons. It's not the WORK that makes people healthy.

&gt; The study was cross-sectional, therefore providing correlational evidence of relationships examined, not a causal test.

THEN WHY ARE YOU SAYING THAT FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT IS IMPORTANT FOR YOUR HEALTH??

In case it's not clear, I think that working full time is an outdated relic of the last century, and is exploitative in light of all the productivity gains in the last few decades.

There's such a focus, even by left wing politicians (aside from Andrew Yang), on JOBS. WORK. JOB CREATORS. Create more jobs. Create more work. NO. WORK IS NOT THE ANSWER.

The answer is choice. The answer is security. The answer is freedom. I don't know what the solution is, but the population doesn't need to be working as much as they do to produce and sell pointless widgets, to line the pockets of the owner class.

Work is not inherently bad. Work that is forced on the population, with little freedom, (and the alternative being homelessness/starvation) is bad.",False,diiyk1,mynameisegg,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/diiyk1/this_study_says_working_full_time_is_important/,8,45

Anyway I haven't thought of killing myself at all the last couple days and have generally been in a good mood.

I don't know how any rational human being can be mentally/physically capable of spending 8 hours a day doing repetitive crap for 8 hours a day then going home and watching TV until they fall asleep.  People say you have to work to contribute to society but, what society? I couldn't tell you my own fucking neighbors name. Humanity had the chance to build a society that people would enjoy living in shortly after they discovered agriculture and the industrial revolution. But, instead of using our brains to our advantage (which got us this far by the way) we decided that since there is plenty of food and no danger we'll just fuck like rabbits. And the rich took advantage of the fact and bought up all the land and resources  to rent or sell back to the rest of us at the expense of our time and sanity.  Lots of these jobs are manufactured as well because heaven forbid everybody doesn't have a job. And they keep inventing new and better shit for us to buy to keep the wheel moving. But, here's the thing. What if I'm completely happy with everything I have and just want to sit in a reasonably priced housing and enjoy it?  Why do you need to sell 30 years of your life to get something everybody needs to live like a house? Why are parents so quick to get rid of their children when they are 18? Don't you want a better life for your kids? Just going to sell them into slavery rather than let them stay at a house that's already been paid for? If I ever have kids I would want them to have a better life than me. That means not wasting it doing stupid bullshit they don't care about just to support a life I forced on them. So they are free to stay indefinitely and they can inherit the house when I die. But, all that aside life feels like you've been shipwrecked in shark infested waters and you're supposed to find your way back to land.  Like really?

462,I hate this damn job,"Let me break it down for you. First, im just plain tired of the work. Ive been working on planes for nearly twenty years and Im over it. Especially this plane. The V22 Osprey. The biggest piece of crap I have ever worked on. It does its job well, but ease of maintenance was clearly an afterthought when they built it. I hate it, I hate working on it. I tried to transfer to another platform. They wont let me. My supervisor who is the most yessiest company yes man I have ever met tells me when I spoke to him about my desire to transfer says, "" it used to be a lot worse"". And to ""give it a chance"" yeah ok. Thanks pal. A few months ago management came down and asked for volunteers to go to backshop, which is a great gig if you can get it. They took people from every production line except ours. Turns out they had no intention of letting any people from the V22 line go, but they had to ask us to seem ""fair"". There are few crueler things than to give people false hope.
See, no one wants to come to the V22 line because its universally known to be a miserable place. No one wants to go there, and everyone wants to leave there. So its always undermanned. Which means the poor bastards stuck there (like myself) have to work non stop overtime. 
Lets talk about the overtime system here. Toxic as hell. I don't need the money. My wife makes great money, we live within our means, and we don't have a boat/truck/motorcycle like just about everyone one else seems to have. But get this, you have to work overtime to refuse it. If your hours are lower than everyone else, you get FORCED to work saturdays and 10hr days during the week. So now I have to sacrifice my weekends to this managerial shit show.
And lets talk about logistics. Apparently the marines never have any money, so they can't order parts. So we order a part and it can take weeks or sometimes months to get here and when it finally does? You guessed it, OVERTIME because we need to catch up to ""support the warfighter"" no one apparently gives a shit about the warfighter at any point in the logistics chain, or when it takes a month to get an engineering disposition back, but by God when it finally does your ass better be here non stop so we can get this airplane out to the fleet. The same fleet that is down nearly 100 aircraft because of money and poor maintenance. 
So here I am, instead of being at home making breakfast with my kids I'm here sacrificing another saturday upon the alter of incompetence, mismanagement, and others greed. Fucking lovely. But hey the supervisor buys us biscuits on saturday so that's good right? FML.

The benefits and being paid for training + just going into the office is awesome

So, I do orientation. I do the first 5 hours of at home training. I took my time on this and some paperwork for my mental health

After all this, I was suppose to get my schedule to shadow someone before doing the rest of my certification

It's been a month

I still don't have my schedule, and unfortunately really need an income because I have taxes and credit card debt to pay off

Every time I call in, they've been busy and forget to schedule me. I only have the spoons to call every Monday, and then I was sick for a week

My theories for why they've basically ghosted me:
1) They've actually been really busy
2) Because I was slower with my training and paperwork, I'm not a priority
3) I'm openly trans

And despite my state having it that you can't fire someone for being trans, people still get away with it

470,I won't contribute to a system that has so far denied me personhood,"For my refusal to work society has punished me by forcing me to spend every single one of my 25 years on this planet living with my parents. 

I accept that I will never have my own place, car, friends, girlfriend, clothes, money ect. I lost all contact with my friends and family. I am just a burden to my friends without money or a car. At this point I'm not willing to take part in a system that has let me suffer for as long as it has. I want to prevent people from being hurt by this system, not take part in it. 

The thing is that I don't need help. A psychiatrist can't help me because the psychiatrist is trapped under the same circumstances I am. What I really need is the ability to make decisions in terms of my own well being and livelihood. I need the things required to function in modern life. Currently I'm being denied those things. Talking won't fix that. 

People have told me before that opting out of this system won't change anything, but that's my entire point. This system doesn't have to deny people like me personhood. It chooses to do so based on a arbitrary number. I now strongly believe all humans deserve food regardless of their number ""value."" No human should have to give up years of their own life only to earn things necessary for survival. Especially in a post hunter gatherer society. People who support this system don't believe everyone deserves life. They believe only workers deserve life. 

I wouldn't take part in such a clearly immoral system even if it was only taking a year of my time, but people willfully give up 40. In my opinion giving up 40 years of your life to do tricks to earn things every human deserves isn't a sign of mental maturity or something to boast about. There is no way you can give up 40 years and end up as as well rounded of a personhood as you would have if you spent that time with family, friends, learning, traveling, living at your own pace. 

Currently under this system, people actually rally against the use of self driving trucks as it will decrease the amount of jobs. This system actually tries to create more work even if there is no work that needs to be done. The world we live in could already be much more automated if it weren't for arbitrary numbers preventing humanities true potential. We could already be educating everyone too, but instead we reserve education for those with enough money. I can't even imagine how a successful alien race would look at the idea of only educating certain members of our species based on paper amount.

471,"Whenever I talk about what I do, someone here always replies, ""are you guys hiring?"" Trust me, you do NOT want a do-nothing office job. Here's why","I keep seeing these comments of users wishing they had a B.S. job. I get that many of you engage in difficult physical labor, and sitting at a desk all day might seem like something to aspire to. 

Well, I'm here to say the grass is definitely not greener here.

Here are the reasons:

1. **Skill deprecation.** If you do nothing, you don't gain any meaningful experience that would allow you to get another job in the future. In many fields, the knowledge you already have becomes irrelevant over time as industries evolve. It's a vicious cycle, where you can't get a better job because your current job is bad.
2. **Non-physical jobs are back-breaking too, literally.** Humans are not meant to sit for 8-9 hours a day. For me, the results have been very painful. After suffering from debilitating chronic back pain bouts over the past few years, seeing specialists, chiropractors and physio, I came across a research on this. Apparently job dissatisfaction is one of the most [common predictors of back pain](https://www.aafp.org/afp/1998/0701/p220.html).
3. **Other health implications.** Being immobile for 40h+ a week is bad for you. If you find the energy to go to the gym after work every day, kudos. I don't. It's surprising how draining it is to do nothing all day, even though there's very little physical exercise involved.
4. **You can't re-purpose the time for anything more useful.** Offices these days do not have cubicles. The trend is open space. Everyone can see your monitor.  You're also monitored electronically - your employers likely have some system to track browsing history. There's also a slow and inconsistent stream of meaningless work, small tasks (emails, spreadsheets, online forms) that requires context-switching and break your concentration. 
5. **Everyone around you is fake**. Fake smiles, fake corporate jargon, fake agreement with everything management says. Ranting does not happen. I think this self-censorship is internalized, those who partake in it might not even be fully aware. [Offices are dictatorships](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/7/17/15973478/bosses-dictators-workplace-rights-free-markets-unions), where free thinking is forbidden and supposedly-voluntary obedience and acceptance of the dictated values is the key to success. On my last 2 jobs, your coworkers had to write quarterly reviews on your performance, so you couldn't even be open with them.
6. **You can't treat it as just-a-job - it's your DREAM!** You're forced to be fake too. You have to act like this is your passion, not just something you do to get paid - even when you're so bored you want to fall asleep at your keyboard. You won't be hired unless you say this is your true calling and act accordingly. The cognitive dissonance is frustrating. 
7. **Boredom is worse than you think**. David Graeber's book, [Bullshit Jobs](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-bullshit-jobs/), discusses this elaborately. It's proven that extended periods in solitary confinements, the extreme example - an ultimate state of boredom, causes *brain damage* to prisoners. There's a famous research about how humans - even babies - enjoy play because they like when things they do have some visible consequences in the world, even if small. Humans need to feel like they're doing something useful to themselves, or to someone else, to build their self esteem. There's something inherently frustrating about spending hours composing some report, because that's how your team does things, only for it to be filed away and knowing NOBODY read/used it.
8. **It's your life you're wasting away.** Same as any job, you're wasting what little time you have in this world on doing nothing.

473,A nice surprise on my new workplace,"Just started working for a new company this week, and their drug policy really surprised me.

Every other company I've worked for has had the same old drug policy. ""It's illegal so you can't come to the office intoxicated, and oh, since it's illegal we will drug test you at random because, you know, we don't want any druggies here at this fine institution"". 

But at this new job they had a completely different approach. My employer basically said that he'd rather lose an addiction or problem than an employee. So they don't do drug tests here, it's just if other employees notice you are all scuffed from the meth binge you had last weekend that they will even think about testing you.

478,Just quit entrepreneurship with neurotic business partner and want to die now,"Sorry for long post.  TLDR at the bottom, but it is an interesting story.  


I got a call from a female friend a few weeks ago to meet up to discuss business opportunities so we wouldn't have to run this rat race for life.  I was skeptical at first, but the plan seemed legit and she seemed genuine.  We had a grand scheme of building our business and she excelled at a lot of the things I didn't, and I did the same for the things she didn't.  It was perfect and we were 2 physically attractive people in the health and beauty industry.  We worked for the same corporate company before and had a friendship since then, so she was not unfamiliar.  


We met up literally every night for 4-5 hours even after juggling my 3 day jobs.  We sat outside in the cold at starbucks strategizing our business and even brought fucking blankets for the outside of starbucks for when they kicked us out when they closed.  We took photo shoots and everything and I was so motivated, but i should've seen the red flags sooner.  


She is a bisexual with a lot of masculine energy and is a demeaning control freak who is constantly moody and high on weed and caffeine.  She would always explain her vision and then go on tangents which would make our meetings last way too long  and i'd try to bring her back down to earth to what we're actually planning.  Something tangible.  She'd get frustrated when I couldn't understand what the hell she was talking about and asked for clarity.  She'd talk about ""reverse engineering"" all the time and end up way into the future when I kept trying to pull her into WTF we have to do right NOW.     Most of the ideas I tried to contribute she'd think get impatient with, so I decided to just contribute in other ways while she did most of the work and I just showed up.  plus she was more business oriented than i was.  I thought maybe I wasn't understanding her vision, but she'd be full of oxymorons and Kanye West type ego tangents (Think MLM personality type people, but this wasn't an MLM).  


I talked to her about her miscommunication and her impatience and talking down to me.  She apologized and promised to work on it and we pushed forward.  We were even going to live in a HOUSE together!  it was so we can make a calculated business move constantly filming our business in our home environment and generating revenue off of it.  I am against moving in with women due to sexual tension in the living space (no sexism, just had bad experiences that were hard to get out of), but she was very butch to the point where she'd talk about how big her dick was etc. (constant ego talk that i shrugged off).  Plus, i was so depressed and in a negative mind space before this project that I was desperate for a change anyway.  


She ended up making a move on me literally pulling me into her room and asking me to make her cum.  I told her that if we're going to do business, we should not do this.  The reality was I was not attracted to her because she is way too masculine for me.  We agreed to keep it platonic.  This should've been a bigger red flag to me, but i still saw her as a cool butch bisexual and more like ""one of the guys"".  This incident is one reason why we met up in public from then on.  


Then today, we have another photoshoot and we were having fun on the ride there, then like a flick of a switch, she turns into a moody bitch.  her energy and attitude is just negative and she's telling me she's gonna flip if I fuck up.  I've already had this discussion with her about how she should be encouraging and uplifting and not demeaning and shit, yet here she goes again.  I try to get in my zen state and not let her disrupt me state of mind, but she ends up storming out the room with me and the photographer.  We proceed without her and she comes back and flips out again.  This pisses me off to the point where I end it all right then and there.  I tell her i'm done.  


On the way driving her back, i tell her about her attitude and how we already had this discussion and this was supposed to be fun, but I can't do business with someone like her.  She says she's always taking control and she doesn't want to, I tell her whenever i do she fucking shoots me down!  Then she attacks my masculinity saying she needs someone with a BIG DICK to DOMINATE.  I immediately see that all this time she was fucking instinctively shit testing me and trying to mold me into some macho alpha male that would tame her and take control of her.  I tell her it seems like she wants me to be someone else and i want her to be someone else and we can no longer do this, because she is a headache.  She goes off on more talk that doesn't make fucking sense and I start to realize she is literally neurotic and undiagnosed with some type of personality disorder.  I drop her off and realize that this is over and i have to go back to my shitty work life next week with no other current plan out of this rat race.  I was so emotionally invested in this project that I feel depressed that it ended and want to kill myself going back with no end in sight.    


TLDR: ex coworker (masculine butch bisexual caffeine &amp; weed addict) calls me to start up a business.  I'm skeptical, but she convinces me.  We meet up 4-5hours a night planning and executing our business for the last few weeks and plan to move into a house together to film said business to create content.  She constantly talks down to me and is a control freak, then weirdly hits on me. i reject her, we push forward with strictly platonic business goal.  During photoshoot, her attitude gets worse and she has a tantrum and i immediately quit.  I have moment of clarity that she is neurotic and was looking for a guy with ""BIG DICK ENERGY"" (her words) to tame her and out alpha her (which go figure, guys typically DON'T like).  I start the same bullshit work schedule next week and I'm depressed and feel like killing myself with no current goals to look forward to working on to escape this fucking rat race once again back to square one.",False,dh8f4r,DarkHumorDark,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/dh8f4r/just_quit_entrepreneurship_with_neurotic_business/,21,11
479,Returning to work after time out due to depression and suicidal thoughts,"So some time ago I took sick leave due to depression and suicidal thoughts (I even posted about this on this subreddit when I initially did that).

Tomorrow I am going back to work. I do not feel ready at all, I still feel messed up. I can't stand to face the toxic environment at work, it was this environment that lead to me taking that time off. Just for some context, some of the senior staff have lied about me which lead to some serious problems for me. Even after I protested this I was told its my word against hers. My line manager knew I already go to a psychologist due to some mental issues I already have and still felt the need to be so overly critical to me over such small issues like for not taking in a notepad to a meeting. Some of the staff also snitch on me on very small things like leaving 15minutes early. Amongst other stuff I have to deal with. 

I was ready to hand in my resignation last Friday, but due to some unforeseen circumstances I am going to have to delay this. I have no idea by how long. I just hope I don't fully crack and do something regrettable before I am able to hand in my resignation. I can't begin to imagine the relief I will feel when I hand in my resignation. 

When I see my friends at work who I care about deeply hand in their resignation to pursue a better path I get really happy for them.

         The first time I used this was for a job as a busser I got it . The job was awful tho it really hurt my back later that week I started applying to more jobs I got a quick call back for a big retail store temporary stocker I took the interview and got the job I didn’t show up to work the next day at the busser job. 
         I made a mistake with the new job tho I put all day availability it’s bad for two reasons because they might put me to unload trucks early in the day, I unloaded one day and I was really bad so they put me back on online pick up two hours later, and also I owe them a commitment now for the times I can work. 
          It’s been a week now at my new job then I get a call for a interview for a smaller retail store this job is also temporary but I feel like I would stay past the season here I go because I want to test out the strategy again I get the job I put my availability after 3 . 
          Back at the big store job they said they will cut my hours this week to keep a budget and because I’m new and some other people with me are new. 
          So this week I’ve been at the small retail store it’s a good job but I don’t really like cashiering and at the bigger store I stock and do buy online which I think is better . 
          My manger at the small retail is really nice . And my manager at the big one is a bitch but if I show up on time and stay out of her way I won’t have that much problems with her, I’m thinking about keeping the big retail job .
          Apart of me wants to keep them both out of guilt of not disappointing people but I don’t like working period and working two jobs will be worse, plus I already said all day availability at the big store so I can’t even if I wanted to.

492,My funemployment plan isn't working out very well,"After years of being pressured to excel in school and to get a good job, I feel that I have lost the ability to enjoy life and to even understand what makes me happy.

In my first few days of unemployment, I got so stressed out because the new hire, my boss and my ex-colleagues kept messaging me with questions even though I am no longer getting paid. This is what happens when my bosses gave me too much work in my final week and still expected me to handle the entire handover process. There is only so much a person can do.

I am thankful that I managed to escape from that toxic environment. Now I am overwhelmed by the free time on my hands. ""What do I do with it?""

At first, I envisioned a ""funemployment"" period in which I could finally restart some hobbies like reading, exercising and cooking. I overestimated my passion for life and it turns out that I am now apathetic to everything. Even small chores take away too much energy.

People be like ""Oh, keep applying for jobs!"" and ""Upgrade your skills during this time!"". Our lives revolve around building ourselves into better workers and to be enslaved to employers. Every responsibility is being shoved onto the individual. If you fail, it's your own fault. Too bad you did not get a good enough degree in the right field, too bad you don't have the relevant skills and too bad you couldn't handle the work stress.

Sorry for this pointless rant. Yesterday night was tough because I was struggling with sudden suicidal thoughts. I feel sad about the fact that I am programmed to study and work.

496,"""He told me it was inconsequential and unimportant, and that it shouldn't be approved.""","LONG POST WITH A BIT OF RAMBLING

TLDR: My direct supervisor told my boss not to approve a day I requested off for a funeral on the premise of it being unimportant, and claimed I was a bad employee even though he makes me do my job and his own every day. 

Yall. I. Am. Livid. I work in manufacturing, and *fortunately* I seem to work for a company that cares about their employees. I've seen them move lots of people to easier positions when they had limitations, and they've been beyond accommodating to me and my disabilities. They're even changing my department again in a few weeks to be even more accommodating. The night shift plant supervisor (lets call him Jimmy) is a genuinely good guy, and we have a decent relationship. However, my direct supervisor (Frank) is a different story.

All week, Frank has had me doing not only my job, but also his while he sits in a chair and finds more ways to run the clock. I run non stop making sure the production line is fully stocked with materials. I don't have time to do his job (putting away inventory and repacking materials) on top of mine. I've done it since last Wednesday, and I just can't handle that pressure anymore. Today I told him that I wasn't going to do his job. Only my own. He took it pretty well and I went on my way. 

This brings me to the big issue. 

Two weeks ago, a family member in another state committed suicide. I told Frank that when we have the funeral in a couple weeks, I won't be work. Period. End of story. He was supposed to be working it out to get me removed from the schedule or for me to get a paid day of bereavement leave to attend the memorial so I don't get the automatic write up from our clock in system. He told me today that HR didn't approve the bereavement leave on the grounds of them not being immediate family (I didn't want the day paid, only unscheduled), but that it would be the Jimmy's decision at the end of the day. I made plans to talk to Jimmy about it when I got the chance.

Towards the end of shift, Jimmy had come over to talk to Frank who had been neglecting his job all night. Frank told me in front of Jimmy to manage the inventory put away, because he knew I wouldn't directly defy that in front of my boss. So, I did what I was told. When I got the opportunity I chased Jimmy down to talk to him about the funeral. 

I told him I knew it was ultimately his decision whether or not to remove me from the schedule for that day, but that bc it is family I won't be in regardless. I also asked him bluntly if I could get the day off. He stopped walking and said that Frank told him that I asked for ""a personal day for an inconsequential and unimportant reason"" and that he shouldn't approve it because I was not a good worker. He then showed me the email. 

I saw red. I told Jimmy that I needed to take a minute to calm down before I walked back to my department because I didn't want to do something that would get me fired. He told me that the day is 100% approved and asked how often Frank was making me do his work. Once I told him, he stopped again and asked me if I wanted to file an HR report. I told him I'd think about it and let him know by Monday because I'm taking today (Friday) off. 

I'm so ready to retire, and I'm only 23. Fuck Frank. Fuck work.",False,djlfpa,forgotmyabcs,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/djlfpa/he_told_me_it_was_inconsequential_and_unimportant/,8,13

509,My job is fine. It's wage labour as such I hate.,"I hate work. It is not because I don't like the tasks I get at work. Many of them are interesting and challenging. I also like my colleagues. They are nice and friendly people. My bosses are also nice, down to earth and has never given me any trouble for asking for time off for family matters. I work in a nice office only a few minutes bike ride from my home. I'm not burdened with huge work loads or tight deadlines. The pay? Well it's there and although it's not the kind of money that will allow me to pay off my student debt or retire before I'm dead at least it keeps abject poverty at bay.
I should be reasonably happy about my job. It is as good as I can reasonably hope for and many people have it significantly worse. But I still hate going to work.
I don't hate my job as such. It is the concept of forced wage labour I hate. It is knowing that I have to do it day out and day in. It is knowing that no matter how nice the bosses are the logic of capitalism will compel them to fire me if I'm no longer productive, hurling me into poverty and unemployment. It is knowing that ultimately I'm not seen as a human being with inherent dignity but as a cog in a machine that will be replaced if I'm not performing as wanted. It is knowing that I have to wake up each morning before I'm fully rested and go to work each and every day no matter how I feel about it.
It is knowing that I can only complain about it in obscure corners of the internet like this. Everywhere else a host of right wing troglodytes will emerge and shout abuse at me if I complain about work. It is knowing that the only viable alternative to wage labour is starting my own business which is even fucking worse than wage labour.
I know that we need to produce goods and services for society to function and I don't have a fancy detailed plan for what should replace wage labour and capitalism.

517,"Just came across this sub, wanted to hear your opinion on my point of view.","(Please read at least the tl;dr before commenting) 

So from what I can see you guys are against working for 'the man'. You see capitalism as being a system of oppression and slave labour.

I'd like to ask, what is the alternative? 

If everyone were to stop working there would be no food in your kitchen, no water in your tap and no power in your home. Someone's job is to maintain the Reddit server this post is stored on, someone's job is to make the computer or device you are reading this on. So my question to you good people is again, what is the alternative? 
If humanity automates every single aspect of our lives, what is left for us to strive for? Don't get me wrong, I am fairly anti-capitalist, hence why this sub has been recommended to me, but I still think we all need to do something that contributes to society, else I believe we will all end up aimless drug addicts with no sense of purpose (see idiocracy). 
Work has taught me so much in terms of discipline, commitment and self respect, yet if you had asked me when I was in school 'do you want to get up at 4.30 in the morning and spend 10 hours stacking shelves and mopping floors I would have said no. 
Having to work was one of the best things that has ever happened to me, and it is only because of having a job that I am now able to make the most of my time on this earth and hopefully go on to make my mark on the future. I think in this day and age we should not have to work nearly AS MUCH as the people in charge seem to think, but I also believe that abolishing the need to work at a job you don't particularly want to do is an even worse idea than working too much; for society as a whole and for the individual who has yet to develop a sense of purpose. 

Tl;dr
You see a utopia where everyone is free to indulge their passions, I see a dystopia where everyone exists in virtual reality 24/7 with an IV drip full of heroin. So people of r/antiwork I ask you:

518,"Your Time, Their Entitlement","I know this topic has been covered before by books like Bullshit Jobs, but I'd like to make my own points and observations about this. 

As we all know the eight hour day is borderline abusive to both physical and mental health in human beings, and yet employers insist on it to ensure the most legal production possible. We'll ignore how this is a factual fallacy and employees are markedly less productive during an eight hour day. What I want to talk about is how employers enforce these eight hours and *why* they enforce them.

Just as in my previous quasi-essay post, ""The Orwellian Workplace"", I'll be taking examples from my own workplaces and applying them as practical representations of the behavior of employers. 

This entire week (Thursday to Thursday) my boss was on a vacation with his family, leaving me (the only other worker in the office) alone to deal with the day to day business. Now, without his intense oversight I was able to relax significantly more, portion out my work, and complete everything necessary within the first half of the day, every day, leaving me little to do in the second half. However, I miscalculated and was today informally reprimanded as he felt it necessary to monitor my station with keystroke tracking software. Obviously this was and still remains a serious ethical issue that is mercilessly protected by law, but the question remains: why did he care? Everything that needed to be done was done, I met the necessary quotas, so why did he care if I wasn't working extra?

That is a very simple question to answer: entitlement.

As much as the rich enjoy calling the working class entitled and ungrateful, the truth is very much the opposite. Your boss believes they hired you for eight hours and they will demand those eight hours out of you. To them, it doesn't matter that you've worked what they asked, their money, to them, is a reward they bestow upon you for being a good helper monkey, a privilege you should be grateful for. Employers believe that, once they begin paying you, they own your time. That your time is no longer yours and is theirs to control, and that you have to dance to the tune. 

This may not be the conscious thought of every employer, but the underlying psychology is the same. Because they are paying you by the hour, they believe that it does not matter how efficient you are in your work, so long as you work for all eight hours. 

Of course, the opposite of this is true. Without you giving up your time to produce for them, they would have nothing, and this is something we, as workers, have forgotten. At any moment I could stand up and leave and it won't matter any more how many hours I worked, he'll be shit out of luck with nothing to do but scramble to replace me. 

In closing, I would like to remind everyone that we have the power as workers. If you are the sole worker in your department, if you're the leader of a group that others rely on, if your job is unique, you have the ability to stand against these abuses and remind your boss who is supporting who, even on your own.",False,dj7efs,PigMasterHedgehog,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/dj7efs/your_time_their_entitlement/,3,44

Its one thing to hire someone you know because of their sought-after skills and proven experience; its another to hire your child or spouse to do jack shit just because they're related to you... 

I feel particularly awful to my core knowing my college studies for a degree in the field I'm working in and past experience in the field I'm working in means practically nothing when my compared against a relative of the owner who has not gone to college for something related to the field we're working in and also does not have experience in the field we're working in.

&gt;While the term still carries stigma, Kato believes it’s useful to examine as an emerging cultural phenomenon. In the West, depression is often seen as a disease of sadness that is highly personal. But in Japan, it has long been considered a disease of fatigue caused by overwork. The traditional depressed patient has been a “yes man,” someone who always acquiesces to extra tasks at the expense of his social life and health. What makes modern-type depression different, according to Kato, is that patients have the desire to stand up for their personal rights, but instead of communicating clearly they become withdrawn and defiant.  
&gt;  
&gt;Clinically, this type of behavior first started to appear with some frequency in the work of Shin Tarumi, a colleague in Kato’s department at Kyushu University. In the early 2000s, Tarumi noticed that some of his younger depression patients, particularly those born after 1970, had an entirely different personality profile than traditional depression patients. They didn’t try to maintain harmony at the expense of themselves, and they had less loyalty to social structures. Instead, they avoided responsibility. They tended to fault others for their unhappiness.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Modern-type depression patients, Kato believes, are in an uncomfortable limbo state, trained to be dependent in their family and social lives and unclear how to adapt to a quickly evolving company culture that asks them to be more assertive. While they want to speak up for themselves, their ways of going about it are ineffective and immature.  
&gt;  
&gt;One patient Kato introduced me to was a 34-year-old engineer. At first, the engineer was happily employed at a government office, but he says he was transferred against his wishes to another known for its long hours. He repeatedly asked if he could be moved again, but his supervisor told him it was impossible. He lost his motivation. Months after he started asking, he was finally granted the transfer, but it was too late for him to snap out of his withdrawn state.

Well, when I got into work yesterday, there were fliers up advertising my shifts as a new opening. After I clocked in, a different manager took me aside and told me that I was being fired and that I could either resign right away, or I could wait to be formally fired by the head manager (the one who threatened to fire me, turns out she decided to fire me then and they just never informed me) when she gets back from her holiday in a week. They cited that this was the third strike in the 11 weeks I had been there, the other two instances I was late by 10 and 12 minutes for reasons out of me control. (They ignored that every single other shift I was between 5 and 15 minutes early)
I am just sick of caring about jobs that dont care about me. I really fucking tried there. I worked faster and better than the people who've been there years, but all I accomplished was making the company slightly richer and I get thrown away like fucking garbage. This was in guildford and I can supply more details to prove that it happened. I joined our union a couple weeks ago, so I'm gonna get a representative and just waste as much of their time with meetings and bullshit as possible.
This would be illegal if I was an employee, but you're not technically an employee until you've worked there 12 weeks. 
The actual incident last week was that I caught the flu and informed them that I wouldn't be able to work, but could still come in if they want. It was at 8am, when my shift started at 10.",False,dk5q6o,MidnightBlake,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/dk5q6o/i_was_fired_for_being_sick/,38,179

591,a follow up on 'work struggle sessions',"a few weeks ago I posted that we're trying to organize small, local based talking groups with a few beers where people talk about their work, can vent and reflect on the systematic issues related to work.

so far we had two and two more offshot-groups started specializing in given industries, and from initial reactions it's a tremendous success!

where I live is not a very pro-social culture. people are rude in general and are rude to strangers, but when you get strangers to talk about their work and their experiences, which leads to talking about their personal lives, their parents, their coworkers, whatever, it opens the fucking floodgates. I'm not saying they leave as friends, but it does act as sort of a collective stress-relief and people want more and more.

With that being said, we did find a couple of faultlines: the working class is in itself not just separated by trade, but also by corp hierarchy. There's people who are closer to the upper echelons who will have a very difficult time transitioning into any form of solidarity, there's a fair number of cynical people, and we're looking at ways to transform the groups so they're more forward looking lest they just sink into a hugbox. Sector-based orientation seems like a good idea, as this type of activity builds up at least professional contacts so you can ditch if your job already sucks or find out ways how people in the same sector are fighting for better conditions.

With that being said, I can totally recommend trying to start your own group. We don't moderate ours strictly, just have a couple of pointed questions on where do you work, what do you do (explained to a five year old), and people will mention a LOT of struggle related topics, of boss overreach, shitty behavior, survival strategies, fight-backs. Fight Club mood comes when you ask people about their parents jobs, individual education contra parents education, job vs education and so on.

Take this forum 'offline' and local based if you can. It fights alienation better than just staring at the screen, and it can build real community.

(We're also experimenting with taking the talked-out experiences and giving them online platforms - reddit and similar platforms are not that popular here, we're still stuck in the blogging era, but talking about the actual matter and problem with work REALLY drives readers.)

614,An antiwork success story.,"A few years ago, I was like many of you. I hated my job, the thought of going in and doing the same thing over and over again for 12 mind-numbing hours a day, 5-6 days a week, gave me nightmares. It had me sitting outside work breaking down. My mental health was bad, I had no semblance of a social life and every week I thought about ending it all. I hated the fact that I couldn't see any way out of this hole that I had gotten myself in for the next 40-50 years. One particularly bad day I made a decision, there and then. I simply thought to myself;  ""Fuck this, enough is enough"" and went in and quite my job on the spot. It was the best decision I've ever made. Admittedly, for a couple of days I was beside myself with worry. I was thinking to myself; ""What the hell am I going to do? How am I going to survive."" That's when I decided to be proactive and reorganise my life to the way I wanted it to be. I went back to college (Thankfully, something that's free in my country). There I took a course on music production. A subject I was always interested in. But, while I was at college I also decided to get rid of all the ties that had been keeping me down in my life. I gave up my expensive flat and moved into shared accommodation, I paid off all my bills and got rid of any direct debits and credit cards. I paid off my overdraft and then cancelled it. I went back to basics. I removed myself as much as possible from the pursuit of material possessions as I could. I don't care about owning the latest gadget or newest clothes. I reduced my life down to the necessities; Food and shelter. I went from paying out £1500 every month to paying £200. A couple of months into my course, and with my savings starting to take a hit, I thought I'd better go and find a part-time job to keep me ticking over. I got a job working the door of a local bar. It was 4 hours a night, 3 nights a week, 9pm - 1am. This easily paid for my reduced living expenses and still left me with an enormous amount of free time and money to study, play music or just generally have a social life again. I started loving my life and the 12 hours a week I was working were great. Eventually I got interested in DJing and it just so happened that the local DJ in the bar I was working in was planning to leave soon. I asked the boss if I could take over for him as I had all the equipment, and he said yes and that he was actually going to ask me the same thing himself. So, here I am, 7 years later, still doing what I love every week. I work on the door every Saturday night, DJ every Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. I work no more than 16 hours per week and get paid a ton of money. I'm loving my life and am infinitely better off financially and mentally. The moral of the story, i guess, is put yourself into uncertain situations and always try and learn new things. The best thing I ever did was walking in to work that day and say ""enough is enough"" while quitting on the spot. It lit a fire under my arse and made me reevaluate my life and what I want to do with it. No job should have you sitting in the carpark crying at the though of having to spend a minute more in its employment.

615,Spending 6-8 hours a day doing any one thing day after day is insane.,"I think people realize spending too much time on one thing thing is unreasonable. ""You spent 5 hours playing video games? Get a life."" ""You spend 4 hours a day reading? I can barely read for an hour."" ""You spent 3 hours at the gym? Wow you're a gym rat dude."" ""You spent 12 hours on that drawing? Thats a long time!""
 


These things are all hobbies, and yet we're shamed for spending too much time on them, and not enough time at work. I spend 6 hours a day with a boss who i hate and a fraction of that time with my boyfriend who im often too tired to interact with in a very meaningful way after work. 



On a slightly different note, even passions can grow tedious after too long. I like drawing and video gamrs, but if you asked me to sit down and draw or play the same game for 6 hours it would get difficult. Even if its a very good project or game, after a couple of days i would need a break. Yet, we are expected to work thousands of hours for years doing the same things over and over again. Its no wonder that people hate their work so much. Even jobs that i would be passionate about for a month would start filling me with resentment.

But even the worst of us in the shittest situations can end up smiling. Find that crazy within you and hold onto it because in this world, that’s the most sane thing about us.

634,I’m more miserable in a comfy office job than I was in the military.,"I wouldn’t say I’m anti-work per se, more anti - meaningless corporate zombie work. 

Short backstory for those who care:

I served 5 years in the military as an infantryman, which was infinitely more demanding than my current 8 hour a day, 5 day a week office job. However, I never felt this anxious, hopeless, and depressed while serving, even though I would spend full weeks/months sleeping outside in shit weather and working an average of 12 hours on a good day back in “the rear.” 

All politics of the Miltary industrial complex and imperialism aside, I felt I had a genuine purpose and knew my place in the world, and I had an intimate understanding of myself. I had a crystal clear understanding of what my tasks were for the day and what my role was in accomplishing a given mission. I also had a very strong community of people I actually considered a close family or brotherhood, as corny as that may sound, they weren’t just “co-workers.” And the shared hardships only served to strengthen that bond. 

Not to mention, if I wasn’t deployed I’d get 3-4 days off for a holiday (as opposed to just the single day) and 15-30 days paid vacations after deployments (post-deployment leave) 

Now, I sit behind a computer all day pretending to be busy, and have to pretend to care about the timely completion of a project to make some faceless rich person even richer while I can only hope for a slight raise after years of my life are dedicated to this. 

The motivation used to be life and death and winning wars, and I find it hard to muster up the willpower to behave with the same sense of urgency over useless corporate buzzwords and excel spreadsheets. I’m just desperately counting vacation and sick days until I can take my next short stint of artificial freedom from this endless cycle. 

I genuinely feel more imprisoned and consumed by my work than when I was in the fucking military for Christ sakes. This cannot be how humans were meant to live. This all feels so meaningless and I can barely find a reason to get out of bed every morning. I essentially get paid to act like I give a shit and it’s more mentally demanding than I ever would’ve imagined. 

Just needed to rant, thanks for listening if you’re still here.",False,df2bnz,BlackPillMerchant,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/df2bnz/im_more_miserable_in_a_comfy_office_job_than_i/,31,65
635,My boss's bitch,"I [28M] have been working at the same full time job for 8 months. The environment is an outdoor retail center which is open for 12 hours a day (7am-7pm), 7 days a week. When I started, the schedule seemed a bit random. 8 hour shifts, and you were picked to either open or close, with every other weekend off, and one weekday of your choice. 

I hated this schedule and looked for opportunities to advance, and I found them. I got promoted to a Mon-Fri position, 7am-4pm. This was great. I was making more money, had the schedule I wanted, had time during the day after work to unwind. I watched and observed as my co-workers suffered, having to forfeit all their daylight for the company. I watched 1 go, then 2, then 6... All without being replaced by the company's hiring staff. This lead to more responsibility being placed on my shoulders. Having to work the extra mile to make up for employees that were no longer there. Now, I've lost count of how many of my co-workers are gone, I've only been there for 8 months and out of 5 employees I have the 3rd most seniority.

Then one night 3 weeks ago it happened. The only employee we had left for closing just stopped showing up. The day after, my boss approached me with my new schedule. Closing. 5 days a week. As if I hadn't already had enough responsibility, now I was being told to forfeit my daylight. 

I expressed my concerns to the branch manager saying that ""I have obligations outside of work during those times that were set up after being told I had a 7-4 schedule permanently"" and the response was ""If you don't like it we'll fire you. It's only temporary though so just deal with it.""

Well, here I am... 3 weeks later still closing. It's affecting my social relationships, my well being and my life at home. There is another 7-4 position that opened up (another guy walked out of course) but it has even more responsibility and I'm not trained to do what he did. My boss assured me that it's the only way to get my original hours back.

They have what was my coworker on a pedestal for some reason (brown noser), she’s now my manager all of a sudden since my boss had a bitch fit because I told him I was unhappy with a few things (I thought we were mature enough to handle that). Objectively speaking, she’s not ready to manage so I know the change was to purely ‘put me in my place’.

Yesterday she literally repeated what I said and my ex line-manager (who is a dinosaur and thinks I’m his secretary because i work alongside him and I have tits but at the same time seems threatened by me, sigh) glared at me when I said it but when she did right after me he was like “exactly!!! Yes, you are so right there”. w...t...f.

Anyway, I would love to be frank in an upcoming review, nothing ranty just truthful instead of “things are going great! (they’re not), your changes have made such an improvement! (they’ve not)”. However, I’m thinking maybe I should just channel this frustration of being demeaned into actually applying for other jobs? 

I hate having to suck this office politics BS up. I have a lot more skills (technical and higher level of education) but they make me do admin for the dinosaur and have always filtered all the important tasks through to her. It won’t change, even when I produced better quality work they got annoyed at me because one of the CEOs didn’t like hers after. I’m just there as a back up for the dino.

650,Why do so many office workers hate their jobs? Try being a health care assistant...,"I see a lot of you office workers post. I just read a post where someone was basically complaining that they were bored at work for hours, with little to do...

I'm sorry guys -  but please give a thought to us lowly ""carers"", because I, for one, would sell my soul (or what's left of it) to have a job like that!

This past week as working for as an agency HCA, I (along with another girl) had to help an elderly man who threw wet tissues in my face, said digusting sexual things to the both of us workers, he went to grab at her breasts and he groped my bum. He then hit me on the arm. Delightful.

We helped a lady who had MRSA. Always fun helping people with illnesses that I can bring home with me.

I helped an elderly man have a wash then had to put his dirty clothes back on him and steal a pad from another person's room to give to him, because apparantly the nurses didn't give a shit about him in this nursing home. (He didn't have ANY pants or underwear - that's why I had to put the dirty clothes back on him. Nurse just said ""Well, it's his wife's job to bring those in."" I said ""Well, maybe there could be some in the laundry?"" She just ignored me and carried on writing.)

I got scratched on the face (good it missed my eyes) on my upper lip by an old lady during giving her personal care. Nurse did not give a shit, it seems.

I got scratched on the arm by another elderly lady and it drew blood. I asked Nurse if the lady was on a behaviour chart that I could write the incident down in. Nurse just shrugged and said ""That's just the way she is.""

&amp;#x200B;

I work for 12hr shifts. This is not ""rewarding"" or ""noble"" work. I am tired of smelling old people's piss and shit. I am tired of senile old people physically attacking me because they stink of piss and they don't want to have a wash. I don't care that they can't help it.

I need to get out of this work but at this point I can't lower my hours to train to do something else.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want people to know that out of all of the places I have worked in 7 years (and as an agency carer, that number is A LOT) I would say I have worked in 1, count it... ONE residential care home where the elderly people were looked after adequately (not well, just adequately) and the work load was managable for the workers.

Just the 1.

I have been doing this work for 7 years.

If you have family members or loved ones in a residential/nursing home I want you to know that behind the scenes, the level of ""care"" they are recieving is most likely NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

For example: In so many places I've worked Nurses and HCAs outright LIE about how much fluid intake, a resident has, for example. Because in the late morning when we are supposed to help keep people hydrated, we are either: A) still doing personal care on people or B) Finally getting our (late, as usual) break. I admit, if someone pressures me with ""Well, she had 200mls of tea in the cup on her table... I mean, she probably drank it all didn't she?"" I just now go along with it and say ""Yeah."" I lie too.

I've had a an elderly lady start crying because she was sat on her armchair and needed to go to the toilet. She needed a stand-aid to help her up and I was not allowed to di it by myself. (Must be x2 HCAs) It was the second time of me answering her call bell because she needed the toilet. 20 mins gap inbetween the calls. Everyone including me was giving personal care/busy with other people at the time. I said to her I'm so sorry you will just have to wait...

If you have family members or loved ones in a Home then please regularly visit them to make sure everything is okay with them because I am just telling you the truth that they have rushing, exhausted, starting-not-to-give-a-damn workers like me ""looking after"" them. It's the truth.

When it comes to that time for my own mother I will be looking after her myself for as long as I possibly can - and then a bit more perhaps. I would NEVER put her in a Home. I know what they're like.

656,"I started a business because a regular job would have been intolerable (due to autism, depression, &amp; anxiety). I keep exaggerating how much I've worked on it so people won't think I'm a loser. In reality, I'm too depressed to plug away at it right now.","Sometimes I feel like a bad person, but I remind myself that I've wanted assisted suicide for years. So I'm basically a slave, and it's natural for slaves to lack enthusiasm for their work. I may not contribute to society in the way it wants me to, but society forces me to live. 

My business isn't very time sensitive, so it's not all going to come crashing down on me. And my mom's not going to kick me out any time soon, so I'm not going to end up homeless from my listlessness. But people expect me to have a job because I'm not in school anymore, and it hurts too much to be judged, so I keep exaggerating what I've been up to. Sometimes I tell white lies, such as saying I worked on a blog post yesterday when I actually worked on it the day before yesterday. An old lady I help asks me if I'm getting clients, and the truth is that I'm barely looking for them. I keep making it sound like the fish just aren't biting when I'm hardly fishing. 

I walk with this old baby boomer guy at a park. He's from a different time and social class. His kids are all super successful, living in places like Los Angeles. He's never going to understand how much the world has changed or how different my life is from his. I suspect that he's judging me but won't say it. I keep exaggerating and telling white lies to him, too, but I don't know how long I can keep up the illusion that I'm very productive.

I feel like a bad person for studying philosophy in college. I feel like I have to make excuses for why I did it, like I owe people an explanation for why I didn't choose a major that would mold me into a STEM-bot. I graduated without debt thanks to a state scholarship and the PELL grant. I tried vocational majors, and they just made my future look darker. And I dropped out of an electrical engineering program because a teacher refused to use male pronouns for me even as testosterone changed my appearance and voice. The humiliation was unbearable, so I gave up on that career path entirely. It never actually appealed to me to begin with.

Philosophy is actually my passion, so much so that my teachers chose me as this year's recipient of my university's philosophy award. I keep fantasizing about working on a philosophy book I want to write. It's about a religion I've invented - a fusion of Christianity, Hinduism, and religious pragmatism - that I believe would make society a better place and appeal to a lot of people. I think about it obsessively every day. I feel like it's my calling, though I don't really believe anyone's here for a purpose. I can just feel that the book is where my heart really is, but it would be extremely time-consuming to write, and it's impossible to predict how well it would sell. Monetization ruins some things. I don't want to change my message to make it more palatable to buyers. I want to say something very specific.

I try to add some philosophy to my business blog posts, but I can only say vanilla things, and that's demoralizing. I really just want to write my book, but I'm unlikely to make much money from it and would feel guilty for spending so much time on a non-monetized activity.

7 AM. alarm. My sleep is interrupted 3-4 times per night due to noisy neighbours, paper thin walls and workers who get up at like 5 AM or even earlier. I can't afford better housing unlike CEOs in their mansions.

9.30 AM. I arrived at my office. 30 minutes late due to traffic.

1 PM. Went for lunch with my colleagues. Everyone just ordered a quick meal and skipped drink while stressing how much work is ahead of them. I ordered a drink and took my time with my meal. My stomach is already pretty bad and I don't want to make it worse by quickly munching on some cheap food and racing back to the office.

3 PM. Came back from lunch. I was told our project manager was looking for me and I should report to him immediately. Got assigned a few ""priority"" tickets. Seems like every ticket is urgent these days.

7.30 PM. Time to go home. Our office is still packed despite all other places long shut down.

[8.PM](https://8.PM). Finally made it out after quickly resolving a problem with my commit.

9 PM. Arrived at home. My head hurts so bad due to severe sleep deprivation. I immediately put on noise cancelling headphones to block out the thumping noises from my upstair neighbours.

11 PM. I finished bathing, a little bit of apartment cleaning (I have a cat so there is always some mess waiting for me. But I love him and will never give up on him.)

Midnight. My hobby is art and there is an ongoing challenge called inktober. I am supposed to draw a piece per day following the official prompt list. I can barely hold a pen and my eyes are so heavy... I inserted earplugs so I can be woken up only 3-4 times during night instead of 10 and skipping meal, went to bed.

682,just a few thoughts on commissions.,"So  I want to share my three bad experiences with earning commission as a fire protection technician.  In all three situations the commission was a  factor in negotiating a lower than average pay rate. I'm curious to see  if this is an issue in other fields (I'm sure it is), but I'm really  interested in how commissions work in a perfect situation. Ok, here we  go:

Side note - It's going to seem  like I'm speaking ill of fire protection companies, and I am, but from  what I've heard my experiences are the exception, not the rule.

First  was a job fixing and selling fire extinguishers and emergency lights.  I  took the job for $16/hr and 5% of all NEW fire extinguisher sales over  $3k. For reference the most common F.E. we sold was about $60.  This  seemed sort of nuts, but the hiring manager assured me that with the  volume of work it would be no problem.

What  he didn't tell me was that if you had a bad month, the next months  sales would go toward making up the difference. So if you made $2k in  January, you had to make $4k in February to break even.

The  real issue is that a fire extinguisher has to look pretty bad to  replace it with a new one, otherwise if it lost pressure or was out of  date we would just replace it with a used extinguisher for a more  customer friendly price.  Basically the cylinder itself would have to be  compromised beyond repair either with rust or a good sized dent or  gouge, and even then you still have to convince the customer to buy from  you rather than home depot.

So I  quickly found myself way behind considering I was new to the field and  had about two weeks of training.  I started asking around for advice and  found out that a lot of these guys would do some shady stuff to make  their numbers. Some guys would lie and say the building didn't have  enough extinguishers, others would smash them with hammers or damage  components until it was more economical to buy a new one, but the  consensus was that you had to hustle and cut corners if you want that  paper, so I left.

I found another  job doing the same thing but this time it was $17/hr and the commission  was 7% of all SALES AND SERVICES over $22k, 10% over $27K, and 15% over  $30k. Now I knew from the last job that the money was in the service,  and I knew my last month at the last job I made $25k in service. This  was a good deal!

After a month of  training I was killing it. First month: $800 commission, second month:  $1000, all earned honestly, and all customers were happy. BaBoom!

Then  the boss' two brothers, both employees of the company, are BOTH served  with divorce papers within a month of each other (don't feel bad, if  they wanted to stay married they shouldn't have been pricks).  So facing  financial hurricanes, they asked for more money and so the boss made  them techs. Fine. But I then come to find my schedules are getting  lighter and lighter and my commissions are dwindling.  They went from  the $1000 range to the $200 range, and then nothing.  I had days where I  had 9 hours to do about 3 hours worth of work, and the rest of the time  was just spent in the truck or running errands for the boss.

I  come to find that the boss was just giving them the good jobs, making  them a ton of money, and just screwing the rest of us. Cool beans. So I  and a few other guys ended up leaving, and I found another job.

Third  job: this was doing extinguishers AND fire suppression systems in  kitchens and spray booths for $18/hr and 5% of everything over $22k.   They assured me that I would be in charge of my schedule, they assured  me that every month they give out bonuses in addition to the commission  for the top earners, and they assured me that I would get 30% of all  emergency service. Hell yeah, I can't go wrong here.

So  the week I start working they decide they don't trust the techs to make  their own schedule.  Fine, I'll just tell them to load me up with work.  They then decide they want us to spend more time on these jobs to make  the customers feel better. Ok, I'll just be thorough at these places,  and really look for things I can fix to make sure the place is perfect.  It turns out that the majority of these places are chains, and the  contracts stipulate that I need special approval for any work outside of  a basic inspection. Then it turns out the top three earners at the  company are the managers golf buddies and they get first dibs to go back  and do the work that I quoted. So I am out there doing maybe 4 jobs a  day making less than $500 towards my numbers a day, and they get to  vulture my high paying jobs that I did the leg work on.

In  the last months at that job I found out that whenever a customer calls  to complain about the price of a service, the manager automatically  discounts it, which affects my numbers. I also found that I make %30 of  emergency calls UNLESS the problem is our companies fault, which was  almost every time.

Phew, if you  guys made it this far thank you so much for reading my rant.  The fact  that this is a super whiny post is not lost on me, I just want people to  see the games that some companies will play.  I would say that after  these experiences I can't possibly be surprised anymore by garbage like  this, but I'm sure I'll eat those words.

So  yeah, share your experiences with commissions or whatever frustrating  work stories. I will leave you with a quote that my dear mother told to  me after all of this had already happened. Thanks mom.

684,I love my minimum wage job and it's improved my mental health,"Not sarcasm. My previous job, I earned 150% what I earn now, I worked 60 to 70 hours a week, was hardly ever home in my own bed, worked outside year round in Northern Canada for weeks straight. It ruined my ability to maintain friendships, the days off that I had I spent catching up on errands and chores etc. I quit because mental health was getting worse and worse. Moved home, spent nearly a year constantly suffering and self hating, hurting myself, drinking, alone, hopeless. I am still struggling a lot but I got a dog and a job and things are improving. 

My dog of course helped a lot. The job helped a ton as well. I make minimum wage working retail full time, I do sales in a niche hobby I love. So i get to talk to people all day about my passion. I have much more purpose and excitement to learn more, social skills improving, it makes me happy to help others and have conversation. My coworkers and managers are excellent and caring. I honestly love my job. Having a schedule, money, purpose  socialization has improved my life. It hasnt cured my core issues butnits certainly helping, i dont even care that its paying less.

I have several roommates because i live in an expensive area and cannot afford to live alone unless I was making much more money.  Even if i had the money, I don't have that type of credit.  Instead,  I live with roommates and one of them has a psycho LOUD and annoying girlfriend.  The guy is cool ""enough"", but socially awkward and kind of annoying because he can never pick up cues that i don't want to talk ie, me always wearing earbuds around the house, giving short answers, etc.  i always have to end up telling him i'm not in the mood to talk.  I know I put up a fucking wall and it's kind of assholish of me, but he has so much awkwardness and loud energy sometimes and i can't have any deep conversations with him because he is naive, not to mention i don't want to talk at 6am in the fucking morning.

690,Working with authoritarian women as a woman and work trauma,"I have to share what it's like to work with bossy women as a woman, or at least for me. Very long post ahead.

I have a history of jobs that completely took advantage of me or were downright evil especially because of the women in positions of authority.

My first job was at a Tim Hortons 7 years ago, but I got bulied by the cool kids working there and got fired for asking a question about the right kind of lid to put on lattes (which I barely ever had to make bc who tf drinks lattes from Tim Hortons anyway). The female supervisor deemed my question stupid because I should have known that, as someone who had worked there for barely three months and only 16 hours a week with no decent traning. But you know. That whole experience was enough to traumatize me, age 16, from working. I later learned that the bullying stemmed from the coolest of the cool kids because she was in love with my best friend and was jealous of me. So my main bully was some jealous girl and the one who got me fired was her best friend's sister. 

I then got a job at a grocery store, but I was extremely cautious at this point. I didn't trust my female coworkers, but I quickly realized that I wasn't going to be bullied this time. I had a great time adjusting to this environment after that. It was 90% female, but I generally got along with everyone. I can't say that I experienced anything outrageously wrong after 4 years of employment. 

I tried a new job as a receptionist for a popular hotel chain. It was during the summer and I was still working at the grocery store on the weekends, but at the hotel during the week. The woman who hired me told me that there was a chance I'd also work in the kitchen. Being a receptionist was a dream to me because I had been working with food for 2 years and I was tired of it (an understatement). I reluctantly said that I wouldn't mind occasionally working in the kitchen, hoping that it wouldn't prevent me from being a receptionist. The woman (let's call her Karen) had a face and a demeanor that I couldn't trust. I ended up working as a receptionist for ... 4 days. They trained me for the kitchen the week after. I then got scheduled for one more week in the kitchen. I got really suspicious that they didn't need an additional receptionist because they began significantly cutting some of the receptionists' hours. After yet another scheduled week of working in the kitchen, I knew that they didn't need me at the reception and that they had hired me solely for the kitchen. I was extremely frustrated, but struggled to quit because it meant returning to the grocery store full-time after being so close to my dream job at the time. So I sucked it up.

Then they (Karen) did the most fucked up thing ever. At closing time, I was told by my kitchen boss, Nancy, to clean the tables while she sweeps the floor. I found that strange because she had never separated our tasks like that before. We would usually do it simultaneously. It's worth noting that only the two of us worked in the kitchen during the week. The next day, I got called into Karen's office after my shift. She sat me down and patronisingly told me that I wasn't the best fit for the job. I told her that I didn't want to be in the kitchen and that I was supposed to be a receptionist (even though I had expressed it before). She diverted the conversation to my eyelashes by complimenting how long and pretty they were (WTF!). She used that distraction to bring up the pictures that she had taken of the floor the day before. It was especially dirty and she told me that it was unacceptable. I tried explaining that I only cleaned the tables, but she wouldn't hear it. She actually reprimanded me for accusing my coworker of my own mistake, which I wasn't trying to do. Just like that, I was asked to go home. I was fired. 

For a long time, I couldn't wrap my head around what happened. I went up to my boss at the grocery store crying, telling her that I had just been fired and that I would therefore stay. She told me she had a suspicion that it wouldn't work out. A shitty thing to say to someone who was just fired, by the way. I obviously can't say whether Karen orchestrated the whole thing just to fire me, but it felt like it was done on purpose. It was too coincidental, with Nancy telling me not to do the floor that day... I don't know. I'll never know the truth.

I ended up staying at that grocery store for 2 more years. I quit in November of 2017 because I was moving out of my dad's in December. I was a uni student desperate to find a better job than retail and the horror of boomers complaining about the prices of food I have no control over. All my attempts at hotel applications failed and I worked at yet another grocery store for a few months at the start of 2018. Nothing too dramatic happened, but my two coworkers were male, so I didn't get many interactions with women.

After 3 months, I finally managed to get a job at a hotel. A Fairmont hotel, too. I wasn't a receptionist though. I was working for what they beautifully call *Royal Service*. It's basically an on-site phone assistant that takes room reservations and room service orders, amongst other things. The female supervisor there was fucking awful. A French woman who was so stern and stuck up. She was always yelling at me for the most minor things. I got in trouble one time when it wasn't my fault at all. We had to report on what happened during our shifts, so any information that would be relevant for our coworkers the next day, in a ""pass-on"". It was an email that we had to send at the end of our closing shift around midnight for the following morning. My male coworker and I were doing the closing shift, but when I left, we had nothing written in the pass-on because it hadn't been busy. He was staying an hour more after I left. The next day, my supervisor was extremely unhappy with the pass-on. She called me to her office (which wasn't at all private so the discussion took place in front of all 3 of my coworkers present) and scolded me for writing that ""nothing happened it was boring"" in it. I had no part in that because my male coworker had written it. She had fire in her eyes as she was telling me how disrespectful it was. I could feel her hatred. I told her I didn't do it. She didn't care. When my male coworker showed up that day, he didn't at all get the same treatment. He admitted to doing it and she simply told him not to do it in the future. No fire in her eyes. That was it. 

That event was just a clear demonstration of her bias toward me in a long list of unfair things under her supervision. Nobody liked her and people agreed that she had been unfair to me that one time. They went as far as to say that I was her personal scapegoat, it seemed like. She would scold me for the dumbest shit. We had so many stupid rules, too. It truly didn't make sense. I wasn't the only one getting yelled at repeatedly, but I seemed to have it the worst out of everyone.

That leads me to today. I have a data entry job and my ""boss"" is sometimes unbearable. She is an accountant who's very condescending and who also loves to yell at you in front of other people. I still struggle to find my feet around these kinds of women. I'm not confrontational, in case you didn't notice. I never know how to react and I prefer to keep my mouth shut and suck it up. I've always been like this.

 I have no idea what I did to all these women over my years of employment. I just feel like it's the nature of women being forced to work with other women. A man has never treated me like this. I'm way more comfortable around a male coworker or authority figure than I am around a woman in these same positions. I'm curious to know if anyone else had similar experiences. I'm sorry if this is stupidly long and pointless.",False,dfkice,annieduty,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/dfkice/working_with_authoritarian_women_as_a_woman_and/,16,17

692,1 Important Reason why Everyone is Always Tired From Work,"Let me tell you a secret.   
I bet you never thought of it, and if you did, you dismissed straight away, because it is cool to keep up with modern times.  
What am I referring to, exactly?  
Well let me tell you this secret.  
It's around us everywhere we work. Be it in a store, construction site or (and especially) the offices. You see it in traffic and busses and trains.  
It makes us tired, destroys our eyes, gives us headaches. Drains us of energy.

Are you ready for it?

It is the [BLUE LIGHT](https://www.alexfergus.com/blog/how-technology-blue-light-is-ruining-sleep-making-you-sick-fat-tired-and-how-to-fix-it) that comes from the ""modern"" energy efficient bulbs. All stocked up in mercury and other deadly ingredients.  
This [blue light](https://www.alexfergus.com/blog/how-technology-blue-light-is-ruining-sleep-making-you-sick-fat-tired-and-how-to-fix-it), besides the fact that it permanently damages our retina, keeping us in a constant loop of upgrading our prescription glasses, spending more money on adapting to our damaging health, by going to work and making money to pay for the glasses etc. The vicious Circle.

[Blue light fuc£s up our eyes.](https://i.redd.it/za1fcxibt3r31.png)

Alas, this light, makes you DEPRESSED, ANXIOUS and TIRED. [Read this article here.](https://www.alexfergus.com/blog/how-technology-blue-light-is-ruining-sleep-making-you-sick-fat-tired-and-how-to-fix-it)  
It depletes us of our energy and stamina. It destroys our CIRCADIAN RHYTHM. We go outside of the loop of being healthy normal human beings.   
What is weird? It's that the bulbs keep on getting MORE and MORE WHITE with each 2-3 years. When you are sitting in your office, it's like you are being kidnapped by aliens with that white light above your head.  
The cars have white lights, when you drive guess what: you get tired, faster. When you go by train/plane/bus - you get tired faster. 

Your computer that you work on, TV screen, even the PHONE is there to fuck up your circadian rhythm.

The overlords that keep us enslaved know this, and with their ""green agenda"" (while they pollute the earth to death with their gazillion rich companies), they force down our throats the fact that these bulbs are good for the environment.  Yet big corporations, have their offices lit up the entire nights, without a reason. Their offices are all with the lights ON. Doesn't that affect the environment? I guess not.

Hey, what about our health? That doesn't matter? It doesn't: because: we are here to produce money for the machine. WE ARE BATTERY. Once drained, there is no benefiting from pension. There is only death. You cannot expect to retire healthy and live long, when that would imply for you to get back the money you spend on the taxes/pension. 

Getting home fresh and not tired, would mean that we could have more stamina to think about our lives and how the system fucks us. BUt we can't.",False,dei6py,alexdd88,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/dei6py/1_important_reason_why_everyone_is_always_tired/,9,0

714,This. This is how hobbies and skills die. A bit of a rant on work if you like,"Had previous jobs, but my current one seems different. Really tired at the end of the day, unable to stop thinking about work even on the weekend. Have to have a weekend strategy now to get maximum weekend hours to do stuff. Dread going in, have the Monday Blues (or is it Sunday?) at the end of weekdays now. When I try to do something I enjoy, if it's after work, too tired to do it and/or performance suffers and if it's the weekend I feel like time is being wasted because I only have x amount of hours before I have to prepare to go to work all over again. Also find myself thinking is this the rest of my life? You may have a bunch of hours after work, but you've got no energy to actually take advantage of it therefore your actual life and hobbies die slowly.

To me the way  this is set up is all wrong. Not counting the whole, humans can't get work for a solid 8 hours a day (up to 1 hour's break)  because they're not machines and that the tech exist to fix many problems (let's see if I can remember my points since I thought of them days ago):

* If you decide you want to leave, because maybe you find it's not for you or something you look like the bad guy
* Want to work fewer hours, you look like the bad guy
* Turn down an offer, because maybe you knew it wasn't for you, you look like the bad guy
* If you feel deep inside somewhere in your gut that 9 - 5 grind isn't for you (if you consider that nothing in life is for everyone because we're all different then it stands to reason the 9 - 5 isn't either) you look like the bad guy

Stuff like this makes me increasingly wonder why have children if they're just going to enter the same system. You can't get their consent beforehand as to whether they want to be born and therefore join the system society has set up.

728,The job hunt is going to make me kill myself,"Hi all.  
I don't usually make posts like this so forgive me if I sound dramatic.  
I'm only 23 and I've been working my first job out of university for the last year and a half or so. It fucking sucks. I've been job hunting for the last 7 months or so and it's even worse than the first time around. I only took this job because it was the only one I could get, and they had so many idiot fuckos in this position before that the bar is set incredibly low for my performance. I make about enough money to live and no more, and that's only because I don't have a car and I'm still on my parents insurance (not for long, Dad will retire before I'm 26).  
I have struggled with depression and anxiety my whole life. I attended a very good school but I majored in English Lit and French because that's what I could do and I liked it enough which was more than enough with my mental illness. But upon graduating I had to take an hourly wage job working in an industry that I absolutely despise, and I'm surrounded by conservative assholes all day who have no respect for me. Also, the work I do is totally fucking pointless. It fills me with contempt to be working an utterly pointless job when there are so many real problems that need fixing and people who need help in the world. And with my commute stretching my 8.5 hour days to 10 hours, I feel like I am wasting my life.  
But the job hunt is what is really starting to do me in. I have submitted countless applications and at this point had a dozen interviews and it is only making me suicidal as fuck, I blame myself and hate myself so much. I start to get hopeful when I have an interview lined up and now when I get the almost immediate rejection I'm filled with the hopelessness and dread of being stuck here for the next 20 years, like so many of my colleagues have been.   
I've been told I'm pretty affable and I'm not horrible at faking the whole business enthusiasm thing. After going through so many interviews I've even gotten much better at them and know how to anticipate certain questions. I have an interview tomorrow for a remote position which is my ultimate DREAM but I am worried if I fuck it up and get rejected I will be plagued by a wave of depression, dread, and self-hatred so strong I will seriously hurt myself. Does anyone have any tips for how to get through the interview? Or self care tips for coping if it doesn't go well?

Recently, while walking through some unfamiliar cubicles, some woman had SOO many baby/husband photos hung up.

Perhaps I'm too morbid but I couldn't help but thinking, it's as if the photos were reminders, ""do not make waves -- do not risk it -- accept your manager's bullshit -- say 'yes' to extra work -- stay in the rat race -- learn to love your oppressors -- stay late -- be miserable -- healthcare is too important -- your family will go bankrupt -- do not reflect on how unsustainable our current cost of living is""..

Since I was little, I was drifting with no ""passion"" or ""goals"" through school  or more importantly, life, then after I was done with school, I started to look in the 8 year long abyss that is still my life to this day. I was suffering from social anxiety, back then I didn't know what it was called, but knew I had to get it checked because my performance  and health would suffer massively. Fast forward 8 years in (semi) isolation, I still live with my parents, have tried several therapists, psychiatrists who gave me meds, 3 internships  that didn't result in anything except the knowledge that I'm apparently not cut out for any career and all that amounted to me being more suicidal and hopeless than ever. You might say 3 internships aren't a lot and I would agree with you, however, doing those required so much out of me that each of them  are a little feat to me, besides coping with a bad life with forms of escapism everyone here knows, makes time fly scaringly fast. If anything those internships ingrained  into my head the importance of finding the right thing for me and not choosing the best from the worst options. Being 25 is not your ""oh, he's young and still finding himself"" age. It's the ""you should stand with both feet in life and get by on your own"" age. Yet, I'm a grown man who was left behind and falls back further every year.

 I always thought a career that fulfills me with joy is the way to go in life. Something that I could cling to and would pull me out of this quicksand of misery. Somewhere where I'm with like-minded people. At this point I'm not sure this romanticized version or at least some middle ground even exists for me. Over the years I developed this certain mindset about work. I tried to dissect work into pieces that I viewed as ""problematic"". For one, there are the working hours, the people who you work with, your duties, the salary, the actual way to and back from work, your private life and lastly, the toll it takes on your mind and body. So I thought it would be either what I envisioned or nothing at all, but   I still was unable to identify a clear ""passion"" or certain strengths within me that could guide me the way. Some people are able to do something on a daily basis, which every cell of their body is fighting against. I'm (un)fortunately not like most people so I can't do that.

771,The IRS is now only targeting poor people for audits since they can't afford to hire lawyers,"of Sternberg v
@elfsternberg

In a letter to Congress, the head of the IRS says that
rich people and their high-power lawyers make auditing
prohibitive expensive, so the IRS will target only poor
people who can't appeal until directed otherwise by
changes to the law:

Washington, of 20510
Dear Senator Den:

| write in response to a question you raised in my April 10, 2019, hearing in front of the
Senate Finance Committee. You asked about recipients of the Warned Income Tax
Credit (EITC) and why they may be more likely to be united than taxpayers accounted
for in the overall audit coverage rate.

The enclosed report explains the two different kinds of audit that IRS employees
conduct. It also provides information about EITC audit and audit of high-income and
high-wealth taxpayers and includes short- and long-term steps that the IRS and
Congress can take together to ensure that we have appropriately balanced audit
coverage across all income levels.

| hope this information is helpful. Since this will be part of the official hearing record, |
am also sending the report to Senators Bonnet and Cortez Last, who submitted
Questions for the Record on this topic, as well as to Chairman Grassley. Of you have any
additional questions, please feel free to contact me, or a member of your staff may
contact Menard Oursler Director Leaisiative Affairs. at 202-317-6985_

We have to change this mentality. Retirement should not exist. Living life at a leisurely pace is vital for people of all ages.

780,Corporate Language is Cringey AF,"I love when companies use the term ""passion for customer service"" in applications/training videos/workplace rewards. It truly shows how they're:

A) Super alienated from the material conditions of the working class, and/or
B) Using Orwellian psychology to attempt to brainwash their workers.

Let me make this clear: no one working an entry level job has a ""passion for customer service"". In fact, I'd assert that hardly anyone has a ""passion for customer service"". No one works at a grocery store because they love to be bitched at by boomers, and then proceed to make said angry self deserving boomer happy with free shit; we put up with it because we have to to pay the bills and literally not starve to death.

""Yeah I love being bitched at by boomers for something that isn't my fault. I feel accomplished when I'm able to make that expired coupon work"" said no one ever. 

So yeah, I can't help but get aggravated when I hear that retarded ""passion for customer service"" shit. The people that APPEAR to have a ""passion for customer service"" are people who are just really good at faking it and have a lot of patience.

I'd have a lot more respect for a company if they dropped the double speak and were honest. ""Hey guys, we know we don't pay you shit, and we know you hate this job, but let's just make these grumpy boomers happy so we can make some money and not collectively starve, okay?

788,Some thoughts and my current position,"These are just some thoughts that I would like to share. Also, if anyone has advice or a ""way out story"", I'd be glad to hear!

I don't hate-hate my job. It's fairly decent, medium pay, and I even get to work from home at least once a week (more in the future). The reason I like working from home is partly because I work very little. Still, every morning I'm absolutely dreaded to go to work (mind it's a 1h15min trip). Every day is a struggle and every week feels the same; mon &amp; tue suck, wed &amp; thu are ""fine"", friday work from home (yay!), weekend is usually fun. And there we go again.

I think this all stems from having not enough time to myself to enjoy things (gaming, doggo, …) or work on myself. I would love to have time for leisure, fitness, cooking, laundry, keeping the apartment clean, doing groceries, taking walks with my dog, … 
Put this in combination with me not being interested AT ALL in my job, the fact that my job does just about nothing for humanity or nature, and you have some depressing thoughts

The problem is my interests aren't very broad, so switching jobs is probably not a solution. The only solutions I see now are:
	- Keep going, suck it up as long as I can take it
	- Find something I'm willing to put 40hrs/week in
	- Switch to being a waiter part-time (I ""enjoyed"" working those as a student + more free time)
	- Do something about the 40hr work week
	- Kill myself
	
I've been going to a therapist for the past 2-3 months, and I do feel some benefits. He tells me my problem is looking way too far ahead (I'm dreading the 40hr week for 40 years). I think he's partially right, but I'm also just not willing to be just another cog in the machine doing something I'm not interested in and it sucking away my time as a living being. I truly believe that 40 hours is too much for a lot of people to have a happy life (this is my strongest opinion). My therapist tells me this is just a thought (as in ""everything is just a thought in your head""). I honestly see what he's saying, but I just can't get over the fact that I'm so angry &amp; helpless at this issue and why nothing is done about it

A lot of times I think there's a fundamental problem with me. If almost everyone does it, why can't I? But then reasoning kicks in again. None of this makes sense. We have everything we need to live, why do we still need to advance at the rate we are going at now? Countries want growth, but why is this only expressed in monetary values. A country's inhabitants are a major part of the country, why not strive for growth there? (on and on, you get the jist)

Note that I've ""only"" been working for a little over 2 years (I've done loads of student jobs though). Everyone said I would get used to it, but I'm not. I simply can't wake up happy knowing the day I have ahead of me.

 I'm struggling with ptsd and depression since a couple of years, life already feels worthless enough without the nonsense of doing some exhausting meaningless task all day long. Studying is what keep a bit of my sanity as I'm not totaly defining myself by the job I'm doing, I have something else for the moment. I'm not even able to study properly but going to my cours even if I'm failing is enough to make me feel that there is something else.

I panic more and more when I'm there, we don't even have the time to drink water while you're going medium rare near the stoves so don't even thing about taking a minute to breath.

801,A rant about a (sort of) fulfilling job.,"TLDR: Humans r shit, even good jobs suck sometimes, dealing with animal abuse and euthanasia is better than retail.

 So I work part time at my local animal control and I gotta say, as jobs go, it's the longest and the most satisfied I've ever been with work life. My coworkers are not (all) gossipy bitches, the management is (mildly) understanding and lenient, and the hours are (usually) very manageable with (reasonably) good pay. So overall, I can't complain. But once in awhile I still get this nasty sense that my job is nothing but cleaning up after other people's messes. Be it mistreatment of an animal, people unwilling or unable to euthanize animals themselves, people losing animals in stupid ways, irresponsible breeders, or just people not having a smidge of common sense. 90% of my job is because the human race is shit to the creatures they domesticated and brought into the world themselves. My coworker had to do six euthanasias yesterday for various reasons, some legit, some questionable, and is now at home drinking her weekend away. 
BUT I wouldn't trade this career for anything, because I've spent my time in retail and it is soul crushing on another level, and I never, ever want to go back to a job that is any less meaningful. I'm super scared that if I ever got fired I would never be able to find a job that was as good and I wouldn't want to continue living. Working with animals is my last haven of meaning in life.

I've dealt with depression/anxiety for 10 years and chronic pain for about 5. Probably had chronic pain earlier but y'know. I've been in my current job for 2 and a half years and I filed for FMLA about a year ago. With that I worked 30 hour weeks for a few months until my pain management was better, and since then I've worked 30-40 hours with usually taking unpaid time. I accrue about 3 hours of sick time every two weeks, and my vacation is gone for the year. 

I feel as though I got burnt out bad after 2 years in my first job after college, but I was making enough money to kind of afford quitting outright. Money went FAST though, and it took me months longer than I intended to find a new job. Things were sort of stable for a bit but lately I've been having more fatigue issues. I'm feeling burnt out and done. When I try to make up time and work 9 hours, I'm fucked the next day. I feel forced to be dishonest about the hours I actually work because I just can't do it.

I worry about losing my job a lot, or I worry I'm just going to feel forced to quit because of my health issues.  I couldn't find a part time job when I looked for one because I can't do a lot of things physically. I ended up as a dog walker for 20-25 hours a week for 3 months but my paychecks were horrible.

809,why do so many rooms/houses require you to have a full time job?,"Look, I get that you want someone who can pay the rent. No one wants to be left in the lurch financially. But it just seems so narrow minded to me and I suspect it isn't about whether or not the person can pay the rent. It comes from a belief that real, morally correct, responsible adults work full time. Like if you don't spent your whole life at work you must be a druggo loser who plays video games all day and never washes your dishes?

What's wrong with working part time? You know, having a sense of work life balance? My mum worked part time my whole childhood, raised me fine, didn't have debts, I had everything I needed and seven quite a few things I wanted! That's not even to mention there are people who work in alternative ways these days but definitely make enough money to make rent. Creative professions, freelance work, FIFO workers, etc.

When I finish my degree, I'll take a full time job if I have to, but if I have the option I'd prefer part time...because I'd like to, you know, have time for other things. Because my identity is made up of more than just work. Because we live in a beautiful wold and I want to enjoy it more than just for a few hours on the weekends between all my other errands.

Where I'm looking at moving the rent is NOT that high, wages are higher than average in my field, and having a degree I'm sure I'll be able to land one of these jobs and easily make rent while working part time, it'll certainly be more than I've ever had before. Yet I'm worried people won't want me as a housemate or to lease to me if I'm not working full time. It's just such brainwashing over this arbitrary standard, and this is why I hate work culture.

---

**43% of my callbacks have required hours of free work before the first interview**
 

Was just going over my numbers for my job search.


More and more employers want you to do some work before they even talk to you. It's always at least 2 hours, often quite a bit more, and if it's at their office you can add travel time and costs as well. A few times I've had the free work sprung on me AT the first interview, which I think is a very dodgy practice.


This is the kind of thing I mean:

https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/03/job-interview-work-assignments-free-labor.html


I agree with Alison Green that this is unreasonable. In the comments you can many stories of people who did the work and were completely ghosted afterwards. I've been there, and it hurts like hell.


It's fine to say that you should just pass on employers who want this, but if my numbers are any indication, that will deeply affect your job search. If you do the work, you could get wrung out pretty fast.


If I had done all the free work employers have tried to give me, it would have run to over 100 hours by now. And not easy work you can dash off. A lot of it would have been equivalent to university assignments you would spend weeks on. Magnify that out to all the jobseekers in the USA alone and it's a scary amount of free and fruitless labor being done by the unemployed.


To the jobseekers out there: Do you think this is acceptable?

---

On a more anti-work tip, I think this free-work-to-get-work trend is horrifying.

- 6 day work weeks 
- 7 day work week during holidays (No lie, USPS has contract with Amazon and can ship on sundays)
- Carry a load of a work mule
- Old tin can work vehicles that would always break down. One time parking brakes didn't work and vehicle literally rolled down street as I chased it down after dropping off package
- Management asking workers to clock out and continue working
- Dogs let me tell you about dogs. I had ptsd regarding dogs for at least a year afterwards. Several times I had to pepper spray loose violent ones.
- The heat, rain, freezing cold, pollution, etc.. didn't matter. You went out and worked
- Mailing into the night literally with head lamp and going through people's yards to drop off mail
- JUNK MAIL! Over 50% of the work load could be eliminated just be having a policy of no junk. One day a week we would get ad day where we had to load up 6 or 7 big parcels of local ads. Each mailbox was to get one.
- Rashes between thighs, feet burning, paper cuts, rubber bands snapping, shoulder &amp; back pain, you name it
- No reward for hard work. If you finished route early they would just go send you to help another
- Drunk citizens yelling at you, people filming you as they laugh watching a dog chasing you, harassing about if you got their paycheck, etc..

I literally thought the heat would do me in as I live in the south. However, it was actually the cold one day. It was pouring down rain in just about freezing temperature. I had a mental breakdown and started crying. I wiped my tears and finished day. Next day I was on first stop on route and turned around. I went into office laid keys down on manager's table and I was done. I think that was the most relief i had ever had in my life.

During just a few months I went from optimistic post-graduate to a hardened bitter towards real life work person.

I was talking to someone I work with who's leaving and she said that this happened to her every time she applied for a job transfer even when she was qualified. She's remained friends with one of the supervisors who left last year and that supervisor dished that our manager gets notified by HR when someone applies for a transfer and can deny the transfer before the person even gets an interview. So if HR calls and says ""hey bootswiththefurrr applied for this, is that ok?"" they can say no. 

I have not 100% confirmed this so I might just be mad for no reason but another supervisor is leaving (surprise) who's been there forever who I'm fairly close to so I might ask her if that's true or not.

828,My take on how automation has been perverted and ruined working standards.,"The 40 hour workweek is a relic of the industrial age. Automation has made it possible to reduce the hours we need to work and live better lives. Here's how that opportunity has been squandered.

Imagine you have a group project for school. There are four tasks to do, there are four of you in the group.

Now one of those tasks has been done automatically and easily. Great! Now each of you is responsivle for 25% less work. Your remaining 75% can be done better because you aren't burned out. You turn in your project and all get As thanks to the automated help. Next hear maybe another task gets automated and everybody keeps doing better.

Companies now are a teacher who says that since there are only three tasks, the fourth person is kicked out of the group and gets an F because he doesn't have a chance to get into a group at all by the deadline or the resources to do the whole project himself. He suffers a lot , the other group members gain nothing, and the teacher has just hoarded an A to himself. 

I hear you saying ""But this analogy makes no sense, hoarding As doesn't get the teacher anything""

Well congrats, now you understand why sitting on millions you could never spend would make someone an asshole. 

Automation should have made our lives better. Instead its just being used to hurt people.

I'm over setting myself on fire to keep my workplace warm.,"I currently have chronic asthma because a couple of years ago I was denied time off when I got a chest infection. It wasn't blatant, but I was told I could have time off if I could replace my hours, even though it was obvious the hours couldn't be replaced by me. Upper management would have had to bring in someone from another store, something that I didn't have the ability to authorise. So I kept working, and ended up with walking pnuemonia. Again, I could totally have the time off if I could do the impossible and replace myself. So to save the company a few dollars I now have probably permanent asthma.

Many times over the years I had to fight for time off that I'm entitled to, only to be guilted when I stood my ground. ""It was so hard without you here Quokka, this and that is now messed up because you werent here, and replacing you blew out our budget"" etc. I'm done feeling bad about it.

857,Work shouldn't be our primary identity,"I find it a little disconcerting that people are so obsessed not only with making their lives revolve around their job, but are also willing to make really big sacrifices for grabbing the next title.

There is also this unspoken-of class divide within corporates, where how you are spoken to depends on how many grades above or below the person who's speaking you are.

And then there are the things people buy to show their ""growth"" ; from the make of their car, to the brand of their dresses, everything is chosen to reflect their ""position"".

What's the point of obsessing so much over job titles and position, to the exclusion of the things that really matter in life? You're encouraged to be ""tough"" and ""assertive"", and if you show a little bit of kindness, you are labelled ""too soft"".

Sorry for the rant. I don't know where I'm going with this. I'm just worried that I'm being sucked into this void, and I really don't want to get trapped.

For 12 years I have struggled and failed to get anything above precarious, middling to low paid jobs. My main areas of ""talent"" were music, art and writing, did a course in VFX, couldn't get a job despite a few interviews as my work wasn't good/photorealistic enough. Then went back to what I was originally strong at, writing and research and did a PhD in English and can't get a job in academia either despite ""networking"", going to lots of conferences and publishing (the last one has been my bane). So I end up working in a low paid, temporary teaching job while my compatriots get jobs in academia through superior social and cognitive skills or perhaps luck. Just wondering has anyone struggled with actually ""launching"" (hate that word) a career? I've done plenty of interviews and always felt a gap in wavelength between myself and other people, many of whom seem like ideologues lacking in any spark of imagination. It's very difficult to pretend to be someone you're not, you'll be found out on a subliminal level regardless. Interviews have 9/10 been horrible experiences of judgement and condescension. 

I found that in academia there were two types of academic, the careerists who I really didn't get along with, these would be the boring, conservative, straight ahead with ticking boxes types who seemed to be in it only for the prestige and then the lunatics, many of whom were my friends who loved their subjects but who wouldn't exactly fit in with society in many ways. I find it really difficult to motivate myself to apply for anything these days because of the bucket list of demands and the inevitable rejection letter I'll get anyway, so I just focus on making a few bucks to put into my music.

I'm good child. I fly back to France every time there's a major family event requiring my presence. I do my best learning the language of my new country of residence.

I'm bad child. I'm helping my divorced mother while my father keeps telling me she's black-holing my small assets (which is true to some extent).

I'm bad child. As my father doesn't trust me, he did not offer me any instruction regarding money, how to grow assets like buying and renting property, invest in the trade market or whatever.

I'm bad child. I make my parents worried because I don't care too much my own health problems and I'm too much addicted to the Internet.

With all this, I can't feel safe. I spend more than I earn to maintain this lifestyle, and to keep my family relationships sustainable.

I can't talk about it to my employer because the guy could not care less about my personal expectations. But it's really annoying to deal with this.

I wish I could have some off-time whenever needed (family, burnout). I wish I was paid more when circumstances require it. I wishI could chill and begin to buy a lot of items to add decorum to my apartment and equipments to my numerous crafts. I wish I was not worried about losing my job for lack of motivation. I wish I was really helped by my company to learn the language here  The Internet is the only affordable and minimalistic resource I can get to express myself, that's why it's so important to me.

You'd figure there would be enough to jobs to do for everyone on Earth but for the 3% in the USA who can't find jobs it just seems odd!

People attack me since I am an introvert who doesn't like to drink, smoke or party.

I am hermit like and love being alone doing my own isolated hobbies.

I don't like being around a mass of people acting like animals in loud clubs filled with nasty cigarette smoke.

People always looked down on me for being a loner. I don't even tell them about my personal life but they either assume things about so since i am quiet or they go and look up people from my past and get personal stuff about me.

They also go and find out about my academic accomplishments and become insanely jealous which leads to verbal abuse, harassment, calling me stupid to feel better about themselves and bragging that they are better than me due to being more popular/going to parties (which I dont even care for since i hate parties and dont want to be popular).

They also constantly compete with me and talk trash behind my back to other coworkers to make me look bad and try to mentally abuse me to get me to leave due to fear that I do better than them. One senior even told me that he feared I took his job due to my credentials and performance at work.

So eventually I got fed up and said “Right well I don’t want this job anyway so I’m out of here, seeya.” And walked straight out the door.

The manager shouted out after me “Go then! You’re a pussy! You can’t handle it!” 
I shouted back “That’s right!” And never looked back.

909,How can parents do it???,"I am married, no kids. Most of the time I cannot function if I don't get TWO FULL DAYS DOWNTIME to begin work week.

But I don't have any other chores that I have to do for kids which are so mindless, time consuming and monotonous. School runs, packing lunches, arranging birthday parties, managing tantrums , cleaning shit are just some few of the tasks I would be putting up with had I been a parent and I cannot fathom how I would maintain my sanity at the end of the day to begin work the next day.

How do parents manage to even turn up to work and do something is beyond me. That's why maybe they are all shitty at their tasks to begin with as their minds are constantly all over the place thinking about what needs done at home or for school for kids. Especially the ones with toddlers, these guys can't get enough sleep at night and still manage to come to work the next day, maybe half sleepy.

I cannot do that, maybe I am not a human being or I am depressed or its my basic inability to cope with life whatever you call that, I cannot be a parent and work at the same time. And if I am so sucked by corporations for a penny's worth, I would avoid repeating the cycle and subjecting my kids to the same wage slavery anyway ..",False,ddikjy,horseshoemagnet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ddikjy/how_can_parents_do_it/,42,53

912,Working as an Immigrant,"Working in itself as a resident of the country is hell but I am an immigrant on a work visa and that's like double times hell.

One, your job is tied to your visa and vice versa (unless I have visa I don't get to apply for a job and once I have it I need to prove I have been on a continuous employment for a certain number of years if I need to settle down)

Two, unless I get citizenship/leave to remain/PR I cannot think of investing in house or getting married (potentially my spouse would either have to leave their job if they are from a different country or my home country and search a new one and in the worst case if a dependent is not allowed to work then that's half the income gone)

Three, employers very well know you are on a work visa and if they get a hint that you have taken a student loan in foreign currency which there is no way you will be able to repay back in your home country without having a job, it's their golden chance to take advantage of you to the max. So they make you work two to three times more than what you are paid for and your pathetic situation would mean you cannot refuse.

Fourth, you may or may not adjust to cultural differences and society in general and begin to feel extremely isolated and lonely. You would feel time slipping by and you being trapped in such a situation that you cannot take any risk of changing a job let alone quitting.

I have seen a lot of my friends take student debts , go to universities abroad, compete with thousands of applicants, get into the rigmarole of the long queue and years of waiting for citizenship all the while being treated like a slave in eternal servitude of the work visa they were so proud to obtain in the beginning. 

This is not to discourage people but paint the true picture of what you are supposed to give up and how life looks like as an immigrant. Many of these people come from third world countries which are basically shit holes but life is not rosy in the western world either. 

I am on a work visa and I have no student debt. I am not banking on a citizenship process here and have made alternative plans should my job not progress for a longer term. There is no way I am investing in a home abroad and being trapped into the cycle of wage slavery.. People should think hundred times before taking expensive long term decisions.

923,Refusing to work: should you live or die?,"In the human rights declaration it says

I've been thinking about whether this means you always a right to housing and food and being alive, or only if you work. In the first half it says everybody has those rights, with no conditions. In the second half it guarantees ""security"", but only to those without livelihood caused by things outside their control. So if you refuse to work, you deserve to have all the things to be alive, but no ""security""? I'm unsure what that means.

It's just a small mind game anyways, right now in practise, you have to work to be allowed to be alive. Which in my mind makes it ironic that many deny people the right to die.
