0,"[PA, USA] 3/4 rant, 1/4 advice: My restaurant is forcing a 30 hour weekly minimum or else you're terminated.",my state has recently entered the green phase so the tgichilibees i work at reopened with less than half capacity the gm is slowly bringing people back for dinein but has said that because the company received ppp money servers must work a minimum of 30 hours per week 3 10hour days minimum regardless of business no one has seen any real evidence that this is actually the case rather its likely corporate lying to us to ensure that the servers who work cannot file for partial benefits i just think its insane that i didnt even work that many hours before covid but i have to suck it up or i lose this shitty ass job shitty ass health insurance and my uc benefits  that pua changed my life man i could pay for healthcaremedicine without worry and provide for my mom without a thought   so what a quarter of the staff works for a mystery amount of money each day at the restaurant and the other 75 gets to keep collecting till it runs out why even act like its a choice if i decline your shitty offer of shitty work for shit money i lose not only the pua money that actually pays the bills but i lose the job too why even pretend its an option once i got that phone call i knew i was fucked no matter how busy the restaurant could possibly be it will still pay less than uc lets not pretend anyone would choose to go back for less money dealing with coopedup karens and kyles all day  it just seems like a way to make sure employees cant file for partial benefits basically my job is saying that even if its a dead shift you gotta stick around for no cash sales arent always high for dinein right now so im sure my coworkers would be able to file and receive partial unemployment if it werent for the 30 hours minimum bullshit i know im beating a dead horse on this sub because everyone who posts here says the same but this pandemic has clearly highlighted the fact that you have to choose between you and your familys health or your livelihood or get fucked two american freedoms the freedom to work or the freedom to starve i hope yall stay safe healthy and fed any advice for my situationsanity would be appreciated thanks guys,hi5n8k

3,"So many people do not understand that there are people who simply cannot work. My dad thinks his brother quit his job bc he didn’t like it just before “randomly” suffering a mental breakdown. In reality, he’s undiagnosed autistic, had worked his previous job for 30 years &amp; couldn’t cope.",my father also thinks that people can get food stamps ssi and medicaid simply by quitting their job this is exactly the kind of bullshit ideology that divides disabled andor poor people from the working class so many working people see themselves as martyrs for allegedly voluntarily poor and disabled people,hhquv4

5,Its sad how people who get work get corrupted,just something i unfortunately had to observe twice now i had two friends who claimed to hate work they pretty much thought like anyone on this sub does both got work because they basically were forced to and both slowly developed into your usual wageslave   it started slowly first they where complaining about how much they hate it then they started with im only doing it for the money i will quit this job as soon as i have enough a while later it went on to i kinda like it tbh its nice to be needed and do your part for society thats when you know its too late because both started to say shit like you should try to work at least parttime too its cool to have more money and lowkey insulting me with its better than getting money for doing nothing which is a sure sign that they feel better than people who are unemployed its sad really im still in touch with one of them and sometimes he says it sucks being a wageslave yet he wont quit the job without any real reason i guess he either says it because he thinks thats what i want to hear or he simply gave in and does what people expect him to do it sucks either way to lose friends over petty shit like that its not like i mind people working but stop insulting people who dont want to work especially not when they are your friends,hgqy3n

19,I know this sounds dumb as fuck but I genuinely believe memes are the key to understanding how we can collectively 'hack' The System (and prove money is a lie),we are a connected world in 2020 more than ever   we are an absurd word in 2020 more than ever  where are you reading this from probably very far from here and yet im there in your mind now the inescapable and global grasp of the internet and our eternal engagement with it through the smartphone has been a pivotal revolutionary shift in human history one more significant than our discovery of fire agriculture steel or the combustion engine we have yet to scratch the surface of its potential and power and the deeper implications of its existence and what that reveals about us  the internet is the genesis of a global communal awakening and awareness of hidden connection  the internet and modern constantly connected culture has allowed us to act as a sort of rudimentary hivemind our access to and saturation of information media and communication is both constant and instant  it is now possible to share our thoughts with almost everybody there is  our friends and family their friends and family people we dont know and never will people in another country and people who may not even share the same language as us  a single sentence spat out into the ether can potentially reach billions of people on the planet in a matter of minutes  you me and everybody else has a form of direct access to nearly every other human consciousness on this planet  what could we possibly use that for  memes of course  to crowdsource the question of what is good because that is what lies at the centre of all belief and action  the fact that we have seemingly become ever more divisive and politically polarized is therefore not to be tutted at wished away or met with calls for civility but rather acknowledged as the only way in which an outcome  truth  can be arrived at copy itself spread and propagate to the point where its opposite seems wholly and utterly absurd  advocates for either a progressive or conservative approach to policy can not compromise not because the facts are in disagreement although that is true but because what comes before the facts is not agreed upon that is the way the world is structured and ordered or the way the world is which itself always acts as the background for an ideology rather than the reverse the idiom seeing is believing is true backwards as well perhaps even more convincingly   believing is seeing and this is evident now more than ever  im going to make some statements that are broad and general but ones i feel are fairly common and often subconscious these are not meant to be statements of  fact only associations to get us to think about how we reach the conclusion of fact  the relationship between progressivism and conservatism is like the relationship between masculine and feminine which is like the relationship between individual and community  consider this disharmony between two opposing or complementary  principles as essentially the basis of all philosophical and thus political thought also consider opposing principles as really a single thing as opposites always exist only in relation to each other this admittedly sounds a lot like some meaningless newage woo but i think most of us can and do recognize the basic and fundamental necessity of this tension between opposites  we see what our minds project and what our contexts allow  we frame the world in the language we have at our disposal and what words mean is not something static and in the word itself but something dynamic unique to us specifically in the way we relate to that word  language has an implicit kind of magical quality  by that i mean much like an imagined casting of a spell it is widely assumed that speaking the right words in the right combination and order can influence and compel people to act and this action is the source of social change this is why great orators have possessed great influence over the course of history  someone must be able to give power to an idea that can move masses to act as a single unified force of nature  language is itself inherently biased limited and divisive  black lives matter means absolutely nothing until it is interpreted and language is always loaded with prejudice even and perhaps especially when great care is taken to make sure it is not there is always a fundamental aspect of loss from translating a feeling to a thought to any thing else even when the path is as seemingly direct as from thought to speech   have you ever known exactly what to say but been unable to get the words out properly in the moment   have you ever written and rewritten something multiple times because the exact feeling youre trying to capture just isnt there   as much as language is the primary way we communicate ironically it just as often obfuscates and confuses because the kind of language we have available to us directly determines how we understand and conceptualize the world and ourselves it is not a matter of merely being petersonianly precise in our speech because precision is meaningless if the principles that precede it are incompatible  how many proponents of any ideology have actually read and engaged with its foundational or supporting texts   probably very few  how many have absorbed bits and pieces through their specific context  language culture family friends media and digital memes  probably almost everybody  you simply cant exist in 2020 and not intuitively just know what a meme is even those that exist totally cutoff from the online sphere would get the picture with some examples most typically we think of images like thishttpsimgurcomsc1nbl7 or thishttpsimgurcomyw2quqt but these are just some examples of the modern digital meme and dont begin to even scratch the surface of just exactly what a meme is and why the answer to that might be really fucking important  for example a picture doesnt need any text to be a meme similarly a picture can be only text and still be a meme a phrase can be a meme or even a single wordhttpsvignettewikianocookienetsimpsonsimagescc3d27ohjpgrevisionlatestcb20141226214635 a soundhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiwilhelmscream symbolshttpsenwikipediaorgwikicoolsmediafile22cools22svg the structure of the building youre in and the design of the device youre reading this from are memetic artifacts musical subgenres fashion and style trends social patterns and institutions including family marriage property law crime and punishment  even complex ideologies  religious political and philosophical all actually inseparable and arguably the same thing  are essentially very nuanced and enduring memetic conversations that span hundreds and thousands of years  human behaviour is memetic  a product of pattern repetition and context rather than a series of conscious choices we make at every moment  this is not to suggest we are totally bound and determined by fate only that we are bound and determined to act in accordance with our own character  we are not something responsible for our decisions we are our decisions and for that we bear responsibility   can you imagine donald trump acting like anything else besides a caricature of pure petulance  thats his role to play  his constitution if it werent he would be someone else and here lies the crucial error that pervades all levels of society  i think the belief that he or you or i make decisions is quite backwards  its partly a product of the language we use to speak about ourselves and the world  a confusion of the symbol with the actual thing  and partly just our basic instincts its plainly obvious that i am aware and can consider many possibilities and outcomes and think rather abstractly about present past and future so it only seems to follow that i must exert some basic influence over the course of my life but i think if we really examine that thought theres no good reason to assume thats true and necessarily follows we might feel that it does but perhaps that is a sign to be skeptical of our most basic assumptions  i find little distinction between me and my choices  i am those choices not a separate entity in the pilots seat of my skull that chooses  that stands separate considers and then finally pulls the lever that corresponds with the choice ive made  those last three words are superfluous  to me they all reference a single thing  a localized happening from my specific perspective  this idea is naturally unpalatable as it seems to absolve one of all responsibility for both wrongdoing and ownership of good acts and artistic creations but i think this is nothing more than a kneejerk reaction to protect our sense of i as something distinct and in control as to accept the opposite comes with a great and terrifying sense of powerlessness this terror is multiplied further when coupled with the additional quality of randomness and the ordinary and pervasive accepted fact of our free will  is an attempt to reconcile this powerlessness with our instinctive desire to be in control even when faced constantly with the reality of circumstance where one life is destroyed based not on any decision or choice it was able to make but the simple act of existing at the wrong point in time and space and colliding with the wrong other does nothing to dissuade us of this familiar and comfortable illusion  responsibility is not something we take it is what we are by sheer virtue of being  memes and the repetition of pattern connects us to something far greater than any single one of us  our collective human ideas about value function purpose and their relation with each other  memes are a portal to the sum total of all human knowledge experience and feeling  memes are threads sewn into the fabric of the tapestry of reality connecting us to the past present future each other and something totally separate  something unspeakable that yet demands to be spoken of  something that can be glimpsed only for a moment and reflected only as a fragment  you may have felt it when engaged in something everyday and ordinary yet struck as if for the very first time by the majesty and totality of all there is  all experience happening right now billions of distinct and separate simultaneous happenings  connections  disconnected only by virtue of the limitations of our own collective conceptions of what is real what is true and what is possible  what is possible  it is possible then to understand humanity not as an abstracted collection of billions of separate individuals but as a single unique happening of organismenvironment that can act with that awareness of unity and underlying connection  we currently insist on persisting in an ordering of society that enriches only a small handful that have fallen to the top through nothing other than circumstance and who insist this must be the natural ordering of the world simply because it is the current ordering of it   can we really trust those who wield inordinate amounts of power to fairly consider how it might be meted out differently is the fate of society directly tied to the fate of the billionaire class or to the current institutions of governance and policing  we are meant to believe and accept that this is just the way the world is   as far as i see it society bears little proof of functioning properly anywhere as long as we define properly as for the common good of all people if we instead understand properly as to the obscene and perverted benefit of a small few at the expense of everybody else then it is functioning tremendously properly and will only continue to do so until we put a stop to it  from where is authority and power actually derived  the primary source is our shared belief that these institutional structures are legitimate and just  and they are so long as we believe it   the secondary source is the ability and willingness of these structures to respond violently if we do not accept the first  violence is of course the most powerful and persuasive avenue of acquiring and maintaining power both literal violent action and indirect violence inflicted and facilitated by a system of organization that regards the principle of ones right to hoard obscene amounts of wealth as higher and more just than an attempt to provide the basic material necessities of life for all people  that is the basic moral principle that serves as the keystone of the structure of our society as it is currently ordered  to preserve life violence may sometimes be necessary but violence can be avoided memetically  you cannot put a bullet in a concept and its just as futile and a bit if a moral grey area to do the same to those who espouse exemplify or believe it violence can be lessened with the correct memetic foundations to underpin our collective conceptions of self other and world and the reciprocal nature of those three things  violence is given power by distinction and separation but that power can be neutered partly by understanding that not only are we ourself we are also every other self too  individualism is too often championed by those who dont understand the distinction between it and selfishness and this error acts as the basic foundation for an entire wing of belief that insists value is directly related to money and money alone and everything can be spoken about in terms of its equivalent and assumed value in us dollars one of many currencies that can in an instant become almost worthless due to nothing other than our shared confidence or lack thereof in it  so if memes are the true catalyst of human action and social change can we then meme ourselves into a better reality can we together engineer build or construct a meme to spread and transform our shared collective unconscious and the ideas that follow about not only what is true but what is possible  i think a good place to start is to understand the illusory and mutable nature of money and wealth their direct relationship with power authority and control and the distribution of these things money is a real thing that performs a necessary function but our shared understanding of it holds real power over its form and in this way we can collectively shape and alter that power it commands over our lives through a collective psychic exercise  we cant function without money but we absolutely can function with a new way of distributing it in hopes of lessening not eliminating the amount of suffering directly related to poverty and the misery that flows from that  google how many billionaires exist  answer 2095  2095 problems  lets look at just one  does jeff bezos really have billions of an actual tangible currency or is his currency really in the form of power and influence as represented by money  is the standard workweek from monday to friday or monday to thursday   whatever the answer is it because this is simply the way the world is or might the way the world is be directly shaped by our collective ideas about it  wars are no longer waged on an actual battlefield  our modern war is a psychic and spiritual one set in the space of the collective human unconscious and the targets of annihilation are not only people but possibilities  the target is truth and the creation of truth as it serves the manufacturer  we are in an era of memetic warfare and unless we can understand that and figure out how to turn it against itself the collective human spirit will be swallowed whole outlived by the last piece of manufactured shit we can sell for a dollar  2095 problems and 1 crucial error stands between us and a better society and building that society is as simple as believing in and spreading the right memes  we can meme ourselves better but only together  if you can believe thats true it is,hiq9db

46,My experience of a four-day workweek,ive been a long time visitor to this subreddit and thought you all might be interested to hear what my shortterm experience of working a fourday week has been   ampx200b  i applied to do a fourdayweek when i started my current job last year my manager refused it saying i was too useful to lose for a day a week despite it being offered to me at interview so when my dept did nothing about social distancing measures etc through covid i saw my chance and got hr to approve a condensation of my hours about a month ago   ampx200b  the reaction to my move to a 4dayweek from my colleagues has been one of jealousy and general disaproval i would say my manager acted as if i were being given a huge gift as he signed the form grudgingly and another colleague asked if i was going to be doing this much longer as if it were temporary the trouble is you see ive taken on a lot of responsibilities that should be theirs and by now being absent for a day a week their shortcomings are plainer to see i have not once been thanked for staying very late to get things done in the hospital i work in for the months before theres certainly a distrust of me working these new hours and as its still new i feel im having to prove that working these hours are effective to everybody  ampx200b  from a working point of view i am way more organised doing these hours i supervise people well more orchestrate than supervise  i fight their side not the managers battles downwards and so i can catch up on emails and calls before anybody else is even in organise the work for the day and then spend my day helping others as opposed to chasing my own problems up my tenhour day feels a lot more effective than my 8hourdays  ampx200b  from a personal point a view the ten hour days feel long i work 75 with a rushed 30 min lunch break somewhere in the middle im an earlyriser anyway so that early start isnt bad for me my commute is 1 hour each way so not having to do that on a friday feels good as is saving me fuel on my work days it really does feel like i get home cook dinner wash up and go to bed  those 4 days are a writeoff  ampx200b  but the threedays off guys oh its been fantastic i spend my friday recovering as i used to on a saturday i get to visit more local shops amp markets at a leisurely pace away from the weekend crowds i get my chores done my winddown from work efficacy mode occurs meaning by saturday the day is mine to do what i want its a mental freedom that id forgotten i still get the sunday scaries but now i have a day to truly enjoy my weekend i hope that the fourday week is adopted but that third day is variable for everybody so they too can experience this   ampx200b  my advice is if you can do this or if you have to push to get this do it   ampx200b  tldr ive worked a 4dayweek for about a month now my colleaguesmanager are suspicious but im more organised amp effective at work and feel a lot more balanced in my personal life work writes off those 4 days but lets you truly have personal time would recommend,hgrjvh

64,Work: The Theft of Life, this is an excerpt taken from the network of dominationhttpstheanarchistlibraryorglibrarywolfilandstreicherthenetworkofdomination by wolfi landstreicher   work  gt  what is the bombing of a judge the kidnapping of an industrialist      the hanging of a politician the shooting of a cop      the looting of a supermarket the burning of a commissioners office      the stoning of a journalist      the heckling of an intellectual the thrashing of an artist      in the face of the deadly alienation of our existence      the much too early sound of the alarm clock      the traffic jam on the expressway      the goods for sale lined up on the shelves  the alarm clock disrupts your sleep again  as always much too early  you drag yourself from the warmth of your bed to the bathroom for a shower a shave and a shit then run down to the kitchen where you wash  down a pastry or if you have the time some toast and eggs with a cup of coffee then you rush out the door to battle traffic jams or crowds in the subway until you arrive at work where your day is spent in tasks not of your choosing in compulsory association with others involved in related tasks the primary aim of which is the continued reproduction of the social relationships that constrain you to survive in this manner   but this is not all in compensation you receive a wage a sum of money that after paying rent and bills you must take out to shopping centers to buy food clothes various necessities and entertainment though this is considered your free time as opposed to work time it too is compulsory activity that only secondarily guarantees your survival its primary purpose again being to reproduce the current social order and for most people moments free of these constraints are fewer and fewer   according to the ruling ideology of this society this existence is the result of a social contract between equals  equals before the law that is the worker it is said contracts to sell her labor to the boss for a mutually agreed upon wage but can a contract be considered free and equal when one side holds all the power   if we look at this contract more closely it becomes clear that it is no contract at all but the most extreme and violent extortion this is currently exposed most blatantly at the margins of capitalist society where people who have lived for centuries or in some cases millennia on their own terms find their capacity to determine the conditions of their existence ripped away by the bulldozers chainsaws mining equipment and so on of the worlds rulers but it is a process that has been going on for centuries a process involving blatant largescale theft of land and life sanctioned and carried out by the ruling class bereft of the means for determining the conditions of their own existence the exploited cannot be said in honesty to be contracting freely and equally with their exploiters it is clearly a case of blackmail   and what are the terms of this blackmail the exploited are forced to sell the time of their life to their exploiters in exchange for survival and this is the real tragedy of work the social order of work is based on the imposed opposition between life and survival the question of how one will get by suppresses that of how one wants to live and in time this all seems natural and one narrows ones dreams and desires to the things that money can buy   however the conditions of the world of work do not just apply to those with jobs one can easily see how the unemployed searching for a job from fear of homelessness and hunger is caught up in the world of work  but the same holds for the recipient of state aid whose survival depends  on the existence of the assistance bureaucracy and even for those for whom the avoidance of getting a job has become such a priority that  ones decisions come to center around scams shoplifting dumpster  diving  all the various ways to get by without a job in other words activities that could be fine means for supporting a life  project become ends in themselves making mere survival ones life  project how really does his differ from a job   but what is the real basis of the power behind this extortion that is the world of work of course there are laws and courts police and military forces fines and prisons the fear of hunger and homelessness   all very real and significant aspects of domination but even the states force of arms can only succeed in carrying out its task because people submit and here is the real basis of all domination  the submission of the slaves their decision to accept the security of known misery and servitude rather than risk the unknown of freedom their willingness to accept a guaranteed but colorless survival in exchange  for the possibility of truly living that offers no guarantees   so in order to put an end to ones slavery to move beyond the limits of merely getting by it is necessary to make a decision to refuse to submit it is necessary to begin to reappropriate ones life here and now such a project inevitably places one in conflict with the entire social order of work so the project of reappropriating ones existence must also be the project of destroying work to clarify when i say  work i do not mean the activity by which one creates the means of ones existence which ideally would never be separate from simply living but rather a social relationship that transforms this activity into a sphere separate from ones life and places it in the service of the ruling order so that the activity in fact ceases to have any direct relationship to the creation of ones existence but rather only maintains it in the realm of mere survival at whatever level of consumption through a series of mediations of which property money and commodity exchange are among the most significant this is the world we must destroy in the process of taking back our lives and the necessity of this destruction makes the project of the reappropriation of our lives one with the projects of insurrection and social revolution,hirsqs

68,I don't know what to do anymore...,i work a simple desk job since about 2 years i chose this because of stable hours and because i was kinda burning out from my last job at a hostel being a manager i was too overwhelmed at 20 years to do that job so i left  now time has passed and i work in a completely different field i couldnt even describe what we as a company do it simply doesnt matter to me  my coworkers are significantly older than me and thats a big reason why they are so loyal to their job they do over hours even if they dont get payed for them personally i value my private life more than just a job so i frankly dont care about staying any later than i have to there are exceptions but mostly i just leave asap   nobody understands my feelings i cant talk to noone about this my boyfriend likes his job and wants to build up a successful career in his field which is fine but he just doesnt understand how it is when you dont have a corporate mind i couldnt care less about my company   my parents always just say almost noone loves their job but everyone has to work so you just have to suck it up its not going to be different anywhere every job has its downsides   and i agree but it just still doesnt feel right to me  i just came to the conclusion that i dont see myself pursuing a career i dont want to climb up the ladder i was a manager and i couldnt handle the stress and frankly the money is not worth the hassle for me    my boss had a review talk with me some months ago and he asked me what position i could imagine myself in and i honestly couldnt answer the question   he was like  you surely dont want to stay on the same spot forever right  i didnt answer anything but the more i think about it i dont want to work towards more responsibility and even more work if you ask me the next best thing would be to cut my work hours and start working part time so i have more time for my hobbies  i feel like this option is always just laid out to woman with children  sorry for making no fucking sense i just had to get it out couldnt wait for my therapist appointment anymore i dont know what i want if money wasnt a thing   tldr i dont like my job but i need money to finance my hobbies boss wants me to go further in my career whilst i would like to cut down to part time,hitwrf

99,"Had a breakdown because of my career (long post, question at the end)",  last thursday i m28 had a complete breakdown  i was sitting at my desk staring at my screen just another day doing work and i had a thought pry its way to the front all of my dreams are dead im stuck in a job i hate and causes me endless stress to pay off bills debt and rent all for the rest of my life i have no hope i have nothing to look forward to why do i bother  its not the first time i felt that way and wont be the last im not entirely sure why but on this particular day it hit me much harder to the point where the rest of my day was demolished while i tried to restore a semblance of normal life  i have been struggling for a long time on the outside things appear to be fine i have what appears to be a great job at a desirable company with all the benefits and i get to work from home right now   before i go further i want to let you know i get these are tough times and there are millions unemployed right now without the benefits i have without jobs medical insurance millions struggling way worse i fully acknowledge it  i always hear youre lucky to have a job be grateful be fortunate that i get to sacrifice my time my health for someone elses profit money can be recuperated time is gone forever i will never be as young as i am now  i knew early on in life that i was going to struggle in the modern workplace growing up there were plenty of topics and fields that interested me things that i felt were cool and i wanted to learn about the problem was that i definitively knew there wasnt anything that i felt was worth giving up 40 hours a week of course looking back that thought is even more painful as im often giving up much more time than that every week but i digress  even now i struggle to come up with hobbies and activities that i can do for 89 hours consistently with complete focus even things im passionate about are often put aside after some time otherwise i just feel drained exhausted i need a break from them a change of pace usually that means going outside for a walk taking a nap or just doing something else while i recharge  but not work not my career that requires 110 hah focus commitment dedication i have to throw a smile on and pretend everything is ok otherwise im a downer or not a teamplayer i have to be a robot thats on alwaysproductive and cheery mode im not allowed to let people know that im an individual struggling with depression struggling with the thought of working the rest of my life   theres a quote that cropped up recently its from a 2007 game think what you want about the game the story or its message but the quote really struck a cord with me  a man chooses a slave obeys  throughout my life ive made choices that i thought were mine but looking back im not so sure    i chose to work hard and get good grades   i chose to go to a specific college   i chose a major not because i wanted to but because it was one of the reasonable options   i chose to get a job to chase down a career  i chose to follow the safe path to let go of my dreams and passions to forfeit my childhood aspirations  but was it really a choice   i dont know about others but for me it certainly felt like there were no other options no other paths to follow i remember asking many times why we had to work everyday and give up huge portions of our lives to our careers   thats just the way life is   i hate that answer always have always will and i have zero power to change it  of course there are those that say well go get a new job or it could always be worse i concede that maybe getting a new job will reset my personal doomsday clock for a little bit but the deck is still stacked the game is still rigged  a choice between two different sets of handcuffs isnt an acceptable choice in my mind and im still going to be resentful that im forced to make that decision  so what are my choices what options do i have to break free  im not sure that i have any ive thought long and hard about how to break out of this predicament but without any fundamental changes i always circle back to my handcuffs carving and selling myself for a profit either as an employee working for someone else or on my own  the choice is a deception i am still a slave i just get to choose the poison that kills me  and if i dont want to choose then i get to look forward to   homelessness   starvation   the world falling apart and burning us alive   some disease rotting me from the inside out covid or something worse down the line   etc  oh and for those of you suggesting fire no how do you expect me to slave away for another 10 years waiting for that compound interest when today im already at my breaking point meanwhile spending all that time pinching pennies like scrooge thats just another set of cuffs one that relies on the ever expanding growth of shares and the exploitation of your fellow people i have a whole list of gripes against fire though i understand its allure  ampx200b  i appeal to the rest of you please help me understand what alternatives are there to this drudgery or will we just always be slaves   thanks see you all at my next mental breakdown,hi69q8

101,"I’m going to end up homeless, and I don’t care.",so im 18 years old just graduated from school at this moment i dont have any motivation to do something on top of that im dealing with depression im looking at this system at this society and everyday im thinking myself wtf is wrong with this world society sucks and the system also sucks on top of that sometimes i wish we all wouldnt exist so nobody would suffer i havent signed up for being a slave my whole life i cant remember though at this moment im having a job which im doing from home around 12 hours a day and im okay with it because i can do it whenever i want but i also dont really have that big motivation to do it anymore i hate working in general and so yeah i think in a few years i will leave the home of my parents because they want me to get a better degree but i dont care because i dont see any advantage and what for i should get a better degree yo as i do look like im writing thousand  applications huh no fuck this system i also wont do any professional training because no i dont wanna get pushed into this system so i might end up homeless but lol in the end i dont care so at this moment i dont care,hghd38

107,Socialists should give conspiracy theories another chance part 2,in my last post my point was that the correct information on what conspiracies are happening is good for socialists to know and that the idea of a controlling elite that controls the institutions on this world is actually compatible with the ideas on the nwo elite from a socialist perspective it is also important to take away the nwos power maybe even more important than getting rid of capitalism i know most conspiracy people do not look communism in a favorable light i was heavily capitalist in thinking noncompete badmouseproductions thefinnishbolshevik and the movie psywar really changed my persepctive   in my original post i talked about how false flags have been used against communists for a very ling time operation gladio was a series of false flags in europe that were blamed on communists in psywar the movie it makes the point that the wealthy have always found ways to conspire to keep the masses from taking their stuff making everyone in america temporarily embarrassed millionaires distracting people with political football issues and putting many other ideas into the american peoples heads has made america very accepting of capitalism   the first main counter arguments i got was the one argument that has flown around in the last two years it basically says that conspiracy theories give too simplistic of answers to complex problems this is not entirely false but it is mistaken to extend a pattern thinking every societal mystery that is not understood has to be complex society can be simple complex or a certain combination of both what has happened on earth with the nwo having so much power is basically the world taking on a mostly simple way of being  i also was told that conspiracy theories are not worth it because of all the crap theories separating the false from the true is a little bit of a hassle but is not unworth the effort there is way more than a kernel of truth in the conspiracy information just because alot of people cry wolf about wolves doesnt mean there are not real wolves that are being called out on rconspiracy yesterday and earlier today there is alot of good stuff on there the right wing politics has went down  one of the biggest arguments i give for 911 truth is that a trillion dollars went missing on 910 donald rumsfeld talked about it on 911 the are of the pentagon that got hit had the office that was investigating the missing trilion dollars   on oklahoma city truth there is a video i constantly link that proves multiple bombs were in the building the video has excerpts from 3 live news reports they talk constantly about multiple explosions and how multiple bombs were found i always talk about terrence yeakey who was there he knew a false flag happened and he was going to talk but they killed him and falsely ruled his death a suicide his family has come out saying this hoppy heidelberg was on the grand jury investigating this and he has come out about how the process was rigged  i know alot of people here see pizzagate as a right wing crank story but one thing that exposes that more is going on is tony and john podestas art collection as well as jimmy alefantiss art collection they have all sorts of paintings of kids being embarrassed in bathrooms epstein who didnt kill himself was part of a larger ring prince andrew was a part of it and you can see in his interview that he was lying  alot of socialist people will think that getting more money is the most important goal the elite have but if you look into it the desire for power over people is a desire of theirs and it even extends beyond that most of the elite are sadistic themselves they are the true archetype of evil,hh02g6
108,this subs kinda disappointing sometimes.,rarely do people question work jobs or societysystem based around jobs and wage labor its just people bitching about their own jobs and acting like individual bosses are the problem or worseacting like theyre weird or crazy for not wanting to work im antiwork because 95s havent existed for most of human history and this entire system is bullshit that alienates us from actually living i wanna know what people think about various antiwork philosophies because there are a lot  but no one ever wants to analyze the structures that force us to have jobs or discuss alternative systems even if people disagree about the fine points but here its always i hate my individual job should i quit my job my boss sucks but im not gonna question the need for bosses or jobs lame,hgcuxc

121,MONEY ISN'T EVEN FUCKING REAL LMAO,we are a connected world in 2020 more than ever   we are an absurd word in 2020 more than ever  where are you reading this from probably very far from here and yet im there in your mind now the inescapable and global grasp of the internet and our eternal engagement with it through the smartphone has been a pivotal revolutionary shift in human history one more significant than our discovery of fire agriculture steel or the combustion engine we have yet to scratch the surface of its potential and power and the deeper implications of its existence and what that reveals about us  the internet is the genesis of a global communal awakening and awareness of hidden connection  the internet and modern constantly connected culture has allowed us to act as a sort of rudimentary hivemind our access to and saturation of information media and communication is both constant and instant  it is now possible to share our thoughts with almost everybody there is  our friends and family their friends and family people we dont know and never will people in another country and people who may not even share the same language as us  a single sentence spat out into the ether can potentially reach billions of people on the planet in a matter of minutes  you me and everybody else has a form of direct access to nearly every other human consciousness on this planet  what could we possibly use that for  memes of course  to crowdsource the question of what is good because that is what lies at the centre of all belief and action  the fact that we have seemingly become ever more divisive and politically polarized is therefore not to be tutted at wished away or met with calls for civility but rather acknowledged as the only way in which an outcome  truth  can be arrived at copy itself spread and propagate to the point where its opposite seems wholly and utterly absurd  advocates for either a progressive or conservative approach to policy can not compromise not because the facts are in disagreement although that is true but because what comes before the facts is not agreed upon that is the way the world is structured and ordered or the way the world is which itself always acts as the background for an ideology rather than the reverse the idiom seeing is believing is true backwards as well perhaps even more convincingly   believing is seeing and this is evident now more than ever  im going to make some statements that are broad and general but ones i feel are fairly common and often subconscious these are not meant to be statements of  fact only associations to get us to think about how we reach the conclusion of fact  the relationship between progressivism and conservatism is like the relationship between masculine and feminine which is like the relationship between individual and community  consider this disharmony between two opposing or complementary  principles as essentially the basis of all philosophical and thus political thought also consider opposing principles as really a single thing as opposites always exist only in relation to each other this admittedly sounds a lot like some meaningless newage woo but i think most of us can and do recognize the basic and fundamental necessity of this tension between opposites  we see what our minds project and what our contexts allow  we frame the world in the language we have at our disposal and what words mean is not something static and in the word itself but something dynamic unique to us specifically in the way we relate to that word  language has an implicit kind of magical quality  by that i mean much like an imagined casting of a spell it is widely assumed that speaking the right words in the right combination and order can influence and compel people to act and this action is the source of social change this is why great orators have possessed great influence over the course of history  someone must be able to give power to an idea that can move masses to act as a single unified force of nature  language is itself inherently biased limited and divisive  black lives matter means absolutely nothing until it is interpreted and language is always loaded with prejudice even and perhaps especially when great care is taken to make sure it is not there is always a fundamental aspect of loss from translating a feeling to a thought to any thing else even when the path is as seemingly direct as from thought to speech   have you ever known exactly what to say but been unable to get the words out properly in the moment   have you ever written and rewritten something multiple times because the exact feeling youre trying to capture just isnt there   as much as language is the primary way we communicate ironically it just as often obfuscates and confuses because the kind of language we have available to us directly determines how we understand and conceptualize the world and ourselves it is not a matter of merely being petersonianly precise in our speech because precision is meaningless if the principles that precede it are incompatible  how many proponents of any ideology have actually read and engaged with its foundational or supporting texts   probably very few  how many have absorbed bits and pieces through their specific context  language culture family friends media and digital memes  probably almost everybody  you simply cant exist in 2020 and not intuitively just know what a meme is even those that exist totally cutoff from the online sphere would get the picture with some examples most typically we think of images like thishttpsimgurcomsc1nbl7 or thishttpsimgurcomyw2quqt but these are just some examples of the modern digital meme and dont begin to even scratch the surface of just exactly what a meme is and why the answer to that might be really fucking important  for example a picture doesnt need any text to be a meme similarly a picture can be only text and still be a meme a phrase can be a meme or even a single wordhttpsvignettewikianocookienetsimpsonsimagescc3d27ohjpgrevisionlatestcb20141226214635 a soundhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiwilhelmscream symbolshttpsenwikipediaorgwikicoolsmediafile22cools22svg the structure of the building youre in and the design of the device youre reading this from are memetic artifacts musical subgenres fashion and style trends social patterns and institutions including family marriage property law crime and punishment  even complex ideologies  religious political and philosophical all actually inseparable and arguably the same thing  are essentially very nuanced and enduring memetic conversations that span hundreds and thousands of years  human behaviour is memetic  a product of pattern repetition and context rather than a series of conscious choices we make at every moment  this is not to suggest we are totally bound and determined by fate only that we are bound and determined to act in accordance with our own character  we are not something responsible for our decisions we are our decisions and for that we bear responsibility   can you imagine donald trump acting like anything else besides a caricature of pure petulance  thats his role to play  his constitution if it werent he would be someone else and here lies the crucial error that pervades all levels of society  i think the belief that he or you or i make decisions is quite backwards  its partly a product of the language we use to speak about ourselves and the world  a confusion of the symbol with the actual thing  and partly just our basic instincts its plainly obvious that i am aware and can consider many possibilities and outcomes and think rather abstractly about present past and future so it only seems to follow that i must exert some basic influence over the course of my life but i think if we really examine that thought theres no good reason to assume thats true and necessarily follows we might feel that it does but perhaps that is a sign to be skeptical of our most basic assumptions  i find little distinction between me and my choices  i am those choices not a separate entity in the pilots seat of my skull that chooses  that stands separate considers and then finally pulls the lever that corresponds with the choice ive made  those last three words are superfluous  to me they all reference a single thing  a localized happening from my specific perspective  this idea is naturally unpalatable as it seems to absolve one of all responsibility for both wrongdoing and ownership of good acts and artistic creations but i think this is nothing more than a kneejerk reaction to protect our sense of i as something distinct and in control as to accept the opposite comes with a great and terrifying sense of powerlessness this terror is multiplied further when coupled with the additional quality of randomness and the ordinary and pervasive accepted fact of our free will  is an attempt to reconcile this powerlessness with our instinctive desire to be in control even when faced constantly with the reality of circumstance where one life is destroyed based not on any decision or choice it was able to make but the simple act of existing at the wrong point in time and space and colliding with the wrong other does nothing to dissuade us of this familiar and comfortable illusion  responsibility is not something we take it is what we are by sheer virtue of being  memes and the repetition of pattern connects us to something far greater than any single one of us  our collective human ideas about value function purpose and their relation with each other  memes are a portal to the sum total of all human knowledge experience and feeling  memes are threads sewn into the fabric of the tapestry of reality connecting us to the past present future each other and something totally separate  something unspeakable that yet demands to be spoken of  something that can be glimpsed only for a moment and reflected only as a fragment  you may have felt it when engaged in something everyday and ordinary yet struck as if for the very first time by the majesty and totality of all there is  all experience happening right now billions of distinct and separate simultaneous happenings  connections  disconnected only by virtue of the limitations of our own collective conceptions of what is real what is true and what is possible  what is possible  it is possible then to understand humanity not as an abstracted collection of billions of separate individuals but as a single unique happening of organismenvironment that can act with that awareness of unity and underlying connection  we currently insist on persisting in an ordering of society that enriches only a small handful that have fallen to the top through nothing other than circumstance and who insist this must be the natural ordering of the world simply because it is the current ordering of it   can we really trust those who wield inordinate amounts of power to fairly consider how it might be meted out differently is the fate of society directly tied to the fate of the billionaire class or to the current institutions of governance and policing  we are meant to believe and accept that this is just the way the world is   as far as i see it society bears little proof of functioning properly anywhere as long as we define properly as for the common good of all people if we instead understand properly as to the obscene and perverted benefit of a small few at the expense of everybody else then it is functioning tremendously properly and will only continue to do so until we put a stop to it  from where is authority and power actually derived  the primary source is our shared belief that these institutional structures are legitimate and just  and they are so long as we believe it   the secondary source is the ability and willingness of these structures to respond violently if we do not accept the first  violence is of course the most powerful and persuasive avenue of acquiring and maintaining power both literal violent action and indirect violence inflicted and facilitated by a system of organization that regards the principle of ones right to hoard obscene amounts of wealth as higher and more just than an attempt to provide the basic material necessities of life for all people  that is the basic moral principle that serves as the keystone of the structure of our society as it is currently ordered  to preserve life violence may sometimes be necessary but violence can be avoided memetically  you cannot put a bullet in a concept and its just as futile and a bit if a moral grey area to do the same to those who espouse exemplify or believe it violence can be lessened with the correct memetic foundations to underpin our collective conceptions of self other and world and the reciprocal nature of those three things  violence is given power by distinction and separation but that power can be neutered partly by understanding that not only are we ourself we are also every other self too  individualism is too often championed by those who dont understand the distinction between it and selfishness and this error acts as the basic foundation for an entire wing of belief that insists value is directly related to money and money alone and everything can be spoken about in terms of its equivalent and assumed value in us dollars one of many currencies that can in an instant become almost worthless due to nothing other than our shared confidence or lack thereof in it  so if memes are the true catalyst of human action and social change can we then meme ourselves into a better reality can we together engineer build or construct a meme to spread and transform our shared collective unconscious and the ideas that follow about not only what is true but what is possible  i think a good place to start is to understand the illusory and mutable nature of money and wealth their direct relationship with power authority and control and the distribution of these things money is a real thing that performs a necessary function but our shared understanding of it holds real power over its form and in this way we can collectively shape and alter that power it commands over our lives through a collective psychic exercise  we cant function without money but we absolutely can function with a new way of distributing it in hopes of lessening not eliminating the amount of suffering directly related to poverty and the misery that flows from that  google how many billionaires exist  answer 2095  2095 problems  lets look at just one  does jeff bezos really have billions of an actual tangible currency or is his currency really in the form of power and influence as represented by money  is the standard workweek from monday to friday or monday to thursday   whatever the answer is it because this is simply the way the world is or might the way the world is be directly shaped by our collective ideas about it  wars are no longer waged on an actual battlefield  our modern war is a psychic and spiritual one set in the space of the collective human unconscious and the targets of annihilation are not only people but possibilities  the target is truth and the creation of truth as it serves the manufacturer  we are in an era of memetic warfare and unless we can understand that and figure out how to turn it against itself the collective human spirit will be swallowed whole outlived by the last piece of manufactured shit we can sell for a dollar  2095 problems and 1 crucial error stands between us and a better society and building that society is as simple as believing in and spreading the right memes  we can meme ourselves better but only together  if you can believe thats true it is,hgsh9b

134,I DID IT! I QUIT MY JOB!, i finally did it ive been working this healthcare facility for 3 years in the kitchen and tonighttoday at 1am i quit i did it via text message to my hr manager and supervisor but i did it please dont tell me that it was unprofessional they did plenty worse    i started this job in the kitchen 3 years ago at 9 an hour 44 hours a week thats right 44 hours a week but as part time no benefits no healthcare    gone through a new manager every year same old were a family and i promise to fix everything procedes to fck up everything worse  one of my manger actually told me to my face people like you dont deserve to be working in my kitchen after working there for only a week im openly trans gay and autistic        i never know my work work schedule for the next week until the very last day of current schedule  half my coworkers are part of one family current now old boss is friend of said family and makes one of them supervisor we had never had a supervisor until then  and new family supervisor call out everything no matter how small towards nonfamily but family can do no harm ever       now under the newest family ruled boss shifts get rearranged 1st shift gets an extra person and less overall work and second shift gets the same amount of people but with more work    one of the bosses family members hates my guts for some unknown reason i try my best to get with people or straight up avoid them and is allowed to scream at me and even threaten violence against me i tell supervisor nothing happens i tell manager nothing happens i tell hr nothing happens i have to go all the way the building admin and their higher up to stop this and when it finally stops that person is still allowed to work on the same shift as me i have worked same shift longer before them or any of the family had even started the jobs    after 3 years im still making 9 an hour while i know for a fact that the new family are making more bosses even bragged about bonoues they got for staying under budget by taking food away from they elderly   so in these three years ive worked at this place ive worked 40 hours a week minimum but still on paper part time until 4 months ago when corporate finally caught  it hr finnaly puts me on full time with healthcare yay right wrong  two times a day five times a week i washed dishes for roughly 100 elderly people that means the dirty flighty bacteria filled virus infested disgusting dish water filled with food that has been in 100 peoples mouths everyday twice a day without healthcare and i wonder why i got so sick all the time     now over the past month my supervisor who makes the schedule has reduced my hours to 30 hours a week without my knowledge or permission and when i confronted them they gave some bs excuss of of the covid 19 has us pushing hours back wtf no we are still working the same hours    now im part of the nation guard and on multiple ocassions my boss has called or rather has tried to call me in while im at my unit in uniform  asking me to leave early to help them  now i gave my manager my supervisor hr and building admin my yearly drill schedule far in advance but they still try to blame me for not warning them that i have drill when they have my drill for the whole year in paperwork and email and i tell them every month    now with this covid19 going on many units across the country have been doing work from home online work instead of going to the unit in person this still requires me to be busy at my computer for 89 hours and calling in and doing classes over the phone and all that nonsense but my hr askes me to my face to do it while at work hr asked me to work both my nation guard and my kitchen work at the same time as at least half my nation guard hours are during times im usually at work aka ng time is 8am to 4pm and work hours are 11am to 7pm    that happened last week now this week my work week starts on saturdays  ive had to go do someone elses job for the past 4 days in a row so that one person can go help the 1st shift on side of the builing when serving food which means giving one side 4 people duing lunch hour but yet the same side serving the same ammount of people with the same amount of time given only gets 3 people    so this all basically means that i have to go do someones elses job so they can do nothingf and this all puts my an hour behind on all my work for the entire day which means i have to stay over an hour  this trend of me having to do someones elses job started after i went to corporate and had them fix my hours so i get my 40 to keep my new full time and healthcare come to find out the supervisor was the one telling the cook to tell me to go there job the same supervisor that does my schedule      all ive ever wanted was to do my job my job not someone elses i just want to work 40 hours a week or hell even less just so long as i can support myself i live in a very rural region but my rent is the cheapest i could find over the past 4 years of living here and still takes up 40 of my monthly pay    for the past 3 days ive come home and cried and tonight i came home and drank ive never been drunk at most ive been buzzed twice im almost 30 so drinking has never even been on my list of things to do but ive finnaly been pushed over the egde and i drank propably a thirdish of a wine cooler and honestly the hours of 8pm to 1am are a total blurr im still buzzeed as of writing all this so at least someone could know my pain to the full im ok now and have poured all that was leftover into the sink and never plan to do that again    and much more  tldr my job was bad over the past 3 years that tonight sent me over and i got drunk for the first time in life then i sobered up and quit my job via text at

144,Yesterday I Got The Call To Go Back and I've Felt Like Absolute Shit Since,ive had a pit in my stomach since yesterday morning  got the call to come back from furlough on monday after 15 weeks  i really dont know how im going to manage    i was told id be out until the first week of september but theres been a big turn around in business     the most ridiculous part about this is my company has been pushing slow production startup i work in manufacturing safety first volunteers only for the summer    now fair is fair  my company did do a few decent things    during the 2nd week of march they decided to voluntarily shutdown for a two week period with full pay for employees   during that time period the state ordered a nonessential shutdown  the company didnt try to bs their way into pretending they were essential they let us keep our vacation and sick time without paying it out and they let us keep our health insurance granted with double payments when we go back     once the nonessential order ended in may it was going to be all volunteers and small shifts for the whole summer    they had no issues getting volunteers because they promised a four day work week with the fifth day being able to claim ui from the state plus you would still get the 600 a week from the cares act     but then a couple weeks ago they started to realize that they were getting a ton of orders  we make fucking sports equipment  a specific type  and its one of the only sports people are playing right now     well all of a sudden that employee safety went out the window    back to five days a week immediately starting next week  all employees mandatory back to work  ot reestablished both voluntary and mandatory possible six day work weeks until we catch up    all of those volunteers were expecting an extra 600 a week until august now theyre not getting it     these have been the best 15 weeks of my life in i dont know how long  my parents forced me to start working fulltime during the summers when i was 16 years old and part time during the school year  i got fucked out of a lot of normal high school and college summer activities because they had me working manual labor jobs from 7am to 3pm everyday    this was going to be my first summer off in eighteen fucking years      i have fixed up my house ive fixed up my yard ive got a big garden going ive read over 30 books ive been learning french im learning to play the saxophone again i started paintingive really been fucking happy     i dont know how the fuck i can go back to work    and the thing is my job wouldnt be that bad if it wasnt for the corporate bullshit  like most large companies i cant stand the fakeness of it  it literally sickens me  the pretending to care about every employee and their well being and the morons i work with who believe it  monday is a federal holiday  guess what mandatory full shift on saturday  and what do these idiots coworkers say well the company has to make money and they need the product  nothing we can do about it    not to mention the low level supervisorsim sorry team leaders gotta use that bs term to make employees feel more comfortable   getting my fucking ass ridden even when im working hard    oh you were suppose to make 200 of these products todaywhy did you only make 198you had to use the bathroom  well obviously you were on your phone or fooling around  fucking excuse me  im 34 years old  who the fuck are you to talk to me like that  i had to take a shit like every other person does  im pretty sure every time i walk by your office youre leaning back in your chair on your fucking phone  who is calling you out  or i saw you were at the punch out clock at 11 minutes of the houryou know that employees cant line up until 10 minutes on the hour  yes i know that every single clock we have up shows a different time and yes i know we will suspend you even if you just lift your cell phone slightly from your pocket to see the actual timebut im going to have write you up  fucking hell the juvenile and childish treatment you get and the way youre spoken down to    maybe some of you will disagree but i could probably fucking deal with my job on an ok level if it wasnt for bullshit like that     fuck    i just wanted a summer off,hfc9jn

146,I’m so boned. tl;dr at bottom.,the company ive been working for the past year did not have their contract renewed so now im out of a job  the company that until very soon signs my checks is contracted out to do its services for other businesses     due to poor upper management the client decided to move on to a competitor leaving us in the area employed by the original contract sht out of luck  thats the only fact that i know up until this point    the same management thats screwed us out of decent health benefits has forfeited paying out any unused pto  theyll likely loophole us into screwing us out of unemployment as well writing this off as us quitting or something  i wasnt hired as a contract employee so im very blindsided comparable positions have been held for 5 years  there wont be any available positions locally with the company although they do have contracts in other states sc btw  apparently we signed a noncompete clause when hired so the competitor would have to pay an obscene amount to hire us on which is very unlikely     the last thing this company has to offer me is unemployment benefits  ive been quiet about plenty of unfair practices but they at least owe me that  the company also knows our labor force is the last thing they have to offer the client or competitor as to say we treat our employees like crap but theyre willing to stick around   i just want one last screw you to the company who made it seem like my work ethic effected my job availability at the end of the day  how do i even continue going into work  knowing its only going to get worse as the competitor comes in to place their signage and equipment  its not like this is a topnotch career so how can i be bothered to reapply and reinterview for the crappy job that i already have   tldr  company contract not renewed and even though im not a contract employee theyre screwing me at every turn including with unemployment benefits,he7lke
147,Just got fired from my job after taking a week off to recover from an injury.,on sunday june 14 i got injured hiking i had to be rescued by the local fire department and paramedics by being pulled vertically up the side of a cliff while tightly strapped in to what was essentially a plastic sledwhich triggered the fuck out of my vertigo to no end  i dont even like rollercoasters   i called my boss later that evening after i came to terms with my anxiety and shock surrounding the entire situation and he said no problem take some time i hope to see you in the office soon come thursday i have to go back to the hospital because it turns out the wound became infected so i had to get antibiotics and was advised to take that day and friday off including the weekend so i could be back in the office today i was given a doctors note  im not feeling great today my foot is wrapped i still feel sore im on crutches but i was ready to go to work i walk in coworkers open the door for me etc welcome back hope youre feeling better etc i sit at my desk and all the sudden my boss asks me to take a walk with him i get into the room and we have a meeting with hr   long story short i was fired   this isnt the first time this place has fired people under undesirable circumstances i had a coworkerfriend fired around 6 months ago after having to take an extended leave after a total collision getting hit by an impaired driver his body was basically ruined was doing physio and was on heavy prescibed drugs  i fucking hate corporate culture,hdtbgr
148,The quarantine has made me realize that I don’t really want to go back to work.,where im from the quarantine isnt fully over yet as an intern im in a particular condition in regards to employment and the team where i work has been slowly going back to work but the interns and a lot of other people havent yet ive been lucky enough that ive been paid the full 3 months that weve been in quarantine  and you know what makes it just how clear how antiwork ive turned recently is that i actually like this job i could see myself working there its 6 hours a day 5 days a week and they pay well  but ever since i started i started working here ive been thinking about just how much unnecessary labour we do as much as i like my job and in its needed in context ive felt that what i do is ultimately meaningless plus theres no shortage of shitty coworkers that i have to deal with and that all rolls up into a nice ball of antiwork sentiment ive developed over time after less than 2 years of entering the workforce as a professional ive been working since i was around 16 but it was just under the table money  i do want to work but not for profit and under the threat of homelessness and starvation and not for someone else i want to work for myself for those around me and for the good of humanity and i want to have a satisfactory life i dont want to spend the rest of my days in uneventful safety  its just so hard to fight back against that little voice of internalized capitalism that says youre not worthy unless youre being productive you need economic safety and stability etc and ive been considering going to college again to study something with which i can help people plus i love learning stuff overall  i absolutely love my field of study and i am good at it its just a little selfindulgent which is fine i love it its good for my mental health and ive been doing it for my own enjoyment without it having generated me any income for years now and i dont plan to stop its for me but in the context of work it just isnt all that gratifying and it even feels vapid  i do some volunteer work which is how i got the internship in the first place and my internship tasks blended a bit with my volunteer work and i just felt so discouraged for a moment just thinking about going back to work  and idk im just ranting at this point this isnt meant to be particularly insightful i just wanted to share this with other who i know feel simmilarly and ive realized that i could honestly just go the rest of my life without working and instead balancing my own enjoyment with the impetus i feel for helping humanity,he10v3
149,I found this sub.,i havent read much into it but i feel this is the place for the topic  i dont like working really it all feels repetitive what i want to do is just make art and games i know i can commission art or make small indie games but honestly i dont think that shit pays the bills  i dont want to be rich i never have whenever someone asked me what id do if i won the lottery id say live comfortably and when i say that i dont mean mansions or big parties i mean a small cozy apartment where i can spend my days on my computer drawing art or making games to play if i had extra money id probably give it to charity because i really dont think i need a lot to live on i dont wanna live of bare minimum but i dont want to be rich just comfortable  i want everyone to live comfortable because i know the struggle things seem to just be first come first serve with businesses and such meaning you can rarely ever try to get rich regardless of the amount of motivational speeches out there about it it really feels like a coin toss to get anywhere in life  im not entirely antiwork i just dont think we need to work to live because then we arent living,hdrhhf
150,"Starting over, how do I make the most?",i am moving to a new country in hopefully about 9 months i will basically only know my wife and her family there so im basically completely starting over i want to make the most of this opportunity and not get stuck in the same ol 40 hours a week in a stuffy office but i dont know how to be completely  honest i dont feel like i have any remarkable skills im pretty decent with excel and making spreadsheets for analyzing data but thats not that uncommon i like tinkering with stuff but dont have that much pc knowledge to repair or be in it or have my own business with that i love working from home and being able to do things on my schedule and cookeat when i wanted not have to deal with distracting coworkers that dont shut up etc  what kind of suggestions would any of you have to capitalize on my opportunity my wife has suggested i go to school when i get there to help with getting a job but i dont want to get student loans and spend all that work and time unless i can figure out how to make it work as my own business or at the very least be able to find a job where i can work remotely ive thought maybe study something itweb design related but that market seems so saturated already i dont know what kind of opportunities i would have there what would you all do if you were in my shoes,hejg8r
151,Biological existence is a dictatorship - all living organisms are fundamentally slaves,we are also economic slaves to money and work submit to labor in exchange for a paycheck or starve to death on the street  due to having no purchasing power and thus in this current system no right to life most people in the modern world are not able to go live in the woods and make that function they lack those skills so it is a gun to the head scenario with no alternatives for the vast majority  and even if you are willing to work for money to pay for rent and food  but are unable to obtain employment you will starve to death on the street despite being willing to slave away to maintain your futile temporary existence  you may indeed even be one of those rare people who genuinely enjoys your jobworkcareer that does not however change the fact that you still do have to do it and you will starve on the streets if you did not do it or found some other work in exchange for a paycheck in case you quit the current occupation to substitute in some other source of monetary income  people that love their jobs and are genuinely fulfilled by it and see it as meaningful and engaging are no different from samuel jacksons character in django unchained  a slave who enjoys being a slave and likes his slave master you can be a slave who finds it acceptable and even enjoyable or you can despise it with every ounce of your being and resent it to the ultimate degree but both are equally slaves  now in a similar sense we are biological slaves we must eat we must drink we must maintain a certain body temperature we must breathe oxygen etc  now you may say well i enjoy eating i enjoy drinking i enjoy seeking out a comfortable body temperature i enjoy breathing i love fresh air i like that things are like that  ok  but that does not change the fact that you indeed are a slave to all of that you have to do those things or you suffer and die you may be happy with that situation and somehow find it justifiable and acceptable that you are a monetary slave and a biological slave and you can make peace with it or maybe even find it to be just and proper that this is the state of affairs that this is how things are  but you are a slave though and so is quite literally every single living organism that does or has ever existed on this planet  until they eventually died anyways despite any efforts they ever made,hed97q

160,Man I just need to rant,tldr  i hate my union carpenter job been laid off wifes pregnant no insurance cant go back or i might lose my mind fuck    im depressed just bought a house unemployed wifes pregnant no insurance trying to get medicaid for my wife and kid   i was laid off from my job as a union carpenter at the begging of the pandemic i was honestly pumped i hate that job i hate the people i hate working my ass off so that the boss can make more money while i lay in bed at night not able to move because my body is so sore   as long as i work and got enough hours in my insurance premiums were paid for well guess what happens when you dont work and theres a global pandemic you lose your insurance or pay 1050month out of pocket to keep insurance isnt that funny if you dont work you dont make money but you somehow have to come up with 1050 to keep insurance the only thing keeping us afloat is the extra 600wk the government has given us for unemployment but that will soon be over   i dont want to go back to the union i hate everything about it they make it seem like a great opportunity yet all they care about is production over quality then when you do a shitty job to meet production you get yelled at and laid off youre just a number and unless you start sucking dick youre toast ive been doing it for 2 years and i bust my ass for a company just for the job to end and all that hard work go unnoticed and i have to start all over again with a new company  i have an opportunity to do a new job that gives me freedom and flexibility and ultimately less hours per week no insurance offered though and possible weeks off in the winter due to weather but it doesnt fit the mold we are so convinced is the only way my wife is scared im scared weve been stressed and pissed and dont know what the fuck to do i cant continue to kill myself at a job i fucking hate but i also need to provide for my family but idk what to do   how do we as a whole fix the way things operate how do we help people see the error in capitalism how do we combat this shit that we see as bad and other people dont see at all god idk im lost and freaking out,hg1ki5
161,Stuck with people who refuse to understand,im 24 been living with my parents in my childhood home for almost a year now along with my two brothers as of  april im working at a small local market garden which i enjoy id still rather be spending most of my time on other things and would prefer to not hand over most of my labour value to my boss but its better than anything else ive done my parents are concerned about my future i am trying to keep an eye out for a small camper van to move into so i can live rentfree on unemployment for a while and finally gtfo of this town but my dad is against this idea since he insists that its somehow more of a burden to maintain and repair a camper than it is to burn half your paycheque every month on a single room in a basement suite somewhere they are convinced that the best course of action would be for me to go back to school and then somehow immediately land a highpaying job that you can tolerate upon graduation someone can feel free to let me know if this is even reasonably possible anymore because to me it seems completely out of touch and on par with just go into the building give them a resume and ask for an interview  on top of this im pretty convinced there is virtually no job that i can tolerate because the entire concept of wage labour as a precondition of subsistence  that we are expected to spend 40 hours a week toiling on often completely useless tasks just to prove that we are worthy of warmth and calories  completely and utterly disgusts me to my core and thats before the whole exploitation of labour value thing they cant seem to understand that i would much rather scrape by in a van posting music on the internet and maybe selling custom tee shirts than spend half my waking hours completely disassociating just so i can give half my money to a parasitic dirtbag in exchange for permission to live in a building they own   oh and my dad shames me for smoking weed  tldr stuck with my complacent brainwashed parents who are trying to push me towards the same boring bs life path that they took back in the 80s when job stability moderately affordable rent livable entrylevel wages and degrees that carried more weight than the paper they were printed on actually existed they think i am entitled for trying to explain why that life path is not really that viable anymore and i wouldnt be particularly interested in it if i was they have completely bought in,hffxph

170,People need to be very careful hoping the U.S. goes to a permanent work from home culture., tldr careful wishing wfh is going to possibly lead to 5060 hour work weeks with no ot and no pay increases it could also spur law changes leading to the 777 be ready at 7 sign off at 7 all 7 days with availability 247  i think the real argument going on in the us is whether the 40 hr workweek needs to be reevaluated  initial panic if they cant see you and demand you do more than what they hired you for their long term game is screwed  but in the end the worker will get screwed no matter what  this leads to meetings with strategists and hr  before you know it lobbyists are influencing congress to roll back ot fmla etc leading to the 777 report at 7 sign off at 7 all 7 daysand be available 247  frankly id go in for 3 days a week or just let me wfh 4 come in one   this is a slippery slope wfh employers will eventually want you to work at all hours and theyll probably add a lot more assignments to your plate knowing that you have all the time in the world to get it done at home no commute thats 2 more hours for the company  they forget thats before 8 all of a sudden its work time so i think a lot of people should be really careful about getting permanent wfh doing some kind of hybrid system to just remind the boss that you are a person hired to do 40 hours worth of work not 90 hours worth of work because theyll expect you to juggle being home while working all the time  personally i see the idea of ot being a thing of the past for wfh  instead of 40 hour weeks why not 50 or 60 since there are no commutes no lunch runs no rush home to family needs ah but no pay increases theyve been generous allowing you to wfh  careful,hfxoea

178,Small businesses,inasmuch as i have to work ive always preferred to work for small businesses its easier to build acrosstheboard solidarity among staff in most cases and you can easily make changes in daytoday processes and practices if you have a good idea the pitfalls have always been that pay is as low as the can keep it and you often run into narcissistic owners who cant stand for the business to do something that wasnt solely their idea ive had owners either claim my idea was theirs or tell me that wed introduce my ideas for change and then decide against it at the last moment i honestly like working to a point i tend to be a little asocial if left to my own devices so having social interaction forced on me is helpful i dont need a ton of money i could live on 2k net a month here in dc but itd be nice to make that amount of money in 40 hours a week instead of having to find a second job which are nowhere to be found rn bc unemployment is so high and people are going back to work no ones hiring for nights and weekends and itd be nice to have actual input into decision making especially considering that the safety protocols concerning covid at the business i work for leave a lot to be desired  i think that we need to find a way to work for small businesses when we can unionize those businesses to demand increases in base pay and regularly scheduled raises and anywhere you can encourage people to accept that they dont need everything immediately they dont need every convenience we have to reduce our dependence on large corporations or else we have to set everything on fire,hdqz9f

187,My job is making me physically sick : I'm quitting on payday.,ive been working for this company for a year and a half now owner is a complete crook and the work conditions have gone down recently i used to work from home during corona and ive gone back to office on monday my new workplace is an hour away from home  old workplace before lockdown was 15min away  ive tried discussing work conditions to him but it fell on deaf ears honestly ive only been back in office two days and this morning  and the past two mornings ive felt sick to my stomach im just gonna take my paycheck and go im going to be left with this paycheck minimal savings and a small freelance income but id rather risk it than continue to let this job ruin my life ive hated it from day 1 and im the only employee left all the others left within 36 months because its really that bad  anybody else has quit with nothing lined up    i have no new job in sight but i have a plan im currently making 1kmonth roughly on freelance so i want to increase that and just top it up with unemployment then cut down on my living expenses to grow my freelance and living off of it within a year how does it sound ,hewmsw

196,Unions are *not* the answer.,the leftcommunist theoretician paul mattick explains it as follows  httpswwwmarxistsorgarchivemattickpaul1975lebelhtm  gtparliamentary parties and trade unions lose their limited effectiveness when it is no longer possible to combine an improvement of workers living standards with a progressive expansion of capital under conditions which preclude a sufficient capitalist accumulation that is under conditions of economic crisis the reformist activities of political parties and trade unions cease to be operative and these organisations abstain from their supposed functions as they would now endanger the capitalist system itself they will rather try to help sustain the system up to the point of directly sabotaging the workers aspirations for better living and working conditions they will help capitalism overcome its crisis at the expense of the workers in such a situation the workers unwilling to submit to the dictates of capital are forced to resort to activities not sanctioned by official labor organisations to socalled wildcat strikes factory occupations and other form of direct actions outside the control of the established labor organisations these selfdetermined activities with their temporary council structure indicate the possibility of their radical application under arising revolutionary situations replacing the traditional organisational forms which have become a hindrance for both the struggle for immediate needs and for revolutionary goals  the union form cannot transcend capital because it relies on it for its own legitimacy it requires duespaying members and a bureaucratic link to capital this holds good even of genuinely radical outfits like the iww  what in my view would be more revolutionary would be a group that organized against the workplace rather than inside of it which taught workers how to drop out of the system sustainably,hew12z

198,Living on welfare can be a choice and it doesn't mean that one is lazy or doesn't want to work. How living on welfare allows me to give more to my community.,im not living in the us but in one or those european social democracy with a generous welfare state and i thank life every day that i was born here unfortunately here too the people on welfare are often ridiculed as lazy entitled by those who have a full time job  here is why living on welfare can be a choice of life  living on welfare allows me to spend more time working on my nonprofit organization which focuses on helping organizing cultural activities and events in the community as well as helping those in need single parents the unemployed children with special needs etc  we organize all sorts of events year round where the people living here can gather and get to know each other and socialize which as a result created a closer more social community we organize everything from dinners to barbecues to concerts to promoting local artists to sport activities such as treks and football matches to craft workshops etc  of course as a nonprofit we benefit from donations by residents as well as subsidies from the government without which none of these would be possible but thats not the point  we went from being a community where no one talked to their neighbors where some kids would drop out of school where there was some petty crime issues nothing bad just theft and the like to being a living breathing community where the people all know each other and watch out for their neighbors the petty crime has disappeared and far fewer kids drop out of school  im not talking credit for any of it id just like people to recognize and to admit that communities benefit from having events and activities organized where anyone can join to have a social nonprofit looking out for the needy in the community and to do their best to help them none of which would be possible without welfare because id have to work 40h a week and would come back home too tired to do anything  and im not earning a cent from the donations or subsidies the surplus is systemically reinvested into the community im only getting my welfare check and thats it,hdpc50

223,"Works Sucks, But Humans Have Been Stuck With It Since Prehistory And We Moderns Have It Better",it sucks that 13 of my day is devoted to work i would rather not sacrifice the best hours of the best days of the only life ill ever know just to create wealth for somebody else  however out species has never truly been work free jungle tribes in africa and the amazon spend practically all of their waking hours working its not so hard to imagine that this was the case when we were all hunter gatherers our ancestors spent all day and night struggling to eat and survive against predators and the only pay they got was the direct fruits of their labors and nothing more  i still hate working but im thankful i dont work and live like a prehistoric man i only have to dedicate 13 of my day to work 13 to sleep and i still have 13 to do with as i pleaseand i get every weekend to myself unlike prehistoric man what i earn can be saved and invested the work itself isnt even so bad   so maybe most of us are cogs in a massive machine but i think its better than the alternative which is to live naked in a jungle tribe tribesmen dont get weekends off or investment accounts,hd5ht6

226,Entrepreneurship not the answer?,warning long post thank you for reading if you so   i just found this subreddit a few weeks ago and ive never felt more understood ive worked a variety of jobs over the years ranging from physical labor to desk jobs to a brief stint in selfemployment im currently working a desk job and the last few months working remotely have genuinely saved my sanity   i keep trying to formulate some plot to make money to be able to quit and not be reliant on another job but ive run circles in my mind for almost 2 years now because of the dilemmas i see from every side for example   when i had my own business i was working 14 hour days and even though it paid off handsomely i was the most miserable and mentally unwell as i had likely ever been however i did feel a sense of accomplishment at the end for weathering the storm and in retrospect the pain didnt seem so bad although i know it was because i was crying  having panic attacks every day for a month    at any job ive had either physical or mental ive been miserable after about month 3 when the honeymoon phase and excitement from leaving my last job started to wear off ive always seen so many flaws in every job from the treatment to the authorities to the actual tasks for a long time i thought there was something wrong with me because i couldnt find contentment and then i went into convincing myself that i had to find some form of business ownership again or entrepreneurship    however the problem is that i have very strong moral issues with much of entrepreneurship in regards to consumerism materialism and capitalism i hate how marketing is constantly shoving every person place and thing down my throat and it physically disgusts me to think of doing that to others for my own sake but im getting so depressed and miserable over the years that i keep going back and forth between selling out for the sake of getting money to be able to get out of the rat race part of me just always thinks i should just do absolutely whatever i have to do to make my own life and situation better and then once i have enough money i can retire and work on the writing art hobbies etc i really want to the sad part is ive even tried to on several occasions ive tried to sell a product sell myself as a personal brand or coach come up with some new concept or idea and i just feel so phony and fake i feel like such a sham and am gritting my teeth the whole time until i eventually just stop after a little while hence i never stick with it or put in a real enough effort to actually have success with it and in a way its almost like i psychologically dont believe i would be successful or would deserve that success because of how morally unaligned i would be with those pursuits   basically im just wondering does anyone have any true solution or advice because even being my own boss or entrepreneurship is beginning to seem like a crock of shit too i want to be a writer  artist essentially but even a lot of those types end up falling into what i feel like is selling out by selling dumb merch more consumerism more commercialization of art i dont find it wrong to make money off of your art but i do feel like there hits a certain point where it becomes a cash grab i just want to make enough money to survive and help my family i dont need a lot or want to be greedy i just am so tired and drained thinking of wasting my entire life supporting causes i dont believe in and working jobs i absolutely hate i think there are also ways of being an ethical  conscious entrepreneur or business owner but im struggling to find a way   thanks for reading if you did hopefully one of you might relate i wish you all the best as always,hdgsxy

233,Is depression just a chemical imbalance?,this might be unpopular but when i go on the depression subreddit and most people talk about their problems the positive answers always go on in elaborate detail about how ones brain is physically and individually dysfunctional and lacking the chemical balances that make normal people normal  i am in no way a medical expert but cant they at least imagine that there can actually be a factor our society that contributes to depression or even causes the chemical imbalance or do we ignore that possibility because that idea is too much to accept,hf8rdx
234,It's disturbing how much black history is married to corporate greed...,this seems offtopic at first glance i promise it is not  ive been trying to learn more about blacklifematters recently as ive always just been content to sit on the alllifematters bench and avoid the discomfort of learning more to start this process i listend to the podcast 1619 and watched 13th on netflix  to start with selling humans to get land or goods the original proof that corporations run on blood  but it continues through today i strongly encourage anyone who hasnt watched them to do so even if youre ignoring the racism you can look at the system that feed politics corporate greed or the devaluing all human life  i was already antiwork before these things very much anticorporation and antipolitics thats probably why i was so observant of them for these past four hundred years it was honestly concerning to me that this has been basically going on in different forms for as long as it has we just have computers now,hfd47i

239,We Can Protect the Economy From Pandemics. Why Didn't We? What's next? Asteroid Insurance?,interesting business article i posted it here as i think it is ironic that capitalisms approach to mitigating economic effects of a pandemic is to productize it and profit from it the article is basically about pandemic insurance i like wired but disappointed that they would herald this approach to what should be a humanitarian solution not a lets sell some insurance and make a buck solution we already pay unemployment insurance we pay social security insurance we sock away money in iras hopefully we do that and now they want us to pay for pandemic insurance i always thought technological advancement was at least ideally or partially to free laborers from tedious jobs that a machine could do so that those laborers could pursue education or art or other past times to better themselves and learn or study instead of having to work more than half of our lives just to put food on the table,hej34e
240,Former boss who fired me a year ago sent an email pretending to offer me “per diem work.” I was such an awful employee yet he wants me back? Interesting!,just to be clear i know hes 100 the greediest and most litigious bastard i have ever known i know this is a ruse to make me disqualify for unemployment because he doesnt want to pay the teeny tiny tax increase that will come from what ive collected so far  im honestly not even sure if refusingnot responding to this would disqualify me because im pretty sure that it has to have actual details of the job spelled out also im not sure how the cares no work search requirement affects the whole you must take any job offered to you deal but i havent actually dropped below my normal hours this month and probably will not again im not really even that worried about it its just a great example of how fucked the system is oh and when he fired me he offered one day of pay  3 months of health insurance in exchange for not filing for unemployment which was essentially illegal of him to do   anyway this is the email he sent me  hope this finds you well i got a notice from the unemployment of folks that you were collecting uc and they charge my from the fund that i had paid into  if necessary for me to cover a possible staff absence are you available for perdiem work please let me know thanks  sic on the whole damn thing because he cant even bother to take the time to type complete sentences or use punctuation he dictates emails and sends them 100 asis,hegq9d

244,The thought of going back to my overbearing coworker makes me ill,i had only been at my job a few months before lockdown began uk and in that time i grew to loathe the other person in my department lets call her mary   mary is in her fortys mary cannot work a computer she cannot figure out how to open emails she cannot work word mary believes because i can do these things i am a technological genius all day every day mary will interrupt me demanding i stop what im doing and help her i try to teach her things but she refuses on one occasion putting her fingers in her ears and saying look im no good with this sort of thing its easier this way were allowed to have headphones in at work to listen to low level music and one day i noticed that i was not able to get through a whole song without being interrupted and having to pause it  i made the mistake of giving mary my number when i started her requests extended into the weekend however these were not work related she would text asking me things like how to share a post on facebook how to unfriend someone and even explain what twitter was   i have mentioned this to management i was quite passive at first because i was new and didnt want to start my new job by complaining about someone managements response was along the lines of well shes been here a long time its just who she is they didnt seem concerned that mary was preventing me from doing the job they paid me for   working at home has led to me being much more productive mainly because i can actually do my job without her driving me crazy but even then she would use messenger to contact me and ask for help and some of these matters would not even be work related she once called saying she had just purchased a laptop and wanted me to set it up for her over the phone   work started letting us come back part time they only wanted us to come in once a week basically to show our faces and start getting back into the swing of having a routine the day we could go in was our choice mary immediately called me im going in on tuesdays i decided i was going in on thursdays mary text me asking where i was on her day and when i didnt reply immediately she called me repeatedly until i answered saying that she felt it would be better if i came in when she was in as we would work better as a team in other words come in so you can do my work as well as your own  work have now announced we are to return full time at the beginning of july i dont want to go back the thought of putting up with mary again almost makes me cry i want to look for another job but jobs in my field are scarce in my area of the uk and it took me a long time to find this one,hfizst
245,Just had my car REPOd because of my job struggles - any advice would be extremely helpful,so before this whole coronavirus situation happened i was working happily as an uber driver making about 20003000 a month but then everything went to hell and it was no longer a viable work option i stopped being able to pay off my bills and switched to shipt to try and make the money i needed for the most part it was working well not nearly as well but it was enough to make some money i ended up getting lazy though and stopped working for a week and a half or so from mental exhaustion plus i was enjoying spending time with my best friend online as much as possible  i was going to go back to working super hard with shipt 12 hour days plus uber afterward for whatever crowd i could pull in to make extra income but went to my car today and found it missing i knew i was behind on payments and called the company that handles my payments and they confirmed it was repod now i have to come up with anywhere between 12001500 of which i could maybe do like 500 right now in order to get my car back they told me on the phone that it would cost 300500 in repo fees and im about 900 behind on my actual car payment i could maybe negotiate it down with them when they open tomorrow but i am not sure by how much or if i can get my car back at all i might have to take out a payday advance loan despite how dangerous that can be and assuming i can even get that to work with my currently very terrible credit but other than that im currently not sure what to do  does anyone have any advice at all im on the verge of a severe anxiety attack from this happening today and recognize that it is in good part my own fault for not working harder but i need to get through this somehow otherwise ill have literally no way to make money and soon after that no place to live for me or my roommate who is relying on my portion of the rent,he4tvo

248,Housing costs are disproportional and the largest weight on workers and society,housing costs and rent continually rise and is  disporportionally the largest expense for the working class people can always adjust their source of food limit the use of utilities take public transit or wear usedhanded down clothing to cut costs housing on the other hand will typically take the largest portion out of your income and the continued pressure of the rentmortgage bring due is always looming above your head   sometimes i wonder what society would look like if the cost of housing was more aligned with other usual expenses i imagine that people would feel more secure happier take more risks in business ventures learn or try new skills or quit the job they hate to try something else that maybe doesnt pay as much the threat of potentially being kicked out onto the streets keeps people in the continual ratrace cycle to maintain having some form of a sanctuary despite the increasing cost rant,he9ip1

252,Existential depression because of work,im glad i found this subreddit i knew there mustve been more people like me that feel existential depression on sundays or in general i think its the ultimate human tragedy that we only get one chance at life atheistically and we literally spend it working it away making someone else rich and by the time were allowed to stop were already old and frail ready to die i think about how human existence was meant to be spent exploring the greater mysteries of life trying to connect with nature through transcendentalism but here we are  in the middle of a pandemic that is being downplayed by politicians bough by corporate overlords just so they can explore those same mysteries at the expense of human capital hoarding their riches the depravity of our modern condition is that we were born into this broken social contract under the guise of civility and progress when it fact this is just an incredibly unfair food chain the rich eat the poor basically sure we are sentient beings that enjoy things no other species enjoy like comfort hedonism consumerism etc but is it really worth it though i think wed be happier with underdeveloped human ingenuity  sometimes watching a sunset at beach knowing you dont have to worry about anything is way better than getting that new pair of grails or that latest smartphone that has a much smoother and seamless processing power to give even more of your identity away to the powers that be i think our species was meant to be kept in eternal captivity as if we are paying for past cosmic crimes against existence here i am working my life away at a place i hate making someone else rich that has no regards for my health and wellbeing during this pandemic and i cant even quit because i need the societal construct of money to live this is the closest thing to a hell that exists i wonder sometimes if then the reward we get at the end of our lives is just nonexistence  the fact that we will form part of an eternal emptiness blackness devoid of all human angst and joy,hdytib

262,Wondering how many people here are also childfree?,i had a hysterectomy two years ago at age 23 and im okay with it bc i already feel like i have no life between a 8 hr work day and 2 hour commute which thanks to covid is now 5 minutes to my laptop on my couch except for going to the office once a week   i just get so touched out like i cant talk to people for too much time or be around people all day i just need space kids would absolutely overwhelm me and take up any free time  i just want to be productive in doing things i enjoy my anti work mindset isnt laziness its just i want to create and exist as a person and do things im passionate about i like other peoples kids but i never ever want my own sometimes i get that sad feeling that i want a baby but dont want to be a parent i want to work but i want it to be my definition of work and a livelihood   heres to starting to pursue other avenues so i can spend the rest of my 20s at least working part time doing what i want by my own volition and part time slaying away at some office  ive worked as a public servant in state government for a while now and im just kinda over it i was a workaholic for years and i climbed the ladder fast and make a really good salary for my age but my partner who thankfully is also childfree in mindset doesnt at all understand why id want to take a pay cut or leave behind my retirement or the ton of leave time or promised pension which isnt as good as his since i started a few years later after they changed it  thanks to older generations totally and completely sucking it dry  this has become a nonsensical rant but yeah im just curious is anyone else childfree or plan to be my partner is childfree too but we dont see eye to eye on the definition of work how did you get your partners to understand you have more of a free spirit than being a typical 95er i dont see myself doing the same job year after year i want some autonomy or start my own small business and id tolerate working part time for someone like i wanna pay my bills but id give up some extra fun money if i could sustain my own creative endeavors and make money,hf9hgg

275,Careers that aren't bullshit?,hi there guys finally read bullshit jobs by david graeber one of my favourite reads ever but it did make me realise my job as a data analyst for consumer debt where i shit out charts for my boss new and efficient consumer tranches and segments is largely bullshit the impact it has on society is at best nothing and at worst probably pernicious i want out  nothing made me realise that more than this morning while cleaning out my cellar while i was preparing to move house i had my headphones on listening to podcast and turned a dusty mouldy mess into something aesthetically pleasing ive long thought about how nice it would be to be a postman just walking around with headphones in all day dropping mail or a teacher or a plumber because those jobs actually do something for people   is there any resource that i can use to find the non bullshit jobs and career fields i want out,hfpjsu
276,I’m new and I’d love to hear your anti-work related thoughts,so whenever i start talking to people about the fact that we made up most jobs and its absolute bullshit jobs mostly to keep pockets full people think im off my rocker and that im just looking for excuses to freeload but the more i investigate the crazier the system seems im finding it increasingly difficult to pretend like anything matters outside of taking care of animals and nature who provides for us and loving each otherbeing togetherbuilding communitieslaughterisnt that all that matters so what are some of your best arguments or insights to support antiwork,h9pdw8
277,"Can't believe there's other people who think this stuff about work , I thought I was alone (rant)",ive been thinking this way about work ever since i got my first job at 15 and had a complete breakdown because i felt so bad for the people who worked at my job and were adults and had been doing it for years it was working at a farm doing packaging stuff at like 20 i called my mom sobbing because i was working a job that was ruining my life not because it was particularly bad but because it took all my time and i was a young person trying to be free in the world and i was already trapped in this horrible cycle of work to live live to work but she didnt get it and i felt so ashamed for being weak that i blame my depression and anxiety on other things so that people would understand i just feel like how did we all accept that working is what makes you a valuable human being and if you dont do it then you are not worth shit its horrible and the thing is if working wasnt absolutely required id definitely do some of it anyways just to help society id gladly do it but the way we have like limited what kind of jobs each person does means that everything is outsourced and each person is relegated to one form of contribution and i think it just ruins all our humanity and all our communitypotential connections because when someone needs my help or something if im already working 40 hours a week im way more likely to say thats not my job  anytime ive criticized working culture in my life people have made fun of me like im stupid and just dont understand economics which is partly true i dont understand economics it was because i was like what is job creation if there is a job to be done shouldnt it already be there why are we creating it but i know that humans are miserable and that should matter  i also think the people at the top are miserable because theyve bought in with their very lives and energy and time into this system that makes us all relate to one another in terms of money and production value theyre just rich enough to not be outwardly miserable but i think this shit erodes your spirit and your ability to connect with other people   there has to be a different way to live and i hate that being part of the working class takes away your ability to explore art and ideas and have a forum to like discuss them and be seen and heard about your ideas about the world you can still do these things obviously by yourself but it just feels like there is no one who gives a shit about my feelings because if my feelings were correct i would have ascended the magical structure already like why do we care about celebrities thoughts on things they have no background in just because they are rich and famous we should listen to what they think about dieting or about education or child care etc   this has been a rant but i was really relieved to find some people who think that the concept of working your life away for someone else is crazy thanks for existing,h9vsad

283,It's so sad that all my talks with my family are me answering their questions about work,like its how we relate to each other when they update me on my brother its about how his job is going its never about him its about the company and when they talk to me its always about when will i go back to work and im like eh i dont care im having a good time not being there and they are like we thought you wouldnt do well without a job and then i can literally be like im doing great but they dont believe it and still want me to get back to work its like these companies like have taken over our very personalities and connections so many of my friends from hs when i see or talk to them its about work and i try to talk about other stuff but like they just arent separable from their jobs it makes me feel like such a loser for still working an hourly wage job when some of my friends have like salary jobs because i dont really want to share about my work as if its like part of some long career journey its just what i do to survive i guess we just chose different paths but its like were getting further and further apart and im scared one day we wont be able to relate to each other at all how sad is that,hahsf6
284,Work is increasing everyone's shifts by 2 hours because of coronavirus yet we still only get a 20 minute break.,im honestly so angry about this my work is reopening soon and theyve decided to put us into bubbles so the same staff work together and if someone in one bubble gets infected they dont spread it to everyone   so now were all doing 10 hour shifts for the foreseeable future no choice no apology and no extension of the pitiful 20 minute break that we should apparently be so grateful to have because its paid   im so stupid i really thought this pandemic might improve working conditions but clearly its just going to make them even more intolerable   i hated my job anyway so this is just the icing on the shit cake,h9qnbc

299,"We need to break the economy of slavery, once and for all",the problem is too many people believe that a slavery based system is the only way to make things work   the problem is the slave system has been in effect from the early days of where there is registry of a civilization   capitalism simply changed the style of slavery instead of directly threatening people and using physical force and deliberate mechanisms to make the slave work now we have psychological schemes that make people believe that the right thing to do is to be a good slave   one of the basic concepts is to switch the idea of slavework to career and to be professional instead of the physical punishment a lazy or rebel slave would have now there is the psychological punishment where the person is regarded as unworthy valueless despicable deplorable a loser a waste of space a selfabsorbed parasite a free loader an enemy of society a diseased a jobless person is not a person and the vast majority of people hold that type of view   even if an individual is a helpful person a person that actually does things that would be considered work if they were performed under an official contract but theres no paycheck the person is viewed as useless if you simply go about helping people doing lots of work but has no official career you would be seen as a bump a drifter a hippie but if you have an official job with a monthly paycheck doing nothing youd be regarded as a productive member of society  also in many jobs the amount of money the person needs in order to be eligible to participate in that kind of work social position can be equivalent to the actual pay the person is getting therefore the persons salary is used only to maintain her as a functional worker basically the money they get serves to pay for the lifestyle attached to the job position that is the very dynamic of slavery the slave has what is necessary to properly perform their daily functions im not disputing that life quality has greatly improved to most people and that real slavery with violent punishment was much worse and a horrible thing but the social dynamics are still prevalent today,hcglhv

303,A fork in the road.,hello all just found this community and really connected with the ideas i have been reading about here   i am a 28yo nurse i have been working for about three years in nursing and im halfway through my masters degree   some back story my dad passed away a few years ago and he spent his entire life working 80 hours a week until his last few years where he actually got to live a life he enjoyed then he died   that shit changed me i realized how fragile life is and how much i did not want to do what he did because of this i have been studying the fire movement if you havent heard of this its financial independence retire early basically how can you best save and invest your assets to retire at a younger than normal age this post isnt about investing strategy but is a tool i plan to employ   anyhow im starting up my school again in the fall and i have two more years until i graduate my masters degree will come with a considerable pay raise but i cant honestly say that im excited to do the job i cant honestly say that i like or love my job that i have right now thats not to say that im not good at it im actually pretty damn good at nursing but i got pushed into the career field by well intentioned parents   i do have special moments that i will cherish forever and i am thankful for those but by and large i view my job as a way to earn income and nothing more i am proud of what i can do to save someones life and i am very thankful for the opportunities that i have had because of nursing but it is a job philosophically i dont understand how someone could love something that they have to do i need to work to earn money by definition i am not acting upon my own volition i am in the sense that i chose the job but you essentially have a list of options that you must choose from you dont get to choose to throw away the list entirely all in all i want to throw the list away i want to quit working by becoming financially independent im not sure if i should invest another two years into education and 15 grand it will bump up my pay considerably but im not sure i can handle the stress of it anyhow the problem is is im so far deep into it i might as well finish and at least have the degree who knows maybe ill love what i can do with my masters or is that just another dream the system wants me to believe after all i wouldnt be getting my masters if it didnt give me a pay raise   i figure this will be the place to ask this type of question im new here i appreciate any thoughts you can share,hbsy42

(1929)",but what will you do with the lazy man the man who does not want to work inquires your friend  that is an interesting question and you will probably be very much surprised when  say that there is really no such thing as laziness that we call a lazy man is generally a square man in a round hole that is the right man in the wrong place and you will always find that when a fellow is in the wrong place he will be efficient or swiftness for socalled laziness and a good deal of inefficiency are merely fitness displacement of you are compelled to do the thing you are united for by your inclinations or temperament you will be efficient at it if you are forced to do work you are not interested in you will be lazy at it ,hafhh0

308,"Investing: To play the game of capitalism, or not?",this is something ive been thinking about a lot lately to opt for the invest most of your income so that your money goes to work for you strategy youre essentially betting on the stability of capitalism for the next few decades at minimum its also in a way immoral if youre a hard leftist and thus consider all capital as theft but at the same time i cant really blame anyone for playing the game thats how you succeed in capitalism after all  my question is is this even a good idea are we reasonably sure that capitalism wont be overthrown within our lifetimes would you be willing to accept that in the event of a socialist revolution your entire stock account will be null and void and youd basically have to start over thus making all those resources poured into investment kind of pointless,hbxpxi
309,"Slavery remained the social condition of laboring no matter how many slaves were emancipated, the modern emancipation of labor was intended to elevate the laboring activity itself.",the chief difference between slave labor and modern free labor is not that the laborer possesses personal freedom  freedom of movement economic activity and personal inviolability  but that he is admitted to the political realm and fully emancipated as a citizen  slavery remained the social condition of laboring no matter how many slaves were emancipated the modern emancipation of labor was intended to elevate the laboring activity itself  the human condition  hannah arendt,hd59t7
310,The Opposite of Having too Many Work Hours,i see a lot of posts here talking about how their bosses make them sit around for 8 hour days doing nothing when the job theyre paid to do could be done in half the time but what about the opposite of that   i work in retail where every job description is ended with and more tasks as assigned i could work here 247 and still not get done all the work that should be done to keep this god forsaken store at a good level but the people who work themselves into the ground running around doing as much as possible get paid just as much as the people who chat all day,hcmpzj

314,What are your thoughts on feminism?,if i were a woman i would not want to work 40 hours a week i would prefer to stay home and take care of the children and cook and clean all of these tasks dont add up to the time spent on a job including getting ready and commuting  cooking and cleaning can be done in 2 hours meal prep to save time vacuums swiffers dish washers etc make household tasks quick and easy leaving more time to spend with the children   theres no boss do everything in pajamas play music watch spongebob with the kids that seems like a much better life than going to work everyday i find it hard to believe that women would give that up to go work a job   if i were a woman i would not want to be equal to a man if it means working a 9 to 5 i rather not have to work ironically women have given up what seems a better deal in the pursuit of equality   anyhow these are just my thoughts what do you think,h9p1z9

321,How long do you think it's going to be before employers start including the deep and dark webs into their background searches on prospective employees?,of course it will never happen you say its an unconscionable invasion of privacy and a gross breach of the sacred and implicit but endangered separation of work and personal spaces but keep this in mind at least 25 states have passed laws preventing employers from asking for demanding coercing etc employees to provide passwords or access to social media accounts such as facebook and twitter  those laws are there for a reason they werent developed by forwardthinking legislators taking proactive steps to prevent this from happening they were responding to employers who were actually doing this facebook went live in 2004 it became available to everyone in 2006 remember prior to that you had to have a school email address associated with a participating college or university i recall the first news articles about the practice of employers asking for the social media passwords of prospective employees appearing in 2008 or 2009 or so facebook reported 500 million users in july 2010  think about that level of ubiquity more people than lived in the united states were on facebook and suddenly an entire countrys worth of peoples social networks were the subject of scrutiny by their employers who you were friends with what they said what you said about whom you said it your political opinions your sexual orientation facebook was a window into all of that data and employers were predicating peoples ability to earn a living on access to that window  after numerous breaches and scandals and all sorts of individual travails no doubt we have all learned a big lesson about privacy we have developed a certain cultural understanding about how social media ought to be used how to curate our image and how to adjust privacy settings in order to create different virtual social spaces with different functions and different levels of intimacy  but theres still a way into that window and if they did it once before do you suppose that our employers wouldnt try again to gain access to it  when you get an alert about how experian or target or your bank or yeah even linkedin got hacked and your data ended up on the deep andor dark web youre usually offered some complimentary credit monitoring service as a means of apologizing just in case some bad actors get a hold of your accounts and start opening credit cards or running pumpanddump scams in your name but nothing comes of it and eventually you forget it ever happened  your data isnt being abused because there probably just arent any buyers to whom its worthwhile most cybercriminals are motivated by monetary aims and your data is potentially the means to that end your emails probably arent exciting enough and your bank account probably isnt big enough for anyone to put the work in to extract that information from you  but what if that information became valuable in and of itself what if there was an actor out there who was interested not in converting that information into money but just in seeing it as it is what if there was a large organization with funds enough to invest in acquiring that information and examining it in order to predict peoples behaviors to gauge their opinions to see if associating with them poses any reputational risk thats what a background check is right when you go to take out a loan or get a new job or rent an apartment this is the kind of information that people want to know about you  so if someone gets a hold of this data and uses your name your email address your drivers license number your social security number etc they can use that data and the data that you have freely provided them to track the movements that you previously thought were invisible what you say on reddit the beer you drink what kind of porn you watch your opinions on abortion what kind of medication you take what kinds of books you read where you shop what you buy  some of this information will be available to people who want it without even having to break a law they wont have to hack an account or buy a password all it is going to take is a username in most cases just one search for that unique callsign that you use could turn up dozens of sites where you have made comments uploaded photos or left reviews everything that we do online leaves behind an artifact and if someone knows what to look for those artifacts are breadcrumbs that will lead them right to your window  and as for someone being able to purchase your password and use it to climb through that window take their shoes off and really feel the carpet in your house between their toes metaphorically speaking of course i think there is actually a lot of opportunity for large powerful wellfunded organizations to take advantage of their resources to affect changes in legislation such that obtaining our passwords will be either outright legal or associated with repercussions that are so minor as to be negligible  the primary piece of legislation that covers passwords and accounts is the computer fraud and abuse act cfaa which was originally passed in 1984 and primarily to provide protection for businesses from monetary damages its 35 years old its been amended a number of times most recently in 2010 but given the rate that our technologies and the way that we use them change i think its safe to say that the law in this case was written to regulate a reality that doesnt exist anymore  do you remember that spate of headlines that said you were going to go to federal prison for using your brothers girlfriends friends hbo password to watch game of thrones well that was the result of the court decision over a cfaa revealing that the law is not welldefined the united states v nosal was a trial about a guy who started his own business and hired former coworkers to obtain information on his behalf from his former employer the implication in the decision was that if by violating a terms of service by sharing a password opens you up to federal prosecution under the cfaa then everyone who shares their netflix password is committing a federal crime  but that seems excessive netflix clearly isnt suffering much from password sharing practices it reports billions of dollars in revenue hundreds of millions in profit every year and it doesnt pay any taxes  the problem is that if and when the cfaa is amended or replaced with legislation that clarifies what constitutes defrauding traffics by using passwords to achieve access without or in excess of the authorization granted to a user by a terms of service such that its okay for us to use each others passwords to watch our favorite sunday night shows depending on how that is phrased it might open up the door for corporations to start using those passwords that they glean from the deep and dark webs to access your accounts and see what you have hidden behind your privacy settingsto look through your window so to speak,hbkjxq

327,Both love and hate 2020 for doing this to me,i thought i enjoyed working i liked being productive but then i got laid off due to coronavirus causing a lack of business   ive been laid off for three months now and just got an email that my employer is going to start bringing people back that email made me face a really really awful realization   the last three months have been by far the happiest of my youngadult life i havent gone through waves of anxiety and depression im closer with my partner ive talked with more friends and gotten in contact with people i havent heard from in a long time ive pursued hobbies and finally had time to develop a workout routine that i can actually stick to my diet is better because i have time to plan meals and cook   dont get me wrong i didnt hate my job but this time off really made me realize that the work culture of america is so skewed we value all the wrong things and i hate that we have to spend more time with coworkers and bosses than the people we truly care about   i dont want to go back but i have to there are bills to pay i love 2020 for helping realize what really matters but i hate it because i know that my ignorance was bliss to a certain extent i didnt know what i was missing so i would dutifully work my life awaybecause thats just how it is but now i know but i dont know how to fix it,haauet
328,In trouble with HR for sharing my negative workplace experiences,tldr im in trouble for honestly sharing negative experiences at my company  long rant ahead because i am pissed  i have worked for greedy healthcare company ghc for a mere six months and it has been a nightmare  they screwed up my benefits so it took 5 months to get things sorted and i was passed from phone line to phone line to email to phone line rinse and repeat for weeks  i quickly began to feel like ghc  was doing whatever they could to avoid providing me the benefits id been promised but i didnt give up the fight  finally as of june 1st 55 months after hire it was sorted but who knows how much i overpaid in that time frame because our pay stubs are impossible to decipher  it also took 5 months to get my cell phone reimbursement which ghc only finally agreed to once they required i work from home and i was using upward of 1000 minutes per month  since ive been there weve lost our previous director 3 fulltime nurses and 3 prn nurses  others in the office are looking for new jobs and i havent stopped looking for a job since a month after i started  ghc is the kind of company that just combines job titles when people quit or when they make cuts so im already working under two job titles then have also been delegated a laundry list of other massive projects including one that is 100 a nurses job and i am not a nurse  my concerns have been met with oh its easy  you can do it  youre so responsible  youre so organized  meanwhile no instruction or training is being provided for anything  i trained myself on how to do my highly regulated medicaredictated joband i know im doing it wrong in many cases but i dont know who to go to for help  the others with my title had no training either  my boss is 90 days late submitting my 90day review its done she just hasnt turned it in and shes constantly telling me we should talk so she can teach me how to do some of these delegations and even though i remind her at least once a week nothing ever comes of it  but the final straw is that they are refusing to give me a copy of the job description i signed on hire  my requests have simply been ignored  so i left an indeed review that gave a short version of all these things and gave the ghc 25 stars  honest and representative of my experience  i deleted the review a couple days later when i realized it listed my job title which would easily identify me as im the only one in my office  but it was apparently too late as i received an outlook calendar invite yesterday that said conference call  the only participants were myself my boss and our regional hr person  i asked what it was about and my boss just said your indeed review  our patients and their families are suffering because greedy healthcare company cuts left and right and demands more and more of whoever is either brave or stupid enough to stick around  i have a job interview today 45 minutes before my hr conference call  please wish me luck  i cant take it anymore,hasw31

330,i can't keep living like this,i just cant do corporate jobs anymore man this is complete bullshit 40 hours a week doing boring mindless tasks and i barely have time for anything else i am at the point where it doesnt matter what corporate job i go to every day every fiber of my being fights me about going to work similar to how your body heats up drastically to try to fight off a virus it literally does not want me going to work  i cant fucking do this anymore like im going to quit in 3 weeks and start doing some freelancingindependent contractor jobs since ill be able to make my own schedule but it might be too late ive sacrificed too much of my soul and mental health for nothing theres always the gun stores that are around here  the worst part honestly is that i found a girl that i really really really really like just i cant explain how much i fucking like her i dont even know if its love yet and i dont care shes so fucking amazing and were so into each other and talking all the time and despite how much work has sucked the soul out of my body shes managed to make me so happy lately but its just work is a constant black holelike drain on me and yeah i can text her while on the job and call her while on the job but its like all the energy i could be putting into a potential relationship is being wasted because of work,hbqctp
331,Employers assume their employees are stupid.,i guess this realisation fully hit me today when my previous employer temp agency thought they could try deducting negativeunworked hours from my last paycheck at least thats what i assume happened because the maximum number of hours they can deduct under certain circumstances is the amount thats missing im still waiting for my paystub for details  see the collective agreement that my labour contract is based on is cut and dried in that regard the temp agency can deduct up to a certain number of negative hours a if the employee quits on their own or b if the employer terminates the contract without notice this can only be done under circumstances like theft i guess   neither of which is the case for me   all i had to do was find a pdf of the collective agreement and read the bit about deduction of negative hours its not even a matter of interpretation or exception the right to deduct unworked hours from an employees last paycheck clearly doesnt apply in my situation and still they tried   they count on people not knowing their rights or deciding that legal steps arent worth it financially they feel invincible superior and like they are above the law its sickening,hc3yma

333,Receiving unemployment benefits should not be frowned upon.,we are born into a society that puts us to work from the moment we start school until we are old and sick in retirement   5 days a week 8 hours a day from age 56 to age 60 60 if youre lucky  getting 26 weeks of income for sitting on my ass is a pretty trivial benefit compared to the aggregate amount of years spent working  05 years on ui  55 years spent at school or work   091 of your total years before retirement so thats compensation to sit on your ass for nearly 1 of your years spent at school or work fulltime  yet people shame me if they find out im on unemployment they seem thoroughly disturbed by it they look at me with pity maybe with disdain as well this lazy pos leeching off society come on get the fuck back to work you sloth this mere 1 of my working years being subsidized infuriates them  a message to any others on this sub who are fortunate enough to qualify for unemployment benefits dont let these kinds of people ruin your fun if you qualify that means you deserve it youve earned it,hbt76r
334,I’m starting to enjoy working? Please help,hello everyone im in a bit of an unusual situation and really need some advice and would like to hear what you guys think money has been running tight lately so i was forced to pick up a new part time job at a local grocery store i had to mentally prepare myself because i heard the horror stories about working in retail and interacting with customers  anyway i started working a few weeks ago and was expecting the worst but my experience so far has actually been not so bad the pay isnt incredible but its several dollars more than what i was making before at my old job whats more is that my coworkers have all been very welcoming for the most part and ive made a couple of good friends already in all my previous workplaces everyone just kind of ignored each other and did their own thing but here people constantly chat with everyone else while they work and it makes the shift go by so much faster  the management at this new job is also a lot better than what im used to at my old place my manager would get super mad whenever i needed to take a day off but here theyre completely fine with it as long as i let them know beforehand  so heres my dilemma all my life ive been against the idea of working because i believe my time belongs to me and me alone why should i put in so much effort so the rich get richer but ever since i started this new job ive found myself being excited to wake up every morning i dont know how to feel about this but im starting to get worried that ill become a bootlicker at this rate  im afraid that if i stay the capitalism will delude me into becoming their supporter and make me lose faith in socialism for that reason im considering quitting this job and finding another that ill be miserable at but at least will have a peace of mind that i will firmly remain antiwork do you guys think this is the right way to go from here,hblrx7

336,Proof (if we even needed it) corporate tax breaks aren't going towards workers,i work for a healthcare company doing the work of an entire team as just one person i manage a multimillion dollar budget and have complained that im drowning and need help for the past three years every time they say its not in budget and that this is your job make it work   today they told me that im getting 2million extra in budget and i need to find new ways to reach three of our most trickiest demographics i went silent on the call and then said wow we have 2 million to spend on prospecting but not on the help ive been asking for who could fulfill this job full time better than i could with my limited time   their answer well this is government subsidized money its not long term so we cant hire another person and keep them each year this money is for now  i just fucking greyrocked and shut down the rest of the conversation  there is no trickle down there is no soul or heart in a company its not family   2 million dollars to a corporation and we the people got a one time 1200 check and a ton of us complaining about the unemployed collecting 600mo until july   im so done i wouldve joined the circus if i knew life was this much of a shit show,ha2vrl

340,A solution to replace compulsory work by replacing capitalism,i know we all feel strong feelings about whats happening right now we are furious because we are not allowed to feel but we the people are clearly expressing we have had enough of this shit  as long as the corrupt own the means of production we will never truly be free we will never truly be heard and we will be forced to work as long as capitalism exists your working life is not going to end   i wanted to share with you something ive worked on for the last 4 years a simple but powerful alternative to capitalism called senatism where work is optional but encourages a true meritocracy  i dont care about cash fame or anything im writing this anonymously i just want this idea to spread i think we can do a lot better than what we have and when the people do take the power back were going to want to avoid making the same mistakes that got us here  the website is  httpsenatismorghttpsenatismorg  please take a look and please please please challenge the idea make it better keep the conversation going the time to throw capitalism out was centuries ago,haf4uc
341,Don't forget: your eligibility to find housing is also dependent on your shit job,my partner and i have been filling out rental applications lately im somewhat new to the requirements for applying for a lease on a new apartment or house and i am straight up appalled at some of the requirements we need and the amount of info the landlords need at times heres a few examples that make my stomach turn  1 credit checks you need an acceptable imaginary number that is based on your spending and debt are you trying to save money by not having a credit card fuck you you cant live here   2 income verification screenshots of your paystubs from your shit job dont forget that they need your managers name and number so they can verify that you are in fact a wage slave dont make three times the amount of rent per month for a house that probably has rats and has no washer and dryer fuck you you cant live here  3 bank verification not only do they need a credit check they also need to take a peek at how much money you have in your checking and savings accounts to make sure they can bleed you dry when they require a deposit that is rent x 3 oh you dont have enough money for a deposit that were probably never going to give back to you when you move out anyway fuck you you cant live here  4 work history verification and housing verification they need a list of every job and place youve lived in for at least the last three years do you not have the phone numbers addresses names and company titles of every single individual youve ever lived with in the last three years because you were desperately floating from room to room in an effort to not be homeless are you not in contact with every single individual youve ever been forced to live with in every single slum youve ever been forced to stay at fuck you you cant live here  5 petsjust fuck you you cant live here    so not only do i have to be a wage slave for my whole life i also have to beg these fucking slumlord bottom feeders to pwease pwease let me live in their shitholes and prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that i am indeed a subservient little robot that works for the capitalist machine this shit is in every fucking facet of our goddamn lives and there is no escape from it not even our friends and family who mostly just ridicule us for not wanting to spend 75 percent of our only life on this shit planet on work work work,hbtoe5
342,What if slavery abolition had another purpose?,foreword im not encouraging slavery its been an immoral practice for millenias wrong and people in this sub know how modern slavery feels like so    anyways i just had a random thought earlier today what if back 200 years ago when slavery in the us at least was abolished it wasnt abolished for the sake of the slaves but beacuse some dude in the 1 or top ranks or call it whatever you want thought you know what why enslave a few when we can enslave everybody    put it this way inbefore slavery banning there where pretty much two major social classes the upper class made of laid back fat fucks who made slaves do all their chores sounds familiar and the lower class people who were living by what they were producing such raising animals and growing vegetables a point of start where the upper class was at some point in time too there was the middle one as well you could think of proffessors or doctors but they were not as common as today this is mostly for the fact thay cities were not as big and developed as today and most of the population was living in the countryside also probably this is the point where the whole work hard and youll make it big bullshit story was born but this is for another discussion  yet the industrial revolution happened and you really couldnt expect to cover all the workforce needed for the different emerging industries with the back then existing slaves that baby born capitalism needed more workforce in order to satisfy its belly to grow up into what it is today so they replaced slavery by employing people who needed money to survive anyway and who didnt have a choice but to find a job fast forward to 2020 and this sub exists    let me know what you think,hcioz3
343,Capitalists are more afraid of you dropping out sustainably than of violent revolution.,not to say they arent afraid of revolution all their fears turn on it but a process of dropping out and organizing externally to the system in an intentional way  as opposed to the tune in turn on drop out ethos of hippies  is an important component of revolution and one neglected by contemporary revolutionaries without it revolutionary movements become reabsorbed into capitalism even whilst retaining their radical premises  a revolutionary movement would have to have external capacity for food shelter personal support etc supplied for by independent freeholders etc and an internal revolution is gonna necessarily be preceded by a bunch of people trying to get outside to create these conditions if you can start finding ways to do this,hc7wn1

353,"Choosing money over happiness, or happiness over money",i grew up in a very underdeveloped impoverished area of the united states where rugged individualism and pulling oneself up by the bootstraps was basically dogma the picturesque images of my country i saw on tv the lavish lifestyles all of that did not exist in my hometown i come from a family of poor farmers one of my parents left my siblings and i and the other one died i spent part of my teenage years living with a social worker and her family and another part of it with my grandparents who got lucky and found a career later in life that enabled us to enter the middleclass  i never understood the obsession with money mostly because i lived somewhere that lacked the opulent luxuries that many people on tv had not really much to do if all you see is fields one gas station and one grocery store i worried more about being bullied at school for having autism and being gay the harddrug addicts that roamed the neighborhood and whether or not my family would be robbed again than i did about status and what do you want to be when you grow up  my educational prospects were severely hampered due to my upbringing the public school i went to was not up to par with the states standards and it was very hard for people to advance to university level if they managed to get that far many people were not prepared for the rigor and got very poor grades or dropped out  i was told that my education was the most important priority as it would open doors towards a future career i was forced into perfectionism and have always felt broken when i fell short of that  i had a traumatic event happen during high school that gave me severe ptsd this crippled me especially later in high school whenever i was taking college level classes and working at a part time job because my foster family didnt adequately provide for us  i fumbled whenever i managed to get into a very lowtier university that didnt even offer my stem major and despite getting good grades had to take time off to do minimum wage warehouse work because i struggled academically was very stressed and really needed more money  there is absolutely no industry and no jobs where i live so you typically have a 2 hour daily commute to even go to a ramshackle city with some fast food joints and walmarttarget  this was honestly the worst time of my life i was in an abusive relationship and my ex boyfriend coerced me into working full time and being his personal housemaid my feet and back have never felt the same since i was forced to work retail warehouse and food jobs but if i didnt have a job i was useless to everyone  despite the fact that i dedicated lots of time towards learning algebra geometry trig and other subjects i had not properly been taught in school so that i could return to college   i transferred to a respectable school that gave me a full scholarship for computer science didnt realize things could get even more miserable than when i was wageslaving full time for walmart the stress and the pressure to succeed was suffocating i never made a single friend as people were competitive cutthroat and seemed to care more about expanding their linkedin network than companionship my school did not provide me any disability accomodations and seemed to get frustrated whenever i complained about the conduct of some faculty towards disabled students and how it was impossible to get academic help from them   ive had over 10 different therapists and been on over a dozen psych medications over the course of my lifetime but none of it helped i was so drugged up last year at university i could barely function all because i was not being productive enough and depressed  when the reality is i am depressed due to the state of the world and the crushing reality that my whole life has been spent trying to be someone im not so that i could succeed in the rat race not some chemical imbalance  i realized i could not go on at that school i was so upset everyday that i couldnt even will myself to go to class around this time i had started seeing someone long distance and went to his country to visit him over one of my academic breaks living in the english countryside seemed like an escape from the dogeatdog capitalistic hellhole that i was living in so in secrecy i began applying to uk universities my grandparents pushed me into applying to transfer to other schools in the usa and i hid that i was trying to move to the uk  i got an unconditional offer to study what i truly wanted neuroscience at a pretty good russel group uni rather than push myself further in the hot mess general education curriculum here in the usa the kicker was i also go accepted to an ivy league school and have been pushed heavily to attend due to the prestige and the career prospects that come from being in the upper echelons of academia  however im honestly sick of everything that is happening in my country i dont give a shit if i get paid a lower salary after graduation when i start my work visa i dont give a shit if i cant buy 10 different brands of pasta in the store i dont give a shit if i have to give up some of these luxuries and freedoms everyone seems to treasure so much i hate the idea of a career but id much rather pursue potential happiness in a place that wont work me to death rather than pulling 60 hour weeks as a minimum wage lab tech here in the states or being a developerslave to a massive corporation   everyone is saying i am stupid to give up the chance to go to an ivy league if they give me decent scholarship money i need some reassurance that my decision to take on some debt and pursue a better life elsewhere is worth the sacrifice would you pick potential happiness over money,haxijl

359,There is a difference between Life and Survival. [by CrimethInc.],whatever medical science may profess there is a difference between life and survival there is more to being alive than just having a heartbeat and brain activity being alive really alive is something much  subtler and more magnificent their instruments measure blood pressure and temperature but overlook joy passion love all the things that make life really matter to make our lives matter again to really get the most out of them we will have to redefine life itself we have to dispense with their merely clinical definitions in favor of ones which have more to do with what we actually feel   as it stands how much living do we have in our lives how many mornings do you wake up feeling truly free thrilled to be alive breathlessly anticipating the experiences of a new day how many nights do you fall asleep feeling fulfilled going over the events of the past day with satisfaction most of us feel as though everything has already been decided without us as if living is not a creative activity but rather something that happens to us thats not being alive thats just surviving being undead we have undertakers but their services are not usually required we have morgues but we spend most of our time in office cubicles and video arcades in shopping malls in front of televisions of course suburban housewives and petty executives are terrified of risk and change they cant imagine that there is anything more valuable than physical safety their hearts may be beating but they no longer believe in their dreams let alone chase after them  but this is how the revolution begins a few of us start chasing our dreams breaking our old patterns embracing what we love and in the process discovering what we hate daydreaming questioning acting  outside the boundaries of routine and regularity others see us doing this see people daring to be more creative and more adventurous more generous and more ambitious than they had imagined possible and join us one by one once enough people embrace this new way of living a point of critical mass is finally reached and society itself begins to change from that moment the world will start to undergo a  transformation from the frightening alien place that it is into a place ripe with possibility where our lives are in our own hands and any dream can come true  so do what you want with your life whatever it is but to be sure you do get what you want think carefully about what it really is first and how to go about getting it analyze the world around you so youll know which people and forces are working against your desires and which ones are on your side and how you can work together with us were out here living life to the fullest waiting for youhopping trains across the united states organizing political protests in french public schools writing beautiful letters at sunrise in bangkok we just finished making love in the corporate washroom a minute before you walked in on your half hour lunch break and life is waiting for you with us on the peaks of unclimbed mountains in the smoke of campfires and burning buildings in the arms of lovers who will turn your world upside down   come join us  days of war nights of lovehttpscrimethinccombooksdaysofwarnightsoflove,hc9ir3

382,99 percent of jobs are bullshit jobs,do we really need doctors nurses lawyers police judges bankers polititians etc   why not everyone just live on a farm with their family and grow their own food  boring life but simple  i know the reasoning of what if you get sick what if violence what if disputes what about money leadership  ask yourself do doctors stop people from getting sick and dying can doctors help everyone who is sick   do the police stop violence from happening do they even help or do they often make things worse   do judges deliver justice does the justice system even work   does money stop people from starving or is it the reason millions are starving  do polititians provide good leadership or do they mostly make false promises  do any of these jobs solve any of the problems we have had since the dawn of time   if the answer is no then they are bullshit jobs and we can live without them   if all of these jobs are bullshit is it fair to say the system is bullshit ill leave you to ponder that,hcr534

384,We don't know peace,we never get to have a moment of true peace capitalism is always pushing us to produce think educate ourselves we can never have the present we are always working towards something anxious with deadlines approaching the fear of starvation of falling behind of not being able to be good enough for the market  our psyche is completely molded by capitalism its hard to even imagine a different type of social mediation other than the commodity anxiety is ever present neurotism and psychopathy developing unbriddled necessary to navigate the world to produce more to tolerate more to push for more to disdain the value of human life in favor of commodity production and circulation our minds atrophied too focused on abstractions that have come to enslave us too weak to break the order consumerism and anchoring to that which we consume in a ritualistic fashion as if it were our personality expressing ourselves through the commodity its all so broken its all so pointless i sometimes wonder if its even real it has to be a joke right our society couldnt be more divorced from usevalue we let the homeless die in the streets while we guard pieces of paper and commodities like they were more precious than any living being how corrupted can we be whats the effect of the valueform on us even are we just subject to it or do we become stronger empowering our own twisted mechanisms of destruction  what could we create if all of the limitations and obligations imposed over us by work were lifted overnight how would we use our newfound freedom and expectation of freetime and development across our lifetime could we deal with that landscape or would be shackle ourselves and others once again,hb4ftw

389,In conversation with an evil capitalist.,just browsing this sub and its nice to get a different perspective on things  if anyone wants a chat with someone from the other side then im here all day   i sympathize with the antiwork stance work is troublesome but i believe its a necessary evil and if everyone had adopted an antiwork lifestyle wed still be in the stone age so were actually fortunate that historically the concept of antiwork wasnt popular mainly because no work has always meant starvation im pretty much failing to understand the stance of antiwork and would like to hear an argument against work that gives me an ah ha moment maybe i can learn from you maybe you can learn from me perhaps not who knows  ampx200b  ive heard a few people expect homes but not want to work for them this i cannot understand  an example i like to give is the house example do you have any idea what a technological marvel the modern home is and you want one for free i know a lot of people whove built their own homes good quality ones at that its cheaper than buying but you need project management skills at a minimum you can too assuming youve got the skills  the skills required to construct a home are many and learning these skills is highly difficult if you dont have these skills how can you ask those that do to use their skills and labor to build you a home theyve got other things theyd rather be doing like not working  its up to you to convince them how you go about that is up to you  what about this do i not understand,hc3j88
390,American capitalism is psychologically murderous from a very early age.,if lifes a playground we ought to sue the designers there are way too many sharp edges and needles buried in the woodchips  school as such is bullshit and should be abolished in favor of vroriented education for higher learning and small apprenticeships for handson learning the forced socialization of public school is soul obliterating billshit on par with factory farming even those who enjoy the experience do not escape it unscarred the only reason it exists in this fashion  and yes i am targeting the public school system which isnt magically separate from the society around it  is to ready individuals for the labor force   capitalism produces emotionally flat introverts at extremely high rates this is again a response to enforced socialization after spending ones formative years being marketed to with bullshit  i can remember gi joe being one of the early triggers for whatever brand of narcissism i unfortunately have  the point is that yeah capitalism is to blame we dont have to blame ourselves it is the system your very responses to basic social relationships are deeply colored by your formation in school,hcanfq

We're just the modern day slaves.,ever since the dawn of civilization those at the top have been served by those at the bottom money and resources have always determined your place in society   nothing has changed of course slavery now is a far cry from what it was thousands of years ago now we can actually afford some luxuries   if you live in the first world and were able to take advantage of education you can get a job that allows you to live like royalty compared to the rich of thousands of years ago   you may be fortunate to sit in an air conditioned office and type on a keyboard rather than doing back breaking labor in the sun   we are the modern day slaves but the most fortunate by comparison the world has always been the way it is if anyone is to blame its our parents for not being rich and bringing us into a life of slavery   those selfish bastards,hbo5xl

405,"Do the ""back to normal"" brigade annoy you?",because they really annoy me there was absolutely nothing normal about the before times from the not so long long ago although i recognise the tragedy of the pandemic the lockdown was sweet however peoplesociety are in such a rush to resume this abnormality that they value so much the shops opened where i am yesterday and they were stampeded by consumers ikea had queues i once checked out ikea to see what all the fuss was about and instantly hated it with every fibre of my being i wanted out of there immediately the furniture sucks too it was like a george romero film watching zombies shuffle in fluorescent lit uniform white roomshalls with the all the accoutrements of a pseudo comfortable middle class suburbanite ideal in much the same way i watched transformers 3 having not seen any transformer films prior to this to see what all the fuss was about and hated it wanting out of the cinema theatre after 30 minutes people were getting excited about spending the whole day at ikea the night before the lifting of restrictions literally what the actual fuck i am on a different planet to these people these are the same people who want to work 95 monday to friday absolutely nothing has been learned from this experience consumerism is still in effect capitalism will resume operations pollutionclimate changespecies extinctionfactory farming will bounce back i want all these things gone and its about fucking time too but no the society prevails  edit another thing about back to normal it has a redolent whiff of religiosity like the statements you would hear in the 90s about moral values etc made by people in response to those satanic rockers etc just another reason to hate normal  edit 1 and one more thing talk about double standards i had zero issues adapting to the lockdown i greatly enjoyed the absence of traffic on the roads the lack of crowding and the freedom of it however im an introvert yet extroverted people were complaining within 2 weeks about the restrictions and constantly calling for them to be lifted or just outright violating them thereby endangering everyone else again fuck these double standards extroverts and early waking people wouldnt be able to tolerate an introverted night shift one yet we have to adapt to their system fuck them,gzm7ze

407,I wish profitability were the actual goal here.,long story short the management at the place i work at are focused more on appearances than efficiency or even profit i say this based on what ive seen during the past week covid has resulted in lower work orders and less shifts so someone upstream in accounting must have calculated the minimal number of workers needed to complete work and maximize profit this meant the guys that sort the product containers in the warehouse didnt come to work and i had to do their job in order to do mine i load and unload the containers i did 2 jobs for the same minimum wage this means i work slower than i normally would and output is diminished but hey money saved by not paying workers  on top of that i was next to the foremans office when i heard him screaming i shortly found out that someone had used their phone on the job and that the section leader was being reprimanded for not policing the nophone policy we were reminded to turn our phones in before starting work id never been told this before i found this a bit inconvenient because the lights on the 1st floor storeroom are blown out and its almost impossible to read the labels on the products late in the afternoon and impossible during overtime hours which is why i used my phone flashlight to check labels but i suppose appearances are more important than productivity right and dont get me started on overtime seriously this company is run by egocentric eggheads that dont understand that their costsaving measures are actually losing them money  edit i still hate the fact that i had to sell out by getting a job just to be able for food,h85bge

425,“[This is] one of those things that comes up in life…”,throwaway account  i got that as a response in an email today and it made me furious  background  where i am right now there have been some dangerous environmental issues yesterday while working from home my girlfriend and i received a notice stating that we needed to evacuate the area immediately i wrote up a short email explaining that i had received evacuation orders and sent it out to my team before promptly turning off my laptop over the course of the next few hours we had gotten our emergency bags work bags our pets and some limited supplies into the car and we had driven out to my parents place where they had set aside a single room for us we then drove back to get my girlfriends car and some other supplies before returning back to my parents   overall it took a while and i was offline most of the day  that evening i logged back on we have to do our timecards everyday where we log our hours and explain what we had worked on if you dont do the timecard a nastygram goes out if you dont have 40 hours by the end of the week any time not accounted for is withdrawn from pto  it was approximately 6pm and i did a couple of hours of work but it was clear that i wasnt going to make up the rest of the day unless i worked until like midnight only to then get up at 5am the next day i did my timecard and logged off for the night with the goal of reaching out in the morning  so this morning i sent an email asking for some help i asked if there was a number i could charge to for emergencies and if there wasnt then could i get an extension for my week essentially can i at least make up hours next week and work later in order to balance my week out to 40 hours this week my hope was to avoid using any of the remaining pto i had this year has been rough between surgery and a few emergencies i am down to 40 hours total from now until january  after a few hours i manage to get a response  this is one of those things that comes up in life like getting sick or having transportation issues they then mentioned that i had 3 options  1 pto  2 an alternate working schedule i wont get into this since it would reveal a lot of information about my situation and where i am   3 i quote work a lot today  so im sitting here displaced from my home with 4 pets some are my parents with my girlfriend with a few backpacks with our emergency supplies and some clothes waiting to hear back if its safe to go home and im basically told  eh its not that bad and not unusual  and my options are  1 use pto to survive being removed from my home due to circumstances outside of my control  2 work 14 hours today and make up the time  3 work 14 hours today and make up the time  im not surprised really im not but it still pisses me off  i am not seen as a struggling individual in need of a little leeway no im seen as human capital stock that must be squeezed for all my productivity regardless of my mental physical and emotional condition  i mean i like to think im not asking for much and that its not a huge request honestly tell me am i in the wrong here is this really all just part of everybodys normal schedule getting evacuated and having to leave everything behind possibly permanently is all just part of another tuesday and im just making a big deal out of nothing,h7tl49

427,"The paradigm of leeching off someone vs. ""earning"" your money is fundamentally nonsensical",many of you guys still living under the paradigm and narrative of being self sufficient vs being a leech are not really taking into consideration the reality of how nonsensical the economy is  you would feel guilty leeching off your parents perhaps if you have to live at home with no income or not enough to get your own place but somehow would not feel guilty if you for example had a job of slaughtering hundreds of chickens full time for a paycheck in some factory  while having to shit in a diaper standing there killing chickens all day because that work place doesnt allow toilet breaks yes this is a real actual thing look it up if you think im making a job like that up  that money really ought to be given to you you earned it killing these animals pumped with hormones that will produce cancer in those that buy them to eat while youre shitting away in your diaper you citizen of the land of the free way to contribute and make the world a better place thank god youre doing that for the world you wonderfully contributing admirable citizen you  having kids in this world and telling them when you grow up you must work full time or starve to death on the street even if whatever work is available to you is soul crushing stupid pointless made up bullshit  you have to do it to avoid starving to death on the street and we will not help you in spite of choosing to unnecessarily bring you into existence to begin with is insane to me they are responsible for taking care of you as long as they can and if they dont and dont want to well alright i just think thats fucked up that they chose to impose all that on you  we live in a world where a most wealthy people are wealthy precisely due to leeching off of slave wage labor and where a tv star earns in a few days what a firefighter earns in literally 40 years of full time work ive done the math no joke  so whatever money you do or do not have is not legitimately or fairly or justifiably yours no ones money is actually theirs its an arbitrary made up concept  no one earns their money its not fair or deserved its all arbitrary  biological existence in general is quite unequal and unfair to begin with but then even more so is the human man made economic system  like imagine a firefighter asking christiano ronaldo for a 20 just to help him out in a pinch somewhere  and christiano ronaldo who earns in a few days what the firefighter would earn in 3 lifetimes goes nah thats my money i dont believe in hand outs you need to earn your own money  you are not in actuality leeching off of your parents at least not anymore than companies leech off their employees or their customers because whatever money anyone has is never legitimately theirs to begin with nor is anyones its all made up and arbitrary we all just need food and shelter the money stuff is made up  christiano ronaldo is a multi billionaire because football is an avenue through which companies can sell beer and cars etc  so alcoholics and the destruction of planet earth through oil over use pollution of the air etc is the reason why he is so unfathomably rich he is rich due to fucked up things  so the idea that someones money is and should be theirs in some justifiable sense is completely delusional to me how do you know that you would view it as appropriate and fair that they get that money to begin with,h77jyo

437,What does it mean to be “lazy”? (Rant),tldr below lets say i a capitalist create a job where a person is to simply copy by hand the text written to a 1000 page textbook onto sheets of paper 100 times and i pay them minimum wage it is possibly in the modern age one of the most pointless jobs to exist but i would be hailed as a job creator stimulating the economy and the worker who does the work would be seen as a hard worker with an impressive work ethic  just earlier i had an argument with my mother and sister on the nature of jobs that exist for the sake of jobs existing and i mentioned that the 40hour week is an arbitrary construct design to drain people of the energy needed to rebel against the structure they then defaulted to the idea that work can be 30 weeks but i suggested that it could be even less if we evaluated what our real needs as society are remember im just starting with lesser work hours i cant even discuss communism yet immediately i was called lazy and that people need to work   conclusiontldrwhat the hell is this these are the same people that say that they would be bored with retirement and if everything were automated theyll simply invent new work to do or more accurately beg some capitalist to do that because work in our society is defined by the capitalist paradigm if you independently decide to copy textbooks and youre not making money doing so people would think youre wasting your time if you do that under employment youre a hard worker  so what exactly does it mean to be lazy,gzu0le

452,Memes are proof that money is a lie - and offer a way to spread that awareness,i know this sounds asinine but just give me a few paragraphs to get some momentum  you cant exist in 2020 and not intuitively just know what a meme is even those that exist totally cutoff from the online sphere would get the picture after a few examples most typically we think of image macros like thishttpsimgurcomsc1nbl7 or thishttpsimgurcomyw2quqt but these are just a couple of modern digital memes and dont begin to scratch the surface of just exactly what a meme is and why the answer to that might be really fucking important  for example a picture doesnt need any text to be a meme  similarly a picture can be only text and still be a meme a phrase can be a meme or even a single word a sound symbolshttpsenwikipediaorgwikicoolsmediafile22cools22svg the structure of the building youre in and the design of the device youre reading this from are memetic artifacts musical subgenres fashion and style trends social patterns and institutions including family marriage property law crime and punishment even complex ideologies  religious political and philosophical  are essentially very nuanced and enduring memes that span hundreds and thousands of years   its difficult to think of anything that is not a direct result of memetic repetition as this is the way in which all information beliefs and ideas are shared and become socially entrenched  this method of transmission is directly related to and reveals something specific about the origins of power authority control and choice and how we relate to those concepts and ourselves  human behaviour and response is memetic  a product of pattern repetition and context rather than a series of conscious decisions we make at every moment  this is not to suggest we are totally bound and determined by fate but only that we are bound and determined to act only in accordance with our own character  we are not something responsible for our decisions we are our decisions and for that we bear responsibility  can you imagine trump acting like anything else besides a caricature of pure petulance   thats his role  his constitution  i think the belief that he or you or i make decisions is backwards  partly a product of the language we use to speak about ourselves and the world and partly just our basic instincts  its plainly obvious that i am aware and alive and can consider many possibilities so it only seems to follow that i must exert some influence over my choices  to me there is little distinction between me and my choices  i am those choices not a separate entity that chooses  that stands separate considers and then finally pulls the equivalent lever corresponding with the choice ive made  those final three words are superfluous  to me they all reference a single thing  a localized happening from my specific perspective  this idea is naturally unpalatable as it would seem to not only absolve one of all responsibility for wrongdoing but also rob one of their ownership over both their good actions and artistic creations  i think this is simply a knee jerk reaction to protect the egos sense of itself as something distinct and in control as to accept the opposite comes with a great sense of powerlessness   responsibility is not something we take  responsible is what we are  language has an implicit kind of magical quality  by that i mean much like the imagined casting of a spell it is widely assumed that speaking the right words in the right combination and order can influence and compel people to act and this action is the source of change this is why great orators have always possessed great influence over the course of history  someone must be able to give power to an idea that can move masses to act as a single unified force of nature  i dont believe individual human action is ever the true catalyst to change  i think it is human action predicated on and driven specifically by the memetic concepts we have at our disposal  most importantly what is good right valuable and true  language is itself inherently biased limiting and divisive  black lives matter means absolutely nothing until it is interpreted and language is always loaded with judgments as much as it is the primary way we communicate ironically it just as often obfuscates and confuses because the kind of language we have available to us directly determines how we understand and conceptualize the world and ourselves it is not a matter of merely being petersonianly precise in our speech because precision is meaningless if the principles that precede it are incompatible  how many proponents of any ideology have actually read and engaged with its foundational and supporting texts   probably very few  how many have absorbed bits and pieces through their specific context  language culture family friends media and memes  probably almost everybody  these repetitions of pattern connect us to something far greater than any single one of us  our collective human ideas about value function purpose and their relation with each other  memes are a portal to the sum total of all human knowledge experience and feeling  memes are threads sewn into the fabric of the tapestry of reality connecting us to the past present future each other and something totally separate  something unspeakable that yet demands to be spoken of  you may have felt it when engaged in something everyday and ordinary yet struck as if for the very first time by the majesty and totality of all there is  all experience happening right now billions of distinct and separate simultaneous happenings disconnected and separated only by virtue of the limitations of their own collective conceptions of what is real what is true and what is possible  this universal need to communicate and share  to be heard  is intimately linked to creative and artistic expression  memes are innately communal and creative  they are meant to translate a feeling or thought into a shareable format that can be used related to and understood and community and creativity have a direct and intimate connection to both art and play two characteristics central to the human experience  art is itself its own distinct form of language  a language that transmits ideas and feeling only through its interaction with another art is our way of speaking telepathically  a way to contain and convey something enormous and infinite bound in the confines of an object  memes and artistic expression both reflect something crucial and universal in the spark of our human spirit  both are inherently creative and communal  they represent the human need to share something intimately linked with community and altruism art can of course be done selfishly but there is no artistic expression at all without the memetic patterns that allow that expression and an audience to engage with and be receptive to the artists message  memes are thus quite a bit more significant than just funny and relatable pictures we share  what a meme is has direct implications regarding what we are and our current shared cultural conception of them is simplistic and as a result limiting if we dont fully grasp what a meme is we lack the capacity to both comprehend their true power and the ability to wield that power to our own collective benefit instead we persist in an ordering of society that enriches only a small handful that have fallen to the top through nothing other than circumstance and who insist this must be the natural ordering of the world simply because it is the current ordering of it  can we really trust those who wield inordinate amounts of power to fairly consider how it might be meted out differently  is the fate of society directly tied to the fate of the billionaire class or to the current institutions of policing and governance  from where is their authority and power actually derived  the primary source is our shared belief that these institutions are legitimate and just  the secondary source is their ability and willingness to inflict violence on us if we do not accept the first source   violence is of course the most powerful and persuasive avenue of acquiring and maintaining power  both literal violent acts and indirect violence inflicted and facilitated by a system of organization that regards the principle of one persons right to hoard obscene amounts of wealth as a higher and more just one than providing the material necessities of life for all people  that is the basic moral principle that serves as the keystone of the structure of our society as it is currently ordered  do we really believe those with obscene means deserve it  what about those with such means that they could lose a thousand yearly salaries in a single day and not have that impact their quality of life in the slightest  the divine right of kings still rules although now its simply the divine right of the wealthy  we are meant to believe this is just the way the world is  i find that idea just as intolerable and narrowminded as those that believe it  society bears little proof of functioning properly anywhere  properly as in for the common good of all people  if we instead understand properly as to the obscene and perverted benefit of a small few at the expense of everybody else then it is functioning tremendously properly  individualism is too often championed by those who dont understand the distinction between it and selfishness and this crucial error acts as the basic foundation for an entire wing of political and philosophical thought which insists might makes right and value is directly related to money and money alone where everything can be spoken about in terms of its worth in terms of the us   one of many currencies that can in an instant become as good as worthless due to nothing other than our shared confidence in it  now i want to make some statements that are broad and general but ones that i think are fairly common and subconscious these are not meant to be statements of fact merely word and concept associations to get us to see how we arrive at facts  the relationship between progressivism and conservatism is like the relationship between masculine and feminine which itself is like the relationship between individual and community  consider this disharmony between two opposing or complementary  principles as essentially the basis of all philosophical and thus political thought also consider opposing principles as really a single thing as opposites always exist only in relation to each other  this sounds a lot like some meaningless newage woo but i think many people make these associations subconsciously anyway even though we can offer legitimate arguments against them  just conjure up some typically conservative imagery and symbols in your head  what kind of qualities are emphasized what is deemed valuable good and of worth what foundations precede these symbols  the inescapable and global grasp of the internet and the smartphone was a pivotal evolutionary shift in human history comparable to our discoveries of fire agriculture steel and the combustion engine  all of which are only useful through memetic transmission  the internet and our constantly connected culture has allowed us to in a sense act as a very rudimentary hivemind our access to and saturation of information media and communication is both constant and instant  it is now possible to share our thoughts with almost everybody there is  our friends and family their friends and family people we dont know and never will people in another country and people who perhaps dont even share the same primary language as us  a single sentence spat out into the ether can potentially reach billions of people on the planet in a matter of hours   you me and everybody else has a form of direct access to nearly every other human consciousness on this planet  what could we possibly use that for  memes of course  to crowdsource the question of what is good because that is what lies at the centre of all action and belief the fact that we have seemingly become ever more divisive and politically polarized is not to be tutted at or wished away but rather acknowledged as the only way in which an outcome  truth  can be arrived at spread copy itself and propagate to the point where its opposite seems wholly and utterly absurd  accepting all of this it is possible to understand humanity not as an abstracted collection of billions of separate individuals but as a single unique happening of organismenvironment that can given certain factors act in unison  the most important factor is of course each self knowing and feeling that they are a part of this greater self which is not something that can be forced but something like creation itself that happens spontaneously  one can edit and correct and obsess over the minutiae of an artistic object but inspiration strikes it is not conjured  it is never willed into being it is rather being itself which then acts on our will  those advocating for either a progressive or conservative approach to policy can not compromise not because the facts are in disagreement although that is true but because what comes before the facts is not in agreement  that is the way the world is structured and ordered or the way the world is which always itself acts as the background for an ideology rather than the reverse  the idiom seeing is believing is actually totally backwards   the truth is that believing is seeing  so if memes are the true catalyst of human action and social change can we then meme ourselves into a better reality can we together engineer build or construct a meme to spread and transform our shared collective unconscious and the ideas that follow about not only what is true but what is possible  i believe so and i think a good place to start is to understand the illusory and mutable nature of money and wealth and their direct relationship to power and authority and the distribution of these things money is a real thing that performs a necessary function but our shared understanding of it holds real power over it and in this way we can collectively shape and alter that power it commands over our lives   we cant function without money but we absolutely can function with a novel way of distributing it so as to lessen the total amount of suffering directly related to poverty and the inability to provide materially for oneself  does jeff bezos really have billions of actual tangible currency or is his currency really in the form of power and influence as represented by money  is the standard work week from monday to friday or monday to thursday   whatever the answer is it because this is simply the way the world is or is the way the world is directly shaped by our collective ideas about it  the statesanctioned brutalization and modern lynchings of black men at the hands of law enforcement in the us is itself a memetic pattern  law enforcement tactics are memetic including their violent response to protest organization and the legitimate outpouring of anger directed at the inhumanity of the institutions of justice the video of george floyds horrific and senseless murder was spread memetically and so too were the calls for protest all across not only the us but the entire world  a memetic call for collective struggle has been sounded and heard by the entire planet  now is the time to take this opportunity to understand ourselves as one to tear down and rebuild the arbitrary social patterns of power and control that rule all of our lives  the legitimized armed wings of state police and military personnel should stand with the people not as their opposition  stand with them in demanding justice and equality for all people and the dismantling of a system which treats all conscious beings as resources and like its treatment of every resource exhausts it to the point of annihilation  a single officer taking a principled stand to cross the illusory barrier of usother could be the crumbled brick that begins the collapse of the whole structure all it will take is one person of good conscience to do something difficult but something good to memetically begin a shift towards a better more equal society  if you cant bring yourself to do that you just may be an enemy of the people  see how compelling language can be nested within every word is paragraphs of subtext assumption and implication  enemies of the people are just that  enemies to a free and emancipated existence   to preserve life violence may sometimes be the only option violence can be avoided memetically  you cannot put a bullet in a concept and its just as futile to do the same to those who espouse exemplify or believe it not to mention a wee bit of a moral grey area violence can be lessened with the correct memetic foundation that underpins our conception of self other and world and the reciprocal nature of those things  violence is given power by distinction and separation but that power can be neutered by understanding that not only are you yourself you are every other self too  the global economic and social reaction to the coronavirus is proof of this shared power our collective thoughts have over the world we inhabit of course we cannot simply will it out of existence through a shared psychic exercise but we can decrease the destructive potential through the memetic spread of ideas like social distancing   it has also laid bare that the distinctions and lines in the sand we use to divide and categorize are mostly illusory  the global community as the aggregate of every other community group faction and individual is where we must focus our collective efforts there is no nation but earth and to shift our reality in the direction we want it will take collective effort   the emancipation of all humanity must happen together because of the memetic nature of change and our connected world there is no freedom until we are all free  somebody called the police because of a suspected counterfeit 20 and here we are  imagine what can be accomplished together by simply altering our beliefs about what is inherent and immutable and what is merely a byproduct of antiquated memetic artifacts and the resulting methods of ordering and structuring society  we can meme ourselves better  black lives matter  white supremacy does not  land matters  landlords do not  people matter  profits do not  billions matter  billionaires do not  collective ownership over the instruments of profit production and class stratification is our right  food is a right  water is a right  shelter is a right  healthcare is a right  education is a right  freedom of expression is a right  this includes the right to quell and dismantle the violent rhetoric that enables violent expression  these things are only true or false based on our collective ideas about what is right and what is valuable  justice should not be owned by anyone it is owed to everyone  humanity is an organism  a unified field of conscious relationship and pattern from micro to macro comprised of each one of us  knowing what we are is the first step to becoming what we can be  we can meme ourselves into a better tomorrow together,h0ys8b

458,"Is anyone else annoyed by the concept of ""noble"" poverty (Don't know what subreddit to post this in.)",i know some people who work on farms here and there and make handicrafts to sell and work in farmers markets and they dress in shabby clothing they buy second hand clothing to be moral and theyve got this attitude of like were so anticapitalism we chose the simple life  meanwhile every single time theres an accident or emergency or f they decide want to save money or if they simply dont want to pay for something they call their parents and their parents bail them out  so they get the positives of poverty such as a totally cool antiestablishment image and freedom from the workplace but none of the negatives of poverty such as literally the definition of poverty stress anxiety health problems a lack of money to get the necessities in life or to weather more serious storms etc  im trying to be openminded but everytime they lounge around talking about hating the concept of working a boring job for money i imagine the physical violence sexual violence drug abuse mental and phsyical health problems that my family and the people i know in real poverty faced and its a bit much no i cant call them out on their bs because im trapped in a small place with small town politics ill be leaving soon i just need to grind through this  its probably easy to read into what im feeling as jealousy but its its not like i dont like them as people yes id love to be able to do what i want safe in the knowledge that someone else will pay away any issues i come up against but i dont want them to not have these things im glad that some people get to live their lives without being forced into slavery in the capitalist system  but i just cant bear listening to them talking sometimes due to their lack of selfawareness its like when someone gets hired straight into a managerial position in their parents company and then talk about how they bootstrapped their way through life these people exist in and out of the working world  please send me helpful tips and similar stories i need a sanity check,gzjr23

471,First job back last September,just an old story from almost a year ago but thought id share it with everyone  it was my first real job ever i was 18 and was super busy through school so never really experienced a part time job it was at a lumber mill way out of the way in the industrial part of town i was by far the youngest person there and right off the bat everyone didnt like me for some reason i was charged with pulling out 2x4s out of a plainer and stacking them tightly on a cart but the guy pushing them through was going way too fast for me i asked him to slow it down but he just stared blankly at me and kept pushing them through i had a big mess of them in front of the machine and i was near the point of tears because of this  at lunch time i had to go to the guy who hired me who was super cool about everything but asked me if i would finish the day just to see if i could keep doing it i agreed to it because i felt like if i was doing something else id be better off  the next stage was me pushing smaller stuff under a different thing but by the time it was the end of the day my hand was seized  shut and i couldnt move it i told the hiring guy that i thanked him for the opportunity and all but it wasnt for me he was thankful that i stuck around for the full day and did tell me that some guys just leave an hour in if they dont like it as i was leaving the guy that was pushing the 2x4s threw a chunk of wood at me and yelled never come back which thankfully i did never go back   that was really my first experience of really hating work,h8e6im
472,I had no clue I was creative/motivated,anyone ever notice how whenever you are given permission to take a significant amount of time off work that youre creativity and motivation spikes significantly i never really get to take any long holidays from work and so it doesnt happen that often but when it does everything improves for me i end up spending hours upon hours of spending time on my own personal projects that i enjoy so much that time flies by my strength in the gym flies upwards suddenly i take care of my health way better because i actually have time to take care of it opposed to having to force down some form of processed food coz i dont have time to make myself anything i sleep way better knowing i dont have to step back into the shite hole known as the work place when i wake up so just to sum it up forced labour sucks away every little bit of happiness creativity and motivation in my life  the only way i see some semblance of long term happiness in my life ever happening is by working higher paid contract jobs and just working when i absolutely need to because seriously fuck retirement who the hell sees retiring at 65 when you may not even be alive by then and wont be able to do much of anything anyway as a worthwhile goal to aim for the only way to win at this game is to not play  thats my rant for today,h9douf

480,Making the best of it,i just discovered this sub and have never felt so seen im currently 23 and finding a job even as i went through college and got my degree was always a matter of what do i think ill hate the least because the truth is i dont want to work at all for anyone i do however value my own autonomy and comfort very highly so i work an easy mindless job 40 hours a week that covers my bills plus some extra as im lucky enough not to have any pets or children and i live with my boyfriend who also contributes financially everyone else at my job has families and all kinds of responsibilities so theyre all poor and working overtime any chance they get i feel for these people i would never ever work overtime under any circumstances since my free time is most precious to me so many people express a need to be busy even actual inability to stop working i have never once related to or understood this though it seems awfully common im either way too sensitive or everyone else is completely decimating their mental health all the time since covid showed up i transitioned to working from home which has many perksmainly that i am no longer being watched by anyone i work very intermittently with most of my time spent doing other things i play animal crossing all day long and still manage to be among the top 3 most productive on the team i usually relax fully through the first and last hours of the shift and i cant help but feel as though im striking a balance exploiting my faceless employer as they exploit me this gives me immense satisfaction but it doesnt seem like anyone outside of this sub would think i should be proud i grew up in a household that tried to instill the idea that i should sacrifice in my youth to be successful later i rejected that as a child and i still do now even more so now that im conscious that other people too recognize the horror that is this live to work system and the fact that my successful parents are probably the most unhappy people i know i just want to chill and be happy i think im doing a pretty good job,h7l20w

497,What's the minimum amount of work we would need to do?,if we were to produce enough food and other basic supplies for everyone how many work hours would that be if we were to divide that by all physically able adults how many hours would that be then how many 4hoursofwork days would that be in a year per person  i know this sounds like some wonderland utopia but i believe it is possible even in these modern times that everyone would work only a small fraction of the year and the rest would be total freedom  i think we are already producing more than enough supplies for everyone but of course its not distributed equally and its only a small fraction of population that actually works in production of these supplies the rest work in unnecessary jobs that are in demand nonetheless my idea is that only a small amount of work really needs to be done and anything more than that is providing luxury and entertainment for the rich,gzma5e

502,19 and trying to make a decision on a degree that'll help me get a job that at least somewhat works with my antiwork mindset. Help?,hi everyone hope youre all well  sorry for the long post but this is very heavy on my mind as of late  im 19f whos been living in malta for around 4 months now moved here because of my love of international living and my desire to get away from the country that is stripping me of my eu citizenship  came here just to test the waters and find a job but after realising that i can study here for free if i apply this year degrees here are free for eu citizens but we lose our privileges at the end of this year i would be a fool not to take up this opportunity as one of the biggest complaints i see about tertiary education on the internet is crippling debt sending my sympathies across the pond but im wondering what i should invest my time into  i am thinking about what i want in the future and what i want most is freedom i think i want a job that i can leave and come back to without too much hassle as the job is in constant demand i dont want to be in a situation where i feel i cant leave my job that has shitty hours because i would risk being jobless for an extended period of time due to the surplus of workers scrambling for the position  the degree course that stands out to me is speech and language therapy it combines linguistics psychology and biology  all passions of mine its meaningful in that it helps people live life to the fullest god forbid i land myself in a soulless bullshit job but im concerned about its transferability to other countries that arent english speaking a lot of speech therapists have told me applying the skills you obtain to countries that speak other languages is very tricky as you train in the language you speak and therefore you lack the skills in other languages furthermore its extremely specialist nature and somewhat anonymous status within the medical community makes me think jobs wont be easy to come by  this leads to me thinking nursing would be better travel nursing is a concept that intrigues me greatly foreign nurses in the eu even around the world isnt uncommon and nurses are always in demand simple as im unsure of the nursing shortage in the eu but i know for sure the uk is suffering in this respect  my first thought was to post here as what i want in a job is heavily influenced by my antiwork values what do you all think what are other options that could give me this freedom in the end i want to be able to work save i am a minimalist at heart and feel it wouldnt be hard for me to save a decent amount and then leave work to pursue my whims be it travel hobbies whatever im sure you all know what i mean and then when money gets short i can return to work and vice versa bypassing the youve been out of work for a while prioritising your life and wellbeing cant have that in our corporate family shtick due to the job being in demand  am i being naive advice would be much appreciated,gzup1t

504,HELLO.,removed,gzpyyr
505,Let's take over some federal land,i believe in working for ourselves and stop giving our money to the elites so to keep most of our money and freedom i propose massive pacific protests on federal land in the states where it is abundant start building andor living in motorhomes  so many people live paycheck to paycheck because housing is so expensive society as it is now is like a big monopoly game and we all know how it ends billionaires get richer every day rich families get to pass on their generational wealth we just get stripped out of our basic rights the right to benefit from our work thats why we are working so hard and getting nowhere we are working to feed ourselves and to feed them  even if im lucky enough to buy land there are so many regulations that make it almost impossible to build something if you dont have the money but you know what a house can be built of literally anything including the same dirt on your land why then we have to spend our lives working to serve the rich   we have the skills and the technology to do anything we dream of it is society mostly the ones who already own land to make things difficult for the ones who own nothing they care about property values about attracting other wealthy people like themselves they couldnt care less about the homeless the vulnerable people on power positions who order to remove benches from parks to build everything as uncomfortable as possible for the people living on the streets even the lucky ones who got to keep they cars after they were evicted face harassment for the police unfair laws that target them and make it illegal to sleep in their cars so they can eventually take their cars too leaving them on the streets  being homeless shouldnt be as common as it is in the us we have smart people we have the technology but we lack the political will to do anything they dont care about us we have to help each other as much as we can our strength is in our numbers and our unity  go out take a piece of unowned land save some money respect nature as much as possible maybe even improve the place it isnt yours but a place to temporarily stay to recover to build wealth lets go out and improve places make them beautiful so beautiful that people feel ashamed of destroying them ashamed of kicking out the people who live there we can do the world a better place  maybe nothing of this makes sense to you as it does for me or maybe im just too random jumping from topics anyway thanks for reading and have an awesome weekend,h7zzem

507,Most People Live At Their Job,with the covid pandemic going on most people worked with different schedules and i was one the the lucky ones that worked kinda biweekly  my experience was great when i was at home i got most needed rest that i couldnt have i spent time at my hobbies i spend time with people that i actually want to spend time about  i exercised i lost some weight felt better had time and mental energy for myself i was happier  well things normalized almost all workers from all sectors returned to work full force and i had a chance to hear from my coworkers and some friends about their experience   well most of them said they actually didnt like it i asked about exactly what was the problem did they got so much work or it felt really soul crushing while most people never came to work and they had to work it was nothing like that for them their workload was similar and they had some time off from work which they appreciated but the problem for them was the social part of the work they didnt see their friends they couldnt chatlive at work like they used to   one of my friends said that the last 3 months felt empty i mean i know he had work similar to before and had time offs that he liked but after this normalization he said this and when i asked what exactly he felt empty about it was about social aspect of the work that there was no one at work to socialize   my coworker that liked this normalization said that he didnt had any friend outside of work so he was happy that the things returned to normal  i mean these people clearly doesnt think that covid is still a threat that 1 person can infect all workplace and they can carry the virus to their families they are not sad about losing those free days they are happy that they could live their life at their job again like only meaningful thing in their life was to work at this job feel useful socialise with people and live this way  i cant fully blame them we work 10 hours a day and its like you are forced to give all your energy to these hours to have a meaningful life at somewhere you are mostly exhausted at home and you dont have time and energy to build any meaningful life outside of your workplace i was lucky to have some free years after university and not going straight into some job maybe that makes things different for me but still this is really sad,h7ryxz

511,Saving the world means not working,for the last year ive been offering my days and some of my nights to the deities of marketing and labor working at small digital marketing agencies means long hours underpaid work and an endless succession of meaningless tasks a big chunk of my current existence has revolved around producing content to allure lowincome people into buying multilevelmarketing products and persuading them into a pipe dream of success if that wasnt enough my newest client is an opinion leader who routinely calls epidemiologists dealing with the pandemic economic hitmen on twitter  marketing is such an exhausting and taxing industry not only to the people who work at it but also to the planet we manufacture propaganda to coerce people into buying stuff they dont need selling overpriced detox shakes or supplements funko pops fast fashion the newest samsung galaxy phones or another pair of sneakers that will likely get forgotten in the bottom of your closet  we live in a vortex selling and buying useless shit while the significant stuff in life like housing education and leisure become unattainable commodities  working on marketing made me realize that the solution or at least an important part of it relies on a simple premise all of us know not working the best thing a marketing expert can do to save the world is not creating an original ad to sell ecofriendly guacamole or reusable diapers the best thing he or she can and must do is stop working by not advertising useless stuff and getting rid of their own industry marketers can reshape that world in a more meaningful way than they could have ever imagine  getting rid of marketing and consumerism will free us all from work and save the planet along the way  i recently told a friend about my antiwork views and said to him something i read in this forum my dream is not having the perfect job my dream is not having a job at all  this is only a dream most likely an unachievable utopia but at least i hope i can get away from marketing in the near future and begin to change the world simply by not giving my time and effort to the capitalistic machine that sucks our will for a better world  do i sound naive maybe but at least its worth trying,h903gk

517,I think I'm going to quit my job,im terrified of quitting its a salary position with insurance and pto its financial security something i cling to people will judge me people will say i am making a huge mistake its such a good job they say but its also killing me i literally might not survive much more i have money but i am empty inside im terrified of quitting but im terrified of staying at least quitting will let me be in control of everything going to shit  i have almost no debt just a few thousand dollars on my car i have a couple thousand dollars in savings i live in a cheap apartment i have no kids just 2 cats who are my priority i dont want more stuff i kind of want to try just delivering pizza or working from home as a customer service agent will it suck yes but all bullshit work does will it be hard probably but something needs to change i cant keep doing what i am doing  maybe this is suicide either way but if i have to self destruct i want to do it on my terms  and the high i will get from walking away from my boss as they realize just how much i have done for my department in the last 4 years might alone be worth it  am i crazy,h0s8sr
518,What’s the alternative,hey everyone i am in agreement with all that i have read in this subreddit and i think selfexploitation in order to make money to survive is fucked but whats the alternative say everyone stopped working there would be no clothes no food no homes etc  i might be missing the point so please no hate but i wonder if we would truly be able to function in a society without work we would have to live like animals hunt for our own food build our own shelter etc and i dont feel like a lot of people are ready to do that   however i 100 agree that work culture needs reform so if i am missing the point i apologize just wanted to hear some other perspectives,h7nrct
519,Non Paid internships,how legit are these i recently applied to a few music marketing jobs within the county and got a email earlier today which stated that they are looking for a project coordinator for a non paid internship   the email also stated that there is only 1 paid position available and they are looking to fill it within their intern pool also the wording is very strange   so whomever comes aboard now will be in the running for one of the two paid parttime positions after their internship is completed the other position is already filled by an exintern   so to me it reads that there are going to be multiple non paid interns competing for the same part time position which is probably a little bit above min wage   i just dont understand how this is legal,h7ajnq

523,I recently got my first job and it has made me more depressed and anxious than I've ever been,i 16m started working at a grocery store about 3 weeks ago i only got it because my mom wanted me to get one for the first week and half i was a cashier a big reason i hated doing it is i couldnt for the life of me remember the codes for the produce some of them had the codes on the stickers but a lot for whatever reason didnt have stickers which meant i would have to look in this binder that had all the codes in it but it would usually take me a little while so i would feel like shit because im wasting the wasting the customers time   one day i showed up saw how it was extremely busy and got overwhelmed had a panic attack and ended up throwing up in the bathroom thankfully my boss changed me to a courtesy clerk which is what i applied for in first place if you dont know what that is cashiers call me on a phone i carry around ask me to check the price of a particular item i also have to return unwanted items back to the shelves and sometimes i have to bring carts in from the outside whenever the cashiers call me i have to go looking for the item but i still dont know the layout of the store that well i cant find it and end up wasting not only am i wasting the customers time im also the cashiers   when i try to talk to my mom about how i feel about it she says something like you havent given it a chance or you just have learn to enjoy it on the car ride to the store i always hope i get into an accident not big enough for somebody to serious injured just enough to get a few days off,h0rz1n

528,McDonalds UK is not adequately protecting it's workers right now and all it makes me want to do is cry,i work for mcds uk and as you may or may not know we recently reopened nationwide before returning to work we had elearning outlining thenew regulations in regards to health and safety small things like social distancing and screens to separate work stations were obviously going to be implemented as well as mandatory facemasks and gloves for staff that are customer facing the problem comes in the enforcement of these rules or lack of ive been back for 1 week now and every single one of the promised protective rules have been broken or disregarded   for instance on masks the company states that masks will be readily available up to three per shift these are non medical masks obviously and dont offer too much protection especially as both staff and managers wear them incorrectly off the nose and the like on day 2 i got told its now 1 per shift with the reason being they cost 75p each  the acrylic screens were quickly moved as they make the job harder in their default position originally they were between workers on the line separating in two meter boxes on day one they were moved to the middle and the only stations they cover are the fryers so the people handling the food are wearing dodgy masks incorrectly and are not separated by screens   we were told that everyone would wear gloves this is not true we were told it would be a maximum of 7 in the kitchen and during the rush of the first few days back this was also not true   we were promised protection which was rescinded the wellness check they provide is a scan with a digital thermometer which no one has ever seen their results from no one is scheduled to provide cover for anyone so its suspicious especially when i hear co workers regularly break out into a coughing fit   at the minute im terrified of asking to be furloughed for my own safety as all staff ive asked have told me that until i have a fever they wont do anything by then it could be too late but they havent thought about that   im angry and confused why are schools not safe or the government isnt safe but retail and fast food are a ok why has no one not warehouse not retail workers or service industry workers received higher pay for risking their lives by interacting with potential millions a day   why does the nhs which supports our country right now continue to not pay their nurses and doctors enough to not have to work 5060 hour weeks   help me because there of the last days ive accidentally let slip to managers my desire to go on strike  e also our service timer ranked leaderboard of the uk mcds and out customer satisfaction reviews were supposed to be turned off so we can focus on safety turns out the only one thats off is the csat which is the only one we lose money on 199 big mac and fries for a review   turns out the only rule we turned on was one not financially great,h10p1u

541,The New Spirituality,to briefly introduce myself i am a social worker of over a decade of education and experience  and multiple times over the last few years i have been caught fighting against the injustices both against clients and against staff in my field  i have seen individuals with severe mental health problems left to the street because they were no longer profitable  ive seen people taken into the system and their lives ruined because a judge ruled them incapable and failed to install oversights  ive seen employees threatened every day for speaking up and ive seen them murdered for not  i have always stood up tall against these things and on multiple occasions have lost my job because of it  i rarely last more than a few years as even a good manager will soon find themselves overwhelmed by the corruption and while they leave unwilling to put their career on the line to fight i remain and while there is never a single person who isnt aware of the problems and in agreement that something must be done there is also never a single other who will speak with me in all these years  so as a mental health professional i suffered from severe depression and anxiety with significant trauma lasting years attached to these jobs and these people i had lost  so i began to write to use what i had learned and create poetry in a style modified from those depicting greek and norse heroes outlining a practice for me to keep my head above water end my anxieties and most importantly to keep fighting  id like to bring up here a novel spiritual system a method of dispelling our fear and unifying us as well as a method of controlling our own depression and anxieties when we are fighting what needs to be fought  what im talking about here isnt religion or anything centralized but a philosophical system to unite and inspire us in a world where were otherwise ineffective at toppling the powers that prevent real change from occurring  let no greed and striving cause us stress and sadness   since were born were told to try and work our hardest   help withdrawn though once were grown we fall to failure   frustrated anxious depressed to termination were trying   until at last we die our eyes then dark and exhausted   do not let this plague accost us keep our eyelids   closed and strive for merely living safe and happy   see the worthwhile things in the world as love and fulfillment   what takes years of work one loathes cannot be worth it  this is from the nameless scripthttpwwwrenphilosophyorgrnpdf of rn philosophy stating that everything we do in labour is for some reward that were told is good  money  but beyond the bare minimum we require to survive we dont really need it  the concept of being rich is an illusory reward but because of it this frankly illogical desire we have these power structures and the resulting violence and inequalities  this philosophy is monistic like taoism and some other eastern ideas stating that everything is ultimately of one substance and it uses this to completely humble the individual to the point of denying its existence rn is used in the text as a pronoun to refer to any and everyone  it puts us all on the same page so that rather than striving to get rich to be better than everyone else and increase the self were instead uplifting each other recognizing that none of us are alone a unit  men of science call it selfish altruism   selflessness a fantasy charity happy fiction   but fables cache residual truth and tales remind us   extolling to give is as much for the sender as for the receiver   instinctive wisdom begs us feed the worn and helpless   where theres a choice the charity comes to them from oneself our   chest to hungry throats and have no agency process   the help were lending lest they squander the service rendered  although theyve been instrumental in gaining us rights in the workforce unions today have largely failed us in my experience  theyve become toothless being themselves large organizations with a disconnect from those theyre supposed to be representing  what we need is a sort of revolutionary altruism in which enough of us are on the same page regarding the same philosophy and can speak up against injustice directly as unions once did  to begin with upon seeing abuse happening in the workplace we should have the strength to organize together and stand up against the people in power who are propagating that abuse  as it is spinelessness is rampant among employees and that needs to change  when it does power can shift and we will no longer be disposable commodities but will have the final say in what we are worth and what we can do with our lives rather than expected to show gratitude for the privilege of giving our lives away to employers that will pay barely a living wage and threaten you every day of your life with your dismissal  because you are not necessary  we will become more necessary than them  we cant get there though without a drive and spirituality has historically been a great source of that drive  it gives both individual and community identity which is precisely why christianity has been so unfortunately used by capitalists to support conservative movements in the west especially the us which controls the cultural narrative in the englishspeaking world  so im hoping to introduce a new sort of decentralized spirituality in rn that regardless of ones religious beliefs or lack thereof a consistent worldview and sense of justice can exist in a great enough number of people to provide the energy for this sort of revolution  that if one practices and loses the sense of the individual number one being the most important thing in the world then they will lose the fear that prevents them from taking a stand against the injustices of modern capitalism  and by nature of spiritual philosophy they can take others along with them  thanks for reading this far  this subreddit is an inspiration and its good to see this much support for those suffering under our current system  i hope people will in time find rn to be a useful tool in enacting positive change in ending the exploitation of the working class,gvf9eq

544,Suggestions on how to get fired for performance issues - not “for cause.”,i feel like even subs like runethicallifeprotips wouldnt understand ill explain a little anyway im sure you guys dont need me to explain my reasoning  my job furloughed a ton of people from my estimation it seems like fulltimers whose health insurance they no longer wanted to cover as well as people who were the least efficient now theyre squeezing every last drop out of the people who are left parttimersthe most efficient people   im sick of being a number im sick of being treated like cattle im sick of the rules only applying to them and im sick of them only enforcing the rules when it benefits them and most of all im sick of constructive termination  for example i had two weeks of no pay last year without warning didnt know i could have collected unemploymentim young and stupid i ended up with less than 50 to my name at christmas with bills still to pay they didnt care about enforcing minimum work hours back then but of course now all of a sudden they do   my dream would be to get fired for a performance issue as thats just about the only way to get fired not for cause and even have a chance however small of collecting unemployment  its a shitty 10hr wfh job i can tell theyre starting to engage in some constructive termination right now but its so flexible they cant fire people for being late because the only thing that can be done late is turning in work late i believe that counts more as a performance issue rather than tardiness tardiness is easier to fire people for so guess what theyre doingswitching us from a flexible work schedule to set shifts everyone signed up for this job for the flexibility and theyre taking it away   i should mention that my unemployment payments even without the extra 600 weekly right now is significantly more than what i normally make at this job so even after 731 it will be better for me to be on unemployment  my question is how do i get fired for performance issues not for cause without making it seem like i tried,gwtsj9
545,Capitalism won't enslave us if we choose not to participate,of course we all need things but if we just buy what we need and nothing else billionaires cannot exist the system is designed to make us want more and spend more making us work more thats why advertisements are in our face everywhere   im only 30 but i have come to a point in life where i just dont want anything anymore no car no clothes no clubs no alcohol no applebees not even arbys im content to just buy groceries pay my bills and chill at home   only thing i wish is i had come to this earlier in life i would be so much richer im not rich by any means but my expenses are low which allow me to save money even on minimum wage im not stressed over layoffs job loss reduced hours ill get by   i know its cliche to live below your means but if we all were to practice it then not only would we have more money but our stress levels would go way down knowing next months rent is not depending on this weeks check makes jobs less stressful and offers more flexibility in life,gwn4cd
546,Is it worth living on SSI (in poverty) to not work?,is it worth living on ssi in poverty for the rest of your life to avoid not working i been really thinking about this a lot thinking about working ramps up depression and anxiety but on the other hand i dont want live in poverty either  ssi is a stable source of income especially during pandemic like this but it is also a low amount of money  the biggest issue on ssi is housing and once you have that i mean i feel like you be okay living with ssi the problem is that rent is sky high in rents are about how much an ssi check is and subsidized housing apartments have long waiting lists and once you get into an apartments you be fine and could stay in it as long as you want  personally to me though in the back of my mind i dont really feel safe inside the apartments just for the fact that the landlords could kick you out for any reason they see fit amp you most likely be living right next to troublemaker neighbors too and their monthly inspections amp pest controls amp maintenance its not like im going to dirty the place up its just i dont like how they can come inside where your living at any time they please it feels like legal trespassing i had this happen with roommates i was living with at my previous apartment in the landlords amp maintenance felt like they were coming in every other week in if they see or smell something they dont like they can evict you its like you have to keep the place squeaky perfectly clean at all times throughout the day because anything they dont like they can evict you because of it  speaking of roommates just thinking of living with roommates gives me hella anxiety amp depression i dont like sharing a bathroom with someone or a room inside someones house i dont know the roommates or the landlord from jack adam they could be a troublemaker for all i know  but because the government says this is how much money you get the only thing you can afford with it is a room like that  personally i rather own my own place i dont have to deal with anyone else i can live in it all to myself in peace amp quietness i dont have to deal with ever being kicked out but theres problems with that too i dont understand how a basic human necessity such as getting your houseshelter can be this difficult to obtain  to be able to get a home loan you need to get your credit score high in if you dont have that can take about 6 months to years to  get it high enough to qualify not only that but you need to get a cosigner on the loan to boost the dti because ssi is not enough just by itself so i have to go find someone else willing to just do that amp they are responsible on this loan as well and most likely they wanna live inside the home too so if i wanna live by myself i cant do that all because ssi is not enough for the dti to qualify for the home loan its just ridiculous the stuff that you gotta do just to get yourself a basic human necessity  the other options that i can think of to own your own place is that out of the ssi checks start putting amp saving money into an able account because inside those accounts you can hold more money than the ssi limit allows you can put 15000 per year inside the accounts vs the regular 2000 ssi limit  you can use the able account to buy a small land amp i guess a tiny housemobile home or something i really dont know how much it costs to buy a complete tiny housemobile home but theres all kinds of risks and stuff that you have keep in mind too with the land amp tiny housemobile home does the land have the sewer electric water if not thats a lot more money are there any infestations of animals on the land like snakes scorpions or something and does the home have good electrical wiring roofing etc if not there can be fires amp leakage from rain amp floods  what kind of insurances i need  and the land might not be able to get high speed amp low latency internet thats very good for online gaming because thats also the most important to me at least   all this stuff just really exhausts my brain thinking about all this just to get your own place that you can call your own amp a basic human necessity   im going through a housing crisis right now in im trying to evaluate all of this  but honestly once you have housing covered you could use the free time you would have to learn amp research all kinds of stuff like business amp skills if you wanted to do that to transitioned into a six figure income or more thats just an idea if you ever decide you wanna keep working  i just dont know what do you guys think is it worth living on ssi in poverty to not having to work,gwosp4

549,First Full-time Job and I Hate my Life Already?,i just started my first fulltime job yesterday and i absolutely hate it i have a bachelors degree and am currently pursuing a masters degree ive done a few political and government internships since thats the field i am interested in and have only had 2 small part time jobs throughout undergrad for brief periods of time luckily im in a position where i dont need to work at all i live at home and my parents pay my tuition but i still realize i need work experience for when i do graduate i mean how lame would it be if i graduated with a masters degree and had minimal work experience   anyway i hate the job i just started it was kind of given to me too and the pay is great for someone with no real expenses but its so drab the furniture is moldy the commute is over and hour the people are dead inside and the work is tedious and uninteresting this makes it all worse because i already hate the idea of wasting away 40 hours of my week for something i dont care about when i could be doing things that i enjoy and focusing on my studies i just feel bad because my mom has been freaking out about me finally getting a real job shes over the moon and it feels like this is the first time in a while that shes shown interest in my professional life i dont want to quit because i already quit law school after the first day so it feels like giving up without even trying but i actually hate it here   honestly i just need some advice am i being overly dramatic should i give it a week or two or go with my gut,gvesk3

551,Should I turn down a promotion during a pandemic?,i got a job as a bartender in december it was my dream job at first no complaints in february the owners approached me about managing daytoday operations i was thrilled they set a trial month where i do the work with no additional pay or real authority which kinda rubbed me the wrong way right before we closed because of the pandemic   now weve reopened ive restarted the trial month and im already feeling micromanaged it seems they still want to make decisions themselves big or small from behind the scenes while i am on the front line as sort of the messengerbarrier between them and other employees  they seem untrusting i have to jump through hoops to do what should be simple tasks ex they wont give me direct access to accounts or company cards i have to ask each time i need it  theyre also pushing the boundaries already on what my responsibilities are i assumed it would mostly be weekly ordering scheduling resolving customer complaints etc but now theyre asking me to come up with entirely new systems still in the trial period  also ive been refraining from seeming pushy but i have brought up pay twice with only vague responses no numbers im assuming this will be discussed at our review but normally when youre applying or trying a job you know the details of what youre getting yourself into  now im hesitant on whether or not i should even take the position its already caused me additional stress double the hours no balance and i have a feeling their monetary offer is going to be way below the expectation  my husband recently got laid off from a corporate management position with a similar boss so on one hand i feel its now my responsibility to make more money but his experience also showed me how draining a vague micromanaged position can be  advice,gxccm4

554,Small Business pretending Covid19 is over (venting/ranting),i live in a southern state that was shut down only clearly non essential businesses a lot of businesses never closed though from around the middle of march until around the middle of may the small business i work for was shut down in that time because were a clothingjewelry boutique so definitely not essential in the slightest  i was given the ultimatum of losing my job or coming back by may 15 so i came back my boss couldnt find any sanitizing cleaner so i ended up buying my own lysol to bring to work to sanitize the credit card pin paddoor handlesetc wasnt compensated at all for it either  we started selling fabric face masks and my boss brought down a series of like 150pt huge font printed pieces of paper that say we sell face masks to put in the front window  the problem is my state has had the highest reported positive cases since covid started just yesterday  higher even than any single day we were shut down our percent positive cases increased too so it isnt just increased testing covid is legitimately increasing here when i got into work today i saw that my boss had removed the sign on our front door that tells customers our maximum occupancy based on sq footage and to maintain social distancing which was part of the governors mandate for businesses to reopen  i cannot for the life of me understand how you can advertise that youre selling face masks to reduce transmission of a highly contagious virus and then just blatantly ignore any guidelines that were put in place to reduce transmission of a highly contagious virus this is far from the only example i have of him basically pretending covid isnt happening while simultaneously selling face masks he literally said almost verbatim maybe some people need to die maybe its just their time to me the first day i was back at work so i know for sure hes not taking this seriously at all  i ended up making my own max occupancy sign and put it back on the front door where the old one was i work alone usually so ill be enforcing those while im here if it causes an issue i guess ill have to decide if its even worth it to keep working here or if i need to move on to something else justwhat the fuck is wrong with people you know,gygn69

577,Two years out of college and I'm already sick of working (long rant),before i graduated from college i had several career options in mind i wanted to be a business analyst marketing analyst or financial analyst because they seemed like interesting careers that paid well i applied to hundreds of jobs beforeafter graduating from college and kept failing interviews because of my social anxietyand inability to make myself seem like a good candidate i dreaded interviews i was always nervous and messed up no matter how much i practicedprepped for the interview  after a year of grueling interviews i landed a job as a content reviewer it wasnt what i wanted but i took it because it seemed interesting and id be getting paid however it was anything but interesting my mental health slowly deteriorated to the point that i would sigh before getting out of my car to walk to the office because of the content id have to review a month into the job i decided to quit because my mental health was more important to me than working in a job that didnt even require me to use my degree   a few months after quitting i got another job as an administrative assistant still not what i wanted but i had no choice at this point i wanted to quit within the first few days of doing the job because they slammed me with training on a bunch of different areas and i got overloaded because of all the technical terms and steps i decided to tough it out and after two months everything settled down i didnt even have to do some of the stuff they trained me on   a couple of months ago i had my first break down while driving to work i started crying because i was tired i was tired of everything i was tired of doing the same repetitive work over and over i was tired of getting paid little i was tired of not being in the career that i intended after i graduated i thought id be stuck doing this type of meaningless work for the rest of my life despite having tried so hard to get a college education   most importantly i was tired of working i was nostalgic about my college days the days where id see different faces every day as i walked through campus the days where i was surrounded by likeminded individuals that i could talk about anything with being stuck in an office for 8 hours a day around the same people doing the same damn thing and faking being professional is tiring   recently ive been thinking asides from the obvious reasons for working such as money to repay debt repay parents groceries material goods and traveling what is my purpose for working why do i want to have a certain job title when all im doing is being a humanrobot for a company why do i have to work until retirement age why is a certain career more respectable than another career why do i care about peoples opinions about what career i have will i ever be truly satisfied with any job that i have does a dream job even exist why are we stuck in this system of working our lives away for things that we dont even need   tldr its been two years since i graduated had two jobs that i absolutely hated and am upset that despite having a college degree im still stuck doing lowpaying jobs that dont require me to have a degree,gxyxa9

588,[New York] Keeping work search records for 1 year from START EFFECTIVE date or from the date I SUBMITTED my UI claim??,few people i came across said to keep work search records for 1 year i submitted my ui claim during this pandemic on 592020 and certified weekly starting 5112020 and currently getting paid when i got accepted my start effective date is showing 392020 and expires on 3142021 so when they say to keep your work search records for a year is it from the start effective date 392020 or the date i actually submitted my ui claim 592020  also after my ui claim expires and can they still ask for my work search documents or no  wrote this post out of concern that i fall into the group of people that has to do work search during this time,gwcgzr
589,Worse resignation experience ever,told manager i wanted to quit today i raised the issue of my deteriorating mental health a month ago they tried to make arrangements for me eg suggesting a break a transfer but nothing worked out in the end okay whatever thats fine  some highlights from the excruciating and inappropriate i quit conversation  also need opinions on whether my resignation talk experience is normal cuz i honestly feel super disturbed by the entire event   managers first question was what made you so traumatized i replied that traumatized isnt the appropriate word to be used  manager went on to probe about personal issues like my academic background my future plans how long do i plan to rest and what elements do i like in a job lol why was he turning this into a fullblown job interview to be fair he made a sound point here that not understanding what you wantdont want in a career would only give rise to the same problems again but i already knew that so it felt condescending he always advises me on super obvious stuff and makes me feel im dumb  plus i am resigning on the ground that i need to focus on my mental health tbh i reaaaaally need to settle this would you force an employee to talk about hisher future career plans if they quit due to  idk heart disease he isnt the nicest to work with and now were suddenly buddies who could share our personal aspirations and our struggles  he went on about how big our firm is were growing and how i could simply transfer to another department he also made an underhanded comment about how other places are shit you wanna go into industry b in the future i knew someone working in that industry their hours are shit basically telling me that i might land myself in a shitty position if i leave  see i had to put in extended pauses during the conversation because i was not comfortable with the interrogation at one point i reminded him that the purpose of the conversation was to work out the resignation process and to plan for transition if needed  additional highlights my interview experience for this job was shit as well because the hiring person spent the entire session tearing my resume apart and insinuated in the end that i should be grateful if i ever receive an offer from their glorious firm he also stated that they would fire me within 3 months if i dont perform,gwcok9

611,"Just had a mass exodus at the small coffee/bake shop I work at, kickstarted by the riots. Working on my courage too (Wall of text incoming)",our manager who is black sent a group text to the staff that she would be taking a few days off and was honest about not feeling safe being out in the world due to the state of our country   all personal feelings about that set aside we all offered to stay latearrive early for our shifts to provide coverage including the one other black girl in the shop who said me too ill contact you later for specifics   so the owner misinterpreted both of the texts thinking they were both quitting wrote back to the entire group text take care ladies fyi team interviewing for a new manager fingers crossed and then went on a rant at the shop in front of other employees no customers   i was not there so i cannot say what exactly was said but her nephew also an employee said that although she did not use any actual slurs she was very disparaging the gist of what i was able to gather is that the owner insinuated they would be joining the losers at the protestsriots and so were losers themselves i believe there was also a fuck them thrown in    at the end of the day during my shift her nephew privately pulled her aside and told her that she was way out of line and was not acting appropriately in front of her employees thats when she doubled down and actually brought me into it how she is tired of the disrespect and brought up the previous manager a guy who helped her open the store just over a year ago and also left on bad terms she seems to have created this fiction in her mind that i was tainted by the guy i suppose to help maintain her denial of how deranged and woefully unprepared she is at both business management and people management to clarify this was all behind my back her nephew informed me of everything after she left   anyway long story longer her nephew then informed our manager and the other employee who unwittingly got pulled into the whole thing this was all on wednesday thursday night the manager calls me and lets me know that she the other employee and the owners nephew would be quitting and by this morning friday i was off they had all contacted the owner to let her know this all after she apparently talked to whoever was on shift at the time in a damage control effort   which brings me to me kind of in a tough spot because while i do have an interview in the morning i am scheduled to close and i will be closing with only her now she has never bothered to learn the front end stuff she is primarily the main baker and she has 2 other full time bakers so not only am i not looking forward to the impending shitshow on a saturday i do not want to be in the building alone with her   on the one hand i know it is not wise to quit without having something affirmatively lined up but i wonder about the toll on the psyche that staying with a passive aggressive and demeaning wolfinsheepsclothing employer obviously im not providing the whole story here been there about as long as the shops been open and though she didnt get this bad until around the holidays it has certainly been   ive got the email saved to drafts and am just looking forward to killing this interview,gxks7s

635,Anxiety about quitting,my job has been absolute hell   expectations doubled tenfold  were only given ten minutes to work an account    we have to log every single minute were not marking an account complete were collectors for a    dme company and turn it in at the end of the day to explain what weve been doing    our expected accounts per day doubled and even if you exceed that goal on a daily basis youll get in trouble and considered a productivity concern because you had a day where you had to do paperwork heavy tasks like authorizations   our task list before were even allowed to do our main assignment has grown significantly weve been getting other departments work we get several emails every day told to drop whatever were doing and do this instead and we get bulk accounts back to work again with the simple note fix it and nothing else  all to get reprimanded every morning when youre behind your actual job description   constantly told how lucky we are to still have jobs and constantly threatening to bring us back into the office because its a privilege to not work in a crowded office during a fucking pandemic when the job is totally doable from home which has been proven for the past 3 months    my supervisor has been rude dismissive unhelpful and she plays favorites with three of our coworkers who incidentally are the dumbest hicks ive ever had the displeasure of working with they make everything a racial issue andor a political issue where they have to own the libs they have made several inappropriate comments to me as a half chinese woman regarding the virus which my supervisor found hilarious hr has been called on them several times nothing happens just this week they used our work chat to make fun of the protestors   yesterday i was in a meeting with my supervisor and her boss about the working conditions and i was gaslit to hell or given an excuse and talked down to like i was a spoiled 3 year old not everything is about you i cant cater to you you dont know how leadership works  i told my boss im leaving early gave her two hours for a response none as usual so i just clocked out   im returning to school in the fall to finish my bachelors i have a few thousand in savings and i live rent free with my mother but i do assist with other expenses and have been supporting my own education   student loans are already in my future would it be stupid of me to quit and take these couple of months to learn a skill or two and work on my online content i know its a long term endeavor with absolutely no guarantee of success but surely i can do better than what im doing now   or should i be allowed to be called back in and pray i get fired for ui since im already very behind my assignment despite trying my best with what i had   tldr i work in a micromanaged hellscape with racist coworkers want to quit and have a couple months to invest in myself before i go back to school should i,gxuend

639,Finally left my first real job! Also what I have learned.,on april 8th 2019 i started my first proper job as a data analyst i was very hopeful going in with high expectations and wanting to prove myself to be the best   this quickly changed after the first week i learned i was very naive and my optimistic mindset turned very pessimistic during my time i have had serious bouts of depression due to work where at one point it was so bad that i was having suicidal thoughts and took a month off of work i had planned to hand in my notice right after this month off but due to personal life circumstances i couldnt do that this handing in my notice was supposed to be in october 2019 i ended up handing it in in march 2020 and was meant to leave on the 9th of april 2020 but due to the pandemic situation i extended my contract by two months which leads to today today was my last day and im finished i feel very relieved and liberated i know it isnt the ideal time to be unemployed but i think this decision to leave is the best for me  the things i have learned are the following  1 corporate world is hell  2 companies do not care about you  3 rock the boat somewhat and you will get in huge trouble  4 seniors will give you a hard time if you are not submissive  5 work in the grand scheme of things just isnt important you are important your mental health is import your hobbies are important and your happiness is important obviously with how the system is structured were going to unfortunately need jobs but what im saying is theres more important things in life  not sure how the future looks for me right now this pandemic is of course problematic but right now im happy to have some rest,gx9avb

641,Competency based interviews,i hate them theyre a form of bigotry against anyone who isnt a corporate extrovert type in fact ive been applying for teaching courses to upskill from my current job so i can get a secure teaching job and am surprised to see this corporate nonsense infest its way into education they basically ask for the life of a fictional character ive never had any real overt conflicts in the workplace ive never worked in a team etc i havent led that life of the office go getter ive never even worked in an office and would be remiss to do so if it was corporate i find the types of people who use them to be also highly corporate and by that i mean they lack any remotely human characteristics they just come across as arrogant shallow and judgemental the kind of person who came up with this and the so called star technique which sounds condescending as is i remember this bs from school eg stars awarded being called a star must be a shit stain on humanity any interview which has ever been about the actual job has gone well when these types of questions were absent the interviewers were comparatively less odd in that disturbing corporate way you get with competency based interviewers there was way less bs and answering technical questions was easy   i interviewed with the foundry back in 2010 they make a compositing program called nuke i read the entire manual for nuke only to be subjected to a competency based interview which i bombed i was baffled why they would use personality questions as opposed to asking about the actual fucking job irony or ironies i knew more about the software than the interviewer and pointed out obscure facts about it which she didnt know i didnt get the job either way as i had the wrong personality im still angry about that interview because of how judgemental the interviewer was and how the questions were a kind of personality discrimination in that unless you conformed exactly to mr corporate tm you were out   by contrast interviews about the actual work went far smoother i could talk at length and they were far more relaxed,gvudmj

648,Guys…I think I’m doing this…,im living in germany and here we have a program from the government which is called hartz iv this means if you dont go to work or you cant you can make an application and then youre getting your rent paid and on top of that you also get paid for food its not unlimited and you have to live on the edge but honestly i wouldnt care about that i dont need any luxury things i just wanna enjoy live and its not an easy life because you dont get that much money but from several people which i also read on the internet they are happy without working and they are enjoying their lives in the end of the day you can say you get paid by other people and they wont like you but i mean if there isnt any other system i wouldnt care and in the end when i see how much money goes out of the window because of stupid decisions from the government  what do you think,gvupr8
649,Being off work for quarantine has really shown how bad it aWis for my mental health and now I have to go back.,i am just venting i do not have a choice about going back to work i have social anxiety disorder which i can manage well enough to be functional but it is very exhausting  having to work any job really pretty much takes over my whole life because its highly draining through the day and i simply dont have energy for anything else i get home from work and i just couch potato and go between being anxious in anticipation of the next work day or dissociating until bed and then do it all over again the next day  being off for quarantine is probably the most peaceful time ive ever had ive been waking up looking forward to the day ive been doing all my hobbies like sewing and other crafting ive had energy to keep my house clean cooking healthy meals journaling ive been more available for my partner just overall much happier and content feeling   and then as soon as yall about return to work started ive been back in this anxiety constant low grade adrenaline rush happening   i guess the point is that although i already knew that work is pretty brutal for my mental health this quarantine time off has really highlighted just how bad it is,gwux9p
650,Please just listen....just once,this is my second time ever tripping and am in my room listening to trey songz  how many times this song is basically himtrey songz asking how many black people have to lose their lives before thispolice brutality racism stops   like keep in mind that am african not even african american and yet i see exactly what his talking about i dont understand how racist people think or work do they think we just chose this skin colour do they think were playing the sims in real life if you are white i understand am different from you but bro everyone outside your consciousness is different from you whether they share your skin colour or not thats a real person just like youmom father family dog whatever a person breathing air experiencing life just like you if you are racist am sorry am black if i could undo it i would even better if i had a choice i would choose not to live   i dont see how i can keep living in a world where based on your skin colour you are automatically assigned to a role where just because of that one thingyour race you are supposed to face so much just imagine living life everyday fearing police not for what youve done no but for what they will do to people with your skin colouri cant go i hate that their are people who will read this and think am making myself as a victim am notam not even african american i think these guys have advantages thats we in third world countries dont but what am most grateful for is the fact that where am from we dont fear the police nor do they beat us to the point where we die and if thats what triggers you of all i wrote please reflect on yourself   im not christian so i know justice wont be served in no heaven or hell i know very well that the people who came before me centuries ago whose lives where taken with no second thoughts i know very well that their is no  ultimate justice so just like trey songz am asking how many of us will have to die before this ends  if you read up until here am aware this is just a reddit post and will never end whats happening to black people but thank you for atleast listening to me i just could not bear it anymore,gxfu7s

681,Job-shaming,once i worked at a retail store managing their social medias all i had to do was take pics of the products post them with a caption and talk to customers i made very little money since i worked part time but i didnt hate every second of my day after i told myself i needed to up my game i quit this job to work at a terrible 95 where i suffered every single day i would literally cry while working i hated it so much and i never made so much money but i hated it still my parents shamed me for hating it because of my salary after this one ive never had a job i didnt hate i miss that ill never love any job but at least i didnt hate it  ampx200b  i guess what im saying is why do so many people feel this need to grow and grow why cant i be left alone with the only job i dont hate i rather live minimalistically instead of pursuing high paid jobs that stress the fuck out of me why is that bad who am i hurting,guos74
682,I feel like I'm going crazy,im a government employee who works with the public a little and ive been teleworking for 3 solid months now due to coronavirus  i initially started teleworking when i told my boss that i had covid19 symptoms i did this on purpose because i didnt feel safe going to work and sitting close to coworkers in the middle of the outbreak we were still doing businessasusual at that point early march im in the nyc area i was granted permission to stay home teleworking for 2 weeks and told to take a covid19 test i never took the test because my doctor wouldnt order it they were severely limited at the time and i was pretty plain with her that i was bullshitting my employer about symptoms because i was scared to go to work due to the scare i created at work the city decided to let all employees work from home right when my 2 week quarantine period was ending  fast forward 3 months im more productive than ever my employees are doing more than ever i am a low level manager with a 2 person department that i give 1010 star performance reviews to every year and dont give a fuck what they actually do because fuck this city we have an understanding that if they just tread water i dont care they usually play videos at their desk most of the day and i turn my head because i hate my boss and this city and work in general anyway digression  i found out today we all have to go back to work in the office 95 not even staggered shifts and resume work as usual the same work we are fucking doing right now at home they plan to put up shower curtains between our desks there is no plan to clean the staff bathrooms more than nightly we are told to wear masks as much as possible at our desks i wrote a strongly worded email to my boss about how ludicrous this is not to mention dangerous he said he agrees with me but theres nothing he can do he relies on me to run the fundamentals of our department so i need a good working relationship with him or my life will be even more hellish than it is  i dont know what the fuck to do i want to quit but im so deeply entrenched in this organization and im worried ill never get another job in this economy i could survive a while and help my partner with his business hes selfemployed so its not totally bleak just a big risk  i already requested to continue to work from home but i dont think itll be approved im told not even health accommodations are likely to be granted i have considered saying bye but the handoff of my position would take bare minimum 2 weeks due to everything i do and manage no one in my city department except my own 2person department knows how to even like operate a fucking computer mouse without a 10 page manual so handing off would be really difficult i sorta made it this way on purpose for job security now i feel trapped  im doubly trapped because my boss relies on me and i need to keep a good working relationship i cant just be a total dick to him or i might as well just quit in that case anyway  on the flipside the city where i work and other people i know are making me feel crazy for feeling unsafe returning to work a lot of things have opened back up despite numbers not going down much were in the og hot zone over here but people are sick of staying home and all think its time to just go back to normal so talking to most people is no help  anyway it feels better just getting this off my chest i have no one i can talk to it about except my partner and he is giving me really wishywashy advice because he doesnt know what i should do himself hes really unhappy about me returning to work though he thinks its an unnecessary risk and stupid,gvba6n

684,still having dreams about my last job,i keep having bad dreams about the job i quit back in october which goes to show how badly i was treated there i guess this time it was some old lady who wouldnt tell me what she wanted and i didnt have a big enough box to put her rolls in almost nobody ever made boxes when i was there i guess i got mad and walked out again then when i was trying to leave every street was blocked either by traffic pedestrians or a log lying across the road   every time i have a dream like that it reminds me that i made the right decision the town is full of vacationers and shitty old people who are always creeping on their neighbors i hated it,guq2hz
