8,[Serious] Parents do not respect me because I'm not working at the moment,"This is a bit of a rant, but I want your take as fellow anarchists in this situation. Also, I'm posting here because I don't know of any psychological help subreddit. Delete this post if you think it's been misplaced.

I'm 21 years old, I'm studying a career and I have a very good average so I can apply for a scholarship to go study abroad in the future. I still not have any work experience, but I will seek to start working soon (6 months-1 year, when studies lighten up a little). My parents said today that they ""cannot respect me"" or ""treat me as an equal"" because I was just ""exploiting"" them (I know I'm privileged) and that I didn't give any fucks about them. They are in a bit of an emotional rollercoaster since my sister went to live with my grandma (escaping all the stress), but I hate the situation. I help around the house, I study a lot and I only absorb stress and bullshit. I don't ask for money either, only for transportation and lunch food when I need it... it makes me feel like real shit and a burden, more so with the economic situation.

They work and they just want us to be as exploited and ""useful"" as them, they want my sister to even wake up at 6:00AM to make them feel like they are not the only ones being harassed by the system. It's nuts. I'm considering getting psychological help to even survive and be functional (I suffer stress a lot), or to start working full-time and moving out (but this would kill my academic performance for sure... and my hope).

I'm not lazy, but how can I even be motivated to seek work when all they show me is stress, anger and frustration caused by work? How can I go to them with a smile and do everything they want when I know this is not helping at all? They want me to show respect (I'm very grateful in fact) when they think I'm a social parasite or something... I can't stand it.

Did you ever went through something like this?

Yeah, I know, ""first world problems"" (thirdworldist btw), ""grow a pair and face the world"", ""go work you lazy shit"", etc., etc. I'm sorry if your worldview doesn't fit mine, this shit makes me feel angry and ashamed due to the current work ethic.
