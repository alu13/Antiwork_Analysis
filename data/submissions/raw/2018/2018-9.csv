0,I quit my job.,"I got out. I quit.

I’m following up on my previous post’s update. I finally quit my job. 

It was a difficult past year and a half in it. I should’ve earlier than I did, but I pushed myself through it thinking I could make it work. I was in sales. The company wasn’t bad at all, the position was. It was soul-sucking calling clients constantly with little to no return. The only reason I hung on was the stable paycheck and my manager’s desire to coach my through it and put me in a position that he thought would fit me better.

The second position I was in turned out to be even worse than my first. I had no superiors who were fake, passive-aggressive, and expected me to know what to do with little instruction. I lasted in the role before I brought up to my manager that I finally want to put in my two weeks’ notice. He said he was disappointed, but he understood, and that I’d be missed. I was a bit sad too, it’s difficult to leave an environment you’ve been in for over a year. My manager told me there was no need for me to stay any longer, and that I was free to go that day. I went around to my old sales team, and the few people I’d gotten close to that were in the office that day to say goodbye.

I was shaking and my heart was beating fast when I finally left the office. I had never done anything like this before. Could I really be doing this? I thought to myself. I got on the bus back home and sat in a daze, still comprehending what had happened and what I had finally done. I was free. No more waking up during the night stressed, no more strict schedules, no more meetings that go on for hours, talk of budgets and expenses and new clients. All the things I couldn’t give less of a damn about. I had no more obligations. I was finally out.

**
It’s only been 2 days now, but I’m so less stressed. I used to have a habit of grinding my teeth whenever I was stressed, even when I wasn’t at work, even when I was going about my day. That seems to have disappeared. I no longer have random bouts of anxiety, or feelings of dread and apprehension about the upcoming week because I no longer to go back to the position I was in. I will continue with my serving position on Wednesday, and the following week I’ll begin nannying full time. The thought of seeing those children again smiling puts a smile on my face. 

To those of you who are struggling to get out of your position, I assure you that one day you will find alternate means to sustain yourself and you will get out. Even if it doesn’t seem like there’s hope, find something to hold onto until you reach the end of the tunnel. In your darkest days, remember the things that bring you contentment, remember your purpose and passion. And then go off and find yourself a life worth living.

9,Would you date a workaholic?,"Just a general question for all of you. Would you date an individual who obsessed over a job, ""lived to work"", constantly talked about it, defined themselves and others through jobs, etc.? 

I'm curious to hear the opinions on this.


I personally would never do it. Ever. I want to be with somebody who actually has a life (sounds harsh, but I'm being honest). If you only feel worthy and satisfied with life when you're being used as a tool/another pair of hands, then try to define yourself by something you only do to make some money, then proceed to apply those poisonous ideals on other people,  I don't even want to be around you, let alone date you. 


I'd be with somebody who realizes their life doesn't revolve around a job, and that it's just a temporary burden that we gotta put up with to make some $$. Simple as that. They would know that their real life takes place OUTSIDE of that workplace and realize that it always comes first. They wouldn't dwell on anything that happened there or allow it to affect them or their peace of mind. I could say more lol but I'll leave it at that for now.

12,"For those who feel like jobs are consuming their lives and taking their identity, please read this.","(I'm gonna get a little personal here guys, but I think highly of this sub and its members, so I don't mind it) Trust me, I know how much it sucks. I also used to feel like you. 

Feeling like you're nothing but a tool in life and that nobody actually cares about you.  Feeling like when you go home, you're just on a ""extended break"" and that your job is your real home. Constantly feeling like you don't really mean much in the grand scheme of things and that you constantly need to stress yourself out to gain a manager/supervisor's approval.

The only point in my life I have ever been depressed was when I thought like that. It lasted for about 1.5 years. I was suffering. But I managed to become myself again, break myself out of that bullshit state of mind, and reclaim my life and hold onto it stronger than I ever have before. I wanted to share my strategies for how I accomplished this, I really hope this can help somebody out there as well.

____________________________

1. First and foremost, the most important thing that must be done is you need to strengthen your mind. Constantly think deeply about topics that never really sat well with you. Stop taking things at face value and letting people tell you the way things ""should be"". Think for yourself, put serious thought into things. 


2. SEPARATE.

 Imo, you should never reveal or talk about any details about your real life in a workplace. Put on a mask (metaphorically speaking) every single time you're there.  Be nice &amp; respectful sure, but do NOT get close with the managers, supervisors, coworkers, nobody. Don't ever let them think they really know you, and don't ever think they're truly your friends. B/c they're not. No matter what they say. Your real friends don't only view you as a tool to get a job done, and won't toss you out if you're no longer of use to them. Your real friends don't need to fucking pay you for coming to spend time with them. The moment you start getting close &amp; personal in a workplace is the moment you begin mixing &amp; giving your life to a job, and that is something that must NEVER happen (this brings me to my next point). Just get your money, and get the hell out of there.


3. NEVER view your life and a job as one. 

This is how you lose sight of who you really are. This is when managers and coworkers begin trying to subtly make advances to take more &amp; more advantage of you. They know that the job is all you think about, all you care about, it's your LIFE. So, they'll begin putting you through more &amp; more bullshit and expecting more from you because they know you're less likely to leave. 


4. NEVER grow ""attached"" to any job.

For anything concerning a workplace, put all of your feelings on hold. Completely detach yourself from it and don't let any experiences there intrude on your real life or your real feelings. Of course appear as if you're a ""motivated, proud employee!"" but this is where your mask comes in. Realize all of that is bullshit and just do the job the best you can and get out of there. Simple as that. Honestly, the worst they can tell you is to not come again.   
And there's a lot of jobs out here. Never feel like you're absolutely chained to a job and that it's part of your identity. If you do that, this'll also cause you to lose sight of yourself &amp; what your life really is. 


5. REALIZE &amp; KNOW WHO YOU ARE! 

Sounds simple right? You'd be surprised on how many adults out here don't really know themselves. It's the same people who say ""If I didn't work, I would be SOOO bored! Nobody needs that much free time!""

Sad. So so sad.

You gotta realize what you love in life, what brings you joy? What do you truly care about? What are your passions? What are your hobbies? What brings you peace, and makes your life into *your life* ? Reconnect with real friends, or make new ones! What have you always wanted to learn how to do? Go learn! 

These are crucial questions that we all must know, because this is what our lives really are. This is what defines us. Not what we'd ONLY do to make some money. That's ridiculous. Don't put your life in the backseat because of a job. Ever. Don't make your whole life revolve around a job and make it the center of everything. I get that you need money, but just think of a job as a temporary burden that you gotta put up with for a few hours. That's it. Get your money, leave,  and ALWAYS focus on your life and all the things you truly care about without someone needing to pay you to.


6. When you're not at that job, never let it invade your mind. 

Don't think about what happened there that day, don't dread being fired or worry yourself sick. Don't blame yourself for anything that happened there when you know you did your best or it was a mistake, don't mentally associate anything with that job (for example, associating one of your favorite songs with it and as a result each time you hear that song you get upset), don't ever feel like you're owned by it, don't dwell on it, and ERASE any thoughts about it that you may have. At the end of the day, we're all going to jobs just to make money, so keep it as simple as that. Don't see it as more than a way than to just make some money. I'm not saying you should do shitty on purpose or whatever, but I am saying that you need to remember a job is just a job. Never let it get to you.


7. Work less if you'll still have enough money!

Stop letting people tell you the ""All normal people work 40+ hours a week"" bullshit. It's garbage. You do what you want you to do. You're just as much of an adult as those zombies are (I'd argue you're actually more of an adult since you can actually think for yourself!) I personally only do 24 and will only go above that if I or my family URGENTLY needs money. The moment someone tries tellong you that a job should be a core component of your life and the center of everything, pay them no mind. They're probably the same people who see incredible videos on the internet of people having unbelievable talents and say ""They have too much time on their hands. Get a real job."" 

A job doesn't define you unless you let it, which I would highly advise people to not do. Because an environment where you're only seen as a tool  and only valued for your monetary output for a company who doesn't truly care about you is NOT the type of place you want to make define you. Be defined by how you treat others in your community, your friends, your family.  Be defined by your personality, your values, &amp; what you're passionate about.

14,[Serious] How do you do it?,"I'm talking about the constant grinding, sleeping little hours, making ends just barely meet, etc. I'm 22, with no work experience and studying a career I love, but I know the rest of my life will be spent working for others that I don't care about nor care about me, in some badly paid position (if I even get a job in the field I like) or something else that I didn0t study for and pays the bare minimum. This doesn't bring any happiness and there is no gold pot on the other side. I'm carrying on for the ones I love, for the experiences I want to have (loving relationships, good friends, travelling, learning things, etc.) but it all seems to be impossible once the real grinding starts.

I'm curious: how do people manage to work 8-12 hours a day just to get by, plus manage their lives? I'm just studying and I'm exhausted, can't do anything after Uni which is only 4 hours per day; this makes me very nervous. Also I'm anxious about the new work ethic you're required to have, not only you have to work a certain time, but you're expected to like it, to help the company/State, to be the best employee and to constantly compete with your peers. I can't handle it now where I see myself competing with everyone else in my classes...

19,The type of work nobody wants to pay for...,"Any volunteer work or free community service or even when you work for yourself by cleaning your home. I consider that to be work that is self rewarding, needed, and the type that doesn't generate revenue for anyone. Driving around poor parts of town you can see much of this work doesn't get done. Tall grass, homeless, run down buildings, ect. I think that entrepreneurs should offer to pay for these types of jobs to kick start the notion that a little kindness can make the world a better place, and possibly empathy. If an entrepreneur started a charity company to pay people in poor areas to cut grass, care for homeless, maintain buildings, or anything beneficial to people that isn't normally available to the poor.

Although I don't think anything significant will change in my lifetime, I'd like to think that we're on our way to a brighter future, but it seems to me that humanity has to learn a tough lesson about what money does to people. Too bad the idea of money has already corrupted us all like cancer. Money is just a tool to keep us separated. 

Everyday I dream of being able to work only for the benefit of myself and my community, and not the selling of my only resource (time) for a life of scraping by.

36,The first step in fixing a problem is admitting we have one,"When people find out I'm against capitalism, they usually assume that I'm a Marx loving communist and then they say shit like *""yeah, but Venezuela""* or *""but human nature!""*.

The point is: I don't have to be anything, I'm simply **not** a fan of wage-slavery under capitalism.

I guess what I'm trying to say is: You don't need a lable. Don't let people drag you into a convoluted discussion about ideologies, where they expect you to have a plan/solution for every aspect of any alternative of capitalism. Some of them just want to win an argument, they bring up Venezuela and then reinforce their love for capitalism.

51,"As a society, we need to change the meaning of the phrase ""What do you do?""","I'm so tired of the first question people ask of somebody being where they go to make some money. As if that defines them in any way. The vast majority of individuals wouldn't keep going to a workplace if they suddenly stopped getting paid for it (meaning this isn't really who they are), so why the hell does this society care so much about it? 


When I was a Junior in High School, my Economics professor told our class something I will never forget. Since I was only 16 at the time what he said kind of went over my head, but now that I'm a bit older, his words really resonate with me. 


He said something along the lines of,

""When I was in the military and stationed in Europe, I met a gentleman and had a conversation with him. I asked him 'What do you do?', and he told me 'I enjoy skiing, going fishing, and going on jogs'.

 I was puzzled, So then I told him, 

'Oh no no, I meant where do you work?', he told me he worked at a bank, but then he also told me 'Why does it matter where I work? When you ask somebody what they do, they should tell you what they enjoy doing in life, what they're passionate about.' And that really got me thinking about our own society and whether we focus on work too much.""


God, I miss you Mr. E 😭 He's one of the reasons I chose Economics as my major in College.
