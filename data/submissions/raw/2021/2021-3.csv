27,Automation,"I'm writing this to address some misunderstandings about automation.  Specifically these articles coming out about the ""stretch"" warehouse robot.

The issue is that a lot of these articles are actually just anti-union propaganda (since amazon workers are trying to unionize), and are basically just corporate terrorism.  I was reading one of these articles about ""stretch"", a warehouse robot with an articulating arm, with the undermessage of the article being ""this will replace warehouse workers"".

And it is union propaganda, because making a robot similar to stretch is childs play for Boston Dynamics, a company funded by DARPA, which is a US govt entity that creates alien technology.  Highschool students can make something like ""stretch"" this isn't some big development, because we don't have millions of boston dynamics teams to service every Amazon warehouse on earth.

The issue is, most people didn't read the article.  This warehouse robot is still piloted by someone.  All this ""development"" really reflects is a further alienation of the worker from their labor.  There will still be someone who needs to ""pilot"" this triumph of ""automation"".  There will still need to be someone to code and upgrade it's programming, someone at the call center to service troubleshooting, there will still need to be someone to manufacture it's parts, someone to do maintenance, someone to dispose of it when it has outlived it's usefulness.  You will always need someone, somewhere, to mine the very ore that it's components are made from out of the earth.

The issue that any form of automation will constantly run into is that it posits that the goal of capitalism is the preservation of, and slow growth, of capital, rather than growth by any means necessary.  As soon as a machine ""replaces"" some job for humans, the human workforce will be thrown back into the fire once more, they will always find a job for them because  this is an ""all hands on deck"" situation.  Any automation simply accelerates the growth of capital.

If this ""stretch"" robot were to be adopted by Amazon, one possible situation is that they are able to now demand more of their workforce, since they are no longer performing physical labor.  They will probably be under more intense mental and scheduling demands, controlled more effectively, as their capitalists demand a more unreasonable output from their workforce due to ""human limits"" being addressed.  That satirical ""wage cage"" where you need to ask your manager to unlock your articulating arm cage to go to the bathroom immediately comes to mind. 

As long as capitalism exists there will never be true automation, there will never be a genuine removal of the ""need"" for some worker.  Workers will only be further alienated, their position in the processes of capitalim will be devalued, and further exploited.  As industry becomes more and more sophisticated, through the use of more sophisticated machinery, workers will transition into more specialized jobs to sustain a more and more industrialized workforce.  This also makes the whole society more precarious, as it depends on a constantly shrinking workforce that no longer can comprehend the immensity of processes that hold up that society.",False,mh6erf,capnbarky,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mh6erf/automation/,7,1

34,Being squeezed dry,"I work for a community mental health center in a small midwest city. I worked my way up from part time to full time case management with kids. I used to really enjoy working with kids but now all I can see is us breaking them like horses and indoctrinating them into the cult of work. 
I recently attended a training for ABA therapy for kids with Autism and the whole training felt inhumane and like we were training the kids like dogs. To make matters worse my peers were all very excited for this training (mostly new hires) who all spoke to how applicable the training was in our work with clients. 
I really pride myself on my relation with the kids on my caseload and that they feel like I am a safe space to discuss troubling things in their lives or that they can just let go and be themselves around me. The center I work for though continues to heap new work onto the position because they  reorganize over and over and over again and every time it's the lowest paid full-timers who get a slew of new paperwork as part of the expectation for the position. I have watched the center roll back expectations for paperwork completion from a week to three days to one day now over the course of three years. The standard for service delivery has risen higher and higher too despite evidence that the effectiveness of the services decreases as caseloads become higher. I feel it is clear and plain-faced that the organization is trying to squeeze as much out of their low wage staff as possible. 
I have no delusions that the university I attended pushed me through my social work degree. I was a STEM major and floundered for years. I was never particularly prepared to live on my own and my schoolwork suffered. Imagine my surprise when I switched to a social work degree and started getting straight A's. 
So here I am. I don't know what to do moving forward. I want to go back to school, I want to find a new job. But more than anything I just want to be happy. My grandfather passed recently and he was a forklift driver with the same cannery for 45 years. I used to wonder how he could work the same job for so long or get fulfillment from a job he wasn't personally passionate about or made a difference in other people's lives but I have realized how foolish I was to make that judgement, that rather than living to work he worked to live with consistency and mutual respect to provide for the people he loved, and the position he was in is really the best we can hope for.

People keep saying I'm young and I have time to figure it out but I'm 22 and no closer than when I was 18 to having anything figured out and I don't even know where to start. I don't really enjoy anything and although I almost have an associates degree in chemistry I don't actually know how to do anything because there hasn't been actual labs in over a year. I just want to find some niche I can exist in thats societally acceptable but doesn't involve dedicating my whole life to working.

I have $8,000 saved up and I don't know what to do with this money to get myself out of this situation. They take everything personally. My sister is the head of the household and she takes everything personally. Here is a scenario for example: Yells at me while in one of her stupid OCD neat freak bullshit temper tantrums; she yells at me asking me, ""Is this your water in the refrigerator?"" I said yes. She said, ""It dont go on this shelf! Y'all treating this refrigerator like y'all did the other one!"" Then she said, ""I'm going to tell Leilyni ass this too! And I'm not fussing at you you're not the only one"". If you're not fussing at me then why are you saying ""Y'all""? If you're not saying it's me too then why are you yelling at me saying ""y'all""? She shouldn't be yelling at me period because everybody in the house uses the refrigerator so how the fuck can this bitch say I'm the one who made the mess when she has no proof of that?

I'm tired of the tension that everyone has with each other in the apartment. It's small apartment and too many people living in here so people get on each other's nerves easily. I come home tired from work and I want to take a nap but I can't because they are all camping in the livingroom; I unfortunately have to sleep in the livingroom because all of the bedrooms are taken. But they hardly spend time in their rooms and they don't have any courtesy for me when I have to get up for work early in the morning. 

I didn't move out yet because I was afraid of ending up homeless due to rent increases but at this point what could be worse than living with psychos everyday? I didn't know where else to post this. If this is the wrong place then I'm sorry and the mods can delete it.

60,How do I stop caring what other people think?,"A big part of my job is doing paperwork that has to be completed in a timely manner. I have always followed our office policy. But this isn't my whole job, I have tons of other things to do everyday. No matter what I do the paperwork accumulates and I have at least 8-10 at any given time (like, within a couple of days). It's also the kind of situation where if I do it quickly one time, that person will say ""but you did it within a day last time!!"" and it'll be a whole thing when we have to do the paperwork again. 

My co workers are especially annoying lately about me taking too long to do the paperwork (which has nothing to do with them but they sometimes get caught in the crossfire). I've talked to my manager and she agrees policy is policy and there are few exceptions, so there's no reason for me to rush to get things done immediately if I have 10 days to do it. 

But I get sooooo pissed off everyday about people rushing me. I don't do well with being micromanaged and I'm already stressed and overwhelmed in my personal life which I'm barely coping with.

64,Being self-employed sucks too.,"I've wanted to be self-employed pretty much my whole life. I have no desire to be the CEO of a company or have any employees though. I just want to do something I like and get paid for it. So I got my cottage food registration (I'm not allowed to call it a license in my state because reasons 9\_9) back at the end of 2019, so I'm doing everything legally and following the rules. I'm very good at what I do; there are a few photos of stuff I've made in my post history if you want to see.

I thought having my own business people would respect me more. LOL NOPE! No matter what I do I can't seem to get any orders coming in. I keep getting ghosted by people. People don't bother to read anything and have no idea what they want. I will ask them for more information about what they want and then never hear from them again. I've been ripped off; Facebook ads don't work, unless you throw LOTS of money at it, which I don't have. I got screwed out of money I paid for a booth at a vendor event which got cancelled due to Covid last year and then the company running it went out of business and it was too late so my credit union wouldn't help me get my money back. I share posts in several FB groups but get no response. Other bakers work looks like shit and yet somehow they manage to be more successful than I am.

There's so much emphasis put on good customer service; that's fine and well, but what about being a good customer?? Ghosting people is fucking rude. Don't waste people's time. It's OK if you don't know what you want. It's OK if you're just looking for a price estimate. It's OK if you change your mind or decide to go somewhere else. Just be honest! We're so afraid of being honest with people that all courtesy and respect has gone out the window. 

If a basic level of courtesy and respect is too much to ask for then I'm simply not going to deal with it any more. I'm taking a break. I'm withholding my services until people get their shit together and act like civilized human beings. If that never happens then so be it, but I'm fucking tired of this shit.

65,"At work, bored out of my mind, and need to rant about the insanity work can cause.","You just wake up, eat, work, come home, try to de-stress, but you can’t, so you resort to stress eating or absorbing your mind into video games, then barely get any sleep because your sleep is spent dreaming about the work you hate because of how burnt out you are on it. You constantly get stuck in a backbreaking infuriating cycle of work never able to de-stress, delving further and further into the realm of an almost schizophrenic level of insanity until the day you die, constantly being bent over and fucked in the ass by corporate-psychopath bosses who are incapable of viewing you as a human being.

(example: my old boss often showed signs of psychopathy, but the moment that took the cake was when one of my coworkers quit because our boss got mad that she needed to take a day off due to her sister having complications during childbirth and she needed to be with her in case anything happened. His exact words to her were “So you’re going to let this get in the way of your job?”) Work before family, fun, joy, happiness, physical health, etc.

You don’t get paid based on how hard you work, you get paid based on how hard you are to replace and that’s just the truth. You work like, what, 260 days a year, sacrificing time that could be spent with your family and loved ones selling your soul at a place you hate just to afford basic human necessities that are, by default, denied to you. Then get a 1 week vacation per year (if you’re lucky to get one at all) until the day you die or are too old to be able to work. wtf. I can’t do this. I love my girlfriend but in the long run I can’t see myself living such a meaningless existence. I’ve already attempted suicide before (prior to meeting my girlfriend), partly because of personal issues and childhood troubles, and partly because of the maddening infinite cycle of work. I’m starting to fall into the same cycle of thoughts that lead me to my first suicide attempt, the only difference this time is I have something holding me back and preventing me from doing it, which is the fact that with how close we are, my girlfriend would fall into as dark a state of mind as mine if I were to die. A breakup? Sure, she could move on, but I know for a fact that even post-break up she would be completely devastated if she found out I died, so I can’t do that to her. 

Honestly, the idea of having a family sounds nice, but I’m torn on actually having one because I’m not sure if I want to force more souls into this world (our potential kids) just so they can then be forced to endure the same cycle of bullshit that me and her go through. It’s cruel. Yeah, unlike my childhood, our kids would have a great, magical early life, but I can’t save them from the dreary, maddening onslaught of bullshit that the world will greet them with when they become adults.

76,Please dont make me dance at a work orientation,"The company I just started at has a first-week that is just introductions. Ice breaker activities, competitions between teams, 'fun facts about yourself', the like. 


I dread every second of it. I am not kidding when I say that this is the stuff I wake up in a cold sweat about in the middle of the night. 



I've been informed that the week culminates in a fun dance party where we will be asked to personally perform a short dance. Training lady started the first day with a one-woman standup set about how much she loves chocolate (hilarious material, Shanon. Good stuff) and ended by saying non-participation is her pet peeve- one thats only been a 'problem' once in three years. She warned that if there comes an issue where people arent participating she will get up and call people out if she needs to. 



I just want to get to work. This feels so patronizing. Im a person with pretty bad social anxiety. I'll take note of all your acronyms and 'pillars of such-and-such"", but I dont want to be made to dance for this job. 



It feels like I've been through this before- because I have. I had a previous job which asked us to create and perform a play at the end of orientation based on one of their customer service ideologies. Another big hands-on company with a 'great workplace attitude'. It just seems like certain types of personalities are designing training to be as uncomfortable for introverts and shy folks as possible. They all value inclusion, funny enough, but I feel strongly that I have no spot in these environments.

81,Some thoughts about bootstraps,"I feel like there is some merit to the whole pull yourself up by your own bootstraps arguement. Obviously you should expect food and labor when you yourself have done nothing to deserve it. It should be a sort of trade. A trade of one kind of energy for another.

But the thing is... With how companies are operating, the company owners themselves are doing just that. Especially with the larger companies, they are not providing a fair trade of energy. The workers take the brunt of the labor and energy expenditure then get a small percent of what their work is worth. These company owners are the ones who aren’t pulling their bootstraps. They steal the energy from their workers that they don’t deserve. And this causes a debt. 

I think this is also the cause of many of us average folks not being able to afford our own existence now. Because the company owners literally stole it from us. We did pull ourselves by oyr bootstraps. We work HARD. We DESERVE the fruits of our labor.

But people like the owners of these huge corporations, corrupt government officials, landlords, etc. They don’t do their share but then they steal OUR energy without doing the work to provide back for it and THAT’S why our economy is shit and why average folks can’t afford shit: because the fruits of our labor is being STOLEN by LAZY PEOPLE who can’t PULL THEIR OWN BOOTSTRAPS AND INSTEAD STEAL OTHER PEOPLES FUCKING BOOTS.

This is why I agree with many who are starting to say that localism is the answer. It helps to elliminate this debt by us average folk providing a fair, or as close to fair as we can get, exchange of energy. The answer is to stop supporting businesses that steal their employee’s boots. 

That’s my thoughts. Neither right nor left are wrong. We do need to pull ourselves by our own bootstraps, but we also need to stop companies from leeching off of OUR hard work.",False,mhi0lq,123ninjaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mhi0lq/some_thoughts_about_bootstraps/,7,1

86,Ramblings about some ideas I have about work,"Is it possible to reframe our thinking about work so we can live happier lives? Is the word ""work"" the issue here? I understand the need to be paid for one's services but what if instead of seeing it only through the perspective of a job for which we receive payment, if instead we saw it as a project. 

Let's say you have a personal project that you really want to ""work"" on, working on that project will bring fulfillment to your life no matter if you get paid or not. Similarly we can think of companies as the way for the owner to fulfill his project or projects. If you are not happy working on such a project you can always move to one you are happy with. If you are happy with even an administrative role within that overall project then that's good for you. Would time be better invested in the long run to trying to find and becoming qualified to do that job?

Another idea is if you don't want more control over your own future then one should think about creating their own business. You get to be independent and can treat employees how you would like to be treated. Personally if I were an owner of a business I would place the human aspect of recruitment first and foremost.

I've also been thinking about what I actually want to do in life and wondering if its sustainable. The first big issue I have is trying to live an independent lifestyle and moving out from a fixed 9-5 schedule. Maybe farm life would suit me, I get to grow my own food, I could have solar panels to power my home, there would be few things I would have to pay the government. I'm a software engineer so I could think about working remotely from there too. 

Another thing I would consider is instead of constantly looking for a promotion and climbing the ladder or learning new technologies, I would instead take a job I'm overqualified to do. something artistic or creative? Maybe this way I'll be valued more for my work and I can do the job with relative ease. After a certain point, having an extra bit of money is not important. I'd rather focus my energy of budgeting and optimizing.

89,My friend made fun of my plans for the future,"I've been scared to plan ahead because of everything being shit and how hard it is to make a living, especially with higher education and the student loan crisis in the US. There's no way for me to avoid it and honestly accepting that I'm going to not live comfortably is helping with the existential doom from the idea of capitalism. 

I figured that I can go to a culinary school near where I'm at and get my 2 year (full years, no break or vacation bc they basically speedrun the degree) associates in culinary, and then that on top of my 2 years of working at my current kitchen job, I can score a decent line cook job pretty much wherever in my area where a 25,000-40,000 a year is liveable (at least for now). Then I was going to live on about 10 dollars a week for food and forgoe specialities (like high speed internet or any kind of paid entertainment) in a shithole apartment so I can pay my student loans off sometime in the first 20 years of working. 

I explained to my friend that I'm going to work like this until I die, and if I become unable to continue in the field (like I'm 70 and roll down the steps so I cant do anything) I'll just die since it's a lot cheaper. They yelled at me for being pessimistic, but honestly this is the reality of it. I've been scared of ending up working away and letting a job slowly kill me, but that's the reality of my future and I figured I might as well accept it. 

But also I'm 17 and I'm planning a life out where I work myself to death, so I do see their point. The system in America in downright disgraceful and it shouldn't be like this. There's a lot of people a lot older than me working themselves to death for less money than I make at my part time job.

So far my schedule has been about thirty hours a week (but it's apparently part-time? What counts as full-time?) and I'm making minimum wage. I already feel really overworked! Like, I'm just full of this constant and insurmountable sense of dread -- all of my shifts seem literally impossible to get through, and then once I've gotten through them I start to worry about the next one. It seems silly to be this stressed about something this minor: I mean, the job has an end date (at the end of May), my coworkers are chill, I only just started, and it is still part-time. Plus, it's at an aquarium, which is something I'm actually interested in, though sadly I do a lot more work with customers that I do with any of the aquatic life. I'm essentially riddled with mental and emotional problems (depression, severe anxiety and attention/hyperactivity issues...) for which my family and I can not afford to get sufficient professional help (and which really impede my ability to do this sort of work), and consequently I can't tell my bosses about it because I don't have official diagnoses. Honestly, I don't know if I can even put up with a couple more months of this. I'm not in college until this fall, so I can't ask for fewer hours out of a desire to focus on studies more or anything like that. 

I seriously can't live like this. I don't know how anyone can handle it. I kind of want to quit, but I'm not confident that it gets any better.

You might be committing time clock fraud!

Time clock fraud occurs whenever an employee does something while
punched in that is unrelated to work (while not on a 15 minute break).

Or to”

Were are some easy-to-do tips to avoid committing time clock fraud:

e Use the restroom before you start work and before coming back from meals.

© Take sure to take off your coat/jacket, or other outer pieces before munching in.

e Take sure to secure personal items in a locked before munching in.

e Arrive early to ensure you have the time to complete any shopping or other tasks before
your schedule start time.

e Once punched in, you are on the clock and should immediately grab your equipment
and head to the sales floor.

Of 10 employees commit 10 minutes of time clock fraud a day, that’s 100
minutes a day. That’s 3,000 minutes a month which equals 50 hours of
Payroll lost.

Please remember that time clock fraud can lead to disciplinary action and
termination.

I worked through the pandemic in a completely optional, inessential line of service, sitting in an office, exposed to public transport and *the public in general* every single day. I kept lines and correspondence open, I kept up the legal services, got up at 5:30 every morning, and squeezed 8 hours of work into 4 hours a day for half pay, for two months- after which I put up with my boss dangling pay increases in front of my nose, promising and withdrawing as he saw fit. I stood by, bided my time, and put up with it and adapted when they piled extra administrative duties onto me that caused files that were \~10 pages to BALLOON to a whopping 22.

I didn't take a single day off between March and September, just because the boss said so, that they need ""all hands on deck"", trying to make me feel bad this past month when I actually, legitimately, caught COVID and was -by law- required to quarantinefor two weeks. Every day, I work from 8 am to 5 pm with only 20 minutes or so for a lunch break (on paper it's an hour of course, that's why I'm 8-5 and not 9-5), I forge my attendance sheet because I work full time but my company only pays taxes after me as if I was part-time, and I get home around 6 pm.

Despite that, I'm still barely one rung above minimum wage.

So every day, I drink my nice, warm morning coffee in my cozy armchair at home, read a chapter from my book du jour, sit calmly on the bus and take my ass to work. I clock in when I get there, futz around until my shift officially starts (I don't get paid overtime anyway, why would I work unpaid?), go through what I'm gonna do that day, and take roughly 20 minutes of the morning to sit on the toilet and play puzzle games on my phone.

During the week, when I get home from work I find myself breaking down and weeping more and more, I punch things, even banged my head on the wall a few times today. I just don't care about the work I do, I make mistakes constantly because I'm not focused. I wake up angry and utterly gutted that again, I have to get up and drive the same drive to work I've done countless times, to the same building, through the same door, it actually makes me feel like throwing up sometimes. I'm so tired when I get home from work that I can't do anything, friends ask me to go out during the week but I don't want to do anything, I just try and grasp for time to myself. I need so much sleep to prevent the day of work from being grim as fuck, being tired at work is the most sickening thing, time feels like it's dragging claws across my soul as the clock ticks on.

30 more years of this? Really, it's not worth it, it's no life. Friends think I should go to therapy as if it's my outlook that's the problem, not the fact that 5 days of every week isn't mine, then of the two days off, one is spent in a depression because I have to repeat the process again the next day. My friends tell me not to think about it and to focus on the good things. Most of my memories are of work, since that's where I am most of the time.

Does anyone have any experience claiming benefits long term? What can I get? I can't do this anymore, it's killing me and there doesn't seem to be any point to life if this is what's in store for the next 30 years.

On a side note, I do feel like most people seem ok with it, some people where I work seem to enjoy the challenge of the job.

I can not be excited about doing the same thing over and over for 40 hours a week for 30 more years.

A few minutes after sitting up to try and compose myself I decided to stand up slowly and start getting ready for work. Well pretty much 30 seconds after standing up I had to run to the bathroom and throw up. I threw up about five different times. But I still headed into work in person to tell them I could not work mostly because I don’t know who to call when I’m sick. Now I work at a restaurant as a prep cook so not only should I not be working when I’m sick but it’s also kind of illegal. I get into work and my supervisor at the time just makes me feel awful for getting sick. Tells me it’s really complicated and that if I’m sick he might have to go home and makes me feel bad for all that stuff. I even offered to come in on my off day to make up the hours cause I felt really bad. So he made me call my chef and then I had to take the little health inspection we do every day before work. Well after sitting outside for 20 minutes they told me I wasn’t clear to work which I already knew but then they also told me I couldn’t come back for 10 days. I’m super upset I just got this job and I feel like they already hate me because I’m only two days in and now I have to take 10 days off because I threw up. So I text my supervisor and I text my chef and my chef is at least somewhat understanding but my supervisor literally said to me and I quote “Don t care... Go doctor let us know how you feel... Thank you....”. I keep telling myself I should’ve maybe just sucked it up and went to work and lied but then I keep thinking about how wrong it would be of me to be touching someone’s food after throwing up a bunch this morning.

145,I tried to do it right.,"I've tried my best. I really did. 

I got trained in a trade. But, I have a neurological disorder that would prevent me from ever working in that trade professionally. The trade school had no trouble taking my money, knowing they were training me for something I had no chance of working in.  

So, I got a degree in a thing I love and do well. Here's a loan. Everybody said that jobs wouldn't care what the degree was in. They said that it just mattered that I had a degree. 

Then, they started saying that I had wasted my time getting training in the thing that I love. So, I got a degree in the thing that was supposedly lucrative that I hate. But, so many people did the same thing that the job market was flooded with people who had the same skills. 

I send out dozens of applications a day knowing that 50% are probably fake or just companies farming data. I lie in interviews about liking high-stress, fast paced work environments. I pretend to give a rip about company values, as if a company were an entity that could have values. 

I take the jobs I can get. I have three. 60+ hours per week with an incredibly varied schedule that precludes making plans of any sort. But, they're minimum wage contract jobs with no benefits. I daydream about having dental coverage. Keeping teeth is a luxury, I guess. 

Now, I'm faced with a tide of people telling me to just get a side hustle. It's my fault that I'm not on top of my finances because I'm not working hard enough, not working enough hours. Get a gig. A hustle. But, that has even less security than contract work. And, when would I do that? Where are these hours of the day going to appear? I'd have to borrow from my sleep again. And, that'll kill me in the long run. 

Looking at the numbers, I'll never be out of debt at this rate. I'll never own a house. I'll never retire. I'll never be able to afford end-of-life care. I'll keep at this, prying at the doors of stability for the rest of my life, lining someone else's wallet. 

I tried to do it right. I've developed myself into an educated and hardworking employee, several times over. The bank can get their minimums. My bosses can get my minimum effort. I tried working hard and got nowhere. I may work hard again somebody, but I'm done for now.",False,mgn8i8,hillbillybogwitch,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mgn8i8/i_tried_to_do_it_right/,8,1

148,A different view,"Just to give a different perspective as most posters on here seem to come from different backgrounds than me.  I am a relatively high finance executive at a large public company, and the main function of my job is to help manage our profit margin, largely sitting in on meetings and discussing the ideas other departments put together, and occasionally throwing in some of my own, blended with reviewing, auditing, and analyzing our financial statements.  

&amp;#x200B;

Whether it's labor optimization, inventory, revenue growth, capital planning, etc, I've done pretty much all of it, and I think the one thing people on this thread get wrong is that people think there is malicious intent coming from a company's management when callous decisions are made.  No matter how high in a company you go, someone is breathing down your neck for results even the CEO, there is no such thing as good enough, and vacation time is always looked down on.  

&amp;#x200B;

The worst part is, in my view, that it's a self feeding cycle that forces our economy to function this way.  People demand bargain basement prices for stellar quality.  If you think about that for a minute, you'll realize one of two things is happening when you get those great prices, either you're being lied to about the quality, or something is happening behind the scenes to allow the product to maintain quality at such a price, because remember the golden rule, there is no free lunch.  

&amp;#x200B;

The food industry is a great example.  People love cheese, and cheese is expensive, so in order to get it to the masses and fill the ravenous demand, companies had to get creative.   First, they tried creating a product that was almost cheese, Velveeta, but once people started realizing that it wasn't really cheese, and just effectively toxic waste, sales started not doing so great.  The demand for cheap cheese was still there though, and companies had to again get creative.  

&amp;#x200B;

In order to get people real cheese, and keep prices low, animal abuse was used instead.  Cows are now treated like machines and rarely allowed outside, if at all, let alone allowed to graze like they should. Locked away in factories, where consumers don't see them.  Now consumers get their product and quality so long as they play along with what's happening.  

&amp;#x200B;

Pick any industry that has been scaled and you'll find effectively the same thing, just replace cows with chickens, factory workers, customer service reps, amazon drivers anything that requires large quantities of living beings to deliver its product or service, but has a customer base that isn't willing, or able, to pay what the true worth of the good or service is.  

&amp;#x200B;

This leads to the other end of the cycle.  Imagine the amazon worker barely scraping by on 15/hr. This person is in no position to be eyeing the ethics of his food, housing, or other goods and services he or she needs in order to prevent death.  Thus, he or she is forced to become the very demand that is driving down his or her own wages.  

&amp;#x200B;

There are obviously other factors at play that suppress wages for the bottom \~40% of the work force, unskilled immigration, globalization / international labor markets, the destruction and vilification of unions, but I think they all take a back seat to the obsession American's have for a good deal.  Sure you could go buy the high quality local famers market, or grass fed meet, or locally made domestically sourced cotton shirts that would all help create middle class jobs, but people won't, because Walmart offers immediate gratification for your bank account at the expense of the American working class for decades to come.

(And this talks more about physical exercise and urban planning, but it definitely relates to our modern work culture)
.
.
.
If I asked you - pre-pandemic - to think about public health, your mind would likely go towards flu jab initiatives, healthy eating campaigns, and posters warning us of the dangers of smoking. You probably wouldn’t think about urban planning - but if we want to truly combat one of the worst health crises on our hands, it should be a public health concern.

Inactivity is currently the world’s fourth leading cause of death. It's a problem often confused and conflated with laziness and personal choice, but in reality the issue is geographic, systemic, and woven into the structure of modern living.

In short: if we want to fix our increasingly sedentary world, we have to redesign it.

Political correspondent and cycling enthusiast Peter Walker dedicates a chapter of his new book to this exact issue. The Miracle Pill: Why a sedentary world is getting it all wrong is an eye-opening read, addressing our global inactivity problem and suggesting solutions for readers.

The more I read, the itchier I became to leave my sofa and get moving. After a couple of chapters, I ended up downloading the audiobook version so I could pace around my neighbourhood while listening to the seemingly endless bleak figures about the scale of our inactivity problem.

Currently, 1.5 billion people around the world are so inactive they are risking their long-term physical health. Every year an estimated 5.3 million people die from causes related to inactive living - roughly the population of Norway. An extraordinary 80 per cent of British children move so little that they face a future with poorly developed cardiovascular systems, weak bones and chronic illness.

These are just three of many statistics Walker presents and explores in his book. But far from being a guilt-inducing read, making a reader feel ashamed of their desk job or reliance on their car, Walker manages to instil a relentless sense of hope throughout.

During the book it is repeatedly made clear that patterns can be reversed, health can be improved, and it’s never too late to start moving.

Most importantly, however, Walker never assigns blame for this public health crisis to individuals. We haven’t all become collectively lazy on a catastrophic, global scale: the problem is far bigger and more structural than any one person’s choice to swap exercise for Netflix.

HOW IS URBAN PLANNING LINKED TO INACTIVITY?
Solving this sedentary crisis requires, in part, a rethink in how we design our towns and cities.

“We’ve designed the world such that in many, many places driving is more or less the only thing you can do,” Walker tells me.

But if we could all harness the power of activity, our lives could be dramatically altered.

The book’s name - The Miracle Pill - relates to a study in Denmark that tracked 30,000 randomly selected people over the course of 15 years. After adjusting for all other factors, the people who cycled to and from work (an average commute of just 15 minutes across the group) were 40 per cent less likely to have died during the research period.

“It’s this sort of statistic which helps you understand why some experts can go a bit misty-eyed when they talk about activity,” Walker writes in the book, “it’s also why so many of them compare everyday movement to the miracle-giving pill.”

He argues that were a team of scientists to discover a drug with the same life-enhancing effects, “a Nobel Prize would be more or less guaranteed.” Yet despite the obvious health benefits for people and planet, no such prescription for mass movement has been given.

Throughout the book, the experts Walker talks with repeatedly explain that the decline in global activity levels is because we have systematically removed the need for ‘incidental movement’ from our lives. Incidental movement is the activity that happens naturally throughout our day. Not purposeful exercise, but things like walking to the shops or cycling to work.

If we can redesign our towns and cities to support incidental movement and cycling, it will be better for planet and people.

As more of us work from behind desks, drive to supermarkets, and - especially at the moment - no longer even have a commute, it’s increasingly easy to be inactive for the majority of your day.

Interestingly, though, activity levels tend to be better in cities.

“There’s more people who will even just walk 10 minutes to get a bus or train, rather than just get into their car and drive straight to where they need to go,” explains Walker.

“So my exhortations for people to cycle and walk more are great if you live in the city, or even in a town, but if you live in a kind of small village and your nearest shop is a mile or two away and there’s not even a pavement to get there - then often the only safe option is to drive.”

He uses the cycling-loving Netherlands as an example. “The Dutch are obviously very well known for having bike paths in urban areas, but in lots of rural areas, too, they will have a kind of separated footway and bike lane.

“That’s the kind of thing you need to think about, you need to think about how places can be designed to allow people to move. To an extent this lies in the redesign of cities and towns, allowing for more cycling and more walking.

“The interesting case study for this is all these low traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs), which are being introduced partly in London, and lots of other cities, to make it easier for people to cycle or walk.”

For change like this to happen, Walker adds, it’s up to our governments.

“We need central government to get involved. It's too big for it to be left to individual local councils.”

Getting politicians to take notice, however, is a different matter entirely.

“I once asked the head of the Dutch cyclists’ union what she would do if she was in Britain to get more flexibility. She said ‘well I’d start 30 or 40 years earlier than you are now!’ And that’s almost the most difficult thing, because no one wants to be at that starting point.”

THE PANDEMIC MAY HAVE HELPED SHIFT PERSPECTIVES
Almost a year ago, as much of Europe entered our first wave of national lockdowns, there were reports from across the continent of nature and wildlife ‘recovering’. In the UK, for the first time since the Second World War, daily exercise was mandated to the nation as we were each allowed an hour outside our homes to move.

“Parks started to half-resemble some sort of idealised Victorian sanatorium, full of joggers, brisk walkers, people skipping or lifting weights,” writes Walker in his book’s introduction.

When I speak with Walker he reflects on how people reacted to these early weeks of lockdown.

“A lot of people who live in urban areas had this period where they suddenly thought ‘oh my goodness, the sky’s really blue, the smog and smoke has gone, the air feels clean’ - and a lot of people really like that. And they liked the fact that they could cycle around their local streets, there was no traffic on the roads.”

A year into the pandemic, many people “will be quite desperate to get back to the office” he caveats, but there has undoubtedly been a widespread desire for improved air quality, less traffic, and greater connections with green space.

Pre-COVID, the idea of governments (especially in the UK) intervening in public health as dramatically as we’ve seen over the last year would have been unimaginable. But Walker feels this same kind of approach is needed when it comes to inactivity.

“We’ve had a period now where entire economies have been more or less closed down for a year to save a lot of lives. But arguably inactivity over two, three, or four years will kill more people than COVID has.

“There is this idea that perhaps the bar for what the public will accept in terms of health interventions has been raised.”

WHEN WILL THE ‘MIRACLE PILL’ POWER OF ACTIVITY BE REALISED?
Though the Netherlands is a pioneer when it comes to urban design that encourages movement, figures in the EU are still dismal. Two-thirds of the adult population don’t reach the minimum activity levels needed to be healthy.

However, Walker says, a revolution could be just around the corner. Though it’s clear we needed to start decades ago, “things could change very, very quickly.”

He uses an analogy from his first book, How Cycling Can Change the World, about how bikes were the dominant presence on the roads in 1890s Britain.

“There was this long debate about whether the motoring movement should be allowed to join,” explains Walker.

“It was seen as this kind of innovation, this novelty - these strange people who drove cars with a man in front waving a flag. But within 20 years the cyclists had virtually gone. The cars had taken over - and nobody expected it.

“So these revolutions come, and they’re not necessarily the one that you were waiting for. But, you know, things can change very, very quickly.”",False,mgm92h,ten-year-old,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mgm92h/inactivity_kills_millions_movement_the_miracle/,2,1

169,We just lost our best receptionist because she wouldn't be owned by us entirely.,"Rant.

It's hard to find a good receptionist at a veterinary office. They need to have some basic medical knowledge, be very organized, good under pressure, polite but persistent, need to be able to remember a lot of details (they go over our puppy plans and other things), and so on. They are also the face of the practice-- they're who people hear when they call, see when they come in (when it's not COVID), and talk to on their way out.

And we've struggled to find good ones. It seems like we can find nice receptionists who aren't organized, and we can find organized receptionists who aren't patient, we just struggle to find ideal ones. And you at least need that one good one whom everyone else can turn to when they need help. It's okay to have a couple ""just okay"" receptionists, as long as you have your rock there too.

We had our rock. She wasn't always nice-- sometimes she had a bit of an edge-- but she was good. 

And when things were slow, she'd lean on the counter or sit on it, and get on her phone.

Our manager never said anything because she was still doing more work than every other receptionist. I never said anything because there was never a time when I needed something done and she wasn't doing it. (I am the veterinarian, it's effectively a 1-doctor practice; the owner does surgeries, but only basic spay/neuter, and leaves at noon most days, he's semi-retired.) Our receptionist had a job, and she did it, and she did it better than anyone else, and then she took time to enjoy herself when there was time to spare.

But the cameras caught her sitting on the counter a few too many times, so the owners pressure HR to pressure the manager to say something. And it turned into a fight. She ended up walking out, and she ended up not coming back.

Look, I get that there are some issues there. For example, even though she gets stuff done and the others don't, her example could cause them to want to also be on her phone. But other than that, I think the rest of the arguments are bullshit. ""I'm paying her, so she should be working!"" Yeah, you paid her to be a receptionist, not to own her soul for 8 hours. If the place needs cleaned, you should hire someone to clean it. You know good and well that the 20 minutes here and there that the receptionist spends cleaning it doesn't constitute the undertaking of a necessary task, and it's obviously not a task that will be done to completion anyway. It's make-work, busy-work, and if it needed to be done someone needed to be scheduled and hired to do it. 

Obviously there are things that are part of her job that sometimes can be done. She should stock the shelves, call upcoming appointments, and so on-- things that are literally part of her job, that are written into her job description, that won't get done if the receptionists don't do them. But she was DOING those things, dammit. But now she's gone, on the principal that we own HER, as opposed to we hired her labor to complete specific jobs, and if she gets them done efficiently, she can take time to herself.

It bugs the crap out of me. It goes double because no one is going to say shit to me. I'm the vet, I'm sitting here on my laptop literally with my arms over a pile of records who are waiting for callbacks, but NO ONE is going to say anything to me, because I don't have a security camera pointed at my office, because I'm ""on salary,"" for whatever other reasons, somehow I'm special. I grant that I'm a little harder to replace, though certainly not irreplaceable, but there's more to it than that. I think there's an attitude that if you're a low-wage employee, you're owned by the business during work hours, while as a higher-earning professional, I'm allowed to conduct myself as I see fit, under the presumption that I'm just a different class of being who will self-police. Well, guess what, I'm probably the laziest, least efficient person in this office if I'm being honest. 

And now our office is just a little bit worse because one of the receptionists who often kept me in line (she was very perceptive and even though she couldn't see into the office, she always knew when I was fucking around vs when I was actually busy, and would very politely say ""don't forget Doc you've got x to do"" at just the right times where I'd feel guilty and hop right up to get it done.

Don't get me wrong, it's not like I have ""spare time"" at my job. I don't want anyone to think I'm just sitting at my desk all day. I'll pay for this post later; the practice will close at 5 and I'll get out at maybe 6 or 7 if I'm lucky, and this is an unusually slow afternoon where I don't have patients waiting. 

But as far as using my time effectively, or never getting on my phone-- fuck that, I'm terrible. But it's okay, because low-wage workers are worthless, existing only to perform the labor of the owners, and it's just an attitude that's baked into everything.

173,Work is Hell.,"I have watched my mother (born in ‘57) work her ASS OFF for my entire life. She’s not the “breadwinner”, my dad has a much higher paying job, but she definitely helps pay the bills. She only has a high school degree, so she takes a lot of seasonal and nanny-type jobs. One of her more long term jobs was being a Montessori teacher at a small school. Every single boss has been atrocious; verbally abusive, administratively disorganized, and they never pay my mom a fair wage.

Her current job is working at an ice cream store. The owner has no idea what she’s doing, refused to set up the store weeks ago and now is rushing everyone to get it done in a few days, with no plan. My mom gets asked to do stuff, and gets berated for not meeting some changing and/or unspoken preference of the boss’s. You know, that typical owner shit. My mom is close to retirement, so her tolerance for this kind of bullshit is pretty low.

Recently, I’ve seen my mom question her worth not only as an employee, but as a person. She’s said things along the lines of “I’ve had all these bad bosses, but what if I’m actually a terrible employee.” While she’s the most hardworking person I’ve ever met, she puts *everything* into her work, she’s so passionate about the most small details. I hate seeing her treated this way.

Fuck capitalism, fuck work, fuck bosses. For making people believe their innate self worth is based on their productivity for bosses that refuse to pay workers a fair share. Fuck society for making my mother doubt her self-worth. Fuck these bosses in particular for being the worst humans towards the best human I know.

176,Stomach pain from work related anxiety,"To be truthful I'm not completely sure if there is anything that can be said to help me. Long story short, first job out of college and I'm stressing the fuck out. I work IT and it feels like everything is a challenge, I've been here 4 and a half months and things haven't really gotten much easier. There are alright days, but that is typically when I'm busy with random simple tasks and no one bothers me about things I know nothing about.


Most days though, I'm just stressed. I get assigned tasks that I don't really know how to do. So I need to ask someone for help with any new task I'm given, more or less. This isn't a huge deal, but I feel like I should be retaining information better than I am. People show me things, I'll take notes, but it still feels like it's not enough. Like some how, these useless training videos and my coworker talking for 20 minutes is supposed to cement these things in my head. Everyone is so busy with their own shit, I feel guilty for calling them for help. Why can't my boss be the one to explain anything to me? At least then I'd know what he expects of me. He's so busy that he really only has a 30 minute window once every few weeks. Today I'm going to talk to him at the end of the day.

183,"""We could have discussed it...""","Started a new role in January after an all too short interview with the owner, where they touted the ""work/life balance"" of the firm. White collar job in accounting, salaried exempt, 100% remote, don't care about the hours, just get the work done. Knowing the industry, a little overtime was expected, so I figured there'd be some balance like shorter hours in non-crunch weeks. That should have been my first red flag. My second was the email from the owner to ""everybody"" the day after I started with ""this year's work plan"", which included 2,300 hours on the clock (holidays and vacations not figured into this calculation, mind you). That was shortly revised to 2,250 hours ""to encourage work/life balance"". I shrugged it off and clocked my 40 hours a week for 7 weeks, figuring the worst that would happen is that my promotion potential would be limited by the fact that I wasn't putting in 55 hours a week ""like everyone else"". I did good work, senior people in the firm liked me, everybody seemed to not care about the fact that I clocked out at 5:00 p.m. on Friday and was gone until 8:30 a.m. on Monday. There were rumblings during ""all hands"" meetings about ""Saturday lunches at the office starting soon"", which I ignored because I was 100% WFH. Y'all want to work Saturdays, go nuts. I'll deal with whatever you sent me on Monday when I'm on the clock.

March 7th, a Sunday, my personal phone rings at 4:15pm. It's a number I don't recognize, so I let it go to voicemail. It's the weekend, I don't know you, leave a voicemail. If it's important, I'll call you back. The next morning, I log into my work computer, email from the closest thing to a manager that I have, ""We need to discuss your work hours."" Cue a 25 minute phone call where they basically talked at me about how important it is that everyone does the hours they laid out in the work plan, they'll resend it to me just in case I didn't get it, and implying that my future with the firm was dependent on my ""getting with the program"". They touted themselves for working 60 hours a week last year while helping a family member with a health issue. They talked about how ""it used to be 80-90 hours, so be glad it's not like that anymore."" I nodded and smiled through the whole lecture. Started looking for a new job that afternoon (off the clock, mind you), started working a little overtime (remember, salaried exempt, so no compensation for this). Found out during that call that the firm had been hourly the year prior but had changed to a salaried exempt classification in the last 12 months. Gee, wonder why that is...

In the ensuing weeks, I got several emails addressed to ""everybody"" about how the work plan was ""required"" or ""expected"" and that we all needed to do our part to ensure the work was fairly distributed and that no one was shouldering all of the burden. Had a couple of conversations with the owner that all pretty clearly communicated that they expected everyone to ""put in the time"" to ""reap the rewards"".

Interviewed on the 15th with a company I worked for several years ago, breezed through the interview process, got the job offer yesterday, put in my two week's notice with the current firm. About an hour after I put my notice in, the owner calls me, ""Hey, is it too late to talk about this?""

It was too late when one of your managers called me at 4pm on a Sunday, come to find out the next morning they wanted to talk about my work hours. It was too late when I got an email that week with a copy of the ""work plan"" and the implicit suggestion that my failure to put the ""required"" hours in would be detrimental to my future. It was too late when you sent an email last week laying out how important it was that everyone put their time in. It was too late when you spent 30 minutes during this morning's all hands meeting talking about how the new people to the firm need to pull their weight.

""Well, we could have talked about it, everything's a discussion item, I have an open door policy."" Funny, I didn't get the feeling it was a discussion item. What was communicated in the last three weeks was that everyone who wasn't doing the 55 hours a week (could have been 60, don't you know, and just be glad it's not 80-90 hours like ""the good old days"") was not meeting the expectations of the firm. Doesn't feel like a discussion item.

Cue circular discussion about how the owner ""had to put in my time when I was young and now I'm reaping the rewards."" Cool story. Same logic as the ""we shouldn't forgive student loan debt because I had to pay mine off"" crowd. If your business depends on a workforce of salaried exempt people willing to work 55+ hours a week, you have a bad business plan.

Brought this up during the interview. New boss was very clear that they work 8-6, Monday through Friday, except for holidays. The folks on the team have an 8-hour shift, and we rotate schedules, so someone gets 8-4, someone gets 9-5, someone gets 10-6. If you're not scheduled, you're not working.

My co worker of 8 years got a tiny puppy, 2lbs. Because my bosses are cheap, all staff have to pay to have their dogs in daycare, they just get a whopping 10% employee discount. She was racking up debt on her store account because she was afraid that something would happen to her tiny puppy while she was away at work. There was a freak accident and the puppy died, there was nothing anyone could do. My co worker was devastated. I mentioned to my bosses about clearing her debt as a nice gesture to soften the blow of the tragedy. No. They were ‘services rendered’ so she still has to pay for her dead puppies daycares. I lost my shit and went off on them. They claim to be ‘work family’ but won’t just click delete and help our grieving co worker of 8 years out?!?

I'm seeing this shit way too much on here.... ""My but what about the stores that have mass required signs up? I
have to wear one in there!""

To. To you fucking don't. Talk the fuck in that store like you own the place and get whatever the fuck you need.
Throw those shoulders back and look right through people's souls. Luck ‘em! You are NOT to be tucked with. They ask
you to put on mask? Well them no. Of they demand a mask, tell them they can have your money or have your mask
but not both. Of they pick the mask, you walk the fuck out of there and drive down the street to their competitor.
""Well, we don't have that option where I am. Asks are required everywhere.""

Have you tried? Or are you just too big of a limp to go against the grain? Are you also not going to ""have that option""
for vaccines too? That about passports? You just going to go ""eh, watch donna do?"" when they clamp down on
every aspect of your life? You're implicit in this tyranny if you're just going along with it to avoid confrontation. Met
your shit together before you have no shit to get together!

""My, I just walked in a store without a mask today and nobody said anything! It felt so free!""

To shit! Welcome to our world since all this bullshit began! Did you know we landed on the moon too? THEY DON'T
SAY SHIT! And if one does stop spending money at that store that very second.

You MUST start now! Right fucking NOW! To more of this whitney ""poor me"" shit. On't EVER do things that you don't
like doing.

197,"(USA) Why the heck do unions require ""permission""?","Where I work in the public sector, the full-time folks get a union. While that union won some victories in the past and contributed to decent pay in the area, it nowadays mostly rolls over for belly rubs from the suits, it seems. The full-time employees are indoctrinated with how wonderful their jobs are, they've bought it all in.

Part timers pushed for a union though, but it had to be put up to a vote to be ""recognized"" by the employer. Also, you could only even vote if you worked above 19 hours a week, while a lot (if not a majority!) of their employees work 12 to 16 hours per week. 

(Those employees are also the high-turnover ones, treated like expendable cheap-labor second-class citizens. Go figure.)

They said a non-vote was considered a ""no"" vote. How *convenient for them!* 

Spoiler: Part-time folks lost and still don't have Teamsters.

This kinda blows my mind though. Why do unions need some kind of ""official recognition""? Especially when they're talked about around here, as if they can just be a bunch of workers who essentially group under a flag and say ""Either things improve or we walk and leave a huge hole in your bottom line. Arrr!"" (We're labor equity pirates and rogues now, I guess.)

The employer can say ""No you don't get a union""?! WAT?? Maybe I missed something here.

Bonus Question:

It occurred to me how awesome it would be to form some kind of localized retail employee union. I'd love to go to a mall and just start quietly campaigning and handing out material to all the sales-floor employees when their good-for-nothing management is in the back pleasuring themselves over spreadsheets.

Assuming we got a bunch of ""sign-ups"", in this fantasy organization that would support dissenters and force employers to either check themselves or go extinct, what's to stop it from being recognized as a proper ""union""? 

Forgive me, my American is showing, but it seems like unions are kinda like guns: They're a fundamental tool of the people and a threat to oppression when used correctly, but the ruling class  requiring them to be ""registered and licensed"" seems to defeat the purpose, does it not?",False,mfbgno,MutedPressure,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mfbgno/usa_why_the_heck_do_unions_require_permission/,4,2

202,People don't listen and It is one of the biggest issue at office jobs,"Hello all,

I have been working in IT as software engineer for an enterprise solution. I have been working for almost 4 years at the same company.

When you work ""technical"" you are never only doing technical work. You need to meet with customers to understand their requirements, provide on call support (aka hand holding), you need to remind people about processes, you have to document things, manage releases / projects. All of these are seen ""normal"" in IT as ""this is nature of the business"" (which means you do 2 - 3 people job but get compensated for only 1) On the other hand, what I do is generally laid back job which requires me to work for 4 hours max daily. (Pretty standard for office jobs as you know)

Anyways, the above points don't bother me so much anymore. What bothers me that, people don't listen when you provide them new information / training. I am okay to explain things couple times at the beginning but same people do keep coming up with same questions, mistakes (mistakes users do and you have to correct them as IT. Yes, at some point users have to take responsibility to work on the platform and there is no way to implement checkpoints everywhere) despite all of the correct ways have been shared with them by emails, training videos, ppt...

Examples? Here you go, everyone has to create ticket for a request. No matter what, you have to create that ticket. The same people keep writing you emails that, 

User : ""can we do...?"" 

My answer is always ""Please create ticket we can't take any actions without ticket per company policy""

User : ""Okay, thanks I will create ticket going forward""

Couple weeks later, guess who sends another email about new requirement without a ticket? 

We do provide trainings to educate people on the platform we (they supposed to use) use. There are couple rules to follow when they work on the tickets (Business people do also work on the tickets in our ecosystem. Yaayy team collaboration, digitalization... BS) during the training, we underline those points couple times, trainings get recorded and shared with them... On top of these, PPT is shared with them. Guess what? They do the wrong things and they escalate these things to C - Level as ""Software X is not working, the IT team is not helpful etc) When we kindly explain It is user handling issue (99% of times) there is even no apologies... Same applies for reporting. I mean, If you can't create reports in 2021, you should be out of the workforce. Period. Despite of numerous hand holding sessions with same users, they don't create reports because they don't listen to you

You could argue that, these things are included in my job. Sure, but It is problematic when same people do keep coming back with same things. The job should not be policing people. They should be able to pick things up after couple explanations. The job supposed to develop and improve the platform, get familiar with vendor releases (new features)

214,I failed,"Today I was working up to telling my boss that I want to quit. I've been working for this company for two months now. 6 days a week, 10-14 hours a day. Everyday feels like a week, but every week feels like a month.


Prior to this job, I was unemployed for all of 2020. I graduated from a university in Indiana at the end of 2019 and came back to my home country in January 2020. I majored in philosophy. Fuck me right.


Now I do anything from admin paperwork, to waiting tables, to operations for a shared cloud kitchen. To say that we are severely understaffed is an understatement. Including my bosses, we are a team of 6, with 3 extra part timers who come in on and off. The 4 of us out of the 6 are supposed to run 3 branches. My off days are mostly chosen by one of my seniors, with my boss often asking me to switch my days. I can't remember how many times I've gone over a week without a day off.


Today, I was going to tell my boss that I quit. Between the constant change in our SOPs, and having to eat shit from the customers (we also run a dine-in area, so 90% of what I've been doing these past three weeks has been waiting tables and coordinating the other people on the floor), I am so fucking done. I hate being yelled at for things I was told to do, and for things I don't know. Communication is barely existent.


If I leave, they're fucked. This is not me being cocky; this is fact. And if not for one of my colleagues, I would've quit a hundred times over this past month. This guy has the mental fortitude of a fucking god, and he knows how to maintain control over our vendors and floor while actually treating people like human beings. He's a smooth talker, but not a bullshitter. He is as genuine as it gets. And if I leave, I'd be spitting in his face.


But I don't even know if I can finish out my 6-month probation. The first week of work, I spun out and crashed into a barrier due to heavy rain. I also broke my phone which I need for work. I owe my mom 3 grand for repairs, a new phone, and gas money. I am 27 and I have nothing but regret. I have no more friends, no money, no dreams, no hope. Everyday I pray I don't wake up the next day.


Today, I remembered that I'm on the closing shift, so I'll be missing jiujitsu class. I was working up to telling my boss that I want to quit. But when she came to me on my smoke break to give me more responsibility, I couldn't do it. I failed.


I am aware that there are plenty of people who are having it way worse than me. And I feel guilt for feeling this way. I'm also pissed because it feels unfair that I'm not allowed to feel this way. People say things like ""This is what it's like in your 20s"" or ""Money isn't everything"". And yet, I can't even afford to buy shoes, let alone move out of my parents'. Shit car, shit job, shit life. I've lost count of the times I've cried at, before, or after work. Sometimes I wish oncoming traffic would just crash into me on the way home.

255,Why do so many on this sub blame capitalism?,"TLDR: I think the problem is with the Justice system rather than capitalism. 

I realise we are living in a capitalistic system, but just because a system is being misused doesn't mean that system is the problem? Isn't it the misuser that is the problem? 

For example, if a hospital loses a patient do we blame hospitals or diseases/injuries? Sure you get bad doctors and mismanagement, and those individuals should be held accountable, but does that mean we shouldn't have hospitals?

Similarly I see the necessity of work because people need goods and services to enjoy life, but it looks like the misuse is in greedy bosses who want employees to work full time and more for decent pay (as opposed to part time so they can enjoy life with the other part of their time) just to line their pockets. 

In other words, those in power don't have enough compassion. That doesn't mean power is the problem. It means we should enforce and reward compassionate behaviour. And the system in place to do that, the system that needs to be reformed, is the justice system, not the capitalist system.",False,met146,TVans14,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/met146/why_do_so_many_on_this_sub_blame_capitalism/,21,1

264,Why workers do not give 110%.,"At every job I've had (6+), I do the bare minimum.

Why? Because at every job I've had, I've gotten nothing when going above and beyond.

Do I expect anything? No, of course not. 

  
But who do I see get rewarded instead? Complete and total ass kissers. People who get all chummy and schmoozy with the management. People who don't really do much more than the bare minimum, sometimes even less, but who is the first person to get an ass chewing at the slightest mistake?

ME, that's who.

I've seen my wife, as well as myself through personal experience, get reprimanded for the slightest, most minuscule offenses, and see the ""favorites"", the ""teachers pets"", end up with not a word spoken to them for doing the same exact fucking thing not 10 minutes later.

I work at a cell center and have identified major functionality issues, things that need addressed quickly in order to better serve our clients. Issues that prevent us from doing our jobs correctly.

But no one listens to me, because I am a peon, a regular worker. Then weeks later, management finally catches wind of it, and suddenly it's a big fucking deal. But my opinions, my concerns, do not count. 

This is not just my experience, I've seen it happen to countless others. People enter a company with huge hopes and dreams, only to get them squashed. 

I've seen people who are the epitome of a successful, achieving, perfect employee get passed over for promotions and instead they get handed to someone who was nice to the boss, yet a complete and utter fuck up at their job. 

So giving 10%, going ""above and beyond"" and working your ass off is rarely rewarded, this is why good workers do not last. 

You cannot hand someone criticism constantly for times they do wrong, and not compliment or reward them for when they do more than expected. It's emotional blackmailing, it's abusive, and it's the fastest way to get rid of a good employee. 

People tend to get divorced for the same reasons, when a spouse constantly criticizes another and never compliments. 

So this is why workers do so little work, they ride the knife's edge of doing just enough to not get fired.

If you want more from employees, you need to recognize when they truly go above and beyond, because otherwise they won't do it again. It's that simple.",False,mfg9up,_Raspootin_,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mfg9up/why_workers_do_not_give_110/,28,1

Some jobs pay $8 - $10 dollars, but those jobs are usually body intensive or  upper management. I was lucky enough to be in a position where I earn 15 dollars an hour after only being in the company for 3 months. I have a job people wish they have. However, the job is killing me physically and mentally. I cant stand my management, the work, the customers, the people. I get anxiety just thinking about the place.

Fast forward to 2020 where I was put on a PIP (during a pandemic) for  new tasks that were given to me that I needed training on, not having a camera (even though I took what was given to me when we had to leave the office), and making my new boss uncomfortable because he could not see my face (I shit you not). Fast forward to now. I beat the PIP, I’m still here unfortunately, and I am still miserable.

I get an email on Sunday (yes these people work on Sunday) asking me to train a new person on my reporting because they would like to use it at another site. I already spent 1 plus months training my new team member, and now they want me to train again. I am not a manager, I am not a trainer.

I have 10k saved for expenses
Car paid off so no car note
1k in my trading account that I can’t seem to grow because I am always working.

And these people always claim that doing so many stuff at the same time is crucial for a huge and delightful CV, to grow as a person, and to learn how to be a better manager of one's own time (Time management skills).
I can't help but notice how this indirect points towards the overrating of stress: if a student has a full on college degree to complete, while having a dozen other extra curriculars full of projects to complete all at the same time, of course they're going to end up stressing out, or even burningout. I've had colleagues becoming depressed just because they felt too much pressure of being involved in so much academic stuff all while having to study for tests and assignments. Yet, the majority of people at college portrays this as a good and healthy thing.

I just don't get it, how can a practice that easily leads to burnout be even considered healthy? Why is there so much emphasis on having to experience and live full on stress? Why is it so weird to only want to go to university and complete a degree without having to be stressed with side compromises, and wanting to simply live a relaxed life? Why can't people just take things gradually and at their own pace? 

I fail to understand why being stressed is portrayed as a positive and necessary experience to go through in order to be an adult, when it can quite literally make you unhealthy, both physically and mentally. 

And I'm posting this here because I guess this pressure of HAVING to be stressed and HAVING to have multiple stuff to do at the same time carries on from college to the workplace, seeing how in college they relate these activities so much to building a ""decent"" CV.

PS: I already completed a bachelor's degree, and I'am on my way to finish my master's, and never once got into these extra curricular compromises. Just went to watch some lectures and workshops from time to time, when I deemed them as interesting. Nothing more. I'd rather prioritize my wellbeing than doing something just because everyone at college age is doing it.",False,mereer,Fifs99,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mereer/why_so_much_emphasis_on_stress/,6,1

279,Working nowadays seems pointless,"Nowadays the majority of the companies in the private sector only do pointless products or services; and that at best. At worst they directly harm others.

Why the f**k would I want to work at a software company, making software for another large corporation to help it get that extra tiny bit milion dolar profit (I literally had a gig helping to develop a system that would spy on the employees of a supermarket chain so they won't steal from the shop, no not the clients, the minimum wage employees).

Why the heck would I want to work at a lawfirm or in accounting and help large corporations evade taxes. And who would want to work as a cook for mcdonalds.

How can I have any fricking motivation to get a job when the end result will be pointless and purposeles.

I don’t even have words for that level of just wrong. How is that not toxic? Bullying your employees because they asked for a day off. I haven’t taken a single day off this fucking year and it’s almost April. Get the fuck out of here with that. I ended up standing up to him and telling him you’re either not going to have me Friday or never having me again essentially. He was a bitch about it and moaned and whined, but I won the argument and he took me off the schedule and gave me my day off.

This is my first job out of college and at first, I thought it seemed normal enough. I haven't had a lot of hands on experience in the real world so makes sense that I'd be uncomfortable with the majority of my work.

I get assigned tickets and a lot of the time I have no idea what they are even talking about so I need to get ahold of someone to explain and help me through it. This is alright, but it fills me with anxiety to constantly need help. There was training the first few weeks, but I feel like not a lot was retained and of the things I retained, a lot of is not useful. They are just these prepackaged videos with no specifics to the company.


The other job I do is very repetitive, same steps everyday and I honestly enjoy that way more. Just no room to fuck up really.   On the plus side, I work from home and no one (yet) has made comment on the amount of work getting done. Although I feel like at some point, they have to. Not really sure what to do, don't want to quit because finding another job feels like it will be impossible, but also am I really supposed to reach out individuals every day to get help to do my job?

284,i didn’t understand how working harder without getting payed more worked until now,"I work retail. Store Manager (SM) quit and left the co-manager (CM) and me high and dry as after she left there were only three people who could open and close. This led to me essentially taking over the CM’s position and her acting as SM without a raise or change in pay. I was okay with this because CM and i get along great and i had fun working with her. Well the company hired an outsider as the SM’s replacement and immediately furloughed CM the same day. Now i (a part-time employee, full time student) am essentially a co manager with the same pay as other key holders who don’t do half of what I do. To “thank” me my new SM gave me a fucking $10 gift card to starbucks. I’ve been tearing my hair out trying to fix her mistakes and to help train the new key holders she promoted while also being the person that both she and every other employee goes to for help and i don’t even make $10 an hour. I am so emotionally and physically exhausted trying to keep our store from failing and all i get is $9.88 an hour (pre tax) and a motherfucking $10 gift card.

This is to say that it happened slowly. I didn’t realize that i had been taking on more work. I was having fun, taking care of a store with a friend and then all of a sudden I am the person that everyone goes to. Need receipt tape? in the office. Need to put together the vacuum? diorstars can do it.

Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands... The result of
these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of
which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized
political society.

His is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by
political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private
capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from
the legislature.

The consequence is that the
representatives of the people do not
in fact sufficiently protect the
interests of the underprivileged
sections of the population.
Moreover, under existing
conditions, private capitalists
inevitably control, directly or
indirectly, the main sources of
information (press, radio,
education).
It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed
in most cases quite impossible, for the
individual citizen to come to objective
conclusions and to make intelligent use
of his political rights.

292,I’d enjoy my job more if I was being fairly compensated.,"I make COVID test kits. Started out folding boxes and now I’m an operator of the machines. It’s fun, if really tiring. I feel good knowing I’m helping saving lives. But I’m paid barely above minimum wage. I work extra hours to finish orders. I’m always walking, always talking, always filling out paperwork, always trying to find ways to make the work of the other employees easier because while I’m the lead they all are paid the same as me and I know they’re overworked too. They’re harshly criticized for the most minor mistakes and its so unfair and I get shit when I defend them. At this point I let them take hour long lunches, 30 minute breaks, use phones when there’s nothing to do, talk to each other. Who cares!! They’re getting their work done on record pace, the company is raking in millions because of them.

I feel like I have to step on them to move up but I don’t WANT to. It’s not fair. They’re made fun of for their bad english, but it’s not their fault. It’s a mostly southeast asian workplace with white management. My coworkers bring food for me and tell me I deserve more but I can’t—I know the company relies on paying me so little in comparison to how much I do for them. 

I’ve held millions of dollars in my hands before, in the form of the covid test control fluid, and all of us barely get any of that profit. I want to save lives. I want to help people. I’ve worked so hard here and still cannot rent an apartment. I’ve been told my management that I’m incredible and a key part in the success of the whole operation but I don’t even have healthcare! 

But if I didn’t depend on this to survive...I’d like doing it. I like the hecticness. I even like working on the line sometimes. I’d do it if it didn’t make me so miserable.

302,"Conflicted, tired and sore. More importantly..BORED.","Hello all! This is my first post here at r/antiwork, so what better way to introduce myself, then with a work rant.

I’m a shift supervisor at a large coffee company. Our store is small, but very high volume. (This has increased exponentially in the last year, despite COVID). As of late, I have felt mentally drained, my body hurts, I feel disconnected from my co-workers and don’t feel as if I am doing what a supervisor is supposed to do. I am a great reader or body language and the energies people give off, which does me more harm than good most of the time because I tend put myself in a mental fetal position where have small fears of coaching that person in the moment and often forget. I feel that the work I do goes unappreciated, but the work I miss or overlook is put on a pedestal. 

The one thing I always said when I took this promotion, is that I would not ever change who I am as a person. In the process I feel I have changed, not for better or for worse. I’m conflicted and part of me wants to step down, part of me wants to find another job but another part of me wants to suck it up and accept whatever challenge comes in front of me. 

To sum it up, I just want to do better. Maybe instead of looking at my job as just a paycheck I would invest more of my personal time in it. The truth is, I like to clock in, work, then clock out and go home and I’d assume that’s true for most. This company wants someone that goes above and beyond, perhaps. If I’m not that person, what do I do? Where do I go? I have other dreams and aspirations but I’m not in a financial position where I can throw all my eggs in one basket. 

I don’t expect anyone to show me empathy on the internet. I more or less am looking for constructive criticism outside of people close to me.

305,My (limited) experience with work.,"I've been working for.. admittedly not a very long time. I'm 24 currently, and had my first job at around 16. I've only had a few jobs in between. Most of my work has been physical labor. I started as a construction aide, moved to a cashier / salesperson at a few jobs, and have been a mechanic for the last 5 years or so. Almost everyone I have worked with in the industry, is depressed to all shit. They tell me to leave the industry as fast as I can, that if they could start over, they would never do mechanic work. They wouldn't tell their kids to do it. One of my co-workers would do hard drugs at work like meth and cocaine to make it bearable. My next co-worker was a raging alcoholic. To such a point where he missed work because he was drunk all the time. My next co-worker (who is also currently my friend / manager) Is 32. He's balding, smokes several cigarettes a day. Usually within minutes of each other, and drinks frequently. He has a lot of money. But he practically lives in the shop. I've known him to sleep in the couch in the employee room. What kind of fucking life is that? He has an old, yellowed refrigerator with a bottle of rum and ginger ale. He orders all his food online or picks it up from the closest fast food chain. He sleeps on the couch / floor in a sleeping bag at work. The most fun I've seen him have is when he'll bring his xbox or playstation to the shop and hook it up to a decade old flat screen so he can play some call of duty on an office chair in the employee room for a few hours. What the fuck kind of life is that? He works 8am - 6pmish every fucking day. I think even Sundays sometimes. He spends more time at the shop than he does at home. He cheated on his wife so often that they divorced. I mean honestly, why would I want to subject myself to this shit?

And my dad too. He's so full of love for work that his love is directly conditional on if I go to work or not. I can't even talk to him without him asking me if I'm going to work soon or what my next job is going to be. Literally. I can walk into the room and be like ""Man my head really hurts today"" and he'd be like ""You know why? It's cause you don't work. Brain is shutting down because of the lack of work stimuli""

I don't want to slave away for decades and decades so I can afford to buy things that I'll never fucking use because I'm too busy working.",False,mfin60,JhoshElite,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mfin60/my_limited_experience_with_work/,1,1

316,How to stop work issued laptop going idle?,"Hi folks,

So up until recently myself and a few colleagues have been using long YouTube videos to stop our work-issued laptops from locking themselves and showing us as Away on Skype. We also used the other popular loophole where we could open Notepad and weigh down the space bar key to keep the laptop active. The end result was we'd have all our work finished by 12 and then be able to have the rest of the day to ourselves. Everyone's happy right? 

Well clearly someone twigged what was happening, and a recent software update across all laptops has made it so that neither of those methods work any more. The video and notepad tricks have stopped working. The laptop will lock and show us as Away if we're inactive for 10 minutes. Screensaver settings are greyed out, so we can't change that at all. I've tried a .vbs script as well, but that's also restricted on these laptops. I'm getting pretty annoyed. 

Does anyone know a way we can stop the laptop from locking automatically? Bear in mind I don't want to install any software or extensions on a corporate laptop. I'm not even sure I'd be able to if I can't even run a custom script. I've seen you can buy a USB attachment from amazon that automatically moves the cursor every few seconds but I don't know if that'd even work at this point.

Time clock fraud occurs whenever an employee does something while
punched in that is unrelated to work (while not on a 15 minute break).

Were are some easy-to-do tips to avoid committing time clock fraud:

e Use the restroom before you start work and before coming back from meals.

e Take sure to take off your coat/jacket, or other outer pieces before munching in.

e Take sure to secure personal items in a locked before munching in.

e Arrive early to ensure you have the time to complete any shopping or other tasks before
your schedule start time.

e Once punched in, you are on the clock and should immediately grab your equipment
and head to the sales floor.

Of 10 employees commit 10 minutes of time clock fraud a day, that’s 100

minutes a day. That’s 3,000 minutes a month which equals 50 hours of
Payroll lost.

 

Please remember that time clock fraud can lead to disciplinary action and

322,"The US is a totalitarian dictatorship, it's just the oppression is outsourced to employers","I was listening to a podcast about the former DDR (East Germany). In their jobs, East German workers really had power and *freedom*. You could vote to fire your boss. If you boss is corrupt, you could let the authorities know and they'd investigate (and if they were found to be corrupt, they were gone). You had a very significant say in how things were run. There was real democracy in the workplace. And everyone had a right to a job, this was enshrined in their constitution; so you didn't have to live the constant precariousness of losing your job. All pretty typical more or less of most socialist countries.

Now in the US, your boss has total control over your life. The type of control that you employer has, it's on the level of the worst dictatorships. You can't say shit to your boss. Every single interaction has the potential to ruin your life. You have no say in how things are run. You have to do everything you boss says. You say the wrong thing or do the wrong thing, you lose your job. And in the US, since we have so little social protections, losing your job can lead to a whole lot of bad things, up to losing your life. And this is true of employers collectively. You get fired or have bosses that won't give you good references, finding a new job is so much more difficult. So if you don't play the game by their rules, no only can you lose your job but the system makes it all that much harder to recover and get another one.

I reject the idea that you have to decide between the two, but if I had to decide between having democracy in my workplace or democracy in my political system, I'll go with workplace democracy (not like the US has political democracy, anyway).",False,mf47h7,oak_and_clover,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mf47h7/the_us_is_a_totalitarian_dictatorship_its_just/,13,1

Even if I went full time at my current job, I'd make less than I do reselling on eBay. But I can't go full time with eBay because the income has too many gaps, some parts of the year are slower. You also have to pay more taxes and contribute fully to a 401k, whereas my job pays like 40 cents of every dollar I put in.

It is soul crushing how hard people like me have to work yet people like Bezos, Musk, Gates, etc could literally just fuck off to another country and never have to work again and be set for their life and their children, grand children and even great grandchildren would be too.

345,Superstore (show on Netflix),"The show Superstore makes me think of this sub sometimes. 
It’s a show that really discusses/demonstrates how the rich and powerful profit off the general labourers.
Jonah (one of the main characters) fights for workers rights, higher pay, Medicare and a variety of other necessities. 
He constantly brings up how a lot of corporations dismiss employees who ask for wages, and instead of fixing the problem by getting at the root of the cause, they just say empty things like “we value our employees.” 
There’s one episode where Jonah notices that corporate set up a free breakfast booth in the store for the employees. Then Jonah proceeds to bring up the issue of how instead of corporate giving employees a “free breakfast” they could just pay their employees a living wage. 
My point is, It’s nice to see a critically thinking character when it comes to the issues of capitalism, he’s so “woke” and skeptical of everything. 
Its also very pleasing to watch a show that goes in depth into the issues associated with unregulated capitalism.

367,Questions About Anti Work Itself,"So I might be stupid, but I’m kinda EXTREMELY confused about the anti work idea as a whole. For starters, how can a work free world actually be achieved? Because you literally can’t have any modern society without someone or something working. You just can’t. Someone has to make the food. Someone has to clean the houses. Someone has to fly the planes. You have to have a group of people working to keep society afloat, and right now, that’s basically everyone. The work gets spread fairly evenly among the common populous so everyone contributes to society but also can do their own things. But if there’s just this huge fraction of the population (if not everyone) who doesn’t have to do any work, then who does? Robots? Nope, almost all normal jobs require a modest amount of intelligent thinking, so to create a huge workforce of intelligent robots to do all of our work would immediately result in terminator, and I’m serious. Maybe a fraction of the human population could do work, so that way the other could live without work? Gonna have to pass on that cause that sounds waaaaaay to much like having a giant army of slaves, and that is you know, morally and objectively evil and classist. But beyond the logistics of having a work free world, just the idea is practically unthinkable. Work gives people extremely valuable experiences and lifelong virtues that can make them ten times the person they were before. And yeah I’ll give you the fact that not all good traits in a person come from working, but when it comes to actually doing something with your life and making a living, those traits achieved from working are more valuable than gold. So yeah, maybe sitting on your ass all your life might seem pretty nice, but when you take two seconds to look at it, a work free world is not only logistically impossible, but also morally evil and corrupt.",False,meqsde,throwaway70871,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/meqsde/questions_about_anti_work_itself/,15,1

385,"I am, daily, on the verge of a mental breakdown","I hate my job. I hate the soul-sucking work we do for pennies. I hate the abusive, condescending bullshit we have to take from clients (all without breaking a smile). I hate that after a year and a half I still don't understand the intricacies of this job. I hate that I have never received 1 day of actual training. I hate that my superiors are shockingly incompetent. I hate being told I should be more grateful for allowing them to treat me like cow shit. 

I am a tech support guy for a small software firm. We work in the southern US. The owner of the company lives in New England. He is a bougie twat who fields work from our state because we're an 'At-Will' employment state, which supports almost no rights for worker's. It makes him more money that way. 

The 'CEO' of this company does almost nothing all day long except take fielded calls complaining about  the program, and taking pointless Zoom meetings with my other supervisors for sometimes *hours* at a time. I cannot fathom what the fuck they're doing every day, but I've seen enough of their 'meetings' to know it doesn't result in much. 

My direct supervisor is the only person I respect in this shithole, and yet he's such a boot-sucking kiss ass that I'm slowly losing that respect every day. 

Everyone in this shit shack is seemingly unbothered by the emotionally taxing work we do, to the point where I look like a lunatic when I bring up fairer hours and PTO schedules to them. Every time I bring it up to the person I'm closest with here, he comes back with ""Well man, it could always be worse"", which is a bullshit answer to something you *know* is unfair. 

We aren't allowed (or rather I should say we're *discouraged from*) lunches in lieu of working 9 hours straight with 2 10 min breaks every day. Whenever we *do* want to take a lunch, we need to tell them when, why, and for how long we'll be gone, with us getting phone calls asking where we are after 30 minutes. Originally, I was promised 1-hour lunches upon hiring. That changed via peer-pressure almost immediately. 

When we call out, we have *double* PTO taken from us. Basically, we call out for 9 hours (since we don't get lunches), which results in us losing 18 hours of PTO. This does not mean we're *paid* for 18 hours - we're only paid for 8, with the extra OT hour taken off. The remaining 9 hours are thrown away. It is a scheme allowing my boss to save money by not having to pay us for sick time under the guise of 'wanting \[us\] to get paid'. They have the balls to tell me, to my face, that they're doing me a *service* by paying me those 8 hours when I miss time (which, again, is taken unwillingly out of my PTO bank), and constantly tell me ""It could be worse - we could just not pay you at all"". When we're out of PTO, we are refused days off and any time missed counts as a no-call. 

There is zero worker solidarity in this hell hole, mainly because most of the people here have worked here since at least the early 2000s and have been slave-whipped into thinking this is how normal careers are across the world. 

Everyone here makes sub-$16/hour, with most people sitting at the low-end of that spectrum at around $13-$14/hour. The owner is a multi-millionaire. The CEO makes $150k+ a year.

Sometimes continuous, sometimes I get days off in between. 
This current 2 week pay period. I had 2 4-day stretches with a day off in between.
In both of them I was scheduled 12p-8p, 9a-5p, 6a-2p.

Why am I scheduled like this?
And how am I supposed to get anything done when I have less and less time for myself between sleep and my next shift.

I work a demanding service job and I am exhausted after each shift. I woke up past 10pm tonight just because I collapsed into bed immediately after work. I didn't plan to but my body needed the rest.
I have to be back at 6am tomorrow. And it's midnight now.

They schedule the part timers like this but I work 5 days a week and still get the same kind of inconsistent scheduling they do. 

How long can the body keep up with an ever changing circadian rhythm like this.
It can't be healthy.

I have no sense of a weekly routine because I can be scheduled to work literally any day. Weekends have no meaning for me anymore. I'm simply off when I'm off.

Are conservatives just genuinely brain dead or do they like being double standard dumbasses.

I've never had a job that paid a living wage, ever. I've got hundreds of thousands of dollars in student debt. I'm too privileged to feel sorry for myself, but I do anyway.

Hello all, my company wants everyone to have their camera turned on during our meetings. Ignore incorrect grammar please, not a native speaker. We all worked at the office but due to COVID19 we started working remotely since last April. Now management sent an email asking all of us to have our cameras turned on for our meetings.

I see why they want our webcams on to make sure we are paying attention to the meeting but on every meeting, they require us to email leadership with what we learned like as if we’re in high school. This is why I don’t get the webcam thing if we are already doing the email to let them know our take aways, and frankly I don’t get paid enough for this.

454,How to make employees quit their job without having to fire them,"Let’s face it. No CEO or Manager likes to fire people. At the least it’s uncomfortable and in other circumstances, it can be downright emotional! Employees have their bills to pay and often families to support and rarely take kindly to losing their livelihood. Managers frequently face a whole host of undesirable issues when firing employees. From dramatic scenes in the office to even being sued for dismissals, these complications take up valuable time and resources — which you could be spending elsewhere in your business!

But don’t give up, there is a solution! I’m about to share with you the way one innovative company has figured out how to get employees to resign on their own so they can avoid the stress of ‘letting them go.’ Simply repeat the steps from the method I will describe to you and see your business flourish as you get rid of employees hassle-free!

Let’s dive right in…

In 2007 I started working for a big Australian Engineering company in Perth, Australia. This company had about 8000 employees spread across over 50 offices around the globe. The headquarters were located in CBD on Adelaide Terrace and my department was on the 8th floor. Now this company had a great slogan — “People, Clients, Management.” In an internal PR move I’m sure will be familiar to many of you, this company had an induction program where employees were told they were the biggest assets of the company and every success the company enjoyed was built on a foundation of mutual respect.

After about 8 months with the company, I received my first Performance Report and it was excellent. Then one day the Section Manager was promoted to Department Manager and was replaced by a relative of the Branch Manager. It became clear pretty quickly that the new manager did not like me — to put it mildly. Over the next few months, he would make derogatory remarks about me and especially my appearance.

This got progressively more intense until one day, on the way to a client, he threatened to kill me. I decided to go to HR.

Now I know what you’re thinking! This is the part where things get tedious — with endless rounds of Politically Correct HR people having meetings and trying to iron out difficulties. Things that are a pain for many companies not interested in ‘problem’ employees.

But stick with me, you’re going to like where this goes, I promise…

The HR manager, a guy by the name of Todd, reacted with surprise to my complaint, informing me that everyone had a high opinion of this man and I was the first one to complain. I knew this was not true and other colleagues had also complained before me.

But I kept quiet and Todd promised to investigate.

After a week I had heard nothing from him. Then the new manager who I’d complained about saw me in the corridor and told me: “I heard you went to HR. I fucking hate snitches.” I went straight to Todd again. He said, “There’s not much I can do, he’s a close relative of the Branch Manager.”

So I talked to the Branch Manager and he said I should quit if I didn’t like it there. I reminded him of the slogan of the company: “Client, People, Management.” But I got nowhere. I decided to file an official complaint and Todd said he would do that with me next day. In the morning Todd told me that if I still wanted to file an official complaint, some things were going to change in my work routine. I said I didn’t understand what he meant, to which he replied I would find out the next day. I filed the complaint.

Now, thank you for sticking with me and continuing to read. Here’s the part you’ve been waiting for!

Introducing… “The Glass Room Quitting Method” TM

The next morning Todd came to my desk and said Management wanted to relocate me to another desk. The 8th floor where we worked from was an open space area with 1.5 m high cubicles. It had three meeting rooms, two large and one small, full glazed one in the middle of the office floor. The small meeting room was about 3m x 3m. In it was a table, four chairs, and a phone.

Todd asked me to follow him. When I started packing my workstation, pens and other stuff he said: “leave everything here. Just come with me.”

We went to the small meeting room. He took three chairs out and left the last one then asked me to sit down. Then he said “from now on you will work from here. You will wait until your manager comes and tells you what to do.” He left the room, taking the phone as he went.

So, there I was — sitting in a completely empty, fully glazed room, at an empty table. Of course, the manager never came to tell me what I was supposed to do. I just sat there, hour after hour, with nothing to do but be bored and humiliated.

Todd would come in every morning and ask me if I wanted to resign. When I said no, he simply said I would have to continue to sit there and wait till the manager came and told me what to do.

This went on for a week and I slowly started feeling like I was going crazy. I sat every day in the fully transparent glass room like a monkey in the zoo having nothing to do. You might wonder if my colleagues said anything about it. Later, I was told that they had received an email saying I was going to work from the meeting room on a project for a new client. They, of course, knew that wasn’t exactly right and something was wrong, but fear or embarrassment and not wanting to rock the boat meant they simply kept their heads down and busied about doing their tasks, trying not to look at me.

The week after I decided to go to a lawyer.

You might be worried now that this ingenious solution would reach a sticking point here and the company would be forced to stop treating me this way. But think again!

I was told that from a legal point of view the company was not doing anything wrong. If they simply fired me, I would have a case. But as long as they didn’t, I had no chance. So I resigned.

Some weeks later I met an older ex-colleague of mine by chance in a cafe. He had worked for the company for over ten years. He told me the “glass room” method was common there. He remembered that the longest someone managed to sit there and do nothing was three weeks…till he willingly resigned.

So there you have it! The “Glass Room” Method for getting your employees to quit so you don’t have to go to the trouble of firing them!",False,m65auu,TheArchitectCode,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/m65auu/how_to_make_employees_quit_their_job_without/,24,1
455,Kicking the caffeine habit to get back at work,"Anyone else going through this?

I realized that as much as I like the feeling of coffee as a recreational drug (energy fiend), what the daily coffee addiction basically amounts to is a push for me to take a stimulant in order to be more productive (provide additional surplus labor) for my job.  It's very obvious that this is why a lot of companies provide this stimulant for free.

However, there seems to also be a worrying amount of corporate meddling in scientific/health research in the english speaking world, not only because big coffee is a huge lobby in its own right, but because it is the cornerstone of industrialized grind culture.  While it definitely doesn't seem to be as damaging as smoking, there are similarities in the commercialization of the scientific research, lots of nonsense around a narrative of ""it has negative effects but is fine in small doses, also it nurses a habitual dependency but if you fall for that you're just a moron"".

Simply put, caffeine probably won't give you fairy cancer or lupus or some other secret scary disease we're all secretly getting.  All we need to do is observe what it does to us when we take it, it can make us hyperactive, it raises stress, and stress over long periods of time is extremely dangerous, leading to hypertension/high blood pressure and eventually heart disease.  ""Not being sleepy at work"" ain't worth my heart.

Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be taking a nap in the bathroom.",False,m5rma8,capnbarky,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/m5rma8/kicking_the_caffeine_habit_to_get_back_at_work/,14,1

459,Math ability has excessive control over determining People's fate,"I see a lot of People who seem to have a desire to change Math, as in to make it more vague and less definitive so as to give a leg up to People with less ability in that realm. I personally am not sure about the long term viability of this idea, but what I am confident in is my belief that we need new *avenues* for People. It seems to me that if somebody is really bad at Math, then this might have a large effect in terms of determining their eventual economic status, the perception of their overall intelligence as opposed to simply Mathematics intelligence, a certain *kind* of brain power, etc. 

What I'm not asking is that we corrupt Math, do away with it, or relegate it in a way that excessively messes with it as an avenue for the People who do have ability, for example People like Terence Tao who are brilliant and deserve their careers in Math, not to mention People who might not be at his level but certainly deserve their career or their respect. But I definitely think we need to expand into a system where sucking at Math, or a particular topic in general, doesn't necessarily mean somebody is lower status, set to be lower income, or considered foolish. 

Obviously this is very much an idealist's concept, but I really think it's a fair one. There are infinite forms of intelligence and Humanity simply needs to keep developing and using their creativity to find new ways to ascertain the value that lies within People, uncover avenues where People who previously weren't going to be discovered or able to excel, will be.

461,Working man blues,"So to start off I have what they call a “decent job” for my area. Bout 45k a year in northern midwest is considered a decent living. I work 10 hour shifts of average and put in about 45 hours in slow season and 55 hours in busy season (April-November). I work parts which is basically a glorified customer service job, yes it requires a degree and mechanical background. I have health insurance as well, it’s an ok plan but nothing to write about. 

So in reality what’s it all worth? I work most of my time away, days off are spent catching up and to sore to really do anything fun. Cheapest rent in the area was $915 a month before expenses, and still a 30 min commute each way. I had an eye infection that I’ve been fighting for 4 months, even with insurance the appointments and meds have cost me over 2500$ out of pocket- I’ll be paying that back over the next year. Cost of living has gone up, used to be 150$ a month for groceries was common (I eat healthy as I have stomach issues) now it’s 250$ for the same shopping list. My car is old af with 180k on the clock, Falling apart, can’t afford a reasonable car, most used cars with 100k on them are 15k at the best. So that means between payment and insurance another 350$ per month I don’t really have. I can put some money away- I feel I’m fortunate to be able to do that, but that’s because I don’t spend anything I don’t have to. I don’t even have internet at home LOL. 

So in reality what’s it really worth? Working man works his ass off to do nothing more then just hand it all out at the end of the month.

466,"Quit my Big Tech job 6 weeks ago, best decision I've made in a really long time.","I love this sub. It has carried me through the last few months at work while I was waiting for our yearly bonus before quitting. I wanted to maximize the amount of $$ I could pocket from this job before quitting, but the last few months it was really hard to pretend I cared. 

From my experience, Big Tech jobs are golden handcuffs in that they throw tons of money at you in exchange for getting you to spend your own limited amount of time on this planet working on completely useless (at best) products, surrounded by tech bros, while execs play political games and throw money at the wall to see what sticks. It pays well, and has enabled me to get to the point where I'm comfortable quitting financially, but it's soul-sucking. When I realized I was crying every Monday at the prospect of another week of pointless video calls, about a product that shouldn't be made, in corporate bullshit language full of acronyms and words like ""net-net"", ""paradigm shift"" and ""pow-wow"" (for some reason the ""progressive"" tech industry still thinks it's ok to use this word), I knew it was time to go. 

I am extremely lucky in that my partner happens to be a freelance artist whose business has been steadily growing for the past few years. It recently reached the point where he started needing extra help, and so we worked out how he could start employing me to help him. I very excited, as I have been following his business journey from day 1 with all its interesting challenges that I helped him problem solve. I love what he does, I want to see him make more art, and so I'm very excited to free up time for him by taking on more of the administrative tasks of running a business so he has more creative time. I am of course taking a big pay cut compared to what Big Tech offers, but I really couldn't care less. He pays me a reasonable living wage and the amount of joy I am now able to derive from choosing what I do with my time every single day is priceless. I feel like my skills are perfectly complementary to his, and I am now able to use them on a project I am passionate about. My last day was February 1st and I will never look back. 

It feels so natural to wake up and do what I want without worrying about what time it is, what people that have ""power"" on me might want from me, what appearances I need to maintain to fit in. I am still in awe at how long I convinced myself to stay at this job/industry for the past several years, bonding with colleagues over crying in empty meeting rooms or drinking ourselves blind enough to talk about and process the soft misogyny we were all experiencing. I feel a million times more productive even though I ""work"" less than 15 hours a week. The rest of the time, I cook, I have started spending time doing art myself, I look forward to volunteering to get involved in my community, I learn new skills, I prepare my garden for Spring, I work on the house, etc. I can go to shops in the middle of the day and stop by to chat with a friend, then work on our business until 10pm if that's when I'm feeling productive. It's truly wonderful and I wanted to share the joy with this community, as it has really made me feel less alone in my hatred of corporate culture and bullshit jobs.",False,m6om4g,Impressive-Olive17,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/m6om4g/quit_my_big_tech_job_6_weeks_ago_best_decision/,10,1

Lightning started about an hour ago. They closed the garden center to customers, but told us we could still work. We push large metal racks around an open area for most of our work. I asked repeatedly to go in, but was told we have so much to do we needed to stay out. 

Eventually lightning actually struck one of the lights behind our store. They still asked if we could work, and my coworker still is out moving racks and setting plants on tables. I just looked at my boss and said ""OK, I'll keep working in this, but if and when I get struck by lightning, I'll own the company."" I went in.

496,Arguments FOR forcing people to work,"Currently, most people (though of course not all) have to work if they want to survive in society. While I'm sure there are arguments against this, here are some arguments in favour of the current system : 

&amp;#x200B;

**- Living with work is better than starving to death**

In circumstances of extreme poverty, living with work may be the least bad available option.

**- Abolishing forced work would threaten the structure of society**

This is one of the most common arguments imaginable; how could society function if people weren't forced to work to survive? Do we really think people would just do work of their own free will to afford luxuries such as high quality clothing, gaming consoles, expensive cars etc.? In fact, can you even think of a SINGLE job in society done by someone who ISN'T afraid of starving to death, and instead are motivated by the desire to live in extreme luxury?

**- Forced work is essential to certain industries**

A continuation of the above point, how are many industries expected to work if they don't have people afraid of starving to death?

**- Forced Work would be too difficult to abolish**

\-Oh, it's fine to talk about this in theory, but could we ACTUALLY abolish forced work? Not in today's society!

**-Forced work is good for workers**

Work teaches people things that they wouldn't be able to learn otherwise, such as the importance of perseverence, and of patience.

**- It's natural that some people are forced workers**

Work was put here by the Judeo-Christian God; He designed humans to want to love work. Therefore, we should never try interfere with God's plan.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh wait, hold on everyone, I appear to have gotten my notes mixed up. These weren't the ""pro-forced work"" arguments; these were just the ""Pro-Slavery arguments"" from the BBC's ethics website! Wow, how could I have made such an obvious error? It's not like both systems rely on extremely similar forms of logic or anything...

On a micro level the work that employees do advances no one but the elite share holder lords.

I've been thinking a lot about the past year and a sinking feeling in my gut that was revealed as the bread and circuses dried up.  Almost a year of isolation and the old world just feels unreal, if I had told my younger self that this was 2020 I would not have been able to convince myself.

Before 2020 we may have been able to distract ourselves from what is the true reality, the reality of diseases and systemic control (racism, misogyny, classism, etc), and scientific warnings of collapse.  We were able to wrap ourselves in a warm blanket of ""stable employment"" and retirement plans, and health insurance, and a media landscape where we saw good people reflecting our values coming out on top.  Even those of us who were economically poor or struggling could look forward to a day off, seeing family, friends, going out, getting to live in a beautiful dreamworld for moments out of the year.  I remember it too, the time we spent at work could fly by in an instant, we didn't have to think about getting old, or not wasting our time or youth, because we were in a golden age, we would fall into place, and we were reassured by others of the same.

The nature of work changed so rapidly and became so normalized for a lot of people that it's hard to even know exactly when it happened.  It was like the crack of a whip, **there is a pandemic outside, it could kill you, but you better keep your head down and keep working**.  For a lot of people this realization comes to them individually, when they are fired for a work injury, or for taking off too much time to grieve a family member, but this time it came to people collectively.

You are now an essential worker, you wouldn't want to starve your friends and family, would you?  Your medical knowhow is crucial at this point!  You wouldn't want people to die from your inaction?  Working from home is beneficial for mitigating risk, but we've made the hard decision to have our employees keep coming in for the sake of the company's productivity.  Like the butt of rifle with a smileyface sticker on it.

518,"DISCUSSION: What is a better question for ""So what do you do for a living?""","# The Setup

Our jobs and careers consume a large part of both our day and our lives so asking someone ""what do you do for a living"" is a shorthand for gauging not just your financial stability but also insight into who you are as a person if said job or its industry is what you would be doing for the remainder of your working life. You identify with your job, asking ""so what do you do for a living"" helps identify you as a person. It's a classic icebreaker question for getting to know someone.

Only after the person answering the question has passed, i.e.. has a stable job/income and is happy in that job (meaning it's **sustainable** not that your happiness is a requirement to theirs), does the person who asked the question, ask additional questions related to who you really are as a person e.g. your emotions, your thoughts, your passions, your history, your family, your culture, your dreams, your hang-ups, your problems, all the questions related to getting to know one another and join two lives. In other words, if you're prospectable, then you're pursued. We all do this.

# The Scenario

But if your job is without dignity, not making you happy, not generating enough income, and generally all-around **unsustainable,** and you therefore choose not to identify with it outside of your job, e.g. I may be a McDonald's worker but I DJ outside out that, then what becomes a better question to ask a person in such a situation? Is it:

""So what do you do for a living?"" &lt; \[Answers career job\] &lt; Normal Questions

""So what do you do for a living?"" &lt; \[Answers poorly prospectable job (like McDonalds) \] &lt; ???

521,Essential Employees should have unionized at the start.,"I've been working this pandemic since the beginning like most of you. And like majority of front line workers, we would have: 

1. Made more money on unemployment benefits+CARES ACT BONUS
2. Had leisure time or time to improve our lives
3. Make passive income and focus on things that truly matter to us.
4. Not be exposed to the virus so deadly we had to shut down an entire global economy.

The problem I saw was that not too many essential employees were unionizing. I have met 0 essential employees in my area willing to step up towards there employer, or employers willing to step up for there employees. There is a big problem when those on unemployment benefits are making substantially more than those working. But I am not here to argue that because wage workers tend to be underpaid to begin with as a whole.

As an essential employee/full time student I would have benefited heavily from being laid off. But I was forced to work. I have elderly at home who I take care of and obligations towards my education along with work. I would have made more on the unemployment benefits.

What are your stories? What can we learn from you? And how did your life change?

I know such things are unimaginable for most people in the USA, but in some of the more generous social democracies in Europe - there's got to be a way, right?

I would love if we could hear these kinds of stories more, the ""truly"" inspiring ones (if you escaped the system by your own cunning, of course, and not by exploiting others).

I have achieved this kind of change recently and my life literally turned upside down. On the other hand, each day is a struggle since it is probably the most unpredictable kind of existence for those who achieve it without amassing huge savings.

One unexpected consequence is the painful alienation I often feel... Don't get me wrong, I realize that literally the majority of the planet yearns for such a lifestyle and I wouldn't trade it for anything, but, predictably, my relationships with people who do not live the same way have fallen apart even more than they do by themselves once you are out of school...

539,"""Use Your Potential"": An Anecdote &amp; a Rant","I'm in my mid-late 20's, and thanks to a drastic change in my health (thanks, science), I'm just now physically able enough to begin looking for a part-time job. I've got my eyes peeled for really any kind of low-impact, low-stress position--something secretarial or similar. My approach has ruffled a few feathers in my family.

Here's the thing: despite my health being incredibly poor my whole life, I excelled in school. In college, I missed about half of my classes due to my health, and frequently taught myself the course content from the confines of a hospital room. I still managed to graduate at the literal top of my class. I had professors tell me that they used me as an example to other students who were ""lazy""--i.e., ""I had a past student who got A's from a hospital bed--what's your excuse for turning this in late?"" I took it as a compliment, but frankly, I excelled in school *because I loved school.* Genuinely loved it. Learning and achieving good grades felt like investing in *myself.* Excelling for the benefit of someone else doesn't have the same intrinsic appeal, even if it makes me money.

My family doesn't understand why I excelled in school, but lack ambition when it comes to a career. I do lack ambition--I don't dispute that. Ideally, I'd like to give as little of myself as possible to work while maintaining a comfortable life. I don't need to be rich. I just want free time to do the things I love. I know that I *could* have a successful career. Do I want one? I mean... not really. I want to clock in and clock out, then get back to the things that actually matter to me--my fiance, my hobbies, my interests.

I'm not sure why people seem to find it almost offensive that despite my ""potential,"" I don't have much interest in using it to make money. ""You're talented at XYZ; why don't you work in those fields?"" Because I don't want to invest in anyone else. I don't want to trade the majority of my precious time and my sanity in exchange for a few extra dollars. I just don't think it's worth it.

I figured if anyone else could relate to how I feel, it's you guys. Has anyone else here been in my position? I feel like no matter what explanation I give to my relatives, they're still not satisfied.

I always felt like I was just wired differently than everyone else in my classes. 3D printing, mechanisms...whatever, none of that shit made me giddy. Debt and no prospects is what pushed me through it.

After finally squeezing through, I thought I was guaranteed a high-paying stable job...and I was just met with a smack in the face. It took 11 months to find an engineering job. During this time, I felt like an absolute failure and that life was basically over. After letting this affect me for so long, I gave into the feeling and just tried to enjoy myself. Daily walks in the woods, books, movies, and games I never had time to play in university. I ended up losing over 50 pounds during this time period (healthily) and I felt like my mental health was starting to get better. I became a lot more socially, politically, and philosophically aware during this time--it lead to a lot of introspection to what I actually want...and I'm not sure if this was for the better.

2 months into my ""engineering job"", I feel myself starting to slip again. Sitting down in a desk, day after day, trying to appear busy with excel spreadsheets. Everyone seemingly doing the same thing. Coworkers staying hours late pretending to be busy to get the boss' approval. Super uninvolved small talk. Pointless meetings. Yet everyone seems so proud and caught up in it? I can barely make it through the day without clawing my eyes out trying to stay awake. I get home mentally exhausted and immediately taking a nap. 

 I feel like I have no time in a day anymore...and then the stark realization hits: I will have to do this for 30-40 more years just to have the freedom that I had when I was panicking about not having a job. Hell, maybe I will die before I even get that chance...not everyone is so lucky in life. So, I have to appreciate the fact that I got the job but man...I really just dont see the point in living this way. Devoting all my time and energy to something I dont care about. I know there are people working so much harder jobs for so much less but I have to ask...why? What is seriously the point? Working all day just to pay for your ability to eat and sleep. Why are the essentials so expensive? Seems like people have kids to fill this void, but like why even have kids to subject them to this eternal wheel of suffering? I dont give a fuck about status or wealth...I just want freedom to explore what life has to offer me.

I also hate the fake persona you have to give when in the office.

Our CEO said in a recent meeting that they plan to make us go back to the office but there isn't a definitive date yet. After hearing that, I might have an ultimatum which is if I am not allowed to work from home then I quit. I already commit 10hrs of my day working and commuting will subtract even more time out of my day. Fuck. That.

558,Thank you! Sorry it’s kinda long.,"Soooo awhile back I found this and at first thought it was just a funny subreddit and followed. Then everything posted started really making sense and hitting home. Then someone made a post about how when we work all the time and tell ourselves and our kids we are doing it for them all we are doing is creating a cycle where they will do the same thing. I started thinking to my parents and grandparents who worked themselves crazy providing for us and telling us kids it was for a better life. 

It made me really start thinking about it all. And made me want to end that cycle. I work four days a week and being a single dad, I have to rely on my mom to get my two kids to and from school. I was gone 14+ hours a day. I drive an hour each way in order to make good money. My kids aren’t needy and would rather spend time with me than buy anything. I told myself it was necessary in order to give them a good life. I also have a carpentry business I do on the weekends. I’ve been moving to self sufficiency on my small farm and even making a bit of money from that. In other words I worked a lot. 

That ended today! I took a job that is 5 minutes from the house. I will make half the pay I was making, but my kids will get to stay at home every night instead of grandmas house. I will get to drop them off every day. I will budget like I’ve been doing. I’ve saved enough to pay off my car which is a modest car anyway. I’ll be able to use my extra time to make this small farm pay for itself. With the kids help. So I’ll only take carpentry jobs I wanna take that the kids can help with. I’m ending the cycle and I’m so freaking excited. My kids will remember time with me, not how much I worked.

People think slavery was abolished years ago but It never was... since when did we have a choice to be part of this system? we are born .. slapped with a name... sent to school to learn how to be a good cog... told to work until we are old and broken. Where is the choice in any of that?   


""oh but you can escape the system"" ... yeah if you have tonnes of money. I often honestly tell myself that I wish I had never been born into this era.. I would much rather have been a hunter gatherer with my family all around me in a tribe struggling to live from day to day rather than working for the man who has no idea what it is like at the bottom of society and continues to use me and abuse me every single day.

But you've got to go buy food, prepare for the coming week, and because everyone else is also at the shops on the same day, you wind up losing the middle of your day. Then you realise your Saturday is mostly gone, you still have laundry to do, chores etc. Then it's Sunday, you know you've got to get to bed early, because of Monday, maybe you've got ironing to do, lunches to prepare for the week so that's less time to do your own thing.

568,"14 hour shifts, no OT pay, NO breaks, unsafe toxic environment but I'm too scared to quit.","I recently started a job (1.5 months ago) as a manager of a (legal) dispensary. I was referred by a mutual friend of ours and he's said from the beginning he wouldn't hire anyone else but me (since I have experience in this industry). Since we opened during lockdown we have been very slow, so he (VP of ops who is working in the store with me for the time being) decided it would be best to not hire anyone and split the work between us. This meant 3 of days I was working alone for 11 hours, and the other 2 days I would be working 7 hours. I agreed to this for the time being because I thought it was manageable and because I didn't want to cause an issue. To be honest, it has been a little difficult working the long 11 hour shifts alone with no break, but I managed.

Now that we are out of lockdown, we are able to stay open 9am-11pm. I was under the impression that we would be hiring 2 more people to allow us to work a normal schedule but when I spoke to him last week he suggested that we work 5 regular days (7/8 hours), 1 14 hour day and have 1 day off instead of hiring more staff. I already decided prior that I would not be willing to work this schedule because I knew he would suggest this. When he suggested that to me last week I told him that I don't want either of us to work those hours, but it was a boundary for me and that I would prefer not to. Keep in mind that I did not get paid overtime for the previous OT I worked, nor would I get paid for the additional hours with the new proposed schedule. This means either, I do work the proposed schedule or I work 7 days a week and I'm not really comfortable with either.  He spent the next 10 minutes being upset with me and trying to convince me that working the long week wasn't so bad, which then made me feel like maybe I was overreacting? 

Since then he said he wants to hire another staff member at the end of the month, but to be honest I'm not sure if I trust him. I had the perfect candidate for the job and when I suggested that we hire him before we increase our hours he brushed it off the 2 separate times saying we'll wait a bit longer before we hire him until the candidate was no longer available. So I'm not sure if he actually wants to hire more people or just is tiding me over? Regardless, I've already worked this schedule for a week and I don't want to do it anymore. Even if I wouldn't have to do it in 2 weeks, the fact that he expected me to work this schedule, got upset with me when I said no, and then I was somehow guilted into doing it doesn't sit well with me. 

On top of this, my anxiety has been the worst it's been in my life. On 2 occasions I thought about taking myself to the hospital, and on 1 occasion I called an ambulance. I don't think it's a coincidence that this started when I started this job. My problem is that since it's only him and I, I'm really screwing him over by quitting and I feel absolutely terrible to put him in this position. I'm going to offer to stay another week and help him find a replacement but like he said, he wouldn't want to hire anyone and train anyone else for this job. He has no clue I want to quit so I'm in a really shitty spot, and I'm going to put him in an even shittier one. I know I shouldn't care since he's clearly shown he doesn't care for me or my wellbeing but I just feel so awful about it. I want to do this tomorrow so it lines up with the pay cycle and I'll receive one last pay cheque but I feel sick to my stomach about doing it. 

TL;DR Employer is giving me 2 schedule options I'm unhappy with, either work 7 days a week, or work 60 hours a week with 1 day off. Not sure if I'm being dramatic or if this is a boundary I am justified in upholding and quitting.",False,m58qcc,gaytoradee,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/m58qcc/14_hour_shifts_no_ot_pay_no_breaks_unsafe_toxic/,13,1
569,The hypocrisy of companies offering extra health and wellness webinars during the pandemic without systemically changing anything else is amazing (in a bad way),"of course there are plenty of things both before and during the pandemic that has gotten worse on us workers, but one thing that has really stood out has been the company i work for offering extra optional health and wellness webinars focused on COVID. what amazes me (in the worst way possible) is that these sessions like ""managing stress during the pandemic"" type sessions are nice to offer, sure, but they're ridiculously performative. absolutely nothing will reduce employee's stress and improve our mental health if you don't reduce our hours and workload, lower expectations, stop firing a bunch of people, etc. it really does amaze me that companies think they can boost everyone's health just by offering a few extra webinars. it's like putting one single band aid on a gunshot wound. we so clearly need massive change, in my opinion a reduction of the 40 hour work week is a start - and a realistic and reasonable one at that. i'm just so frustrated that i keep seeing these sessions offered, and i do attend them, and all they do is make me angrier. the good thing is the ones leading the webinars usually send out follow up surveys, so i at least get to write in my thoughts afterwards. but really, i don't see change in my own company, and i've had enough!!",False,m56y80,00evilhag,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/m56y80/the_hypocrisy_of_companies_offering_extra_health/,4,1

585,"I love to work, but....","This will be a big one, but bear with me…

For the last 5 years I have worked in one of the largest European multinational companies in an engineering job. My job consists basically in designing new products for the automotive market and in the paper this is one of those fulfilling jobs where you get to make the difference. 

The problem, as with most jobs, is in the execution. First of all, I am not native to the original country of the multinational. Many of you should know that, by definition, my career and job climbing is limited by nothing else than my own nationality. This is a known secret in all “multinational” companies that in fact have nothing multinational about them except promoting the use of cheap labor in other countries. 

This meant I could never ascend to the top ranking inside the company, which to be honest was not my goal. But this also meant that my opinion, even if highly back by proofs, calculations, simulations and reasoning will be, in the best case, head to head with the native’s heart-felted belief. And that is not how science or engineering really should work. 

The second problem is the local environment in which I work. The local bosses, and the full local hierarchy, are nothing else but patsies that don’t even dream the rise above the limitations imbued in their brains the central headquarters. And, everyone which actually tries to be better, is to some extent marginalized. 

During the time I was there, I was one of the responsible people to win a large public financed project to foment the technology development and specialized workforce of my own country. The idea is to get these tech projects to be done in “less developed” countries so that they could close the gap the “more developed” countries using some financial and social incentives. The idea is of course amazing however, after 5 years and hundreds of people involved I feel we got nothing to show, not necessarily because the projects didn’t create anything useful but because it was never about being successful. Once this project ends, nothing interesting in knowledge will actually stay at my country, or even my work group. We will be back to the meat grinder of useless poorly paid jobs. 

And this is what led me to anti-work! Most of us are either working for someone to get rich, or working for absolutely no reason whatsoever. It is not that I am against working, I love working and see my creations come to life. But I realize that the current status-quo will never enrich the society which I am part of, and that destroys me from the inside.",False,m4ulyx,FaithfulLamb,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/m4ulyx/i_love_to_work_but/,3,1

611,How does one start a side business if their employment contract restricts them from other employment and business opportunities,"I work as a UX Designer at a large software firm.

Things are neither interesting nor well paying here. I've realized that finding another job is just the start of another ""S-curve"" where I'll eventually stagnate yet again.

**The Goal**

Instead, I wanna use my skills and start a side business, scale it up and then automate most of it (Baring the parts I actually enjoy). The approach is inspired by Tim Ferriss' book The Four Hour Work Week where we reduce the time needed to work while still scaling up the output to support your desired lifestyle.

With the skills I have which encompass both design and development of websites/webapps, I can think of a ton of ideas. From selling digital assets online, drop shipping to freemium based applications.

**The Challenge**

1. My employment contract states that as long as I work with this firm, I cannot take up any other employment, business without prior written permission. Given my ideas are all ""software based"" it's very unlikely they'll give permission ever. Besides, this is a very large firm with a wide range of services and products in a wide range of domains. It's not just software but even robots, IoT devices etc.
2. My pay isn't great and my financials aren't very stable. I also have 4 dependents thus reducing my risk appetite. Basically, I feel the need to be cautious.
3. I thought of temporarily switching jobs &gt; Increasing the pay &gt; Stabilizing my financials &gt; Creating a financial safety buffer and leaving my job to focus on the idea. However, in my field (UX Design), a portfolio is far more crucial as compared to a resume. Given my firm is in the B2B space almost all the stuff I have worked on are proprietary and confidential making it tough to find a new job too. I could work on dummy projects just to show, however, they start lacking on the process, challenges etc bits

During the Industrial Revolution, 16-hour days and six-day weeks were the norm.
But people started to campaign, and formed the slogan:

Henry Word and his motor company were the first to implement
the change, and in 1926 announced the five-day work week.

653,Being a transgender person in the workforce makes it so much worse,"(TL;DR: I’m being discriminated against by my horrible manager and it’s got me feeling hopeless.)

I’m new to this subreddit and also new to the job force (my parents didn’t let me get a job until they were vaccinated for COVID.) I’m an 18 year old transgender man (he/him) and I’m very open about that in both my application and to my coworkers. I refuse to hide my identity from people just because they think my existence is a debatable subject. (Maybe not the safest idea because I live in the bible belt, but whatever, trans rights bitches 🏳️‍⚧️)

I think I pass well as a guy and I’m fairly well established in my workplace as a male-identified person. I work in a chain restaurant and when people approach me at the drive through they’ll usually refer to me as “sir,” “man,” or “bro” depending on who I’m interacting with. I have 3 managers (we’ll call them Managers A, B and C) and manager A (the one who’s the most tolerable) even told me one day that she told everybody in the staffing and management at the restaurant what my pronouns were and to tell her if I experienced any discrimination. Manager A and B as well as most of my coworkers are very good with remembering my pronouns. But manager C, the most dickish of the managers, just won’t call me by my pronouns. I have no idea why, he just constantly refers to me with “she” which does not help my dysphoria at all. Manager A said she told everyone in the restaurant, C included, so there’s no reason why he should be calling me by incorrect pronouns unless he’s just incredibly forgetful and doesn’t hear that just about everyone calls me “he”— unless he’s doing it intentionally. I asked manager B to tell C to stop misgendering me and she told me that it was between me and C for that discussion to happen, which I hate to think about. Why should I have to ask the person in charge of everyone else for basic respect? I’m also nervous that calling him out on this could result in me getting snapped at, which already happens to me a lot because manager C is horrible to the workers under him. He accuses all of us of playing around when he’s not doing anything to help us during the dinner rush, snaps at me when I forget to hand out drinks, and even has the audacity to yell at me for handing out the wrong bags of food when he hands them to me and tells me which car to bring it to. Needless to say it’s not a conversation that I want to have or should have to have.

I may be new to this subreddit but I’ve known that capitalism is a fundamentally broken system for a while now. And now that I’m experiencing the discrimination that I am, and I know that discrimination against me will always be present in the workplace towards me just because of how I am, it’s getting me immensely depressed. I’m considering filing a complaint with the higher ups at the corporate level—I assume that because I’m being discriminated against when the contracts I signed specifically said I wouldn’t and it’s a chain restaurant with more red tape to work around than an independent company then I should have at least some luck on my side—but I have my doubts it’ll do anything. I still live with my parents and am going to college in the fall so I don’t desperately need this job, so technically I could quit any time, but I’m just so tired of not having money to afford things. I want to be able to get top surgery and keep paying for my testosterone in the future, not to mention I need to have money in reserve for emergency expenses. 

I feel like it might look better on my resume if I stay with this job for at least 3 months, but I’m already so miserable. Besides that, I have other things to focus on; I’m still a senior in high school and I still need to prep for college. But the truth is that even though I know that I’d be happier if I quit my job, I’m scared to drop it. I don’t want to not be able to afford things now or in the future, and I feel like I’m somewhat useless if I don’t have a job at 18. I wanted a job so badly before my parents would let me get one, so it feels defeating to quit it after I’ve only been there for a month. So I’m at a loss, but I still have to work for 7 hours straight tomorrow. It doesn’t really feel like any move I make now will be a step in the right direction.",False,m3yib5,Striccly,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/m3yib5/being_a_transgender_person_in_the_workforce_makes/,12,1

662,My doctor strongly recommended bed rest and all I could think about was work 😞,"I go to university full time for animation. I have a slipped disc in my spine which is causing sciatica and I also have fibromyalgia + chronic fatigue syndrome. I really need a break, I was running myself into the ground and my doctor could really see that. I’m in a lot of pain so I got strong pain killers, he told to spend the next 2 weeks in bed before I get an x-ray and I freaked the fuck out. 1 because my painkillers make me sleepy which makes me extremely unproductive and 2 Because I knew for a fact my university would not allow me to have 2 straight weeks off and even if they did I would feel so much guilt about not working. I ended up trying to think of a ‘creative solution’ which was to move my pc and cintiq next to my bed so I could satisfy both parties while completely ignoring what I needed and wanted. 

My partner told me that was insane and that I needed to take care of myself. I took a step back and realised how long it had been since I have had an actual break which has been a very, very long time. How long I had been neglecting myself. How badly I had treated myself. That I’m sick, I’m disabled and that I need a break. I even went to the doctor not because I needed help but because I wanted to stop the pain so I could sit down and work again because I was terrified of missing my deadlines. How screwed up is that? My student loan is my only income and I’m too disabled to work a ‘normal’ job. 

I still don’t see a solution to my problem as of now nor am I asking for one, I just wanted to share my experience. It is rather haunting, that we are conditioned from such a young age to just run ourselves into the ground with no regard for our health and well-being. The thought that we have to earn our right to exist. It’s disgusting but I don’t see anything changing.

Prevailing message and your orders:  It's cool to desire a bunch of silly crap and excess, and it's cool to tolerate low-wage slavery exploitation to (maybe) obtain it way, way off in the future.  Either way, with your participation you further enrich the already extremely wealthy and further consolidate their power and influence in society.  So listen to these barely literate pawn artists who don't even write half their own lyrics and selfishly pursue shallow fame and fortune without goal or aim.  Those are the level-headed, wise individuals to imitate.  So get to work.  Make more money for the people with all the money.  Because it's cool.  And you really don't have a choice.

You'd be lucky if even a few people here were remotely passionate about the work they're doing here. Also, you can quit with that nonsense about the workplace being a 'family'. A real family actually looks out for each other, and from my experience, every single employer who calls the workplace a 'family' also gaslights, guilts, and exploits its employees to get as many hours as possible out of them and kicks them to the curb when they don't comply. Tell me, what kind of family do you know that does that? My family is at home. This is just a job to me.

The bar is so low.
People are asking for a ""living"" wage.

Not a thriving wage, or even a satisfactory wage, just
literally enough to live.

People ask ""can | live?"" and the response is ""we'd rather
have higher profits."" In fact, the rich live 15 years longer
than the poor.

690,Are we perpetuating industries because we have no way out?,"Many people work in industries or at companies that don't align with their values. And these industries and companies continue thriving because people can't all just mass-quit and put them out of business. 

McDonald's would have no workers if there was UBI. But because people need an entry-level job and don't have other options, they put up with working there, despite the poor employment practices. 

It's not easy to just pick up and leave, we're not incentivized to because there isn't much of a safety net. Even if you're a whistleblower, it can be a long time before you get compensated (if they get compensated at all). 

If I didn't have to work, I would not care about the industry I'm in. I would focus on cleaning up the environment, helping animals, selling food. But I don't leave because these are the skills I have and I make much more money doing work I don't align with. I used to like my work, but after so many years I'm disenchanted with it. 

I was watching a webinar for work and imagined that the person doing the webinar cares little about what they're saying, but they say it because they're paid to do so. If we weren't forced to work for a living, it's likely webinars like that would go away because who would seriously want to do that? When they could go do something that aligns more with their values. 

How many industries would disappear if we weren't forced to work for a living? And how many companies that didn't treat people right would shut down because nobody would work there? 

I think of employees at Wells Fargo that opened fake accounts and forged customer signatures because they were told to meet quotas. If they didn't have to work for a living, they could more easily justify leaving. But someone who has tons of bills, and has to work, justifies doing something unethical because they need to ""survive"".

anything, because it’s pretty close to where I live, and
when I get there I can do a good job without it being
too demanding. I like the customers and the other
people that work there, and it doesn’t, you know, take
over my life or anything. When I get home I can go and

and it’s not like I’m having to prepare a report for a
scar boss or worry about having to go abroad for a
meeting or whatever. Life should be a lot simpler than
people make it.’ The fiddle with her straw some more.

you do to get money. It’s not your life. Of you spend

Why do you have to pay your bills in full and add extra so some scummy fuck who never worked a day in their lives can get paid to do nothing but it’s 100% ok to not give workers proper compensation for their work to keep them afloat and pay their bills plus a little extra.

Why is a company that can’t pay its bills to the big man considered shit and deserves to die off meanwhile the company that pay their bills but underpays their staff is a cool legit business that almost everyone accepts.

In my opinion!!! (Opinion warning) your buisness is shit if it can’t pay its people enough to live and some extra. If ma and pa have to fix 100 rats per cage and 20 guine pigs per cage (real place in Clarksville rn) charge 82 dollars for a small ass cage and still only pay their people 7.25 then I’m sorry ma and pa can rot in hell for all I care.

I am an inventor and scientist by background but have taken any job I can get to make ends meet. This shit is hard and it doesnt matter how hard you work for others, it will never get you anywhere unless someone really takes an interest in you.

 I recently paired with a lady at a startup and we are working to uplift people and get them out of low paid, high risk work and we are supporting parents get flexible work options too. We aren't making money yet, but I honestly feel we are making a difference.

So I wanted to give you some ideas to get into a better situation as well. Think about what you want to do for work and how you could use that idea to start your own business. Start small and scale up slowly as money comes in. I am happy to help and there lots of helpful people on reddit and all over the internet. 

You don't need a bank loan and there are lots of crowd funding services popping up especially in the US. Some countries even have business accelerators in every state. Below are simple ideas to get you started that you can build on or  be inspired by. If we can't challenge the system, we can create our own better one.

Some business ideas:
-Ask local businesses how much they pay or food delivery services and see if you can offer the same or better. 
-can wash and iron clothes? Maybe you could offer a pickup and drop off laundry service? Many professionals would pay for that and you can charge by the basket load.
-Can you cook? Ask around and see if people in your neighborhood would pay you to cook them fresh meals. You could plan your menu a week in advance and charge them per a serving. 
-can you sew? You could offer a hemming and button sewing service.
-do you make good sandwiches? How about selling sandwiches to staff in business parks or industrial areas that have less options. You can sell soft drinks and do meal deals to make a bit extra on each order.
-are you good with kids? Maybe you can join a few others to start a childcare and baby sitting service?
-can you teach? You could tutor on line theough video call.
-are you bilingual or multilingual? You could offer translation services or teach your languages.",False,m48g59,Chipchow,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/m48g59/some_solutions_to_help_you_out/,6,1

721,"Shoo, go away, icky felon! We don't want you here!","Can I just rant for a minute about my situation? It's just so frustrating.

So I've worked for company A since 2019. I have one felony charge from 2018. Other than that, my record is squeaky clean. Company A saw my felony when they hired me but didn't care since it had nothing to do with the type of work I would be doing.

So I've been super successful with company A in the last year and a half. Promotions, raises, and my direct boss hinting there was more in my near future. Yay!

Well cut to Feb 2021. Company B, a giant, international bank who you have most definitely heard of has bought out my company and taken over. But they treat us current employees like new hires, since I guess we technically are to them, making us go through the whole background and finger printing process.

Well they weren't as understanding as company A when my felony came up. They decided to fire me, even though I've been doing fantastic work and the charge would not affect anything at my work in the slightest.

Then to rub salt in the wound, I STILL haven't got my last paycheck. My last day was Feb 18. When I first called the HR hotline for the new company when payday came around and it wasn't there, they said ""oh it looks like that's because your termination date was set to Feb 1,even though we do see you worked until Feb 18. Call this [random person] and have him fix that for you."" well that contact didn't make sense to me so I messaged an HR manager with the old company and she said"" yeah they gave you the wrong info, don't call that person. Just let me handle it for you, I know how to get it fixed. "" well she's been hounding them every week and they just keep having excuses why I'm not getting paid. Today has been the third week and I was told"" it'll be deposited on Monday "".

So we'll see. If it's not, I'm 100% filling a complaint with my states labor board because I looked it up and they legally only have Three DAYS past payday to issue a check.

I just feel so slighted. I am a great worker, I've NEVER been fired from any job in my 25 years of adulthood, enjoyed my job, all my QA stats were high, attendence was perfect, but this new company sees One unrelated flaw and decides they don't want to be associated with me. And now I feel like the attitude of this faceless mega corporation is ""well she's not a real person, she's just a dirty criminal, who cares if she gets paid or not"".

And I filed for unemployment but my case is under review because apparently if you're fired from a job they have to investigate to see if you're worthy of benefits or not I guess. Wtf.

724,"I'm not totally 'anti-work', I'm just anti-'get fucked by every employer in every conceivable way'","I don't mind working, even jobs that are difficult or demanding. I don't mind getting dirty and I don't mind doing boring things to make a living. I've driven trucks, swept floors, ran registers, done gardening, plumbing, electrical, and even replaced septic tanks. I have never once had a problem with the job, **always** the company and the people I work for. 

I would clean and replace septic tanks all day, every day, but never again for $10/hr. I would deal with obnoxious customers and 'Karens' ten hours every single day, but not for $10/hr. I've earned my class A CDL and it's bullshit when you see all the ads saying ""we pay so much"" and ""we're short on drivers"". They want people with 0 experience (because they either hammer them into their mold or find a way to let them go) or they want people with 15+ years driving and not a *single* mark on their record for anything. Only the most prefect drivers make anything reasonable. My best driving job was about $700-800 (take-home) every week and I didn't even qualify for insurance until I'd been with them for two years. That was for being on the road for a week at a time and only getting 2 days off every weekend. It sounds like it's decent, and it is better than minimum wage by far, but the cost of a CDL can be anywhere from $3k (what I paid) to as much as $15k depending on your location and the school you attend. You don't *need* to go to a school, but good fucking luck convincing anyone to let you borrow their truck to take the test without it. 

I'm just so tired of being treated like I'm worth less than the dirt on the floors I'm told to sweep for hours a day. I'm sick of being belittled and screamed at by bosses and written up when I give the attitude back. Just because you sign my paycheck does not give you the right to treat me like property. 

I'm a human fucking being, I *want* to work, I just don't want to go in every single day and enter every single interview pretending I'm happy to earn fuck all when I know it's never going to be enough to have a 'decent' living. There simply is no 'working class' people living decent lives. Decent as in a paid off home, a paid off car for each adult living there, money and the freedom in work to take vacation, able to save more than single dollars every week after expenses, being able to splurge and spoil friends or family on occasion.  There are no 'working class' jobs able to support that. People tell me all the time to become a welder 'and earn $30/hr easy'. Welding is hard and, where I live, welders start at $15/hr at best. You can't just 'become' a welder on a bridge, underwater, for a skyscraper. Those jobs are selective and require experience even if you're in the area for those. Welding, much like driving, also requires schooling. You might be able to 'prove' to some mom and pop car or fabrication shop that you're a decent welder, but they won't pay like union jobs. People act like you can just 'decide' to pick a better job and make it happen. Fuck no you can't. Nepotism, favoritism, and a lack of trust from management to the bottom employees always fucks over the blue collars.

So I'm not anti-work, I want to work and I work hard, I just want to feel like my work is worth something no matter what that work is. If you put flowers in a vase, fuck yeah, you're valuable. I worked at a floral shop and delivered arrangements. That shit is hard to make look good and people *love* flowers. If you run a register, your work is amazing. Keeping those lines moving smoothly and being able to smile, laugh with, and assist most customers is extraordinarily impressive. The people on the 'bottom' truly are essential and the backbone of society. They all deserve so much better. 

Sorry if this rambles too much. I'm currently fighting a sinus infection (hopefully not Covid, but I did get tested today) so I'll try to respond to many people who may comment, but if I don't, I apologize for my inevitable crash. 

tl;dr: I love work, work is great, i just want to be treated like a human and paid for my work instead of an 'expendable employee' who makes the bare minimum these employers are able to pay.",False,m58b0q,Mavii_Mira_,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/m58b0q/im_not_totally_antiwork_im_just_antiget_fucked_by/,35,1

Thoughts of the weekend overcome and you wish time could of stayed still. PTO crosses your mind, but when you get back the work will quadruple and it's frowed upon at this company to take it.

Of a $15 minimum wage is unfair because cost of living

to senators?

Instead of everyone making $174,000 with Cadillac

min wage. He taxpayers simply can't afford it.

735,I want to make not working possible,"I have an idea, a potentially stupid idea, but hear me out. I'm thinking about if creating a platform would work for our escape, by combining ideas that I've seen other platforms have. I want to make a platform where people can upload content and be paid, like youtube, but I also want the consumers to be able to be paid. Like when you watch a video with an ad, I want the sponsor money to be split between me, the content creator, and the consumer. So it could potentially be possible to get paid to either make what you want to make or get paid to watch things that interest you. I feel like businesses pay a ton to put their ads up, so I assume that the money could be split 3 way without it being a big deal. Sadly if the platform got big enough I'd be unsure how to give each consumer more than a few pennies unless I changed it to consumers with high upvoted comments would be rewarded money, I'm unsure. In the best case scenario, if it got crazy big and I was super rich, I'd pull myself out of it and the sponsor money would split between only the content creator and consumer. But I want this concept of being able to live without having to work to exist. It's something I've dreamed of, and I want to figure out how to make it happen.

775,Temp jobs as alternative to 9 to 5,"Many companies are preferring to hire temp or contract workers over full time employees because they dont have to pay benefits and there is no long term committment. 

This is great for companies but also for people who like to enter and exit the work force as they wish. Working 6 months out of the year is feasible if one lives on the road and doesnt pay rent. 

There are no shortages of temp jobs. They are easier to get than full time jobs. If you are mobile and location doesnt factor you can travel anywhere for work. You are free to pursue whatever you wish on the side, art, music, photography, film making etc. 

No more working the same boring job for 40 years. You can work a new temp job every 3 or 6 months. Take as much time off as you want between jobs. 

For those who are'nt interested in buying a house, starting a family, and like freedom. This is a great alternative lifestyle.",False,m2rrbs,adultsarebigkids,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/m2rrbs/temp_jobs_as_alternative_to_9_to_5/,10,1
776,Dropping out of college,"Felt like writing here because I think I might find some clues on what to do now that I’m at a breaking point. I tend to write a lot, but I’ll try to keep it short.

I thought I was doing great because I found a career I was truly interested in and got the opportunity to study at the university of my dreams. I got a scholarship which tbh I didn’t need because my parents could afford it, but why wouldn’t I accept it? I had the pressure of my parents expecting me to accept something they thought I deserved, finish a career just like they finished theirs and help them financially. Plus, I was sure it was the career I wanted. 

Someone from my family told me I shouldn’t do it. Why would I get unnecessarily tied to a career just to save a few bucks? It’s a public university so it isn’t expensive. I talked to my parents about it and, yeah, it meant nothing. It wasn’t up to me. 

Long story short, I started uni and everything went amazing until… 2020. I just couldn’t do it. Everything overwhelmed me and brought me down. I had also started working 48 hours shortly before quarantine started so I was a shell of a human. I didn’t feel alive, I couldn’t even finish the ridiculous homework I had. I was a fucking robot. So, yeah, I didn’t study last year. 

On December 31st I quit my work. It felt great. I thought I could start uni again and it would be just like the first year… but it wasn’t. It’s the same stuff over and over again. I’ve felt way better in every aspect of my life after quitting, but every uni class feels like hell. It’s not even difficult, teachers are great people, everything’s “okay”, but I think it might not be for me. I don’t even wanna blame being quarantined and having online classes anymore. Now that I look back I think *this* was there all along. College might not be for me, at least not right now. What I'm finding so hard to put my energy in used to motivate me naturally and make me so freaking happy before... I don't wanna lose that. I miss that.

I guess what I’m trying to say is that I’ve already taken the decision. I feel it deep inside, I’m sure. But, shit, I’m 19 years old and I’m already in debt. And ofc it's more than what the scholarship covered (pigs). My parents won’t pay it off, I know that. They’ll be so upset and disappointed to do so, which I get. Maybe they can’t afford it, idk. I’ll have to work again and you know what? I don’t even care. I’ve been there and I know I can do it again. It sucks, but that’s how it is.

I said I know what to do, but maybe there’s something I’m not able to see. Has anyone been through something similar? How are you doing now? Do you regret it? I’d really appreciate anything tbh. I’m scared as hell and kinda need a bit of perspective before talking to my parents and actually taking the decision. 

If there's a better sub to post this in I'd appreciate the info too.

782,Anybody else just feel down sometimes thinking about all this capitalist b.s. the world goes through unnecessarily?,"Maybe I'm just feeling a little existential but sometimes it all just feels so futile. We fight so hard and for so long for things such as relief bills, better pay, better working hours, better jobs, better rights, but does it really even make a dent if we're still trapped in this nightmare capitalist system where people must give up the precious time in their lives to make others money and just to survive? Where people must sacrifice everything just to keep a roof over their heads and to pay for healthcare. Where millions are struggling and will continue to struggle under this oppressive system regardless of the small help the govt decides to give us.  

I'd like to think we are inching our way out of it but I'm also a realist and know that history repeats itself and capitalism will most likely never be done and gone. We're also still fighting many (re: ALL) of the same issues that generations past dealt with even though we very clearly have answers and solutions to do things much better. 

And yes I understand that one way to combat this sentiment is to organize and contribute but I'm much more of an educator than an activist. And I'm already tired of trying to educate people who are too brainwashed to even think of getting out of this system/world/disaster.

The kind where you are tasked to do the same menial, mind numbing, tedious shit, over, and over again for what feels like an eternity, while dealing with moronic, unreasonable and obnoxious assholes every 10 minutes and expected to not only be in a perpetual state of joy, but respond with ""good!, you?"" each time your ~~co-worker~~ co-drone corners you in with ""how are you? (god forbid you tell them otherwise).  


But I'm just fucking ecstatic, because once a month the robotic supervisor (who has about as much soul as a bottle of sanitizer) visits our desks with a box of cupcakes, courtesy of that stereotypical overly bubbly girl who sends out emails, complete in size 64 rainbow text to announce celebrating world fucking banana bread day! As you start to observe the insanity of the same old practiced, theatrical like civilized sterile play - you cannot help but feel an overwhelming cold sense of death, especially during the silence when the phones all stop and the keyboard clatter continues into the empty void of total nothingness.  


At this point, you take a glance towards life beyond the tall sun bathed window, then back at office and in a silent whimper, snicker to yourself... what is so noble about this shit? Well, it didn't take long before dread induced pauses prior to swiping my lanyard at the door turned into daily thoughts of ""I cannot do this shit anymore"", to jumping off a cliff. By this point I was well aware that I was mentally unstable and yet still got scored down for sounding less bubbly on the phone, because of some crap about leaving your feelings at the door etc.  


Not long after I quit, I was chased down but not from an angle of concern, but like prison guards on a jail break mission. When that failed, I was no longer existent, just a disposable number like the rest who feel very special as they gleefully munch onto their cupcake in time before the next phone call. Upon looking back at it all, there are now times  where I am dumbfounded by the sheer amount of time wasted that I'll never get back, for something that barely made a financial difference and only made me physically and mentally sick.  


On that note.. I know I will come off as a cheeseball here, but IF your living situation permits it to any manageable extent and you're just grinding away to finish off that credit card sooner... stop, GTFO and don't look back.

I think my job felt worried for me being let go during a pandemic and so they hung on to me. Because of this job I saved all my side income enabling me to be free at last. I made 60k extra in January. I also made 2000/ month doing side hustles and I have 200k in Bitcoin (I won’t sell. I’m letting it go to the moon!).

789,My work keeps statistics on me.,"     Hi, I would like to rant. My work reprimanded me today. I am a customer service representative. I work my ass of for that job, while having many severe disabling physical and mental conditions that impeded my daily life. 

     I don’t want to loose my job! It is so horrible. I feel powerless because I need this job really bad. I get to work from home which helps with my disabilities. It’s also hard to GET a job with disabilities. 

    They keep stats on me like I’m a machine. I am monitored very closely and if I don’t achieve their baseline stats on performance, I get in trouble. They like to say how awesome a company they are because you can have tattoos and colored hair; I just think that is a weird things to brag about. They literally are the “not like other girls” meme but for corporations. (We aren’t like other corporations). I think it is bizarre that I... as a human being— have stats, as if I were a video game character. 

    Their stats are meaningless as well. I try to build a relationship with the customer, appropriately addressing  their needs, as well as document each incident thoroughly. But the way the companies stats are designed, it makes each interaction like a never ending factory line: being rushed and messy.

     I want to go a good job, it’s important for me to do a good job but their monitoring of me makes it impossible. I wish they would just let me do my job. 

    By the way, I just started this job and it is entry level but I only get two weeks vacation (one week paid). And the time off doesn’t FULLY accrue until the end of the year. I don’t know if I just had better jobs in the past, but I could take off as much time as a needed, so long as it was reasonable. Which only having two weeks makes it so I can’t a vacation and have a disability because I have to use that time off for appointments, mental health days, and physical health days, etc.

&gt;Before the pandemic, Jesson had planned her day while on public transit – going over her to-do list, checking her calendar, and getting ready to transition into work mode. “I didn’t even really realize that I was prepping myself for the day until I no longer had the ability to do that,” she says.  
&gt;  
&gt;In an effort to regain the satisfying elements of her former routine, Jesson began faux commuting several months ago. Now, she drives about 20 minutes to a coffee shop most mornings, before her workday starts. Not only does Jesson’s commute create a buffer between her work and personal time, but it “adds that more human aspect” back into her day.  
&gt;  
&gt;“When you’re commuting, there’s hundreds of people around you, so it’s kind of like everyone’s in it together,” she says.

801,Pick your shit sandwich,"I worked part time (24-30 hrs per week) and enjoyed the most freedom and flexibility I’ll probably ever have in my work life (for now at least). But I wasn’t getting paid crap, I basically could only afford my essential bills and didn’t have much money leftover to splurge on my hobbies like traveling, gardening, etc.

Now I work your typical 9-5, Mon - Fri office job, and get paid more than enough to splurge on my hobbies, but I don’t have nearly as much wiggle room in my schedule to go on trips, visit family whenever I want, call out and have a coworker cover for me if I need a break that day, etc.

So I guess my point is a lot of us can’t have the best of both worlds. Our system isn’t set up to allow people to live comfortably working part-time hours, unless you’re lucky enough to not have debt, have the support of family/friends, etc. We either have to resort to living paycheck to paycheck, constantly stressing about money but having more free time OR having way less leisure time but not really worrying about money....so I guess you have to prioritize and pick your shit sandwich.

This made me realize 2 things: 

1) If you work full time and don’t have the option to go part time, spoil the shit out of yourself. If you love to travel, don’t wait for your company to grant you that stingy ass 1-2 week vacation, take weekend trips, days trips, etc, do it all. I see a lot of posts here saying that people don’t have the energy to do anything after work, trust me I get it. On top of having depression, it feels nearly impossible sometimes to even have the motivation to do things I enjoy. But how I see it is, if I don’t take time for myself, then I let capitalism and corporate employers steal the most significant years of my life and you can NEVER get that time back. So stop waiting and get on the plane, go out to a new restaurant, go to a damn spa just because you deserve it, just do something.

2) If you work part time, companies are still stingy asf with their pay so put in minimal effort for that minimal pay.

I worked on the home shopping department that delivers people's online grocery orders and since I started it has dominated my life. Having to start a 5am kills, especially when I wake up with back pain from my previous shifts.

And it seems like most are happy with this existence (considering that there is no broad movement for anti bullshit work sentiment outside this subreddit). 

I'm just saying I have no idea how I'm going to live with this shit for the rest of my life, and I'm struggling to comprehend how  there aren't more in the exact same boat. I'm realizing that any pleasures outside of work are just an aside, and work will be all you know until you retire (if you're lucky enough)

819,How to Escape Full Time Work: A Success Story From my 22 Yo Friend,"DISCLAIMER: THIS ISNT FOR EVERYONE

However, if you are someone who is willing to sacrifice on certain aspects of your life, I have an interesting story to relay.

My friend, aged 22, recently closed on a Home. Now, the most interesting part is that she was not given any special advantages to reach this spot. And, since I helped her through the process I gained some unique perspective on how much it costs to live.

She used the USDA Home loan program, a government-subsidized mortgage, that let her put an offer on a home with 0 $ Down.

She had a 660 credit score, a college dropout, and her yearly income was 36K working for Verizon.

Now, she owns a 3 bed 1 bath home in Metropolis IL with a 2 car detached garage.

Best of all, her monthly Escrow payment is only 580$ for everything. Principal, interest, HOA, taxes and insurance for under 600$ a month

Now, she plans on getting a roommate and charging them less than market rate for rent.

In the end, she should be able to survive on 24 hours of work each week.

&amp;#x200B;

***So, for those interested in an alternative, this is what she did:***

\*\*Apply for jobs in areas with super low cost of living,\*\*She applied at Verizon stores in 8 different states

**Use this tool to check homes that are eligible for USDA 0$ down payments in that area:**[https://eligibility.sc.egov.usda.gov/eligibility/welcomeAction.do](https://eligibility.sc.egov.usda.gov/eligibility/welcomeAction.do)

**Find a home somewhere that's under 100K**She found her place in rural IL for 80K. a bit older but in fantastic shape given the price

**Help Someone else out by renting a room at below market rate for the area**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Idk if this helps anyone but it caught my attention

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: 22 YO friend with nothing special going for her now owns a home and only works 32 hours a week. She used resources available to anyone willing to sacrifice on some small creature comforts

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: forgot to mention. She only needed 500$ to get started with the home buying process

her yearly income was 36K when she applied for the mortgage",False,m3iy4o,Haamboner,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/m3iy4o/how_to_escape_full_time_work_a_success_story_from/,19,2

831,Learning to un-internalize capitalist mindset,"I work in an industry that I genuinely enjoy, but doesn’t pay the best, at least not at my level of work. Since the pandemic, business has suffered, and the scope of my work has been pared back. Lotttsssss of downtime/Reddit/social media instead of work. Additionally, my company put us on workshare, which means I’m capped at 32 hours a week, but still qualify for federal unemployment assistance. 

Initially, I struggled with this. I legitimately liked my job, and was eager to advance, and this change in my work felt like a complete halt in any sort of professional momentum I’d developed. But now I’m starting to embrace it. I work 20% less, have a three day weekend every other week, and with federal unemployment assistance, I actually make considerably more in take home pay than if I were working at my standard 40 hours/week, releasing considerable financial pressure. 

I’m coming around to learning that I’m worth more than my economic “value.” I mean, how good for my mental health can it be to tie my self worth to a system that has inadvertently rewarded me for doing LESS? True, I do want to feel useful and fulfilled at work, but barring that, I’ll take this pay bump.

Note: this post is not meant as a brag. So many people have suffered terribly over the last year, and for a long time before that. It’s just sheer luck that I’ve somehow benefited overall from the pandemic, and how absurd that situation is.",False,m2av8p,EJD87,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/m2av8p/learning_to_uninternalize_capitalist_mindset/,2,1

In order to keep us all fed and sheltered, people with these skills would need to work tirelessly, as they already do. How would we compensate them without money, and going back to capitalism?

Are there any authors or theorists out there who have suggested an alternative way of living in a society, and one which we can realistically transition into from the state we are in now? 

I’d be very interested to learn about alternatives, as I believe the mental health crisis we are currently undergoing is caused by the somewhat purposeless lives most of us feel that we are living, by grinding away 8 hours a day 5 days a week (at least that).

She confessed that she stuck with it though, and that now after 25 years shes too old to go anywhere else. She closed out the speech by asking us to up our numbers and do mandatory overtime this weekend.

For context, my office is two permanent workers and six contract workers. Our titles are all ""office administration assistants"". But we do custodial work for the documents department, moving hundreds of files day in and day out. It's actually very physically taxing, and we have to also data entry 200 files per day as well. 

We get paid $12 or less an hr, with no breaks, save for a half hour unpaid lunch (which in my state they technically don't need to provkde for us, thanks VA👍...), and of course no benefits. The jobs we all have are not permanent in anyway, even though they've been rotating contractors in these same exact positions for 5 plus years.

This is at the corporate offices of one of the largest, most profitable banks in the nation, whose CEO got a 5.5 million dollar bonus during the pandemic this year.

841,Full time jobs take up too much time for anything else,"I’m young 19 and honestly I just think to myself there is literally ZERO chance I can and will do this my whole life. I just walk through my job and see people making the same wage as me and they are in their 50s 60s all of that. I imagine how they feel because they probably have back pain leg pains all that and they still haven’t retired and yet some of them are there basically full time.

Now I have no problem with working full time I make good money and I pay for my car bill phone bill and a portion of the rent and my car ensurance. The problem isn’t working the problem is how much work takes up your actual life

I work for one of those grocerie store companies but anyways it’s just dumb how much working takes up your time like I’ll be scheduled 5 or 6 days straight and 2 days off. But sometimes they’ll finesse my schedule and work me 5 days farther to the end of the week and then they’ll work me the first day of the new week so basically I would work 6 days straight instead of 5 and it’s still just 40hrs per week. It’s basically like 80% work and the other %20 is spent thinking how tf imma get out of this work life. 

People always say certain things are “unrealistic” like wanting to actually go for your goal or passion, example : pro athlete, actor, singer, rapper, influencer and more. Honestly I’d rather go for my real goals and passions which could take a year or maybe more to reach instead of slaving for these huge companies for the rest of my life. Honestly I just want financial freedom and actual freedom, working for companies is more like they own you and you have to work around the schedule they make for you.

Like I have something on the side that I’m working on to turn into my main income but a lot of the time I never have time to work on it because once I get home at around 9:40 I’m already tired and ready to eat and chill for a bit then once I wanna work on it I’m too tired and then I fall asleep and wake up in the morning like welp gotta get ready for work again. And then when the off days come you always are thinking in the back of my head damn I have to work tomorrow. Regardless I’m just gonna grind on my side goal and once I make income from it enough to equal my wage now then I’ll quit working for another man for good

860,If they made primary school more the workplace...,"Some parts of primary school absolutely condition kids for a life of capitalism. Homework, unnatural waking hours, threat of being homeless in your future life if you don't do well... But what if we went even further with this? What would primary school look like? 

If we really want to condition kids to what life is like, first we need to start getting them up at 6am. Their school is over one hour away, with traffic, and even though school doesn't start till 8, their teachers expect them their at 7:45. They are made to feel bad if they show up at 8. 

The classrooms are grey and beige primarily. 

Every single day teachers have kids teach themselves out of a book in the same subjects year after year. If they have a question, the teacher acts like they are bothering them and makes the kids feel dumb. Passive aggressiveness is the main control mechanism. It is nailed into the kids heads that if they don't do well in school, they will be homeless as a direct consequence. 

There is no art. There is no gym. There is no music or extra curricular activities. Just books, reading, studying, and doing exercises from the book all day. Recess? They need to use their time more productively. Electives? Too much freedom. 

Kids don't speak to many people at lunch. In fact, the lunchroom is made specifically too small to accommodate everyone for building cost effectiveness. Most kids eat at their desk in silence. 

School hours are from 8am to 5pm with every other weekend. Kids are conditioned to feel guilty for leaving at 5pm on the dot and there is no more cheering when the final bell rings. They almost have to appear disappointed that it's all over with. Sometimes they're called in randomly at 7am on their Saturday off. There is no summer break, or any other breaks for that matter. The kids are given 1 week of holiday a year or 2 weeks if they've been in the school district more than three years. 

...

I am pretty sure most people would consider this kind of life soul sucking to children. They would go so far as go call it abusive and cruel. But it's literally what we go through every day on top of the other adult things like maintaining our living areas, paying bills, cooking, and other things we have to do day in and day out that eat up the rest of our adult lives.",False,m3952n,Trix_Rabbit,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/m3952n/if_they_made_primary_school_more_the_workplace/,0,1

All low/minimum wage earners stuck at their job and/or people who are comfortable at their job and want to help start applying at targeted businesses, crush the interview and the second interview up until the point of them offering you the position.

At this point, we all pause and inquire about the starting pay, and regardless of what they pay, we politely decline citing the pay being way too low and you will be taking another offer or staying at your current job.

If enough people did this, besides wasting their time and payroll extensively in the already costly hiring and training process, they would start to see that the rate that they pay isn’t enough to attracted anyone that they identified as talented enough to pass the interviews.

 So by supply and demand, they are not able to attract talent, and must slide the pay upwards until the position gets filled.  Due to opportunity cost, everyone is perceivably already being paid more at their current job or other offers to accept.

I literally spend 8 hours a day sitting at a desk copying and pasting and clicking buttons for shit pay. I'm a robot who, as far as I can tell, provides no real contribution to society. Words can't describe how menial and braindead it is. I couldn't find a job in my major after graduating last May and this is the best I could do.

&amp;#x200B;

But tomorrow, after months of applying, I finally have an interview with a super well known company (I probably shouldn't name it but it's probably easy to figure out) in a position that could lead to great opportunities down the road directly tied to my college major. I should be stoked, this is finally my chance to set my life back on track. Except, god damn, as shit as my work life is now, I know that if I get this job I'm going to hate it infinitely more. I'll have to work 13 hour overnight shifts 4 days per week, meaning I will never again have time or energy for anything other than work. I'll have to move away from my friends and family, so even on the three nights I have off (not weekends btw!), I'll have nobody to see and there sure as hell won't be anywhere open to go to. The work itself will be incredibly fast paced and high intensity, right now at least I get to sit at a desk all day but with this new job I don't know how I won't be constantly exhausted. I'll be managing other people, and given the reputation of this company I assume that means one of my primary tasks will be breathing down minimum wage workers' necks and cracking whips at them, something I don't agree with and would hate to be expected to do. I won't get holidays off and vacation time is the one benefit they leave out of their benefits webpage, so I'll get maybe a week or two if I'm really lucky.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this is to say, I hate this situation I'm stuck in. Like I said, the last year of my life has been miserable and hopeless thanks to my current job and acing this interview means a huge advance in my career with a large pay increase to go with it. But I just know that if I get offered this job, I'll have to take it, but my life will also only get worse with it. Maybe the best outcome here is if I just don't get offered the job, and continue being a braindead low-pay robot.

The wealthy only own everything because they invaded sovereign lands and stole it through murder and genocide.

That is not a claim any decent human being should respect. 

If someone only wants to pick flowers and make art for themselves all day, society should support them to do so. 

That is true autonomy. That is true freedom.

She’s an accountant for one of the richest families in Michigan.  They have so much wealth to keep track of, that they employ an office of twelve people to manage it all year long.

Most of what her job entails is moving hundreds of millions of dollars in money and investments around to try and help these fat cats dodge taxes.  She also has the fun job of telling their trust fund kids that they exceeded their $60,000 spending limit for the month.

She has an alright income rate from all of this, and solid job security, but the extra things they make her do are abhorrent for people who have so much.

Every tax season, she and her coworkers have to work all weekend, every weekend for two months on their own time.
No overtime.
All to try and do some extra manipulation and heavy lifting to make sure these richies pay as little in taxes as possible.

How did we get to a place in society where our ability to live became so closely tied to how much we could do for others?

I hope that one day we can rely on machines to do enough work that we can create a utopia where people can choose whether to work and choose what to work on and when because all of our basic needs are met without anyone *having* to work.

911,What are your plans?,"I know most of us want to stop working, or possibly change jobs or the nature of work, but what realistic and achievable plans do you have in place to make that happen? And I'm talking about a realistic and viable plan and concrete steps toward that end. So if your plan is ""I want to overthrow the entire system"", that's admirable, but in order for this to be a meaningful discussion, I'd like to hear about the concrete actions you are taking or planning to take and how those will bring it about and what would you do with your life when that plan has come into fruition.

I'd like to know because maybe we can share our ideas, discuss those ideas, help other realize their goals and maybe just support each other.

I realize that people here come from different places in their lives and what may seem like a viable path for someone may not be even within the realm of possibilities for another. But maybe we can actually help each other, so even if you are struggling with minimum wage and just being able to put food on the table or pay rent, maybe we can come up with a plan so that the future isn't quite so bleak. 

My situation is, in short, this: I grew up poor. I went to school and landed what people consider a cushy corporate job. I worked hard for it and the payoff is actually pretty lousy and soul-sucking, not to mention the damage it has done to me mentally and physically. 

I've calculated that I need to save up (take risk in stocks) to the tune of about about $500k so that I can retire and live in a hut in the middle of nowhere and generate just enough in dividends to buy electricity and food. 

While I understand that that is capitalism and it might perpetuate the problem we all have here, I don't see any other viable option for me. I'm not able to bring about the social, economic or political change in a short enough amount of time that I could achieve my goal in the time frame I want, i.e. about the next ten years. However, if enough of us corporate tools get out before a ""normal"" retirement age, maybe that will also bring about some change.

So I save as much as I can so that I can get about a pretax income from capital alone of about $25k, which leaves me with north of about $1500 per month after taxes. 

I want my children to go to university and study something they care about and not something they think will benefit them in a corporate setting. I don't want them in a corporate setting at all and I just want them to be able to do what they like and live free. 

My hut is not some majestic mansion, just a hut in the middle of the forest. Electricity, but no indoor plumbing.

I've asked people around me who say they want to be rich about how much money exactly do they want. Most of the time I hear some unachievable round number like $10 million, and they're always shocked to hear that my goal is 5% of that. 

I want to be free, not filthy rich.

916,Full time jobs take up too much time for anything else :(,"I’m young 19 and honestly I just think to myself there is literally ZERO chance I can and will do this my whole life. I just walk through my job and see people making the same wage as me and they are in their 50s 60s all of that. I imagine how they feel because they probably have back pain leg pains all that and they still haven’t retired and yet some of them are there basically full time.

Now I have no problem with working full time I make good money and I pay for my car bill phone bill and a portion of the rent and my car ensurance. The problem isn’t working the problem is how much work takes up your actual life

I work for one of those grocerie store companies but anyways it’s just dumb how much working takes up your time like I’ll be scheduled 5 or 6 days straight and 2 days off. But sometimes they’ll finesse my schedule and work me 5 days farther to the end of the week and then they’ll work me the first day of the new week so basically I would work 6 days straight instead of 5 and it’s still just 40hrs per week. It’s basically like 80% work and the other %20 is spent thinking how tf imma get out of this work life. 

People always say certain things are “unrealistic” like wanting to actually go for your goal or passion, example : pro athlete, actor, singer, rapper, influencer and more. Honestly I’d rather go for my real goals and passions which could take a year or maybe more to reach instead of slaving for these huge companies for the rest of my life. Honestly I just want financial freedom and actual freedom, working for companies is more like they own you and you have to work around the schedule they make for you.

Like I have something on the side that I’m working on to turn into my main income but a lot of the time I never have time to work on it because once I get home at around 9:40 I’m already tired and ready to eat and chill for a bit then once I wanna work on it I’m too tired and then I fall asleep and wake up in the morning like welp gotta get ready for work again. And then when the off days come you always are thinking in the back of my head damn I have to work tomorrow. Regardless I’m just gonna grind on my side goal and once I make income from it enough to equal my wage now then I’ll quit working for another man for good

918,Those coworkers who are oblivious to how bad their situation is. What's the deal with these people?,"It's just like the Gervais Principle in the Office. I really believe the top and the bottom are most similar, where middle management are a bit of a thing of their own.

I don't have a bad attitude at all, I am lucky to have a decent middle class job that's usually 40 hours a a week. 

There's one person at my work. They are essentially a middle management level person. A real ""company man/woman""

To be totally blunt, their personal life is a bit of a mess. They are older and divorced, with no kids. This is by far the best job they had in their life - they were a fast food manager before. Again, nothing wrong with an attitude of gratitude. It's somebody who...legitimately would rather be working. 

But this person is so fucking irritating to work with. 

* Is way too enthusiastic, doesn't understand boundaries. If there's an email thread going, she'll absolutely reply after hours. It sets a horrible standard. 
* Doesn't realize how badly they are getting screwed. They are the point person if there's an emergency. If there's a safety issue at 5AM on a Saturday, they are the person that's called. The craziest thing is...they see this as a point of pride and importance, not as a burden
* Works WAY harder than literally anyone. But they aren't close to being the highest paid person. I don't even think they're in it for a living, so to speak. This job is basically their whole identity. 
* Has a shocking lack of perspective. Again, this job is really one of the only things they've done with their life. But I think they are the type to not respect other people who may not want to work as hard.

This people's life is just sad, to me.

I think they don't realize how shitty work it, because they haven't been able to enjoy the legitimately great things in life

* Spending time with friends and family you love
* Shit like travelling and surfing and smoking good weed!

922,"""There is no money. There is no hope.""","I work as a contract employee for a credit card company (I won't say which one, but it's a big one).  My department is Image Processing: when you need to send any kind of paperwork or digital image to a credit card company for whatever reason, be it a response to a bill, a credit dispute, or a photo of your driver's license as proof of your identity, we're the people who see it and enter the relevant information into the company's database.  We are not customer-facing so no, we're not the ones you deal with when you call.  We are also in no way responsible for any of the decisions that are made regarding your accounts or debts.

One of the categories of mail I see every day are letters from cardmembers who say they are unable to pay their bill for whatever reason.  It's not my job to read or respond, I just flatten out each letter and batch it for scanning so that higher-ups can call up a digital image of your letter in future dealings.  But sometimes I just can't help catch a few phrases and sentences here and there.

The other day I saw a handwritten note on a cardmember's bill, stating that the cardmember was 85 years old, in hospice care from an illness, on meager fixed income, and thus no longer able to pay what they owed us.  The note was actually written by this person's daughter who was now responsible for taking care of them.  At the end of the note, she simply wrote,

""There is no money.

There is no hope.""

In that moment, I had a breakdown.  For the next 20 minutes I couldn't function.  Here I am, working for a company that's demanding money from people who can't pay, people who are old and frail, unable to care for themselves anymore, families who can't afford to take care of their elderly parents, all because companies like the one I work for trapped them into contracts that guarantee this sort of outcome.  I also came to the realization that, more likely than not, that's going to be me in the future, with no money, and no hope.

Yesterday we watched a video from the company's CEO in which he boasted about how we've increased our profits and broke records and had our best year ever.

944,Working and/or studying just to feel like you are doing something productive,"Rant ahead. Like so many others, I lost my job due to covid. The thing is I really liked my job. I worked in several different theatres, my work was really artistic and it’s a big part of who I am as a person. I worked hard to get where I am and poof, covid happens and all the theatres close. 

I have been struggling a lot lately. The days just pass by, and I can’t decide what to do. I wake up and start thinking what should I do today, and end up just getting really anxious or depressed and end up doing nothing! 

I feel like I want to be productive and do or learn something everyday. I want to find some part time job or get some commission works. I feel like I should go back to school to study another degree (even though I already studied for 6+ years and found my dream job at the same field), just so I can go back to work. 

But the fact is that most days I just watch tv, mostly TLC, you know te mind numbing stuff, nap, maybe take short walks, water and prune my plants, eat good food and maybe drink some wine. 
And even thought I’m struggling with not being productive and active, I also love just being home and ”not doing anything”. 

And yesterday I finally realised that maybe it’s Ok not to do anything. Maybe I don’t need to better myself everyday. I don’t need to find another job just to fill my days with work. Maybe it’s just Ok to wait for the pandemic to pass and theatres to reopen. I’m struggling a little bit financially but otherwise I’m starting to feel quite stress free. 

Thanks for reading this far!

945,"Mid 20's, really struggling with work","Hey guys,
I almost found it comforting to find this sub reddit and read that other people felt the same as me...

I need some help and advice. 
I'm 24, I've worked since I was 16. I've always worked in the same field, with children, and I absolutely love it, it's incredibly rewarding.
Unfortunately due to severe depression, PTSD and a lot of trauma I struggle to hold myself together week after week, month after month. I find myself just pushing through each day, crashing after work and in weekends just wanting to hide away. 

Recently I had to take 3 weeks off sick via my doctor while my new dose of antidepressants kicked in. I was at rock bottom and very suicidal and I'd cry each morning as I tried to get ready for work.

At this point I'm thinking whether it's better for me to switch my whole career path and just work a part time BS office job to get by or just give in and sign up for any mental health benefits I could possibly have right to to help me if I decide to leave work.
I cant imagine how I'd pay rent and bills and live my life if I'm not earning any money.

954,My boss lied to me and thinks I can't read,"Another rant I couldn't help but post here. Recently I requested that I be able to skip take my lunch break at work. I asked for this for a few reasons. The first reason is that my lunch break is constantly interrupted. I'm a warehouse worker and I am responsible for receiving and loading large shipments off of trucks. The issue is that these trucks always show up around my allotted lunch time. Nobody else is able to work the forklift so I am literally the only person who can take care of this. So, at least twice a week if not more during busy season I have to stop my lunch and process these shipments. The second reason is that my commute is a solid 45 minutes each way, and I work an 8.5 hr day. This means that if traffic is average or bad I'm spending an average of 10 hrs a day away from home. If I don't take my lunch and just took 5-15 minutes to eat, I could be home a solid half hour earlier to the woman I love. Ultimately I realize this is a personal request and not everyone has the luck to even ask this of their employer, but I dared to ask anyways. I would've taken a straight no for an answer without issue. I take issue when my boss not only side stepped my request, but lied to me as if I wouldn't be able to fact check them. I sent them a direct email. They didn't respond to me so, I asked a coworker who had more direct contact to tell them to check their email and respond to me. My boss had the audacity to not even respond to me through my email or by phone, but instead, responded to a separate coworker who gave me their response. It essentially amounted to no you can't do that I want you here until the last minute to make sure the place is in order every day. We'll whatever right? Nope they kept going stating that law required me to take lunch and it was out of their hands. Except, I had looked up both state and federal law before asking to make sure that it would be a problem for this exact reason. I looked at evey possible credible source and found no such requirement on either a state or federal level. No other person at my workplace lives more than 10 minutes away. Having worked for this company for 5 years, I figure maybe the boss would give me this little leeway so that I could not only have the annoyance of interrupted work-through lunches removed, but also get home to my dear a little earlier in the evening. But no, I'll go fuck myself because my boss thinks I can't read between the lines and take no like an adult. Fuck them and fuck the people who spew shit hrough their teeth like they do I'm so fucking sick of being treated like a middle schooler at work.

964,UBI and Assured Housing will just lead to serfdom if we aren't careful,"I know a lot of people on this sub really like the idea of UBI and assured housing to remove the violence of capitalist society.  However, when thinking of this, it's even more important to use logic to get through this situation.

**Why would your torturer put down the lash if not to pick up a worse tool to hurt you with?**

Serfdom was actually a pretty good deal for it's time.  'Free' land to till, your lord's armies and walls would protect your family from bandits, and your lord would even throw you parties out of appreciation (yup, pizza parties are that old).  Did I mention they worked an average of 3 days a week?

Thing is, this was back when the elites of society were basically dying from the same things we were and not even living that much more comfortably than peasants. Plus there wasn't that much of a technological gap between swords and ploughshares.

This is the best case scenario for UBI/assured housing and it doesn't have a chance of happening.  Modern elites are used to being able to extract 20x-1000x the profit for something they pay for, you can bet your ass they'll be doing that if they're 'giving you' a stipend and a place to stay.  3 Days?  How about 7, you now live at your job.

We don't even have to imagine this, there was a very good post on here that was unfortunately deleted where the person detailed being offered ""free housing"" by an employer, who then verbally abused them, forced them to build countless projects on their property, and even asked their work to scale back their hours to do more unpaid tasks for them at home.

**Yang and Musk are sus**

When an elite is talking about UBI or assured housing it should send a chill down your spine.  They do not have the same needs as you or I.  Even the most well intentioned politicians are brought up to the status of elite once they win their election.  They will never worry about being hungry, their resume will assure them some form of advisory role in some company for more than you will make in your lifetime just because of their role in society.  When they hamstring their campaign promises, when they sabotage their constituency, when the only Elites who can say anything that would actually fix our issues are too weak to do anything, that isn't them being stupid or incompetent, *it is part of the plan*.  Please don't be dense, there really is no such thing as a free lunch under capitalist society.  

**We will need some form of assured resources, housing, etc, to remove the violence from capitalism, but it must be taken from the ruling class, that power must be physically removed from the hands of the ruling class and placed in our control or we will never be sure what we are giving up in the short or long term.**",False,ly8n1v,capnbarky,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ly8n1v/ubi_and_assured_housing_will_just_lead_to_serfdom/,22,53
965,Anyone ever just wonder what the point of life is under the current economic/work system?,"Without getting too bleak or anything, does anyone wonder what the point of this whole existence is if you're literally working for the most part of your life?

Get up at 7, work starts at 9 (if you're lucky), ends at 5 (if you're lucky), then you're home at around 6 or so (again, if you're lucky). Repeat daily until you're an old man/woman. Is this it, then? The wage slavery, literally just surviving and not living or doing anything meaningful for a decent amount of time that it actually matters, anyway.

2 weeks off in entire year if you're in North America, which is an absolute joke. I know it's different in Europe and some Middle Eastern countries like UAE where you get 4, but still. Wtf does one even do with 2 weeks a year? You can't explore the world, can barely explore the country you're in.

Another absolutely annoying thing is the Sunday night anxiety, which is what I'm basically feeling right now and why I'm writing this post I guess. What tomorrow holds. Do this, do that. Will they ask me to do this? Damn, how am I supposed to do this again? Oh, I really hope I don't have to work beyond 6 again.

So, again..what is the point of this? If I'm being brutally honest unless you've gotten your financial freedom (which is ridiculously hard unless you have some super unique talent or something) and certainly isn't as simple as these ""bro just invest!!"" guys on YouTube make it out to be, wtf is this all about? I honestly rather live in a 2nd world country, work part time and just become a minimalist. Lower cost of living, work 20 hours a week or so and have somewhat of my freedom.

Human relationships- talking to people for the sake of talking to them and not for the sake of using them- is regarded as strange, silly, and useless. Why is it that all relationships in life must come with the underlying understanding that you're just using one-another? Why can't I hang out with my professors, my former bosses, my acquaintances, etc. just because they're interesting people, rather than because they have more ""cOnNeCtIoNs"" than I do? Why can't I befriend coworkers because it's human nature to be social, not so we can use each other for career purposes in the future?

I miss talking to people without the underlying understanding that we're using one-another.

When I was fired I received snarky comments from middle class, and not even upper middle class people. I got blamed and told it was my own fault for being homeless and people that said that implied that it was so easy to get a high paying job in America. 

The same ones that were saying this were often lying about how much money they made, bragged to me and other people about how much money they made and then in the same breathe would freak out if they had to spent over $200 for emergency costs. I noticed that a lot of middle class people pretend like their rich or close to being rich when that's not the case at all. It's like they delude themselves into thinking their going to be rich in a few months.

I have a pretty high paying job as of now and live comfortably, but I still constantly think about how I was treated when I was homeless by people that weren't even that financially well off either.

Working fulltime 50+ weeks a year was too much of a drain on my soul and was the probable cause of my depression. Three years ago I quit my job, moved into my sedan, and left the state.

Despite the hardships of homelessness I am much happier with the extra free time and my depression has lifted. When I do have to work at least there is a light at the end of the tunnel to look forward to.

1018,"Want a family, dread the daily grind.","Just found this subreddit after a long trip down a reddit rabbit hole. I already love all of you. I've struggled with the concept of work for as long as I can remember. My dad always came home from work grumpy and tired, and I never had a good relationship with him because of it. Didn't really wanna be around him when he was grumpy. Later on I came to admire him for doing it because I obviously knew he wasn't doing it for himself if it drained him so much, but I came to fear adulthood because I wanted to 100% be there for my future family. Every year is more stressful than the last because I fear the day I fall into the daily grind and lose myself. I don't want to become like my father, but I also desperately want to have a family. 

Fast forward to now, I'm 27, and up until a couple years ago when I got married, I was doing part time school part time work. For the last few years my wife has been working putting me through college (with the expectation that I would eventually get a job because we both want kids and she wants to be a stay at home mom). The last few semesters were extremely taxing on my mental health, and after failing every single class for two semesters in a row, my wife and I decided I'll take a break from school for a year and focus on learning things that I want to learn (video game development). That has helped tremendously, and I admire my wife even more for the support she has given me. If I could make enough money for a family by making games, by myself, not having to deal with coworkers, managing my own time, doing what I want to, having full creative control with my projects, I would be living the life.

But once again, I've started fearing that I'll fail (which might be a separate topic in and of itself), and I'm dreading the potential future of needing to suck it up and get a ""normal job"" for my family. Don't get me wrong, I would do it. I love my wife, and I know I'll love my future children and I'd do anything for her and them. But man... It sucks.

I guess I don't even know why I'm typing this out. I'm so lacking of sleep due to stress, this might be a cry for advice from people who find themselves in a similar situation, who knows. If anything I find a deep comfort in knowing there's a large group of people who feel the same about work.

in an interdisciplinary environment that encourages critical
feminist exploration addressing intersecting of gender and
sexuality with race, class, nation, religion, and a wide range of
social justice issues. The WGSS program at Northeastern
University (www.northwestern.ed/was) has a vagrant feminist
community, an active undergraduate minor, and an established
graduate certificate program. He collaborate closely with the
Graduate Consortium in Tender, Culture, Women, and Sexuality
(GCWS), a group of nine area institutions of higher education,
house at MIT. Northeastern and the WGSS program are the
editorial home of Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society
(http://www.signsjournal.org).

Visiting Scholars provide their own financial support during the
presidency, though the program ma

Scholars will have access to the Northeastern University
library and to shared workplace (so long as public health protocol
permits) as well as email privileges and are invited to participate in
all program events and to collaborate with colleagues through
research clusters, reading groups, a feminist writing collective, and
affiliated seminary. He connect each scholar with a faculty liaison
to help integrate them into the feminist community on camps and
in Boston in
the Spring smelter in one of the following areas: Introduction to
WGSS; Tender, Social Justice, and Transnational Activist digital
Feminisms; Ex, Tender, and Top Culture; and Tender and
Sexuality in World History. Applicant who are interested in
teaching should indicate this in their cover letter and should
include a teaching statement and sample syllabus along with the
materials listed below.

  

Scholars are expected to give a public presentation to the
Northeastern camps community and the public on their going

1038,"I feel like I understand ""bad"" people more","Yes I'm being overdramatic... But after working fulltime for almost a half a year I can understand why people turn to drugs to feel good again when they have no time to pursue what makes them happy, why people steal to get enough money/resources to survive to avoid working more hours, why people suddenly do something violent after finally snapping from all the stress and pressure. I feel like I'm going to lose it every Monday. I only feel slight joy on my Fridays but I want to feel that all 7 days of my week again. Every time I've tried a new position in hopes to find something that'll make me feel better, it's actually worse. I have no clue how people can keep up with work expectations, pay enough attention to details to avoid mistakes, and feel okay enough to be stuck in a building all day. I hear things like drink coffee if you're tired, oh it was nice to get some sun, wasn't the drive here just beautiful... And I just can't understand them so much. We should have more than 2 days of being under the sun, we shouldn't rely on accelerants to have energy, and don't you want to enjoy nature longer than during a 20 minute drive?? Just... I'm so frustrated in where I am, I think I want to do my own thing... But I don't HAVE my own thing.

1039,Rant: my company has an annual bonus program to “incentivize you”,"So, like others have said here, we have an annual bonus program that is actually not half bad, but, there is a catch. They add up your hours of “availability” then run it through an equation, so, for example, let’s say you got sick a few times, took three whole days of funeral leave, had to take another week off for surgery, got COVID, and FOLLOWED health department guidelines to keep your actual coworkers safe and healthy, and your year end quote “availability” was only 85% even though you accepted plenty of OT shifts throughout the year, then, because of their little number crunch equating, you lose 60% of your bonus. 

How does that “incentivize” a person at all? It 100% incentivizes you to come in to work sick, break pandemic protocol, miss your Grandfathers funeral, and come back to work high on pain pills from having delivered a baby last week. Are these people for real? 

This is my first year ever I will have ever gotten a year end bonus. Last year I got one for 2019, but I was hired in June, so I only got half a years worth. Which was still pretty nice.   

2020 happened. I worked all year through the pandemic, a lot of employees got to work from home, but my job is essential. We are happy to get a bonus this year because the business was down quite a bit, but, no matter. This year I had a funeral, missed three shifts due to quarantine rules, had surgery, and called out twice. Due to a whole 2.5 weeks out, I’ll be losing like 20% of the bonus I think. I don’t see the incentive though. 

This year I’m pregnant, and will be taking 12 weeks off. And I’m happy about that, whatever. But, I’ll be out for so long I probably will get zero dollars for 2021 bonus. I definitely could take 6-8 weeks off, but, the bonus would still be so small I don’t see the point! There is no actual incentive.  

The only “incentive” I can see in the entire company, is some higher up, VP, who gets like a 20% bonus (since I’m hourly, and a lowly worker I get like 7%) who has a kid, he will totally show up for work the next day after baby is born, in order to keep his bonus. And, honestly, he just pushes paper all day, doesn’t really make product.

1045,Recommended reading about corporate culture?,"Hi all,

Just joined the sub. I've recently read David Graeber's book Bullshit Jobs and am reading my way through some Mark Fisher.

I work in a corporation - a well-known UK bank. I was fascinated by Graeber's anthropological breakdowns of corporate culture - e.g. glossy printed reports that go unread being a mere prop to demonstrate the manager's power and prestige in a meeting, his/her hosts of analysts providing little more than a retinue to show off his/her status.  


I am fascinated to read more such analyses of what I have always instinctively seen as surreal, bizarre corporate rituals that don't seem to do anything more than signal status and power struggles. Does anyone have any recommended reading? Anthropological / sociological especially...

When we take time off NOT on a holiday, we use a SUPER negative word for it.

1062,I fully support antiwork but my parents keep freaking out.,"I am a 22 year old guy who has graduated from a top college in India. I had a job that paid me way above an average salary but I quit it after a few months because I just didn't want to work at all (there was also a personal incident at home). I have been living at my parent's home since lockdown and I was working from home.

After I quit my job, my parents completely supported my decision because they trust me. I wanted to take a long break after leaving the job so that I didn't have to work. I wanted to work on algotrading so that I could do something that can make money and required less manual labor. I told my parents that I will be working on this project for some time and I will start looking for a job after I am done with this project. 

But the thing is, I started taking it easy and took a lot of times(3 Months) and the project still isn't finished. Now after a month or two, my parents started freaking out. Thinking that if this keeps going on, it will make a huge gap on my resume and I will not be able to get a job. This happens every week now, my parents just start freaking out and start pushing me to find a job or else I will never be able to find one. I get that their concerns are valid in their positions and they are just thinking about my job safety and better future out of love but I don't really think that it is a good idea to just rush into job-slavery which my parents want me to do. If I had a choice, I would live my life without doing any job, but I guess I have to get a job or else my parents will keep stressing themselves out and as a result, will keep stressing me out.

Do you guys face similar issues? Should I abandon my project and just start looking for a job?

1064,Antisocial culture will kill us all,"I'm not even exaggerating.  I understand that not everyone wants to go to parties, dance around in clubs, and go to family gatherings, but hear me out.

Humans as animals fucking suck.  We spent literally millions of years getting hunted by better animals.  We only really have two beneficial weapons in a stone age world.  We are really good at collecting stuff, and we are able to work together.  Forget the big brain shit because it literally doesn't even matter until we can get those two skills down.

The only reason we are where we are at is because we learned to cooperate, because we were friendly enough to have other humans to watch our ass and do the things we weren't as good at.  I'm a big lefty but currency had a big hand in this.  See, humans don't have the brain power to actually have that many social connections, it caps off between 100-150 maximum, which is a pretty small community.  You can't actually do very much with only a couple hundred people, you can't have sophisticated sewage systems, and you can't have scientific research.

This changed with technological advancements, starting with bartering systems, currencies like gold, and eventually fiat currencies like dollars.  What this represents isn't the development of capitalism, but a necessary development of systems that would allow for collaboration across many different 100-150 sized social groups.  

Now in the modern era we have been so propagandized by a bourgeois society that we have almost entirely replaced socialization with the technology of currency exchange and it is killing us.  This is because doing that only works if you are already at the top of the system.  A rich person is fundamentally different from you and I.  They have so much money that they don't go shopping, they pay someone to do it for them.  They don't manage their own money, they pay someone to do it for them.  Of you are rich you can completely replace your social system with a system of paying people, and you can do this until you die.

The rest of us *literally cannot do this*.  If you do not maintain social connections you will be taken advantage of and robbed.  You probably will not ever have enough money to sustain a lifestyle of replacing all of your social connections with monetary ones.

This is why the system is so sinister, you will see your capitalist live like this, replacing the effort needed in creating social relationships with the almighty dollar, they will say that one day you can be like them.  You may go all in, replacing time spent socializing which would give you a sincere, stable support structure for an opportunity to replace it with money.  They will take and take and take your time while you chase that dream, until you eventually fall short, are too old to build that support structure, with your body too frail to take care of yourself, and you will die, having done nothing with your life except make your boss rich.

I had a business in the past and in the beginning stages I wore every single hat from accounting to social media management and it can be exhausting to force yourself to close your laptop for the day and not answer emails because sometimes you feel like you just haven’t done enough or there isn’t enough time in the day to get all of your work done. Even when you’re no longer in the start up phase, you’re still devoting so much of your time to working, which for some people may be fine if you’re “doing what you love” but even people who work their dream jobs aren’t walking on rainbows everyday they go into work. 

As an entrepreneur sometimes the pressure is on 10x’s as much because YOU’RE the one that has to pull yourself out of bed so you can pay your bills, feed your family and live a comfortable life. So many influencers and entrepreneurs nowadays glamorize entrepreneurship like being able to sleep in until 12 or they’re always in Hawai’i like sure there’s perks but there are a lot more entrepreneurs that are sacrificing time with family to make sure their business runs smoothly so they can keep up their self-employed lifestyle so they don’t have to go back to working a 9-5.

Sorry I really just had to get that off of my chest. I’m just so annoyed of hearing people say “Oh you’re sick of working a 9-5? Start a business”, “Don’t like your retail job? Monetize your hobby!” The answer to our capitalist system is NOT always entrepreneurship! And to be honest it’s not for everyone, it’s hard work! Instead of resorting to forcing entrepreneurship down people’s throats support causes and ideas that promote a society where everyone can live comfortably without having to hustle outside of their day job.",False,m06oxd,extracaramelfrap,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/m06oxd/i_really_wish_people_would_stop_glamorizing/,3,1

it’s so ridiculous to me the way they care so much. it’s like they’re brainwashed. they get angry and talk shit about customers that say no to the card. they complain about it all day. the managers are so miserable 

i’ve gotten zero cards total, with 3 applications denied which probably hurt their credit score bc it’s a hard pull. i don’t even care that i don’t have any tbh. they want us to ask each person 3 times if they say no the first 2 times

My coworkers will go on and on and have an hour long meeting about the dumbest, most minuscule bullshit ever. We literally had a 45 minute meeting about the best format to use for presentation slides. I've never so badly wanted to physically rip my hair out of my head. We're living through a literal pandemic with over 500,000 dead, so it just feels like I'm surrounded by a bunch of corporate sociopaths when this is the shit we choose to focus on. They act like we're god damn paramedics sometimes. 

The reality I don't know why the hell I was put on this Earth - and if it was to do this shit, I'd like to speak to the big guy upstairs, or whoever the fuck is in charge. Because this shit sucks. 

I'd love to have a job where I feel like I'm actually helping people - but the trade off is that most non-profit jobs wouldn't support me financially to be able to live in my city near my family.

Every animal starts its day when the sun is up and ends when it is dark, they eat, fly, run, chill, think, play and live in harmony with nature.   
The man starts his day when the sun isn’t up yet, throws himself in a shower and drives a small lethal machine to get to a place where he is stuck and only quits after the sunset.   
The man’s life is perfectly designed to never enjoy the sunlight, the wind, the trees and live in harmony with nature.   
Staring at a screen for 8+ hours a day is what many people consider a goal but in reality is just a synthetic reality where you barely live.   
You stay up late in the night and completely change your own biorhythm just to have that small bit of free time to enjoy something outside work and the next day here we go again.   
I’m so tired of pretending my life is just this, just a screen and worrying that the company isn’t making any sales as if I’d have any benefit from that.   
I envy people that have free time, not the rich one. I couldn’t care less to own a BMW or a huge house, I just want free time and the basic needs to be fulfilled, is that much to ask?   
Is it worth it? An entire life staring at a screen just to afford a living?   
Is it so much to ask for a hot meal everyday and a shelter?   
No one should fucking starve and dedicate their own life just to afford a soup of noodles.   
What are the alternatives? They took everything away from us! Owning a land is now a privilege that few can afford, the entire system works by keeping you inside those 9-5 endlessly and making sure you won’t make any spiritual jump in your life because if that happens you may start doing crazy things like taking time for yourself instead of grinding for that Yacht the boss wants.   
They own every right on you: 

* You have to ask to take time for yourself
* You have to be there if your manager calls you 
* You are being threaten to lose your job if you don’t exceed the expectations 
* You must be happy to work 
* You must have a smile on your face because we don’t want sad faces here.
* What? You quit at 5 o’clock? I see you don’t care enough! 
* Everyone is over-doing just because it’s a fucking challenge how much I can resist before breaking

What is this? Is this life? This is legalised slavery.   
And while you slave-wage there’s that influencer that is making 100x of what you do just by posting an ad on their instagram page.   
Can you imagine that?   
Working hard never pays off. NEVER.   
It’s a scam that many of us fell into. That is not according to nature laws tho, that’s why life is synthetic.   
If you work endlessly on your land you’ll have more food to sustain yourself. Of course there may be adverse conditions but this is exactly what LIFE is.   
Life is not stillness, life is not an Instagram post, life is not wage-slaving for a piece of bread.   
We tricked us into thinking that if we don’t have something stable we won’t make it, we fear the changes that may destroy our crop and make us starve… but we forget we are giving up our freedom for security and safety.

1091,Working isn't bad on its own. Exploitation is.,"I'd like to get a conversation started on this matter. 



While I agree with the sentiment that work can be a drag and a hinderance working is still prefered to the alternative.




If we look at this from an economics perspective here is what we have.



GDP is the total value of goods and services produced in an economy over a given period of time.


If people work less then assuming everything else the same, there are less goods or services being offered in an economy. Which means the private consumption of them diminishes. 




Which in turn makes businesses lay off staff since they no longer need as many people working there. 




That in turn pushes for a weaker demand in the economy. Less sales mean a negative forecast and less need for workers which increases unemployment.




All of this is capitalisms fault you might say. Well capitalism is vastly preferred to the alternative. There are academic studies that have followed the evolution of GDP per capita (in power purchasing parities) during centuries and concluded no other economy has had such a sustained and expressive growth as capitalists economies have.





Which means when capitalism works everyone gets richer and they get richer compared to economies that haven't implemented capitalism. And that is proven its not my opinion.





Furthermore when you start increasing the demands for businesses to operate in they will hire less people (the harder it is to fire the less people will be hired since businesses can antecipate the legal hardships) which in turn increases unemployment. And if working was bad not receiving any income is worse.



It seems that most people on this sub don't hate work as much as they hate working in a toxic environment. Or working in a place that doesn't fulfill them in a significant matter.



You don't hate working, you hate your job.






Does the system need to change? Yes. Is it by abolishing capitalism? No.",False,m1lhvk,bettingdenegerate,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/m1lhvk/working_isnt_bad_on_its_own_exploitation_is/,70,1

1094,Burning out from college. Feel like a loser now if I were to drop out and do a trade or something.,"If I say how much I feel about not liking college in another typical kind of sub about college, I’d probably just get told to “suck it up”. Or, “you don’t have it as hard as I did!”. 

They tell you that you have to do shit you don’t like because that shows employers that you are a capable person - doing mentally taxing work and spending an unfavorable amount of time doing it. Or that it “prepares you”. Yeah, preparing me for more miserableness in the future. 

They tell you that you should get these higher paying jobs (like STEM) so you can live more comfortably. Sure, more money is good. But is the effort even worth it in the first place though? 

I’ve been spinning my wheels in college for almost 4 years, and I’m like not even half way to be able to get an associates yet (my fault completely). The further time I have left and added on difficulty of progressively more difficult courses to take gives me dread. 

I feel like a loser compared to other people in their 20s. I still live with my parents, going to school and might end up going until I get a bachelor’s, which would be when I’m like fucking 27 years old. That’s like 22 years STRAIGHT of going to school. This is hellish. I feel like a loser for wanting to drop out and just do a trade that doesn’t stress me out mentally. I can take physical stress much easier. There’s already tons of people in their early 20s living independently and some people right around my age already about to graduate. I’m like the kid who got held back a billion years.

1122,The myth of being a high performer at work,"It is said that in order to get a raise, an employee must do more than what they are paid. Although this sounds like it makes sense, I think that’s not how it works in most workplaces. For one thing, I’ve yet to work at a job where just the amount of work and effort one needs to complete it is just right-There’s either an overwhelming amount of work, making completing it an impossible achievement in and of itself, let alone excelling in it; or jobs that require minimal effort to complete, and people just sit around 80% of the day- which in most cases, are those sinking ship companies where they aren’t gonna invest in raises and growth anyway. In the first case, excelling at the job is impossible, where in the second case, pointless. 

I think performance has more to do with playing the power game right, rather than actual performance. The notion of “doing more than what you are paid for” benefits those on the top, but not necessarily the worker, especially when excelling at a job is a requirement rather than something actual high performers are rewarded extra for. 
In reality, most who give it 100% every day are simply “doing their job”, while those who have realistic expectations for work are considered to be slackers. 

Ideally, a job should only require 60-70% of effort to complete, with the remaining 30-40% reserved for employees to think, rest, reflect, plan, cover for a colleague on leave, or to willingly work harder if they want to go after a promotion. You simply can’t exceed expectations when you’re expected to give it 100% every single day.",False,lxaiqz,thelacklustregatsby,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lxaiqz/the_myth_of_being_a_high_performer_at_work/,9,20
1123,Who am I to judge,"I am a father of four children. For years I observed the mental struggles my kids had to go through and I could not understand why. They were growing up in the wealthiest society in history so why were they constantly depressed? Like most parents I accused them of laziness. Of arrogance typical of a generation which had everything. I accused them of being unthankful. Being spoiled. But I was wrong. 

I saw the world with eyes that were not my own. What did I see? 

In the year 2020, we witnessed the death of religion, socialism, communism, capitalism, and every other “ism” out there. Family was an outdated concept. Friendships were outsourced to Facebook. Hospitality was a business called AirBnB. Love was Tinder. Every aspect of our lives had been commercialized, and it reflected in our motto: consumption is the meaning of life. 

Personal pleasure equalled happiness. Smartphones were vectors for a new common illness for the modern human called depression. 

In a world of President Trump, TikTok celebrities, Instagram models, YouTube influencers, wokeness, gate-keeping, performative activism, snowflakes, simps, memes, NPC’s, public apologies, live streaming, Snapchat stories, upvotes, retweets, Avengers, and superhero sequels, everything had to be “super:” Super models, super stars, super strength, superfoods, transhumanism, self-love, yoga, meditation, food porn, violence porn, corruption, fake news, knockoff clothing, deep fakes, perverse wealth, millions of books and videos titled *10 Easy Steps to Get Your Life Back on Track.* Creativity was at a standstill, with nothing in production except movie remakes, movie adaptations, movie sequels, song remixes, song covers, song parodies.

1140,Ethics of passive income,"So I really wanted to add to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gak6zt/what_up_fire_folk/fp1ep6v/) comment thread because I disagree with the upvote/downvote distribution, but the post is archived, so hecc, I guess I'll make a new post :'D

It doesn't really make sense to me why writing a book and getting royalties would be any more ethical than investing money in the stock market and getting dividends.
In the case of publishing a book, you put in the work up front to write a book which enables workers who assemble and distribute books something to sell. You sit back and collect a portion of the earnings while they do the ongoing work.
In the case of investing in the stock market, you put in the work up front to earn the money you invest, which is used to build the means of production that enables workers to produce. You sit back and collect a portion of the earnings while they do the ongoing work.

I guess you might argue that most of the stock market is owned by people who didn't work to earn the money they used to invest, but inherited it from rich parents or collected it by doing nothing at an overpaid bullshit job or something. But I'd argue that's more analogous to your parents writing a book and letting you publish it under your name. Either way, same situation as above, only you didn't put in the work upfront. So I still don't see how owning intellectual property would be different from owning stocks from an ethical standpoint; there are all sorts of ways to acquire both.

The way I see it, writing a book isn't comparable to ""doing a normal job only you get the money later instead of right away"", because there's no upper bound on how much you can earn from royalties. It's getting a theoretically infinite amount of money from a finite amount of work. Just like investing in stocks, it's possible because someone else is doing the ongoing work of assembling and selling the books. But idk, what do you guys think?

On another note, I'm not sure if I'd say FI/RE is *ethical*, but I don't really think it's *unfair*; as in, I don't think people doing FI/RE are getting more than their fair share of value for putting in less than their fair share of work. Basically, people doing FI/RE work full time for 10-20 years until they save enough to live on for the rest of their lives. 40 hours of work per week for 10 years is the same amount of work as 10 hours of work per week for 40 years. And don't we basically believe that everyone should have enough to live on while only needing to work 10 hours per week? So I really can't bring myself to grudge FI/RE people who only accumulate what they need to support themselves and their families ...

I mean okay, there's no real ethical way of existing in this capitalistic system and we should abolish it etc etc, but that's going to take time. I'm not saying individualistic approaches are a solution. But in the meantime, is there any way to make things more tolerable for ourselves without being a *complete* asshat?",False,lxzt87,crapsh0ot,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lxzt87/ethics_of_passive_income/,7,0

1153,There's something living behind the walls where I work..,"Either I'm going insane or I'm seeing things clearly for the first time, I don't know - maybe those things aren't distinct.

What I *do* know is that what I've seen and felt is just as real as it is absurd and that absurdity makes it near-impossible to talk about coherently, but I'll try anyway because as I type this my life has reached and passed the point of being only just barely bearable. As far as I see it I have absolutely nothing to lose and hopefully writing it all out wil be therapeutic in it's own way.

For a long time I enjoyed my job (or at least found it comfortably tolerable) but a little over a year ago something changed - something *almost* imperceptible but something significant that I couldn't pin down until recently slapped in the face with the obviousness of it - this low and almost imperceptible.. sound.. sensation.. that buzzed, hummed, rumbled, whistled and whined all at once with a subtle smell of damp and rot. When I noticed it there was no un-noticing it and it was there, not just in the but the background but the background itself, emanating it seemed from all directions. At first I assumed (or hoped) it was a mechanical abnormality, maybe the furnace laboring especially hard because of the cold weather, but I found it followed me home, subdued slightly, until brought back and felt at its 'full' volume on my return to work. It was as if the building and my body were speaking a language I could suffer but not understand.

It was all-consuming. I assumed (or hoped) I would eventually tune it out or be able to focus my attention in spite of it, but it was both subtle enough to not completely overwhelm and constant enough to be irritating and unignorable. With each passing day, week, and month I could feel my memory and energy eroding, along with my very will to exist at all. There was no longer a single aspect of my job to trick myself into enjoying anymore and I would dread the cycle continuing from the moment it finished. I attributed my newfound anxiety and the strange symptom it had manifested to a general fatigue of COVID and the accelerated absurdity that was 2020 (and let’s be real, the few years preceding too) but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was *seriously* off, something beyond normal - it was like my spirit was being sucked, suffocated, and smothered by some force unseen - force that preferred me exhausted to dead.

I figured my stress was also made worse by a timely mid-life crisis (I just turned 30) where I was struggling to let go of whatever bright-eyed childhood dreams I once lived with and had now forgotten, and diminished to a drone in pursuit of a goal I couldn't quite wrap my head around - a goal that made no real sense to me; or, I suppose, the goal made sense but my means of getting there didn't. I was stuck wanting to be unstuck and the only way to get unstuck I was told was to unstick myself.

My manager must have noticed how disconnected I’d been because he called me in to his office and asked in a hushed tone and with great concern, if “everything was okay?”.

I told him about the general stress, fatigue, and anxiety I'd been feeling lately and also made up some lie about learning of an old (and imaginary) friend’s passing, all while the 'buzz' hummed tirelessly, as it always did, behind our conversation. Although I had mostly acclimated to life with the sound and stench of this sensation, for the first time since I had felt it for the first time it overwhelmed me and consumed everything else in that room and I could only sit there, alone, injured and not sure how or who to ask for help because I couldn't even quite articulate what I felt was happening to me.

*""Seriously, thegreatself, are you alright? You look like you’re about to pass out.""*

His words broke through, each word and then each syllable punctuated by static.

I grimaced and pinched the bridge of my nose. I asked him if he heard a buzzing.

*""Like tinnitus?""*

*""Sort of, I guess.. not really.. or maybe.. I don’t know, I have to make an appointment with my doctor.""*

He smiled, wide and wildly, eyes unmoving - his face set with an expression that felt far too exaggerated for the kind of interactions we usually had. 

*""Have you ever met our boss?""*

I struggled to answer because the question was a little stupid and one he already knew the answer to. Anticipating my confusion and I'm sure reading it on my face, my hesitation was his turn to continue.

*""I mean the *real* boss - The One Above All Else.""*

The way he said those last five words creeped me the fuck out, and a deep instinctual gut reaction to just RUN reared its head then and there. His change in tone was so stark that it sounded like some disembodied voice had pushed its way out through a portal and past his lips.

I briefly wondered who the fuck could be above the sole owner and founder of our company and the biggest asshole in the building, but before I could answer his eyes finally shifted to match his smile, igniting like someone just given permission to share something intimate - something they desperately want to talk about but can't or don't often get the opportunity.

*""Follow me, there's something I think you should see.""*

I sat up from my chair before he even finished and, as if propelled by something I wanted no part of, followed behind him, past a row of cubicles and down a stairwell towards the ground floor, and eventually past it into the bowels of the building. Whatever it was that pushed me forward was only helped by my very-human capacity for curiosity, and whether or not I wanted to be a part of whatever was going on, I was.

So I moved forward, the only way I could go.

The further we descended the more intense the sensation seemed to surround, but it morphed into something else, twisting and contorting itself with the added sounds of grinding metal, shattering glass, explosions, gunfire, and tormented human screaming layered into a single consuming cacophony that was one endless crescendo.

I don't know exactly how many flights of stairs we climbed down but it had to be more than actually existed. By the time we reached the bottom I could barely walk or hold myself up unassisted and my faithful guide had to steady me to make any progress. My heart was pounding faster than that one time I ate too many edibles and every beat sent bursts of pain right to the centre of my brain and it felt like my skull was about to explode, torn apart by a noise I could hear but not understand.

I wanted to collapse but I was being propped up and practically dragged by this point.

""What the fuck is happening to me? I need to go to the hospital.."" 

""There's **nothing** wrong with you and there's **nothing** the hospital can do for you. Don’t worry, we're not far now and then you’ll see - and then you'll wish you didn't see!""

See what? Whatever it was I didn't want to see it, I just wanted some relief from the hell in my head, but when he said the hospital couldn’t help I instinctively and instantly knew he was right - I knew whatever was wrong with me was something significant and I was its opposite. I knew that if I went to the hospital I was going to end up in a psych ward but the longer we continued the more that seemed like maybe that's just what I needed.

We trudged down a long corridor lit by those awful fluorescent lights that smother everything in a flat constrastless and cold white. A single heavy metal door with a porthole stood out at the end of the hallway, lined on each side by doors that looked far more appropriate in the context of an office building. Every few seconds a banging on the door repeated in some strange disjointed pattern, like discordant music from another dimension.

And then everything was quiet - I *heard* quiet for the first time in over a year. I stood limply at this door now overwhelmed and sick with exhaustion, stricken by a silence that seemed foreign and alien to me. If the “buzz” was all-consuming then the silence was its inverse - pure emptiness.

I felt sick.

I wanted to collapse.

I was urged forward by a voice that trembled with a mixture of fear, anger, and anticipation.

""We're here! Go ahead! It's all right in there! Everything you need to know is in there! Everything you’re feeling is in there! You asked about the noise so now witness it! See it! Feel it! Let it show itself to you! Let it consume you! Open the door! Open the door!""

I felt like I was being beckoned by something vast and ancient - as if I was being called into a void that might swallow me whole and in swallowing me, relieve me of everything that burdened me.

If I had a choice I didn't know it. If I could have turned around and walked back upstairs I think I would have - but I didn't, because I couldn't - I could do only what I did and grip the door’s handle tightly with both hands and heave...

The sound of metal scraping started the symphony of sound again. A cold air blasted past me, carrying with it every awful and terrifying image and symbol my brain knew and could imagine. It was as if I had opened a door to a raging storm in a boundless ocean, where the wind whipped and carried with it things that were not ""things"" at all but more like memories, disfigured and distorted and twisted by time's passage.

The sound and stench were back and more than ever, and in a single horrifying flash I knew that its source was not external - it wasn't in the building, behind the walls, or even the door to another dimension I now stood in front of - It was living inside me and it had festered and grown until what 'I' was once was consumed and all but forgotten. What I saw behind that door was only a reflection of the ugliest parts of our own particularly peculiar *Human sickness* - greed, gluttony, ignorance and contempt.

There was nothing to see but I saw it anyway - an infinite blackness silhouetted a vaguely human form, some strange amalgamation of familiar but mutated parts arranged nonsensically that danced in a frenzy, thrashing and jerking with eyes absent yet looking straight through me, as if It simultaneously didn't even acknowledge me and viewed whatever I was with a great radiating hatred. 

As It danced It counted and as It counted uncountable jewels sparkled and shimmered and rained down all around It and with each obscene and unrecognizable number It grew.

More - more is all It wants, all It knows, and all It is. More. More and more, forever. More. Insatiable. All-consuming. Accumulating endlessly, forever - and ever - and beyond ever, because never is enough enough. There is no enough. More, always more. More is all there is. More is all that drives It - there is no end and no enough, just a tireless march towards more, a singular purpose of MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE GIVE ME MORE MORE IS NOT ENOUGH EVERYTHING THERE IS NOT ENOUGH THERE WILL NEVER BE ENOUGH.

With a deafening crack I was back sitting in my manager's office, nose pinched between my thumb and finger and words echoing and rattling in my head. 

""Seriously, thegreatself, are you alright? You look like you’re about to pass out.""

The sound and stench were still there, just subdued.

""What do you work for?""

He raised an eyebrow, considered, and confidently chuckled his reply.

""Money."" 

His laugh seemed to echo through the entire building and nestle itself to the now barely audible but still debilitating hum.

Maybe I never really left that office but maybe that didn't really matter - maybe what I saw was still 'real' regardless. Maybe what might be true is just as significant as what is, or at least, what appears to be.

I know It exists because I interact with it daily and I see hints that most others do, too - we just don't know how to frame or conceptualize it beyond talking about 'mental health' within the boundaries It permits.

It wails endlessly and I'm sure differently for all, silently screaming its own sick song or whispering vague promises of fulfillment to those chosen to be wielded to its end - to continue and preserve it as **The One Above All Else** - It is ancient and it is evil, and, most terrifyingly, it is a part of *Us* and a part seemingly inseparable; an inoperable tumor that has been with us for so long we cannot imagine life in its absence because as far as we know there is no such thing. 

It exists because it must.

Or so It has led us to believe - so It manipulates us into prostration and so it forces submission through its single-minded and sole purpose - MORE IS NEVER ENOUGH.

It doesn’t want you to know that ""We"" can talk and that conversation might be all it takes to destroy or at least cripple It. It has prepared for that by instilling in us a sense that this is just ""The Way the World Is"", as if ""The Way the World Is"" is completely untouched by our collective ideas about it.

Seeing the acceleration into absurdity that is the past decade, I’m convinced it's possible to get a message out and that message might shrink It; not kill It outright but at least wound It. I’m counting on it, in fact, because everything I read and everything I feel in my gut leads me to the inevitability of this world’s total collapse, not by entropy but consumed by our own parasitic miasma of peddling and profit - a world where Power, Politics and Profit are indistinguishable.

A message so simple *it can’t be* misinterpreted. 

A message so simple *it will be* misinterpreted.

**UNIFY**.

That is our only hope of depriving It - of smothering It underneath our collective gravity and extinguishing It with our shared sense of what is right, what is good, what is just, what is valuable, what is true, and most importantly what is *possible* - the only thing It fears if It even knows what that is, is that *We* might wish It away, because as all-consuming and powerful as It is, It is just as fragile, perched on the precipice of uncertainty and fed, powered, and driven by nothing other than *Us* and our own warped inclinations and desires - our perfectly *Human* inclinations and desires.

And with all that said there is nothing to do but return to wage-slavery and give myself over to the void, because really what else is there?

1154,I really hate Jack Welch and I think he stands for everything wrong with corporations,"Keep in mind there are probably a lot of other guys much worse than him. But this guy sticks out to me because how much they jerk him off when we now know he was an absolute fraud.

Jack Welch was Chairman and CEO of General Electric (GE) between 1981 and 2001. He was called one the greatest CEOs of all time. I mean the profit figures said so. The stock said so. So he has to be great right?

They jerk him off so hard that even when I first heard about him, I was sorta skeptical. They would keep talking about his great mindset, his great vision, his great leadership etc. They even have stuff like the Jack Welch Management Institute, books on how to lead like him....goddamn it makes me wanna puke. Soon they're going to put his face on Mount Rushmore and create statues of him bigger than the Jesus one in Brazil.

In reality he's the equivalent of one of those kings who's reign caused irreparable damage to the kingdom and would keep declining until it died. General Electric despite surviving over 100 years as one of the biggest companies was booted from Dow Jones Industrial Average recently. And you can thank him for causing it.

Basically he stripped and sold all the electrical related divisions of General ELECTRIC that he didn't consider profitable enough. Yeah killing the things that made it last over 100 years. He cared so much about GE being a financial company he basically let GE Capital run wildly without restrictions. Not too mention all those failed financial service projects which is what he used the money for after selling divisions and laying off workers. Oh yeah and don't forget about all those ""accounting tricks"" he used to make the profit numbers look real good lol.

When it came to his culture, he was the guy who made the Vitality curve aka Forced Ranking. So basically everyone regardless has to be ranked and every time there will be some guys forced to be at the bottom. Those guys get fired. This system has been copied by many firms and even if not directly used, the mindset from it is still there. People become paranoid as the workplace becomes ""survivor"". All thanks to this wonderful guy.

Its funny when he talks about high performance because if he was under this system, he would have been fired long ago.  In 1963, an explosion at the factory which was under his management blew off the roof of the facilities. But luckily back then workers had more rights and forgiveness until he came along to crush them. I never worked for the guy personally so I can't tell but I heard he was a massive prick in real life. Like the kind of boss that would constantly turn red throw tantrums and expected no one to oppose him. Even when he played a lot of golf with the president. Like the ego this guy had could probably solve our energy crisis. He even tried to change the GE logo with his own design. But thats to be expected right? Sociopath who aren't good at working but talking and backstabbing are the guys to rise to the top and he's just another prime example. Office politics 101.

I didn't do very in depth research so there's probably a lot more stuff about him. Especially all those meaningless business buzzwords. The point is the media and corporates love to jerk him off when he was the complete opposite. He pretty much represents everything wrong with corporate culture. The damage he has done not just to GE but the rest of us because of many companies following his ""values"" is beyond measure.",False,lxmc6w,blackupsilon,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lxmc6w/i_really_hate_jack_welch_and_i_think_he_stands/,2,18

1157,"""The Customer is Always Right"" is fascist brainwashing.","The nature of capitalism is primarily one of a dictatorship of capital, a dictatorship of capitalists as the primary owners of capital.  In wielding capital you effectively wield dictatorial power, even as a working class person, for the small moment you exchange currency for something of value, the culture of capitalism offers you dictatorial power, the ""customer is always right"".

Why is that?  It's because it is foundational to capitalism, capital has unlimited power under capitalism.  Without the practice of allowing even the lower classes dictatorial power relative to the exchange of their currency, a vanishingly small share of capital, there would not be the dictatorial power of bosses, landlords, and banks using their greater overall capital to wield even greater dictatorial power, over employees, over tenants, over politicians and smaller capitalists.

""The customer must always be right"" because in essence, even the employee-employer relationship is a ""merchant-customer"" relationship.  Your boss is your customer, they wield dictatorial power with their capital and purchase your labor power, time out of your life, and own you for a period of time.  Even if you use the ""freedom"" to walk away from a bad job, you are still beholden to ""the customer is always right"" you will need to find a new customer, a new capitalist to survive, every time risking that this dictatorial power will be antagonistic to your livelihood.  If you offer bad service or appear rebllious, this will spread like with any ""business"" and you will risk not finding new customers, a new capitalist.  You are not owned by any one person like under a feudal system, you are owned by capital, and by extension, those who wield it.

The customer is always right because under capitalism, capital is your god and it can do whatever it wants to you.",False,lwwabp,capnbarky,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lwwabp/the_customer_is_always_right_is_fascist/,27,111
1158,My Antiwork Escape Plan: Full Financial Breakdown (Please Critique),"Hey there, long-time lurker here. I discovered this sub back in August after being laid off in April. I'm so glad I did because this sub has truly changed my outlook on life and determine what I actually want to do with my life. Since then, I have been thinking about how to escape work as much as possible for good. I believe I have finally determined a plan for how to escape within the next two years. Hopefully, it can be of help to you too in escaping this oppressive system as well. Please critique my plan and let me know if you think some things in it are incorrectly calculated or planned.

The first two pages are about my finances and the budget I will be sticking to for the remainder of the year in order to save enough money to buy some land and build a tiny house by next year. The third page is my plan in writing for saving money this year and building the tiny house next year. I don't know anything about building a house and will be doing more research throughout this year, so sorry if my general building plan seems a bit simplistic.

Edit: If you're interested in me doing follow-up posts once every month for the remainder of the year letting y'all know how the savings and plan are going, let me know.

Anyway, about me:

* 23M single
* Laid off in April, unemployed for 9 months, moved to Austin in December, and found my current job.
* Live in Austin, TX
* Make $15/hr, so by no means rich or well off. I bring in a net of $2198.16/month from my main job &amp; $600/m from a side gig.
* No car payment. I drive a beater civic that I bought for $1000 &amp; maintain well. Should last another 2 years.
* I have 22k in student loans but did not factor them into the budget since there is a payment moratorium in place. Maybe I'll incorporate it into the budget and start making payments now.

Here is my plan:

My workplace being shitty doesn't make yours lovely. Your American lack of health and care doesn't mean things are great in Europe or anywhere else.
 
Often it's the stuff that only takes minutes that leaves the deepest mental scars. 
 
So, please, can we turn down the pain olympics, just a notch? Can we acknowledge that our work situations are difficult in a variety of different ways, without constantly pointing out that things can be worse in some specifics?

1178,"I walked out, I finally quit my retail job.","I worked at a retail store for nearly three years. I very quickly moved up to management because I am a great worker with a vast knowledge of the items we sold and had good customer service skills. Quickly I reached multiple raises and had hit the limit on what I could be paid. Slowly that place was killing me. My store was in a location where I’d see mentally ill people come in, drug addicts, the homeless, and blatantly rude, mask deniers. I turned into someone who just hated everyone. We also would hire people that just were lazy and more and more responsibilities were on my shoulders. I was sick of it all. So two days ago I wrote a note that said, “ I quit”, put my keys on it, and peaced out. Finding a replacement job won’t be difficult, it was a low paying, dead end job. 

But there’s still this sad feeling. Idk if it’s cause I spent years there and change is hard or what. I don’t really feel guilty, because it was ridiculous how much I was doing. Apparently there was a staff meeting and my boss told everyone that no one could replace me and there’s now a big hole in the company. He was a decent boss as far as bosses go. Why do I feel so strange? Is it because of the way we are conditioned in this toxic culture?

I hate support users who wants me to help them but are too damn busy for me to troubleshoot it. They think stuff just magically fix itself (sometimes it does). I leave work mentally stressed and always have to look at my dumb iphone for emails or anyone message me on Teams. It's giving me anxiety and I can't do it anymore. 

I'm going to stay for 4 more months to save up my unemployment fund and I'm going to quit IT for good at the end of June. Or if I can't find anything other jobs then i'll do it as part time or as a contractor. So sick of this full time shit and fuck the money. More money more responsibilities.

I despised the rude customers, the condescending managers, the draining hours - all of it. I guess the only positive from the job was some money for shopping, that’s it. The only thing I ever learned from working at a restaurant is to treat the workers with kindness and to understand that mistakes happen. I would go to my job miserable and I would finish my shifts miserable. I think working there made me even more misanthropic than I already was. I’m honestly not even super worried about what’s going to happen next, I just know that I want to use this time to relax and find some hobbies.

1192,I really hate being a middle manager,"I hate being a manager. I feel like I've really pulled back the curtain and seen how bad the work machine is.

I've worked for one of the largest insurance companies in UK (maybe largest in Europe actually) for about 10 years, it was OK work, I was on the phones logging motor accident claims. Eventually I got very lucky and through a series of promotions I'm now a team leader for an audit team. 

My team at the moment are beyond burnt out and there's nothing I can do about it. Basically we've had a restructure and been given a new way to work. What this means is instead of 12 large projects a year its now 30ish smaller projects but with a quicker deadline. This new deadline is completely unreasonable, it's insane.

My team are working well over their hours to get the work done and I hate it. I've gone to the execs and complained about it but I was told quite clearly my team obviously aren't working hard enough which I called bullshit on, my team are great and these new deadlines are a failure on management's part, I was told my job is ensure deadlines are met and that's it.

I hate it so much and I'm not being allowed to actually manage my people.

Another thing that really pissed me off was one of my team spotted an error the company made, a real big fucking error, if she hadn't spotted the company could have potentially been fined millions (no joke fucking millions). I really pushed for her to get some recognition because it was a huge finding. You know what she got? An email from an execs secretary and a £10 Amazon gift voucher.

1194,How to plan for a better work-life future? Or just vent inside,"Like many, I'm currently stuck wanting to kill myself. Graduated from law school and now working in law. Biggest mistake of my life.

Background: I'm in South Africa. Went to law school looking to form a solid future where I could work the 9 to 5 and enjoy my private life without worrying about extreme debt (not to be rich, but to be solid middle class). Needless to say, letting 18 year old me decide what to do was a huge mistake and one that I still regret till this day. Worked hard in law school and got into a job where I've been for the last 5 months. Shit pay (very shit pay), working between 50 to 60 hours when my says 40 (not getting paid extra by the way). Constantly working so much some days that I can't catch a break to get coffee at times. However, South Africa is in the midst of its largest unemployment numbers. So I should feel grateful to have a job at least, but damn is it difficult. 
Yes, I know, I have only myself to blame.

Which brings me to what I wanted to ask anyone that could give me any kind of advice.

I have citizenship from a EU country and want to utilize this to move to Europe in the future. So I'm planning what's the best way for me to move over, and to where.

My law degree doesnt help that much, because it's in South African law, plus I don't want to work in the legal field anymore due to the overworked and alcoholic steorotype being true.

I was hoping to apply for general office work, or any other corporate work, which would solidify a 9 to 5 without making me work an extra minute. I thought of emailing companies and asking what a company like them might want to see in a candidate like me if I ever applied in the future.

Furthermore, one important thing to decide is which country to move too. I can start learning the language of the country from this year as well. One option is the Netherlands because I know Afrikaans and I might find the beginning to learn Dutch easier this way.

If anyone has any advice, comments, or insight into my plan, please comment. If you just want to vent about your shitty situation too, then shoot away. Misery loves company.

I have absolutely nowhere else to talk about this because she doesn’t give me a salary therefore I can’t afford a therapist to deal with her ass.

I was trying as hard as I possibly could and it, for some reason, wasn’t enough. I asked to meet with her so we could go over EXACTLY what she wants our brand voice to be and figure out exactly what she wants from me. That was all I asked for.

Instead of giving me the chance to turn our social media around, she decided to be a SNAKE and hire a whole social media agency to do MY job without consulting anyone first. I had to hear from another one of my coworkers that this was happening and that now my job was to do any administrative bullshit and “help the social media agency out.” Then had the audacity to say “if you want to find another job, we understand.” ??? Why didn’t you just fire me if you hate me so much?

On top of this, she lectured me over the phone yesterday about everything I do wrong, including how I don’t answer her emails right away ON THE WEEKEND. She goes “I’m your boss. It’s your job to answer all of my emails, even if it’s on the weekends. I need to know you received them.” I answer every email on Monday morning, and complete all of my tasks on time. At this point you’re straight up micromanaging me and crossing my boundaries.

I was antiwork before this job, but this particular job proved how antiwork I truly am. I haven’t genuinely hated a person in a long time. But I genuinely hate her and hope she goes out of business. All I can do is pray for another job where I’m not this micromanaged, violated, degraded and humiliated.

I recently got a job that's 100% remote (or at least has been since COVID). I used to work at a laser machining engineering firm that required me to be onsite often since we work on physical systems, so my days were often split between home and the office.

Things that have improved for me drastically since I switched to the fully WFH job:

1) Less physical tension. I realized how much tension I held in my body simply because at any moment, someone could come up behind me at my desk and surprise me/ask me for something/make a stupid comment. And, I don't have to stifle my emotions at any given minute - lots of energy went into that.

2) I can SEE OUTSIDE. My 2nd bedroom isn't paradise by any means, but wow, I can watch the birds on my feeder while I'm in a meeting. I can follow the course of the day, be in tune with the weather and the neighborhood. 

3) I am comfortable. I have a chair that I actually like, a desk that is actually high-quality, and the ability to take a moment and stretch out on the f\*\*\*ing floor if I want, ha! Or, go for a quick walk/run! Plus, I am always the right temperature; no more ridiculously cold office that forced me to wear long johns even in the summer. No more uncomfortable dress shoes that destroy my feet. And my desk area is in a room that is actually painted a COLOR (not white or gray), with furniture made out of hardwood that has personality. It's amazing how much more comfortable that is.

4) I am tasting my food. I get to prepare my own fresh meals on my own schedule and relax while I eat.

5) I can finish my work in less than the ""required"" 40 hrs and not feel bad about just chilling after that. I concentrate when I need to, then I give myself a break. No one there to force me to pretend I'm still staring at something important on my screen. This has actually allowed my CREATIVITY to come back (!). No more numbing bullshit that exhausts me mentally and destroys my weekends.

1227,So fucking tired,"I graduated from law school about 10 months ago, been working for about 8 months and I'm already sick of this shit. I live and work in India and the work culture here is one where there's absolutely no respect for your personal time, especially in the legal field. Clients call you at any time, boss calls you at any time, it's a joke. Even when it's a Saturday or Sunday nobody gives a fuck.

 I do a lot of transactional work and these fuckin clients show up at the last minute and set absurdly unrealistic deadlines for getting their transactions over the line. Half the time just as they're about to go to bed they'll dump something on you and start asking for it first thing when they wake up. The level of entitlement is unbelievable. I'm sick of making these rich boomer men richer.

 I really like my coworkers and most of my friends from college face similar problems, so I'm in no way special, but I just can't anymore. My grades in college were average at best, so when I got this job I was constantly reminded by everyone how lucky I am. I get it, my grades were shit but I'm supposed to be fucking grateful to these people for squeezing as much work out of me as possible? I'm paid the equivalent of 400$ a month  which to the people from the western hemisphere reading this might sound pathetic, but it's  actually not that bad in India considering the cheap cost of labour, but is still way too less for the work I'm doing. 

I'm repeatedly advised to stick with it because of all the ""experience"" I'm gaining. I get it, I am getting a lot of exposure, but in a larger sense, what's the point? All the experience I'm getting I'll use to get a job with higher pay somewhere else, but all it means is that there'll be less respect for my time and I'll just be slaving away in a different environment. we're all in the same boat I'm not trying to say I have it so much worse or something, but I read posts on here and generally on reddit about people from the states complaining about the 9-5 and honestly I feel jealous because I'd kill for a standard 9-5. Here there are some days where I won't do shit until 5pm and suddenly a mountain will get dumped on me. Oh and the less said about my dating life, the better

Okay rant over. Thanks for listening guys, mostly nothing will come of all this because I don't actually have the stones to quit and I really like the freedom the money has given me, but I really needed to get that off my chest.

3 days into the job they send me out to the field to do labor. I expressed to my boss that I wasn't to work as an electrician, but as a project engineer, so I wouldn't be going to the field. He agreed, except now he sent me to a project in the next town over (45 minute commute one way) where my office is in a job trailer. 

The reason I applied at this place was because it was so close to my house and to get out of doing field work. I have an interview with another contractor today.

And because they let me go I get my compensation paid out. If I would have quit I‘d still keep it but would take it over to my next job.

So last month I consumed the last 2 weeks of vacation I had left and since monday I‘m officially unemployed.

Holy shit it feels amazing to break out of the hamster wheel. At some point I have to get in again but the last 4 years or so I was so depressed and thought my life was gonna be the same shit every day.

I got a job offer last night at a place that just \*has\* to be better than my current place. Literally, the boss was on a zoom call on his phone without throwing a temper tantrum. It was amazing.

I came in this morning to Hell to get my shit. I was going to stay a little to help a coworker with a project but tbh, I don't care. The project would've been done last week were it not for our shitty boss changing everything all the time. If they can't meet their deadline, it's genuinely not my fault.

Anyway, my desk is right in front of the door and I'm waiting for them to start their hearing in the conference room because the doors will be closed and nobody will see me gtfo.

This place is horrific. I've even developed a new symptom of fear. A deep burning pain right in the middle of my chest whenever I hear my boss's voice. I told my husband his voice was triggering as a joke but it's literally triggering lol.

Now I find it difficult to choose to shift to a more simple job that will, inevitably, pay less. I cannot imagine going back to my college budget of noodle/canned goods filled diet 😂 

Everyday I chat with my friend about how much we wish to escape this corporate slavery but we just don’t know what to do. We talked about how difficult it is to be without a safety net of rich parents. We work hard for ourselves and we are proud of it. But when will it end?

Now even more with Covid, I feel like a prisoner in a dungeon. I feel like travel is impossible and going out to eat normally is always nerve wrecking.

I’m turning older and people will expect kids/marriage by 30 or 33 or whenever but I just can’t see it. Life is difficult as it is...

Is life going downhill from here?",False,lwxgkb,Brief-Bee-7315,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lwxgkb/i_was_thinking_how_difficult_it_is_to_be_without/,14,8
1242,Solutions,"I see a lot of bitching here and not many solutions. I need to work. I'm 38 and I hate it. Here is what I have learned and done to make it better. It's taken me a long time to get here.

MOVE AWAY FROM ANY MAJOR CITY !

I don't buy things I don't need and the things I do buy, I purchase used as to avoid paying taxes. 

I bought a small, cheap house just outside town limits. With a 20% down payment my mortgage is $450 /month and I pay way less tax than being in town. Also am near enough to a fire department so not to pay higher insurance. 

Drive used Japanese automobiles. Toyota, Mazda, Honda. Buy lease trade-ins or 5 years old, low millage. Believe me on this, North American made cars are terrible quality and European vehicles are extremely expensive to repair. Get a car/truck that will last and is cheap and easy to repair. I drive a 2008 Toyota Tacoma with 270,000 KMS on it. I hope to drive it until at least 400k. And learn to do basic maintenance, it's very easy and will save you a ton of cash.

Learn skills to build or repair things yourself. Work in construction for a couple years or get a trade of some sort. You will have those skills for life and they will pay off over and over.

Make your own meals! It's way healthier, and way more cost effective. I like to go out to eat but I limit it as much as possible. Once or twice a month at a quality restaurant. Screw fast food. On that note, homebrew your own wine or beer and don't smoke cigarettes. 

Invest some extra cash in high growth stocks, they might not all be winners but one winner can cover much loss. 

By doing all this I now have FU money, the freedom to change my position in life when I feel I need to do so. The ability to leave a job, start your own business, take time off etc etc. 

Money isn't a barrier in your way, it's a tool to obtain freedom. Make your choices.",False,lwn0u5,m_l_ca,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lwn0u5/solutions/,45,16

1245,every new generation starts of as idiots,"the word idiot is very condescending, but it is what it is. When I was young me and my peers did not see or view how modern day work is just modern slavery. I didn't understand debt slavery. I heard about the media advertising to young people due to they are easily manipulated and nag their parents, but did not fully comprehend the scale, nor the various techniques &amp; hidden incentives/agendas.

Today majority of the learning everyone is doing is from propaganda, and corporate incentivized learning. Even at school such as robotics we learn to use the tools of the highest corporate bidder/donor. Those with money are infront of everyones faces spitting propaganda at everyones faces through ads, in our education, the media/news, all the banners on subway, school campuses. And companies invest in their propaganda years ahead with messages that we do not comprehend the agenda and plan at the time before it's too late. Our beliefs are manipulated, engraved, and we are too stuckup to change our beliefs.

We need to change all this. I don't know how, but this just gotta change. Teachers is a good start, they can slip some analysis of propaganda sporadically in their lessons. Parents need to teach their kids how modern propaganda works. My parents didn't have time as they were grinding their jobs trying to live, not to mention probably didn't comprehend how propaganda was influencing them to make their lives worse. We need to educate people on where we can, perhaps on reddit like I'm doing now, other social media, when we talk with friends.

Silence will only let corporations win. They will try to infiltrate, like amazon is trying to stop unions from forming. I'm fucking tired of corporations sodomizing us. I'm fucking tired of how the brainwashing starts at a very early age. All the research in human psychology is used against us to manipulate us to maximize profits, and keep us as slaves. On PBS news recently they mentioned how distrust in the news &amp; media is an all-time high and they give bullshit reasons which feel like they are just trying to manipulate us to trust the media more. Anyone paying attention to the news can see why distrust is so high. Takes about 1-2 months to notice. For those that haven't yet it's because the way decisions are executed make no fucking sense, it only looks good on paper.

The first step is we need people aware of the problems before we can work together in solving them. Thank you for your time in reading, I hope we can progress together to a better future. There might be huge economic fall out coming up, and if we want to make it through it, we'll need to get our shit together and work together, otherwise corporations will just sodomize us, and not even care if we die or live in pain.",False,lwx9j2,red_green_link,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lwx9j2/every_new_generation_starts_of_as_idiots/,4,1

1248,"Theoritically, rat race needs us to be obsessed with safety","In my life I've been chilling a lot especially during studies, because at that time I was the poor student with access to a (very small though) state grant. My country, France, offers some 460eur/month to children of underprivileged families. I still was under pressure regarding exams, yes, because if you fail your year, you lose access to the grant. But fortunately I didn't run into trouble.

At that time I was stressed a lot on my homework and learning was tough, but I still had hopes that, after that, my work life would be something more slow-paced, with my evenings being rid of any homework.

Just to realise it is not entirely like this.

First, as usual I need to find time to fend for myself, and with my days occupied by work, some evenings are dedicated to buying a new piece of furniture, having an interview with a banker or an accountant, basically any project hat requires professional assistance. Makes me think, are these people busy during the day? Lots of persons have negative feelings for non-workers, but at least these non-workers can visit whatever store and counselling office they want between 9 and 5 , and consume accordingly.

Second, the way a white-collar job demands homework is more vicious. Because no one really tells you what you need to perform, and yet everyone expects you to grow at one point or another in your life. So they could promote and responsabilize you. Sometimes some clues pass by, your manager mentions to you about x industry magazine or y seminar that would improve your skills.

Third, you get to realise the days where your transitioning to a job could be subsidized, are all gone, and if you want to transition to another industry, you are on your own. So if you grow uncomfortable in your job, then you can't even relax at evening and week-ends, because you'd be busy re-assessing your initial choice.

Fourth, if you need to keep your field, but change companies. Basically what we call ""the slave choosing his master"". Then you need to keep going with the complete charade of searching for a new job, but this time during your own job's clock, because when your schedule is cleared, employers' are, too. Everyone gets home at 6pm right? And yet, this needs to be done quietly because openly looking for another job can lead to trouble in the workplace.

Fifth, maybe you are in a situation where you are underpaid and would like to start a side-gig? Maybe you're working abroad and need to learn a new language? Well that will be on your own, too. Because such matters are considered ""personal life"".

In conclusion, I observe a lot of the so-called personal life is spent to acquire necessary assets to please the corporate overlord, be it a potential employer or a potential customer (for small business owners).

My life goals are on the side of hobbies, I want to learn useless/unsellable things for myself, because I enjoy them and want to find communities with whom I can share. I also like having my hands in multiple different topics, which makes for poor commitment on my part. It is the way I am wired.

I don't know where else this rambling goes. This life just makes me very tired. Not everyone can sell themselves or their skills, so why just not let them be I wonder. I'm sure I have a lot of qualities that are underused by the society, just because that one size is designed for all.",False,lwuy32,eyewave,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lwuy32/theoritically_rat_race_needs_us_to_be_obsessed/,0,21
1249,"Just because I am ""free"" in the sense that it is a day off does not mean I am free to come in and work for you.","I am on a 10 hour a week contract at my current employer (a store) because I'm a full time graduate student and it works perfectly for me. I work all day (7 hours) on Monday and a 3 hour lunch cover on Tuesday and then I am done for the week.

Just because I am not rostered to work Wednesday-Sunday doesn't mean I am free to come in on those days. I am busy with Uni, have made medical appointments, arranged to meet up with family/friends, have online classes etc.

Even if my plans for the day are ""sitting in my bed on Netflix"", I don't *owe* you coming in. Just because I am not on the roster does not mean I am available for you. 

It's getting a big deal because my employer is furious I don't want to pick up a lot of extra shifts in the middle of the year when I am on University holidays.

My manager is going on annual leave for 3 weeks in July and I am being asked to work full time for the 3 weeks, which are by coincidence during my Uni holidays. I receive a student payment from the Australian government for my Masters and work 10 hours a week - intentionally. I can make approx $450 before my student payment is affected. After that, they deduct about $50 straight up and 60cents from the dollar for every dollar earned over that $450. I work basically exactly enough to get to keep all the money from work and still get my full student payment. 

If I were to work those shifts, I’d only make about $5 an hour on them (a bit less than 1/4 of minimum wage for retail), and for me, that’s not worth it. It’s basically $40 a day, and by the time I pay for my transport to/from work and buy lunch (we are not given a fridge to keep food in or anywhere to sit, so I eat at a restaurant in the shopping centre so I can sit without being asked to come out and help), that’s gone. It would basically be working for free for 3 out of 4 weeks of my holidays if I agreed. But I’m a huge asshole for saying no. It annoys me because I’m expected to be a tEaM PLaYeR. 

It only goes one way though - I'm expected to make sacrifices for them but they don't give a shit about me. 

I WANT to enjoy my holidays while I still get them and before I have to graduate into full time wage slavery with minimal time off. I don't want to waste my last few holidays selling overpriced crap for basically peanuts.....it's bad enough Covid has stolen my last holidays, but I won't lose them to work.",False,lwj550,eeniemenieminy,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lwj550/just_because_i_am_free_in_the_sense_that_it_is_a/,4,16

I lost a battle with work comp last year over typing causing neuropathy in two of my fingers.  I'm in my 30s.  All of our hobbies are dependent on dexterity... I knit, cross stitch, sew, play video games, etc.  He builds models and various hobby kits.  Our insurance sucks, so neither of us use it. I did get PT for my hands the one year I hit my $6600 deductible, but it was pretty worthless.  It didn't improve the pain.  I can't grip cold things without my hands being in shooting pain.  I already can't knit anymore.  My two fingers are numb half the time.

The stupidity is 90% of all the typing I do is completely unnecessary.  Type this form in triplicate so you can copy/paste it into a system that already had all the information you typed.  It's just stupid busy work.  It doesn't take me 8 hours to do my job, just let me hit whatever quota and log off.

It's just profoundly sad to me that we are damaging our bodies so much for work that we likely will lose the ability to engage in our hobbies.  Or it will cost tens of thousands of dollars for surgery.  I guess I'll get to stare vacantly at the TV.

Of course, you can follow such a lifestyle without being religious, but it seems rarer and maybe harder.

1282,Stress from my job has given me nightly panic attacks that prevent me from sleeping.,"I'm essentially a glorified data entry drone with a large retail company, making barely a livable wage. Over the last year I've been growing more and more dissatisfied with my job. They've made some changes to the kind of work I do that essentially makes it harder to perform well about a year ago, without increasing my pay.

Every time I protest this change, they brush it off and tell me they know I'm capable of doing a good job. However, over time, my metrics have noticeably dropped, and a couple weeks ago I was informed that I was now on a 4-8 week probation, and if I don't improve enough for them at the end of it I get fired, despite the fact that I was a fantastic (often placing top percentile within the department) employee for the last 5 prior to the implementation of these changes. As my probation period goes on, it's becoming more and more clear that I'm probably going to lose my job.

Starting a couple days ago, I've been having some kind of episode every time I lie down for bed. Every time I start to drift off I'm suddenly seized with a sensation that I can't breathe, and that my heart has stopped. It instantly shocks me into being wide awake, and the first night it happened I literally didn't get a minute of sleep all night.

I saw my doctor about it the next day because it understandably freaked me the fuck out. He told me my vitals were great. Pending some blood work results I'm probably physically fine. He asked about my stress/anxiety/depression levels. After hearing my response and situation, he told me that basically I've internalized everything that is happening, so much to the point where even when I'm not actively thinking about how fucked I am at work, and how fucked my life is once I'm fired because I'm a college dropout with no marketable skills, it's essentially made itself a part of my entire conscience and I'm permanently stuck in a state of red alert. Even the simple process of falling asleep causes my brain to freak the fuck out and force my body into fight or flight mode. It's torture.

My doctor gave me some medications to help fight this, and they helped a little bit so far, but not a lot. Over the last 3 days I've gotten maybe 8 hours of sleep total. I'm so fucking tired. I constantly feel like I'm going to have a heart attack in my sleep.

I'm a little bit lucky to be in a position where I'm allowed to go on FMLA. My therapist recommended it, and I've already put in my request for it. I'm taking a significant amount of time from work, and I know it'll help me in the short term, but it won't help with my overall situation and once my FMLA is up I'll be right back where I started.

I feel like I'm in a pit. If I lose this job my only option will be going back to retail/service, assuming I can find a job in the covid landscape. I won't be able to afford my apartment on minimum wage, and my parents don't have room/can't afford to let me stay with them. I don't even know if I'm capable of going back to retail, I could barely handle it last time around and trauma has caused my mental health to significantly degrade since then. I have a very high chance of ending up homeless and jobless. I don't know how I'm going to take care of my aging cat.

1. Your company should provide the equipment and camera.

2. You should have the ability to use privacy background which Zoom and Google Meet offer by default. This blocks your surroundings.

3. It should be clearly stated when cameras are required and it should be just some of your meetings and not all of them. I think one or two meetings per day with advanced notification for cameras on is reasonable. 

4. This should be required only from companies where the expectation before work from home was to be in the office, in person. If you didn't sign up for a job where you had to show your face, you shouldn't be forced now. But if you did, it's not a huge change to have to do it online now.

5. They should pay for your internet. 

And here's the reason why (in order of importance):

1. Visual communication works better than audio or written; you need to see people's microreactions to presentations, updates, if you're truly trying to collaborate.

2. The point is to have cameras on and actively listening to the call; without cameras, people are more inclined to multitask and make the meeting less impactful. Even with cameras on some people multitask which is a bit disrespectful to whoever is presenting. The problem is not the camera, it's having meetings that are not relevant to all participants.

3. I just think it's a shame to not use the technology if we have it, but that's maybe just me.

1292,[ADVICE] My boss is hoarding ALL tips even after I confronted her.,"This is a weird situation, because I don’t work in a typical food setting. It is a commissary kitchen, that also does catering, and as of last year produces cheesecake. I got hired as a delivery driver, but quickly adapted into doing any and everything else we need.

Our main reason for deliveries is lunches to doctors offices. Drug reps order lunches on the Pfizer credit card and spend ungodly sums of money on some basic chicken parm. But I am the one who delivers these meals, 98% of the time. Almost exclusively to offices 2-3 counties away. Hour drives usually.

Well after a year of doing this, my brother ordered some lunches, and a few days after it was done, he asked if I got my 60$ tip? I had no clue what he was talking about. Left on a credit card, he said. Well upon confronting my boss, she basically made it pulling teeth to even get her to consider putting it on my check. Let alone giving me cash.

Don’t tips go to delivery drivers? She’s gotten thousands of dollars in tips over the year I’ve worked there. Not to mention with cheesecake sales, EVERYONE hits the 2$ tip button on square. But she won’t give it to us. I asked her and she avoids it and got shitty with me today calling it “The company’s money, not your money”

Do I have a legal foothold here? Are the tips someone leaves on the deliveries I take actually mine? Or am I off base?

It’s unrealistic. My friend worked for a German company and they found this American OT working culture so strange.

1294,I think this is sub is driving me crazy,"Hi everyone,

First things first I agree with everything you stand for. I am lazy, I hate all kinds of work and believe no one should be forced to slavery for 45 years.

When I first discovered this sub, I was glad that I found like minded people (I still am) and realized that there is nothing wrong with me, it was the others who normalized this slavery have issues. 

However, more recently the sub started to make me go crazy for a few reasons. 

1) I am not sure I can put this into words but for a moment I read this sub and feel like I am right, everything is shit but when I return to my life it is completely different. There is no one else in my life who understands what is being discussed here. If I say to them working is shit, they will just say stuff like  ""so what will you do if you don't work"", ""everybody works"" or ""your career is a part of you, it is what defines you"".

2) All we can do is complain, the system (slavery) is not going anywhere. And we are already self-aware, we know how shitty everything is yet we are powerless to make an impact. I don't believe in things like collective power, idealism etc; my country is corrupt as hell deep down to every fundamentals. So we are just getting angrier each day and closer to burst but no escape from slavery.

3) What irritates me most is that all my coworkers are workaholics. Especially after reading this sub with like-minded stuff, my toleration to workaholics dips. It is becoming really harder to survive in slavery. I am angry all the time about how can they stay happy while wasting their 60 hours of week for nonthing, how can they accept working overtime in weekends without questioning, how can they are not irritated to have only 2 weeks off annually etc... 

I truly believe the system is shit and working is worse than hell. It is probably the most thing that I am so sure in my life.

1306,Sick of having to be grateful for being employed,"People have been saying this to me a lot lately, and it's getting on my nerves. It's used in a way to trivialize any problems I might have with my job or to shame me for complaining about something.

My workload is being increased but my compensation isn't going up to match? Well I shouldn't complain because at least I have a job.

No one in my department is getting merit based raises this year even though our productivity increased after we transitioned to working at home because of the pandemic? Well we can't complain because the company didn't lay anyone off.

I didn't even get an interview after applying for a position within the company that would have doubled my salary, and I'm feeling a bit down because of it? Well I can't be sad because I'm still employed.

I feel like the leadership at the company and my coworkers have become complacent because of this mindset. We could have put our foot down and not have taken on extra work for no extra pay. We could have terminated the positions of useless mid-level managers that don't contribute anything to the company. Instead, we have settled for less than we already had, and everyone seems pleased despite it.",False,lwe6lk,JDuCalisson,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lwe6lk/sick_of_having_to_be_grateful_for_being_employed/,11,1
1307,Being suicidal,"I’m so sorry if this is the wrong sub for this but I felt like if I were to post it on a depression or suicide subreddit, they wouldn’t necessarily agree with my ideas and so that would just make me feel more lonely. 
I want to kill myself. I can feel myself withering away. I have no emotions. I have no creativity. I have no ideas or feelings. I am not a human. I can even feel myself cognitively deteriorating. All I do is work. And I have never been so suicidal. Every second of every day I wish to commit suicide. I’m in high school, I’m 16. I’ve been depressed for 5 months now, since October. First, the 6 hours a day after school was enough to recover from the day of stress. Then that no longer was enough. Then it became the weekend, to recover from the week of stress. Then that wasn’t enough, and now I’ve been under perpetual acute stress for 5 months. I am severely depressed. 
I know, it may seem stupid because that’s the whole reason this sub exists, but what in gods name do I do? 
If I can’t do something now I will permanently damage myself beyond recovery. And even if I had to live like this for 10 out of every 12 months, I’d take it in a fucking heartbeat so long as I knew I could recover and be a human again in that short period of time over the summer. But I am afraid that summer won’t be enough. Just like the 6 hours after school became not enough, just like the weekend became not enough, and just like winter break became not enough. If it turns out that summer isn’t enough, I will have no choice but to live like this or commit suicide. It will be 3 years of being a nonhuman. I have no doubt that by the end of it I will never be able to be myself again. Please help me.",False,lw909k,tsuya-kusa,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lw909k/being_suicidal/,4,1

1326,The meaning of “work.”,"This is probably overstated on here, but I’ve been thinking that I just hate work. In reality, I don’t hate “working.” I enjoy learning. I like completing assignment. I like being productive. I like having tasks and a routine (I’m just in school, but in general). What I hate is having to *worry* about work. I can’t actually think about work in a positive way because there is so much anxiety surrounding it, as mentioned in the title. I can’t just choose a job based on my interests, because I’m interested in everything. If it were up to me, I’d “work” multiple small jobs and keep switching around. Teaching, therapy, medicine, marketing, art, receptionist, cook...and I’d be *excited*. People like to assume that being anti-work means you’re lazy, or that being unemployed means you’re lazy. Well, it doesn’t. 
Work has come to be defined by capitalism and the horribly fucked up labor and education system. Work is waking up and making breakfast even when you’re severely depressed. Work is checking texts you’ve been avoiding. Work is feeding your pets. Work is researching random topics just because you want to. Work is taking care of your hygiene. Everything humans do takes effort and *is* work. &amp; you know what’s really sad? The fact that bright-eyed, hopefully people go into adulthood and get treated like absolute trash by this world to the point that they look up the concept of anti-work. They lose interest in the things they once did. They lose interest in life. 
And yet, people are forced into this system. I’m one of them. Undergrad, grad school, unpaid internship, the whole nine yards. But I sure as hell wish I didn’t have to (please no advice about that. I’ve mulled it over. I do not want to do trade school or start a business.)

So people book the most expensive hotels/trips they can afford so they can tell themselves ""it was worth it!"" and post billion pictures on social media of how ""happy and rich"" they are. No you're not. All this grind, exhaust and stress, just so you can go to 4-star hotel for few nights, swim in pool and maybe see some antiques, camels or mountain. You can't be serious.

Am I crazy or this is pure scam? What's the point of this grind if you never actually have time to live.

I see so many success stories of people making a lot of money on a product or art when they are young (hell, even people making millions on stock market) and it cuts me inside because I know that they can quit everything tomorrow and just focus on living.

I’m going to work everyday, trying to save money and wishing my life away. Every week I wish the week away just to get to the weekends, every month I wish the month away to get to payday, every year I add up how much I can try to save. I go home every night and all I think about is work. 

But I’m wishing my entire life away, I’m 33 and I feel like my youth is slipping through my fingers. I’m working for my retirement (like most others). How sad is that? To think we only have one precious life on this earth and this is it.

I wish I could do something to make a lot of money in a short time just so I can start living before it’s too late.
