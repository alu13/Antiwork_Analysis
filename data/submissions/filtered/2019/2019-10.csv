1,Progressive company culture,my work is big on its  progressive culture  last week we were sent an email from the  exco  including ghandi quotes no less  how vulnerability is strength and so on and so on    i needed a few of days off to look after my very sick  pregnant wife  i gave them proof with hospital appointments etc  to be told it would go unpaid due to  point 2 of section 6 15 of the staff handbook  about listing dependables   they don't really believe in what they are forcing down everyone's throats  i would prefer them to be honest that they don't give a fuck than this confusing  progressive bullshit ,doh9uf

3,People who put their work above their family,i have a co-worker whose dad lives across the country  he's in pretty poor health  she hasn't seen him since christmas 2017 and he's coming to visit in a couple weeks    she keeps saying  i hope he's not expecting me to take off work  well  he probably is wanting to actually see his daughter who he came to visit  but whatever ,dopf0n

5,Not ready for job interviews because unemployment has been nice,today  i received an unexpected call from the hr of a big and reputable firm for a phone screening  i applied to that position like half a month ago and i have a very vague impression of it  i applied to like tons of other jobs  the woman was nice and rescheduled the screening for tomorrow so that we can have a more substantial conversation    as much as i would love to explore this seemingly good opportunity in advisory services  part of me is extremely reluctant to join the work force again given how horrible my first job was  i left that place 2 weeks ago   i'm also quite puzzled by hr asking me to do more research about their company before the screening tomorrow because there isn't enough information on their website  a lot of grandiose words with no meaning being thrown around that's all    i was in a bad condition and had two panic attacks after that phone call  nevertheless  i'm going to whatever i can for the phone screening tomorrow   i don't even care if i left a bad impression today during the sudden call  might be because i don't feel like working again that soon ,dp4geh

9,A Brief Review on This Subs favorite Billionaire,welcome all  today i ll be discussing the one ceo who gets a pass  the one who is almost god-like and is single handedly saving our lives  the underdog according to some users  in this sub  actually  or the only ceo who doesn t care about    yes  still in this fucking sub  well i thought i d throw together some info on this supposed savior  it s early and i haven t had my coffee or nicotine so i might leave out some of his  highlights  or my writing might not be perfect  apologies     i spent a decent amount of time in a thread trying to inform other users of this sub  yes  of this sub  that elon musk is no different than any other billionaire  all replies to top comment  here https www reddit com r antiwork comments dmym5s selfmade utm source share amp utm medium ios app amp utm name iossmf    instead of responding one at a time to his boot lickers  i figured i d just make a big ole list of reasons why you should stop worshipping him    first maybe we could look into why so many people are worshipping him and only him  like most billionaires  he has a team of workers who monitor his pr  he even came out and talked specifically about reddit and his team working there    only link-less claim  couldn t find it  if anyone has info on it please send it to me  from about two-three years ago   people in the thread were defending him for tesla s  break throughs  and how much they help the environment  i ll touch on this last  but first let s talk all things not tesla    hyperloop  an idea birthed by the thought that  you could be standing by anybody on a subway  he has completed a mile of tunnel that was supposed to be offering free rides last december  he now hails it as r amp d and not the actual tunnel  he had a plan to sell the dirt as compressed bricks  then someone pointed out the housing crisis in his state  now he s going to sell them at 10 c a pop    that was may 2018  i ve seen small demonstrations of the bricks being used  if any musk stans who are lost and still hanging out in this sub have any info about the houses he built please pm    more specifics on  the glorious tunnel https usa streetsblog org 2018 12 19 elon-musks-tunnel-project-in-los-angeles-is-bad-joke    he s info on what the bricks  could have been used for https www popularmechanics com technology infrastructure a20874588 musk-boring-company-dirt-bricks-cseb-affordable-housing  hint  they shouldn t leave the tunnel    phew  well musk fans probably downvoted and moved on by now  for those of you still with me let s talk maybe they re reading the good news of musks new solar roof  literally just launched v3 yesterday   and idea that originally launched in 2016  and don t worry  these aren t the same ones from earlier this year poor walmart https www businessinsider com photos-walmart-roof-tied-to-tesla-solar-panels-lawsuit-2019-8  i kinda hope they are going to be like the ones from 2016 where thousands of people paid for a reservation and dozens received a product   outstanding https www cnbc com 2018 09 24 tesla-solar-roof-tiles-where-are-they html utm source share amp utm medium ios app amp utm name iossmf   there s a video of a poor sap who paid a huge reservation and is waiting for a third year if anyone has it   now some people might come in and say musk is revolutionizing solar panels and making them used by the common man  users also responded to me and said the same thing about tesla s batteries  people fail to realize  musk bailed out solar city in 2015 and bought out his cousin  fellow south african billionaire  the tech was their before musk  same with tesla using panasonic batteries  he isn t making them accessible for the common man because the common man can t buy from him  he isn t the only business offering solar and most business are going to look elsewhere after the wal mart lawsuit    does musk get new people to use greener methods  yes  he is a salesman  selling things he didn t invent  does almost every other billionaire who owns any stock in any energy company get people to use greener methods  yes  why is musk different  because he s a meme and acting like he is your eco friendly buddy is way easier than being realistic    are environmentally conscious people following musks lead  no they ve had solar panels for a decade   they drive a 10 year old used car that doesn t need raw materials and lithium that tesla doesn t even know how to recycle    now here s what really gets me  people tell me all day that elon doesn t care about profits  he only cares about bettering the world  if you are in this sub and you believe this in your heart of hearts  take three steps back and literally fuck your own face  this is  an anti work sub www google com search q musk labor laws amp ie utf-8 amp oe utf-8 amp hl en-us amp client safari sbfbu 1 amp pi musk 20labor 20laws   so many fucking results  you could spend a day reading up on this union busting piece of shit  tell me why he doesn t care about money and then explain why someone who has no needs for profits milks every last penny from his workers  this link alone should tell you all you need to know    now on to tesla  i ll start off by saying what tesla  not musk  gets credit for  making an electric vehicle that a younger crowd and not environmentally aware crowd wants   tesla made the first electric vehicle to most people  while this is far from true  many see it as fact   the battery is made by panasonic  so don t be like users in the first thread i linked and praise elon for his battery break through  the battery is also the best feature of the car  don t get me started with other issues i have with the product   worst paint  amp  panel gaps in the business  interior feels like the plastic from a honda oddessy   self driving  bullshit that his idiotic customers believe and then pull some shit like reading while driving etc etc   i have him credit where credit is due  yes  if any musk stans actually read all this please tell me what you think  i d love to hear you still justify his praise by telling me how he is still different than the others  i am 100  sure some one out there will  i am prepared to answer with other ceos that maybe we could worship instead because they help more than hurt  why is he helping so much  because space x  do you miss the days we used to praise the astronauts and engineers and not the billionaire over lords who let them use a small fraction of their money  or is he helping because rich people are buying tesla s then trading them in three years later for a newer mercedes they ll drive for three years  maybe the new tesla roadster would help too  why make the cheapest ev you could for the masses when you could release an uber expensive one that goes fast     honorable mentions  thai cave incident  sec fining him over damaging tweets  his twitter is more comparable to donald trump than any other celeb   reddit user spilling his beans on space x ttps www reddit com r enoughmuskspam comments c7pmaf yes spacex really did falsify test documents no i utm source share amp utm medium ios app amp utm name iossmf    his claim to help flints water crisis  claiming to be socialist while union busting and being the largest donor for a republican pac  people believing neuralink is coming in a year or so  being a  green ceo  to all his lap riders and then selling them flame throwers they used once and forgot about    seriously if you read all of this and your thinking about what to comment to defend musk  please get the fuck out of this sub you boot licking piece of shit ,do8ric

12,Coercion and Choice,two arguments i see a lot from conservatives and capitalists  are as follows   1  labor for income is not coercive because you can choose to work somewhere else  or you can choose to be homeless and not work  2  labor for income is not coercive because nature is coercive  so the capitalist is actually doing you a favor by providing you a solution to your hunger  they are not exploiting your biological necessity   i have a couple of objections myself to these arguments  but i am interested to hear anyone else's takes ,dnx6nv

14,I quit. Feeling bittersweet about it.,hey reddit   cross posting this  should have posted here first    i quit my job  it feels so good  for months  i tried my hardest  absolute damn hardest to make it work  i was a manager at a big company and was extremely proud of my position and it was a big part of my identity  until i realized how difficult it was to manage people who are double your age and don't care about you or what you have to say  until i realized that people will call in for sneezing and then managers who are salaried have to always stay   until i realized that companies are eager to short staff their branches despite posting profit over profit each quarter  sometimes managers managed multiples branches with a minimal raise  until i realized nobody cared about what i had to say and just began to feel like i was a robot  nobody remembered the good i did  they remember the couple times i had to say no  i remember putting together gift bags for holidays and barely getting a thank you  i remember trying to get them to sign sympathy cards for other staff members losses and it was a bother   i took calls on vacations and off days for anything work related  i came in on days off if needed too  but it wasn't enough   i had to humble myself despite the fact that my family and friends were concerned that i would be stepping down from the great paycheck and title i worked so hard for  i quit  i feel bittersweet  happy the stress and toxic environment is gone but i feel like a loser  like as if i couldn't handle it and just walked away  like a failure  i feel like everyone is looking down upon me and i wish things could have been different  but money isn't everything when it's impacting your health and nobody wanted to work together as a team    and i am glad i am done  i just wanted this off my chest  just looking for support   thanks for reading ,do1adn

22,work culture promotes drug use.,how many caffeine addicts do you know   people grumpily wake up early to serve someone elses agenda which makes them miserable and run down to the point where they need drugs in order to be productive or even just to numb themselves from life   plenty of people can't even function before their first cup of coffee   then what do we do when the weekend rolls around   alcohol   to wind down and relax because we  deserve it  after a hard work week or don't know how to unwind without it   weed to mentally escape from the horrifying reality we live in   percs pain killers to literally numb ourselves from the daily stress   anti anxiety to ease us from   anxiety        i'm not saying this is the only reason why people take these drugs  but it definitely rings true for some ,dpy9nt

30,Jobs always want more of you,no matter what  i realized this pretty early on though not early enough considering how my dad's  dedication  to his job destroyed our family and any stability i could hope to have as a kid by putting us through endless ridiculous moves  and for what  my dad never even pretended to enjoy his job  it was a corporate job that always promised this time would be the last time we'd all have to move  sometimes to different  countries  that he wouldn't have to travel as much  just wait another year  i almost feel sorry for him if he actually believed them  the first and only corporate internship i had  i usually babysat for money but my dad figured that wasn't good enough  i never had any complaints  i love kids and it's fun easy summer work for me  and got me some job where his friend was the boss  it was clear there was no actual work for me to do  it was all bullshit  but they still had some girl  mentor  me  one day she asked me why i never asked her how i could  improve  my work  i told her that she'd never given me any indicator that my work was less than satisfactory  she said that i should be trying to do more than was asked of me  i laughed and told her this was just a job and i didn't really care about  honing my craft  or whatever she was trying to sell me  she was so offended  treated me like shit for the rest of the time    my social skills aren't great  probably has to do with moving constantly for my whole childhood  and i just can't give what the corporate environment wants  honestly though even if i did what amount of money could make me give up so much of my life for that  for nothing  if every corporate job disappeared tomorrow every jobless worker would be left with next to nothing in terms of actual practical skills for normal human life  automation  algorithms are coming for these jobs too  it's not like they're difficult to automate  it really makes me sad for the people in those jobs but relieved that i'm still pretty young and can avoid getting jobs that are essentially like games that rely on a loot crate based reward system but for your entire fucking life ,dpjfyk

34,Is this it?,hey r antiwork  i m a recent college grad who got a job right out  as lucky as i am  1000s of retyped resumes later  i m making as much money as my parents did when raising me  living at home and saving money  just a regular 8-4 in a field i majored in but could care less about  as a desk holder  this is what i worked so hard for so many years of school right    the first almost month they didn t assign me a drop of work and had me do online training through the video training sites  it crushed me  i leapt at the opportunity to pick the scraps off the floor to be the backup option on a project but  it became clear that my work was getting shot in the trash as deadlines loomed   now  not much has changed in 6mo  i just go in  not assigned any work to sit at a desk and pretend to be busy and be  present  in meetings    is this it  i just do this for the next 40 at various companies ,dpaod5
35,On Work and Appearance,i've been thinking a lot lately about the ways that work follows us even after we've clocked out   specifically  i ve been dwelling on how our jobs dictate the way we look inside and outside of work  for context  the majority of my experience comes from retail and office jobs  my current office is relaxed in its dress code  and most people adhere to something in the realm of  business casual  mostly i see jeans or khakis  and even shorts in warm weather  paired with anything from a basic t-shirt to a button down  there is rarely anyone wearing a tie in the office  let alone a suit jacket  yet like most offices it still feels like there is an unwritten acceptable  look  regardless of how relaxed the standard for clothing is     i am aware that my company is not in the norm regarding many of our appearance policies  and i am grateful for that  many employees have visible or semi-visible tattoos  and a few have their hair dyed  non-natural  colors  many companies would not allow even this level of expression be visible in the workplace  though it still feels like there is an unwritten understanding that being too far outside the mainstream is basically asking to put a freeze on your advancement mobility  or at the very least asking to get asked frequent questions about why you look different   obviously the dynamics of gender presentation   professionalism  client facing roles  cultural tradition  and many more factors impact how we look at work  however the way we present ourselves to our bosses leaves a lasting impact on how we are permitted to present ourselves to others in our lives  because dying my hair or getting an  unprofessional  hair cut or getting a visible tattoo might offend a potential employer  i m not allowed to alter these totally superficial parts of my body for longer than a weekend  i have no option other than to look within one standard deviation of every other drone in my office with no visible personality  even when i am in a situation outside of work where i can wear my own clothes  i feel like i still just look like a yuppie asshole wearing a costume    our bosses usually have an oppressive amount of control over what we look like at work  and because of this effectively control the limits of what our bodies can look like outside of work  the only choice we have is to slave away to afford clothes that will make us feel more like ourselves ,dp9l2x

38,Oliver Hart was a true underrated artist,no one really understands the experience that jades logic and paves an agnostic place to lay and decay in toxic waste so most carry identity paraphernalia to familiarize with smiles neatly painted on a robotic face but not this man  he played the bucket with his hands and got paid by whatever change people would drop in his can twenty-three years ago he was a lawyer by description but i guess all of a sudden he resigned from that position but i've never seen the sky quite as clear as his eyes as his blistered fingers beat down on the plastic and in a twisted sort of way it all makes sense while they rush to die he provides the soundtrack so tragic he sits on the corner of 7th and 1st and i was thirsty for the answer to a question anyone would nurse one day i asked he why he gave up his career he said   i didn't  i just took off the name tag  then he added  make money and die that's the american way it don't matter what name you gave the bucket that you play make money and die that's the american way it don't matter what name you gave the bucket that you play  so i took in what was said but i didn't accept it well maybe i did i mean i just wouldn't admit it i was too committed to the belief that all the hard work from now would improve my future existence somehow so i said  you don't accomplish nothing sitting in the street and i'm sure you barely survive off the pennies you gather he said  to your surprise i make enough to eat and i accomplish just as much as you only i stop pretending my job matters he looked me in my face and told me i was a puppet and what i do is no more important than playing a bucket i still hear his voice when i set my alarm before bed i never could wash what he said out of my head  so fuck it  it goes  make money and die that's the american way make money and die that's the american way make money and die that's the american way it don't matter what name you gave the bucket that you play make money and die that's the american way make money and die that's the american way make money and die that's the american way it don't matter what name you gave the bucket that you play  see i can dress myself up in a white coat and say i'm a doctor carry a knob on my belt buckle with a gold badge and say i'm a copper maybe i'm just a sloppy lazy crazy carbon copy part of the heartlessly deranged nation that gave me the generation ecstasy under water  i forgot the survivor of the mind washed and slaughtered  i've watched your offers  caught your calls and called your forefathers my bosses  lost it all in the name of gaining enough to spend  consuming the youth since those pray in doom for the hand my friends  see when i saw my man playing away on his drum something clicked in my brain and i became less dumb i'm working for bread crumbs pretending there's a meaning but my employment is just a bucket  i'm desperately beating and one day  i'll be old and retired looking at my life like what a waste of good fire all because school never taught me how to be inspired and the job concerned applying to myself just wouldn't hire,dp9ut2

40,Figured I’d post here to join the gang.,i work for a food packaging delivery company  a lot like schemas  we re a smaller company  supplying a 5 state area  we supply gas stations and grocery stores  markets etc  we have everything from candy  chips  snacks  to frozen meat  frozen breads  frozen pastries  to tobacco products  beauty products  and even chemicals like car fluids  and a lot more   i work in the freezer  in -20 degree temperatures   obviously  it s fucking shit  when you start  you re promised 4 10 hour shifts from 4pm- 2am  that never happens  you can t leave until all the orders for the next day are picked  and loaded onto the trucks  during the summer months  15 hour work days were not uncommon  every monday we were there until 7am  at least  the rest of the week was about 12-13 hours   now  the hours themselves i can deal with  but we have been at least 20 employees short of what is required to do the job since i ve been there  the middle management knows this  relays this to the upper management  but all they say is  have a better attitude and it won t be so bad  like really  the job is impossible to do with this many people  the management lies to their employees  telling them what they want to hear  but then going and literally doing the exact opposite of what they said    recently  it s gotten worse  they are hiring a huge amount of new people  however they don t make them start until 7-10pm  everyone starts at different times  and it leaves the rest of us to do 70  of the job ourselves  while everyone else gets to come in late and still leave at the same time as us  i don t know what they re trying to do with this  new shift  but it s supposed to take some of the workload off the rest of us  and recently they ve just fired someone because they  made a scene  and drilled the president about the horrible health insurance    this place is just a fucking shit show  none of our equipment works properly  no one comes into work  the night shift managers do literally nothing all night and just sit in the office and fuck off until something breaks down  then they fix it and go back to sitting down  3 person jobs and pawned off on 1 person  and they expect  better attitudes  out of everyone  i don t know how people have been working here and being ok with it  i m quitting before the end of november  and i hope it fucks them good  with 60  of the freezer being new people now  it ll be funny to know that i  one of the most knowledgeable working in there  will leave  making everyone else work harder   rant over  could go on for longer but it s already long af,dpd3rd

43,How is 9-5 a good work-life balance?,my country is generally overworked  people  including those in office jobs  complain about working overtime and not being able to leave   i'm supposedly one of those 'luckier' ones who leaves on time and have good work-life balance    the thing is  how is 9-5  or more like 8-6  a good work-life balance  say your day is broken up into 24 - 10  work  - 1 5  commute  - 1  breakfast and dinner  - 7  decent sleep    4 5 left for adult stuff like household chores and yourself  you are telling me this is balance  and there's those who work 12h shifts without weekends off    am i whiny  or are most people deluded  it's really insane to me that people think they all will live long and healthily enough to enjoy their earnings ,dpnxx4

49,Solutions (discuss),so theres plenty of posts of people complaining about the status quo  understandable but i think it would be nice for us to discuss some alternatives and solutions for a change  i dont mean voting and election related stuff  i mean tangible practical strategies for helping each other figure out a way out of the daily grind    some suggestions    1  starting a commune  finding some land or a place in ur own or another country to imigrate to  pooling resources to build and help build some idealistic socialist  or other  place where we could live sustainably  2  starting up buisnesses or self employment advice  like do people have marketable skills and or ideas for things that could be used for such ends   i do software development and are making video games in my spare time  i'd welcome other people with game devs related skills to contact me if they are interested in working on a some projects  maybe some day we could sell some games and break into self employment that way  3  off the grid living advice  how to's or directions to where to find such resources  like the details of buying land and getting planning permission  i know there are curtain kinds of mortgages in some places for the purchase of land with the intent of building your own house on it  that are cheaper than buying a house with a regular mortgage  for some of us  some savings and a good credit rating isnt to far out of the realm of reason  4  bit more wacky of an idea but crowd funding  charity  maybe if ubi isnt going to be government funded people would be willing to contribute to creating a ubi fund  of course who would be eligable for payouts and so forth would be a complicated matter  but prehaps some sort of small scale regional experiments could be done somehow    discuss ,do97ib

51,"I want to share my “change of mindset, change of life” story. Hoping to start a conversation and better understand how r/antiwork thinks.",wall of text  my apologies    i used to have this mindset  that rich people were assholes and because i was working a shitty dead-end job  that i was entitled to the free healthcare  housing and the works  hated everything remotely capitalist and attended a few minimum wage protests    at some point in my early twenties  something flipped in my brain - i needed to stop feeling sorry for myself and get my shit together because i couldn t wait for anything to change  i lost hope that politics in the us would change to benefit me in any way any time soon    i started reading leadership books  watching motivational speakers on youtube  researching entrepreneurship  i realized that i didn t have the ability to start my own business  so i started looking around for start-up companies that were hiring  it took two years from that point for me to find an entry level position at a company that hadn t even opened yet    when i got the job  i was employee number five on the payroll and the first hire to my department under the manager  my starting wage was  15 hr  which i thought was amazing because i was only making  8 50 hr before  literally felt on top of the world  after my first week  i had this crazy sense of opportunity at this company - it was a huge motivator for me    i made my job my priority and passion  because this was a brand new company  there weren t really any procedures in place  i started thinking about the best ways to run the storefront  typed up all my ideas and consistently presented them to my manager    six months after i started  there were now 7 employees working alongside me in the same entry level role  the manager was an older man  and had become less present over time  i figured that since he was gone most of the time that i could help the other employees get oriented    fast forward a couple months later and we were open  i was working 12hr days  doing everything i could to make the business successful  was i making the owner of the company a lot of money  yes  but  i knew that he had put in 5 years of work and dumped his life savings into starting this company without making a dime before this point    a year goes by  and i was promoted to  supervisor  making  20 hr  again  i was thrilled  i never thought i d be making this kind of money in my entire life  motivation was through the roof  however  i was also irritated because the department manager hardly did anything and was certainly making far more than i was  he got a new car  new clothes  i was jealous  but that drove me to push myself even harder    two years in  the department manager resigned  we had no one leading the department except for me  i figured that i would be moved into his role right after he left  but that didn t happen  i stayed at the same wage and same title  nothing  i was furious  and thought about leaving because i thought everything that i had done had gone unnoticed and unappreciated  i began drifting back to my old mindset  that the world was against me and i had no direction  but i had put in so much time and so much effort that i decided to stick it out    another year goes by  and now we re getting acquired by a corporation  son of a bitch  now  i was going to have to prove myself all over again to these new people  i was ripshit  but stayed on and continued to try my best    a few months later  the acquisition was final  and i was approached by the executive vice president of the corporation s operations division  we had just lost a couple managers from other departments because corporate thought they weren t a good fit  and i thought i was next on the chopping block  but to my surprise  they had offered me the position of operations manager with a probationary salary of  60k year    two thoughts went through my head in that conversation   finally  and  holy shit  am i capable of this  i had no idea what was going to happen  but i pushed on and worked my ass off  still 12 hour days  and now working from home on my days off  i was non-stop and started burning out    they saw what i was doing  and shockingly after my probationary period was up  i got a review and a massive raise to  80k a year  again  i was on top of the world and now responsible for the success of a team of 60 people  including 5 managers below me    last month  over 4 years after starting at the company  i was approached again and given a heads up that they want me to soon take over as the regional director for my corner of the country  this role will put me in charge of 4 locations and almost 200 people  and is sure to send my salary somewhere into six-figure range    i know my situation is unique   rare  and progressing this quickly is nowhere near normal  but my outlook on life has changed  and my sense of self responsibility has skyrocketed  i no longer look at the wealthy and think  fuck you  now it s  i want to be you    yes  there are some filthy rich scumbag motherfuckers out there that don t deserve what they have  but i don t compare myself to them anymore  i m not jealous  i m in charge of my life and how it turns out  and hopefully i m able to make others lives better along the way  if i ever am fortunate enough to enter the ranks of the 1  i won t be selfish because i get it  i came from almost nothing and know how it feels to struggle every day - rent or food  gas or medicine  helping others is what i really want to do someday     -  again  just wanting to start a thoughtful conversation and hear your honest thoughts of my current situation  do you feel i am wrong or contributing to the nature of the country for making the changes i did ,dnvnvo

62,Words,this may be a rant  i haven t fully formulated what i want to say yet  but i need to vent to someone and this seems as good a place as any   i recently moved across state from a rural town to a city  i m lucky enough to have family here that is letting me stay with them until i can afford a place of my own   21  btw  i m a creative person and i was hoping it would have more opportunity for me   after being turned down by a few places and ignored by many during my job search  out of semi-desperation i filled out an application for ups  at completion of the form  i was automatically booked to meet with them for a tour at 5am in a few days  after taking the tour  the guide asked us pretty much point-blank who was in  i originally wanted to give it a day or two to think it over but since this seemed like a take it or leave it sorta deal i raised my hand   in retrospect  i believe this is the reaction they were banking on    fun fact  the job is pretty bullshit  they said so up front  didn t beat around the bush on that  which i admire  in some respects  but yeah  getting up at 2 50-3am  driving 20 minutes and stuffing 1 200 boxes into four trucks by myself for five hours with a 15-minute break is pretty bullshit  especially for a skinny shrimp like me who s not really that physically minded in the first place   so needless to say  this is taking quite a toll on me  mostly emotionally and mentally  i ve always try to do my best for my employers and this job isn t an exception  so it s disheartening when it feels what i do isn t good enough to get the job done well  emphasis on  feels  there  because deep down i know that it isn t a problem with me  they ve literally said that i m in a  shitty situation  somewhat apologetically  most other workers load three trucks with less packages going into each   all i do now is sleep  dread work  spend money  i think the money component is an effort at escapism  i ve been investing more in things that make me happy  like my art  or books  but this means i m quite literally living paycheck to paycheck  no real savings to fall back on  i m pretty desperate to get out of there   especially with christmas around the corner  but i just don t feel i should consider that option until i have other work savings lined up  i m doing my best to get other work but i m worried that the longer i wait the worse for wear i ll be   so that s a bunch of words  sorry  maybe this sub isn t the best fit for them  just wanted to let it out  thanks for listening  feel free to advise if you feel so led ,dox1ta

67,Job position was blatantly misleading [RANT],i've been working at a company for over a year now and every year or so have to switch roles  my first year has been pretty bad  the role i was offered was not at all like what i got  in fact i barely was given any work at all  but because this is my first job out of college i've stayed in fear of what damage it would do to my resume if i left a company a couple months in  here i am again  i chose a few positions i found out what my job will be next year  it sounded amazing on paper  the job title and description were what i wanted  after it's secured i found out the actual job title does not at all reflect what i will be doing  i'm just stuck here not knowing what to do and pretty depressed  the only thing that's been keeping me going in the past has been the possibility of actually having this type of job and i feel lied to and misled  i don't think there's anything i can do about it either  i could leave the company  but i want to leave the state and my so is stuck here until the end of 2020    worst part is everyone irl has told me  welcome to the real world  and been completely unsympathetic  im not whining about it  i've only told a couple of close friends and they don't seem to get it  they've all told me that you never will get a job that's anything like the description and that you just have to tell yourself what you're doing is meaningful  is this life ,dp8dks

95,Celebrating a decade of burnout and exhaustion.,i'm 29  going on 84   i'm so god damn tired  i have worked myself into a relatively cushy office job but that makes no difference  i work the same 40 hours as everyone else  doing tedious mental gymnastics for a local health board's it department   it's  on paper  the best job i've ever had but all i can think about while i'm at my desk is crawling home to spend an hour with my kids before they go to bed   i had a taste of a  free life  when i was still a kid  i was homeschooled between the ages of 11 and 15  and the sense of freedom to be able to up an leave the house any day of the week and go anywhere i wanted was massively under appreciated by 12 year old me   i had the same freedom in 2008 after the recession hit at i was unemployed  besides degrading myself for an hour or two a day by groveling for a job i had total freedom over my time  it was amazing   i've been constantly employed since 2010 and i've never had the time or money for a holiday  every day is more exhausting than the last and not even weekends are a rest because those two days are my only chance to maintain my rental property to the standards laid out in my tenancy agreement   i have retired boomer family who advise me to work extra hard in order to stand out at work  to push for more responsibility in the hopes of promotion  to strive for my dream job  but no matter how many times i spell it out for them they don't get it   my dream job is to not ever need to work again  to spend all my time exploring hobbies and chilling out with my wife and kids  to finally feel rested   it's never going to happen for me   but on the bright side  only 37 more years until i reach new zealand's retirement age and get to just keep on working because in what world are we going to be able to afford retirement ,dpeduw
96,I don't now what to do,i don't know where exactly to post this  i'm sorry if this breaks some rule  but i really need it to reach someone   i've spiralling down into a cycle of existential doubt

r antinatalism   r foreveralone https www reddit com r foreveralone   r aboringdystopia https www reddit com r aboringdystopia   r collapse https www reddit com r collapse   r misanthropy https www reddit com r misanthropy  etc  i would be a member of  r sanctionedsuicide https www reddit com r sanctionedsuicide  if it still existed  i occasionally lurk their forums  my view of the world and my life is one of anger  regret and shame  i can't find any hope  and i'm constantly coping and procrastinating due to having no willpower  motivation  i'm not suicidal though  which i guess makes me  sane  enough not to be thrown into the psychiatric system or medications right away  i don't have delusions  i do have mild anxiety  i'm more of a melancholic   the point is that i don't think any of this is due to having  negative thoughts   like it were something i can change magically  or me  having an illness   i think the cause to be the state of the world  things don't work for me  and i just can't get out of this negative state i've been over the last years  i think my melancholy and my rage against the system  people  my past  my lack of romantic partners and my social anxiety are too much to bear  there's just no way back for me  it's like i've discovered some truth  some hard and dark truth  about the world  everything loses its mystery  its magical properties  and becomes meaningless  there's no point in pain  there's no point to self-improvement  to keep going  still i keep going forward  like inertia  the state of anhedonia is everywhere  i want a partner  yet i don't care to go out or plan dates  i want to study  yet i procrastinate  i want to write  read  exercise  yet i game for hours without feeling much better   i'm tired of the common sense advice of  go see a therapist   exercise   eat healthy   wake up at 4am and make world peace  those things may work for  normies  people who are stable enough and alienated enough so that they don't see life as something bad  that have  all in all  a sense of progress  a sense of hard work and pain paying off in the future  protestant ethic  a good social circle  success in their romantic lives  they can  at least  relieve their sexual impulses  but for the many who are left out of the  normal  pleasures of life  who are left out of hope in the future  hope of finding a  good job  or  buying a house   because they realize those goals are nonsense  etc  what's left for them  for them  therapy is useless  and medication is almost an insult  you can't change reality and your life keeps sucking  so you are drugged to  calm down  and become a cog in the machine once again  therapy can't do anything against systemic pressures  bad luck  or huge feelings of anhedonia and depression  the same goes for the other advice  exercise  play an instrument  go out  i'm miserable everytime  and i don't think life is worth creating or living in the slightest  my life is like a collection of numbing alienating breaks in between of pain  boredom  stress  sadness   i really think there's like two different worlds people belong to  and at least i am in the world in which no matter what i do  what attitude i try to take  nothing matters  nothing gives me any kind of realization  any kind of joy  i've been humiliated  bullied  rejected  treated condescendingly  forgotten so many times that i have no will to try in social life anymore  i don't care about meeting new people  i would want to have sex and a relationship  and this may look contradictory  i just don't want to deal with the process anymore  my interests and my personality are not made for this ruthless system of competition  i don't care about jobs  making money  having a good resume  i literally hate the way the world functions and i can't accept it  i can't  fit in  this system is madness  the only thing i look forward to is to do nothing at the end of day  to lay in bed for hours indulging in entertainment  porn  music  maybe i'm horribly desensitized by this consumption  i also have symptoms of adhd  the point of the matter  however  is that my worries and thoughts about life by far surpass anything that could be explained by mere addiction theory  or so i believe  as i also have a lot of other fronts to cover   reddit is an escape mechanism  i get to comment and read posts from people like me or that think like me in some areas  it's a safe space  safe from all the bullshit media culture  social media pages  social ostracism or social judging  i can write whatever passes through my head  no repressed emotions  ideas  if i hate working  i can vent  if i feel depressed i can go look other people who are going through the same thing  if i'm angry about society  i can complain and share ideas freely  without being afraid  bless this webpage and some of its communities  however  i cannot but think they've radicalized and veered me off some  good path  of obedience  discipline  positivity  i was bitter and angry before  but i never had this kind of existential hatred and philosophies and or groups of people truly dedicated to understanding it   i don't know what to do  i don't know which attitude to take  how to be motivated  i don't know how to even begin to work on my goals and not return to a cycle of hatred and hedonism  i've tried the usual diet   exercise   going out combo for months  i've tried  r nofap https www reddit com r nofap   r stopgaming https www reddit com r stopgaming   r nosurf https www reddit com r nosurf  etc  i've turned off my pc and uninstalled everything more times than i can count  i've tried meditating  learning languages  changing countries  travelling  making new friends  nothing does it for me  i am not consistent  i'm always back at square one  with a horrible sensation of despair  always unable to do what i'd like to be doing  always being a shadow of what i could be  there's something about people who succeed in fixing their lives and achieving really big changes in their way of life and their social romantic lives  something that i don't know if i have because i don't even know what it is  i've always felt i was incomplete  like i wasn't like the rest  i didn't have that easiness about work  friends  studies  romantic partners  etc  that they had  i had the existential doubts and despair that they didn't  but i'm sure i'm missing out on some key factors   i don't even know why i'm posting this  to cope  to seek help  to vent  to share my experience  to motivate discussion  i have no idea  i would like to thank anyone who read this mess of a post  where i constantly ramble about myself  have a good day ,dpaywd

98,"automation of jobs, and an idea",ever since i was a kid  my parents have always told me that robots were gonna come and take all the low-end jobs  they're easy to produce  cost way less than having humans there  and are far more accurate  and they were always scared of it  it didn't make sense to me then  and doesn't make sense to me now  if all the menial taskwork we need done can be done by robots  then why not just give people money and let them do what they want  and let the robots do their job    like  i'm wording this weirdly  but it seems like  robots are going to take all the minimum wage jobs  should be something to be celebrated  but because capitalism  it means people have to work even harder to not only find jobs but keep them  because they're competing against perfect machines to be paid  15 an hour  it makes no sense   idk  automation has always been super interesting to me  and it seems like a combo of 1  higher taxes on the rich  especially ceos  2  automation of minimum-wage jobs  and 3  redistribution of the wealth from the ceos to those who were laid off by the robots should at least give people time to pursue something that they enjoy doing  instead of work  the robots are cheaper to maintain  so if prices stay the same  or even drop  the ceos and robot managers are making more money at the same rate of sale  and then that can be funnelled back into the pockets of the working class   it's not as complete-anarchy as i want it to be  but it's the best explanation i've found that my dad  a hardcore capitalist  who still believes in capitalism after having to file for bankrupcy when his store shut down last christmas  actually believes might work  so  thoughts,do2721

132,I am 30 years old and have never had a job. I have the benefit of somewhat supportive parents (financially) but not emotionally. Yet the worse thing to me is ending up in a wage-slave relationship. What should be my plan of attack?,basically  my parents have helped me financially all these years because that's their only way of showing affection  most of the emotional issues i deal with is due to their somewhat toxic behavior    i have never had a job due to being somewhat picky and not wanting a worse life  there is a lot of terrible advice online when it comes to job submission  don't complain  work hard  don't think you are better than the position  anyone want to work for a toxic chemical plant or a factory that destroys your hearing  or amazon that lets a person die from a heart attack  just be glad you are employed at all    to me  the rants  mantras  and justification towards wage-slave labor feels very similar to how people justify buying apple products    it is a cult    anyways  i want something that will give me the skills to progress within a healthy dynamic within work  for example  if i get  any job  and end up in retail fast food  then 5 to 10 years down the line  i will only be qualified for more fast food and retail work   due to the forced selectivity  i could not gain better working conditions because there are many more desperate people willing to work for less and work longer in these positions    basically  my goals are more inline within the  so good they can't ignore you  mindset than the cult of work mindset of employed  any at all    good    what would you suggest ,doskpj

135,PTSD-type fear of time clock systems?,this may sound a bit weird but i thought some people here would probably understand  i am very afraid of the fact that my job is now out of nowhere using a fingerprint time clock instead of allowing us to report our time then have our managers check over it  i know this is normal for most workers but i have a weird fear and probably privilege for being in a field  digital marketing  where we are supposed to be professionals and having a college degree from a well regarded school   this job is way better than my last one but i am already scared that this is going to be used to fire me because i know other people have said that  time theft  is an excuse for firing many companies use   at my old job  every minute and second of our work day was monitored through a computer application time clock that required us to log when we used the bathroom to have it deducted from our breaks  took screenshots of our computers  alerted managers if we visited a non-work-related website then tried to clock us out for it  and clocked us out if we stopped typing or moving the mouse for more than five minutes  it was apparently used against many employees to build a case to fire you or force you to quit  not to mention to dock people s pay    after this experience  i became traumatized  my doctor actually put me on disability from the panic from this job  so now when my new  better job added this time clock out of nowhere  it makes me feel like the world is closing in on me  it feels like this is the first step to  cracking the whip  and workplace tyranny starting here  this is even though my boss likes me  compliments me  and has given me more hours   though some of my duties did get changed a bit for reasons not related to performance    obviously punctuality  time on task  and not taking breaks are not the kind of metrics that bode well for me so i am really scared of the consequences of a mess up  especially since this is the closest thing to a good job i have had in years and i may never find a job as good as this one    have any of you had a similar aversion to time clocks or tracking ,dkudt1

149,Productivity and self-worth,i'm facing an entirely new situation  i'm not busy at the moment  basically i'm having some time off as i'm in between jobs and have enough savings so that i do not need to work for the next weeks    and it's harder than i thought  i discovered that in my mind my self-worth is tied to my productivity  productivity meaning here working to earn money  i feel useless and at the same time know that this feeling does not make sense   i'm wondering why i feel that way  i'm using my time off for all kinds of things  seeing my family and friends  i've lived far away from them for the past 7 years so it's special to have the opportunity to simply meet for a coffee and spend some time together  my parents are getting older  who knows how much time i've got with them  i'm helping my parents around the house  i'm working on a novel  roam the woods for mushrooms  knit  read the books that have been sitting on my shelves for years  visit workshops  but i do not earn money  i am not productive    in this time with the glooming thread of climate change producing masses of unnecessary goods and selling them all over the world is a huge problem  as of now i am not participating in that game  i do not produce anything  i do not cause harm  that's more than many people can claim for themselves  yet i feel useless    are you familiar with that mindset  how did you break out of it  how can i as an individual and we all as a society stop to see productivity and work as the holy grail  the way to measure our worth ,dm21r3

154,"Guys, a question. Please help me out.",so  i left my toxic job  relaxing  to say the least  i gave the resignation a few weeks back   after 7 months  i was still in probation  so there was no need for me to serve the notice period  but i wanted closure  so  i agreed to the notice period    2 weeks before  my senior  aka an idiot had asked for something  i had taken leave between those days and when i came back  there was a network issue the whole week    i promptly was unable to do it  now this guy called me up and started yelling at me at which i cut the call and left office  taking an impromptu leave     when he called me today  i didn't pickup his calls nor respond to his messages   well  he escalated this to the manager  who called me and told me that i'm an incompetent idiot  and told me off    now  my mental health  i'd have to say that  isn't always the best  i'd had breakdowns due to this job earlier and his telling me off just pushed me off the edge quite a little bit  i was on the verge of depression again   if i was the way i was before  i definitely would have killed myself    now after this  i didn't pick up the call at all  from anybody  i was not feeling good enough to pick up any calls at all  so when they called  i didn't pickup any calls   now the manager has whatsapped me asking me what happened  why i am not responding etc  his last message was threatening me  saying that if i don't pick up his calls  he will report me as missing me to the police  i don't know if that's legally possible  that is one part of my question   also  should i give them any closure  should i explain why i left   i feel like i dont owe him that  but i need your advice ,dl3og9

160,The main problem with the 40hour work week (for me at least),tldr at bottom  i see a lot of people complain about the 40 hour work week and a lot say it's bad for different reasons  some state it's cause it tires you out so much which is true  some say that it doesn't pay enough for the amount of work which is definitely true  and most state the lack of breaks which is really true  my main problem is how it effects experiencing life  i've always been a i would rather have a experience than a expensive object sort of person  so i've always liked enjoying life  the problem with work isn't that it stops you from enjoying life  plenty people will argue that you can just plan around your work  work gets rid of spontaneity and that's it's biggest crime  when i was working minimal because of school  about 16 hours  i loved being able to do something on the drop of a hat  dad wants to get a beer and watch the game on a random tuesday  sounds awesome  parents have tickets they can't use so they're up for grabs  sounds like a fun night  work gets rid of moments like that  either because you're working  you have to wake up early the next day for work  you have a family so your free time is spent watching the kids  or you're so exhausted all you want to do is sleep  life shouldn't always be planned out  life should be an experience that changes and grows  we shouldn't be stuck in a rut and fill out forms to experience life  tldr  40 hour work week gets rid of the spontaneity and enjoyment out of life,dn4shy

198,"Just a reminder: When you’ve been understaffed for months and your boss says, “We just can’t find any good candidates,” what they really mean is, “We’re not willing to pay someone the market rate for their services.”",really  there are plenty of people out there with the skills necessary for the job who would be happy to take a job where they re paid what they re worth  this is especially true for jobs that don t require complex training  like cashiers  hostesses  etc  yet those are the jobs that are chronically understaffed  go figure    the perfect example is my company right now  our staff was halved when people just started leaving  i ve watched my managers interview literally dozens of people for the job over the course of 8 months  and almost all of them were highly qualified  they have hired no one  and keep saying that there s a  skills gap   yeah  the gao is between what people are worth and what they re willing to pay them  which is too damn low    my managers now keep trying to trick me and my one other coworker into working 12 hour days  6 days a week  they ve declined virtually any time off request with the excise that we re too understaffed  they phrase it as a great overtime opportunity  but even if that were the case  what about those initial 8 hours a day in which we re expected to work twice as hard for the same pay    the bottom line  if you re working extra hard to make up for having so little staff  then technically you re enabling your employer to pay people below market rate  including your own pay ,dmlcig

Here is my story and I need your suggestions please.,i'm  35m  originally from a india and i live in a first world country for the last five years and have acquired citizenship  our  my wife and no kids  current net worth is 210k usd and 30k usd in a fund similar to 401k   i may inherit 50k usd from our parents  i'm working since 21 and work has never appealed to me  i'm on  r antiwork  so enough said    i can live in india without working for rest of my life with the money we've got  my wife and i could do some simple work back home with very reduced hours days to continue saving or if we are bored  i'm pondering now if that's a good option  living in india obviously comes with a hell of a pollution  corrupt government  bribery  and you know the rest  but working 9-5 everyday is more shit than that    i have to tell you my work here is a breeze  i work 9 - 4 and work from home one day a week  i watch movies and get drunk on that day  my actual work is less than 8 hours week and sometimes i can go to work with out doing any actual work for weeks together  the worst i've done is 20 hours of actual work  my wife's work is cool too  we don't know if we want to keep doing this stuff for few more years and save more money  we have simple lives  or to stop doing it in a year and move back  but sitting still 9-4 everyday has given me depression and i sometimes want to kill myself  i can't do things i like here because work and commute drains all my energy   i see a 4 hour workday with enough time for me to pursue my hobbies in india and i have a big family there so we wouldn't feel alone as we feel here   and i can always go back to my new country if this set up sucks    i love this community and i strongly feel  r antiwork is not about being lazy but people with a heightened sense of ways of living and don't succumb to the stupid idea that life is about buying a house and a fancy car and impressing people  i would like to know your thoughts ,dm8yqw

It's a trap and a surrender to capitalist realism,workers create the material world  before and after socialism  everything that exists was made by us   the reason why work sucks is that it's not on our terms  we won't have jobs in a better world  just occupations where we control the value we produce  until then  we have to use our work as a threat of strike action against capital   taking your ubi check and staying home is a bribe not to strike  it's a pacification  advocating for ubi is stating your belief that there is no alternative to capitalism and nothing can fundamentally change  it's giving up preemptively ,dlzahu

215,I really recommend this sub reads Das Kapital by Marx.,i've been making my way through this unit on audiobook and it's honestly amazing how much of marx' observations during the british industrial revolution hold true today  there has been times during the book when i had to listen to a passage over again because i was so astounded at what marx had written in the 19th century was pretty much things i had seen observed here in different forms  topics such as  overpopulation driving down wages https en wikipedia org wiki reserve army of labour  or improvements in technology only working to increase the profits of the capitalist at the expense of the worker    it's a very long time intensive book which at times can be confusing but it's well worth the effort  contrary to popular belief  marx was not some megalomaniacal supervillian hellbent on establishing an oppressive dictatorship but a man who saw the injustices of his time and sought to put forward a means to address them ,dmxqy4

218,How the F Did This Happen?,ok  so this story is long  about five years long  but basically  i was hired in 2014 by a guy from indeed  i worked for him for three years and he was horrible at being a manager and would leave work and never be there and people would be mad and it was always my coworker and me  well  i quit and fast forward to last year  he calls me and tells me that he valued me as an employee and was hoping i would come back to work for him  i was hesitant  but he said things would be different and he'd pay me more  i was needing money  so i joined back up  and things were good for a while  but  then things started to be horrible again  he had me do tasks that weren't in my job description and i got injured doing them and he told me well thats what good employees do  he was very unprofessional and would say things that were off color or racist  well one day he pulled me into his office  this was about a month ago and said he wasn't going to be coming to work anymore and that i would have to answer to my coworker  i was confused and he told me that i didn't need to understand and to not tell anyone that he would be gone  if anyone asked i would tell them he was in a meeting  i thought this was so odd  so i talked to my dad about it  he saw my coworker as a client and he mentions it to her and asks her whats going on  my coworker tells my boss and then this happens  i am sitting at my desk doing work when my boss comes flying into the office  he starts screaming at me and cursing and pushes me into my desk  he tells me that i should have just kept fucking quiet and that i was stupid and he was furious  he leaves and i am shook the fuck up  a week later i made a simple error and my boss blew it out of proportion  he told me he had to fire me because of my mistakes  i was so angry that i told him he knew i didn't do anything serious  he ignored me and told me he had to fire me  i immediately went to file unemployment and even though i was fired  i wasn't fired for anything in writing  so they said i would most likely qualify at the unemployment office  a week went by and my family encouraged me to file a complaint with labor and industries for a hostile work environment and unfair termination  i went and told them the whole story and my caseworker was shocked at my bosses behavior  this was all on friday  well  now i don't know whats going to happen and i am kind of nervous  because i don't like screwing people over and i know my boss could lose his whole business because of this  but  why do i feel bad   it's because i still care and forgive people and thats my mistake  my boss doesn't care what happens to me  but i don't like doing the same to him  yet its too late  is this some sort of stockholm abuse thing i am going through    amp x200b   tl'dr-long time bossed physically assaulted me and verbally abused me and then fired me  i reported him to the state  but feel bad for doing so  is this some sort of stockholm syndrome thing i am going through where i still want to protect my abuser ,dkur39
219,Just got a job where I do nothing for 90% of my day,for the last 5 years of my life since i entered the workforce in earnest  working has been the  1 cause of my worsening mental state  it's not that i'm lazy at all  i'm just  not the kind of person who feels okay about throwing so much of my life away making money for other people  which i'm sure a lot of you can relate to    then about two months ago  i got a job at a university dispatch center  i have never had a job like this before  where i could just go in and read a book or draw and get paid for it  we have a low call volume and my boss doesn't care what i do with my downtime  everyone else there hates how boring it is  but i love it  it's the only job i've ever had any positive feelings towards  i've been taking some online programming classes in my downtime there and i've read more books in the last few months than i have in years  the pay isn't very good  but it's enough for me to pay my bills and have a bit left over  which is all i really need   i think i was so stuck on finding a job that i would enjoy that i hadn't even considered that there are plenty of jobs that don't really require much of you except to show up  sure  i have the odd stressful day and deal with a lot of stupid people  but it certainly beats working in food service  not to mention when i am actually doing work  it's work that helps people  i'm so fucking relieved,dkkll5

229,Job hopping like a happy bunny,hey everyone  last night i stumbled upon this sub and read as many posts as i could and i think i want to share my thoughts  this will be a long post so here's a tldr   job hopping helped me gain perspective on what is  normal  in a workplace    i am an almost 25 years old woman  i have attended university and the years i was there were extremely busy but also extremely fulfilling  i studied classics and linguistics  in my country this is a kind of prestigious degree  not on par with lawyers or doctors  but close in a way  i also tutored children and teens for little to no money but i covered my expenses  i was so happy  i woke up every day at 6 00 with no alarm clock  exercised  took care of my diet  went to my classes  had the perfect notes i would share with anyone who needed them and after 9 hours of class i would tutor for 2 or 3 hours    in 2016 my family had some financial problems  i live with my mother  my father has passed away  and the government cut almost half her pension  which was not large at all to begin with  for two years i tried to push through with cutting my expenses and tutoring in order to help us  but it was not enough  so  when the father of one of my students told my that their business was hiring  i took the opportunity and got my first job    it was okay  i was not passionate about it like i am with teaching  but the money was good enough and the hours were fair  no overtime  paid vacation etc  after a year and a half it got tedious and some things came out of the woodwork  i was the only young person  and woman  in there so i had to endure many absurd comments  my work was not fulfilling  i was a bad fit and i do not say that as a bad thing  i just didn't click with this job  no big deal  that's how i see it now  at that moment i was rather sad and frustrated    so  i applied to any job i thought would be a better fit for me  i was lucky enough to find a job as a secretary for a private school  i loved everything there except for the owner  my boss was horrible  he would swear  insult me  use vulgar language for the shock of it  everyone avoided him  all my co-workers said that they had cried at work and that it is normal to feel frustrated in there  so  i tried to do my job and ignore his insults  that was until he told me i would be working 12 hours on saturdays and sundays  we had a  discussion  meaning i presented my arguments and he yelled and barked at me that i was lazy  entitled  the whole nine  just because i wanted one day of the weekend for my family and friends    the next day i didn't go to work  one morning when he was not there i went to sign my papers and take the money he owed me  i had already found another job at a publishing house  again as a secretary  my feelings were not good for this one since the interview but i needed the money  they didn't match my previous salary  they expected me to stay overtime  no extra money  of course  and the owner  an 83 year old man  was a handful  he would storm in 2 hours before closing  swearing for no reason and expected me to do many things out of my duties and stay overtime because he arrived late  he would also go on long  passionate speeches about my generation and how difficult we have it and how we must fight the man and claim what is ours  all that while he didn't want to give me 10  above minimum wage   i stayed with him for 10 days  why  when my cousin went into labor and i asked to leave an hour early because things were not going well  he told me that my cousin would still be in the hospital in one hour and i could go then    i had another offer by a young man and his sister who operate an e-shop with decorative items and furniture  i took it on the spot  when i went to quit my boss told me i was unethical  that no one would want to hire me and give me more than the minimum wage  unless i worked in a brothel and that it is a good thing my father is dead and he can't see what his daughter has become    i cried on the pavement outside work and took 10 days to myself where i mostly sorted out the garage and drank  i was afraid of my new job but i couldn't admit it to anyone    yesterday was my first day  no one yelled  no one cursed me when things didn't go well  even though i have experience on the job  they didn't expect me to know everything  they trained me by showing me everything and answered my questions  we even joked and shared some stories  when they told me i could use the coffee maker if i wanted coffee  something the other bosses didn't allow  it clicked  this is what normal is  at least for work  not crying  not yelling  not swearing  just working side by side  tackling tasks and having a laugh along the way   i am still not too optimistic but things finally seem to go well and with my new peace of mind i will try to make more of my life and pursue the things i am passionate about ,dldkb5
230,Boss ruining my day in one sentence; questioning my sanity sometimes,my boss at my minimum wage slacker job  i picked this job specifically because i only need to be physically present and  aside from that  can do whatever i want with my time  just noticed that i read a book and asked me what it was  she then flat out asked me whether i  wouldn't want to make something out of  my life someday  which triggered a lot of anger and shame i guess   i am 25 and had good grades in school but always felt alienated  got kicked out of three schools and after graduating  five years ago  got hit with depression really hard  i've come a long way since then and realized a lot about our fucked up culture  how conditioned we all are  how most people have their self worth tied to their success in the system  in job titles  reviews  credits etc   in our family we had the good fortune of growing up with a father who came from  nothing  and  made something out of himself  all the while not gaining an inch of inner peace or doing anything really worthwhile for society or anyone but our material welfare inside the family  he still drank himself to near death  had a stroke  was overweight and neglected his mental health and spiritual wellbeing  essentially emotionally neglecting us in the process of it all  i consider that a gift and a curse  since i realized early that the rewards of modern capitalistic society are mostly empty  he also was very permissive and tried to never shape my opinions in any way  always respecting my feelings and never judging me  which is probably the perfect breeding ground for someone with  adjustment disorder  lol   now  i don't know how i want to proceed from here on out  what i don't want is to make these decisions out of status or monetary fear like almost everyone does  i luckily don't have to pay rent for the foreseeable future  but god the fucking pressure is almost unbearable sometimes   everyone questions you all the time and you internalize that voice in school    i sometimes feel like i'm radicalizing and deluding myself with those ideas instead of ariving at a more accurate picture of reality  so i guess i'm just looking for validation and reassurance that i'm not going crazy ,dlfkop

232,Does anyone else think the Mars colony is undesireable?,i understand why people are excited about mars being colonised by itself but not why people would still sign up and be excited knowing that a private company is involved  it doesn't seem futuristic and sci-fi  it feels tired  just another century of  whoever has the gold makes the rules  gone wrong   1  straight off the bat  a private company owning the colony means there is no space that is 'publically' owned  and belonging to you  a citizen  by right  where do you go when you want to get away from elon musk's corporate colony culture  2  because the colony is owned by a private company and it's on another planet  the laws of earth don't apply  the corporate laws created by elon musk apply  in order to gain the most profits for elon musk's company  the working and living laws will be created to get the best out of musketeers who are willing to work 80 hour workweeks to prove their undying love to elon musk  best of luck to non-white people  women  transgender people  disabled people  old people  and families   3  it will be densely populated with musketeers who think working 80 hours a week for elon musk's personal legacy is the pinnacle of their existence  if you have any issues with the way things are run up in there you cannot breathe one word of it to anyone else  because you're surrounded  and you cannot trust corporate drones  4  cult of personality is inevitable with people far from their family  their friends  with no space to call their own outside of the corporation   while being overworked and over-stressed  with delusions of grandeur about the work they're doing  in other words it would be a shitshow ,dndyqn

239,Stressed Out and a Bit Worried,i hate unloading and ranting on an anonymous forum  but i need some sort of outlet right now  hope you all will bear with me       this week has been stressful  really stressful  like  if the apocalypse shed light  and you could use a magnifying glass to focus that light  my stress would be akin to an ant being crispy-fried by that apoca-beam       not getting into details because they're too mind-numbing to even list  but folks should have a clear mental picture of the work environment right now when i say  white collar job  during a project crunch       anyway  on top of that  we have big wigs in the office this week with their entourage  as in  my boss's boss's boss and all of his team  on top of  that  the big-wig-ening has now required me to have two days of all day meetings - 8am to 6pm - with a  generous  15 min lunch to break up the monotony  oh  and a single 5 minute restroom break allowed in the afternoon  can't forget that kindness       on top of all  that  last night we had a  team-building fun event  scheduled  i said and meant  night  literally  because it went from 6 00 - 9 30pm  during the majority of which it was dark out  oh  and this event  golf  drinks schmoozing and a  light dinner  at an indoor putting range  was being held one city over  45 min - 1 hour away from my office and home       no offense to anyone who likes golf and alcohol  but i hate them  i hate schmoozing even more  i hate being out late  45 min away from my house at 9 30 at night  even more than any of those things       i didn't go and didn't give any excuses       the evening was much less stressful for not having gone  but now i'm a bit worried as to how much ass-kissing points i've lost by not going  it's close to end of the year and the attendant annual reviews that go with it  and i  the pessimist i am  can imagine how easily the swath of good work i've done could be overlooked and count for nothing in light of me not being a  team player  at the big wig-ening       that's about it  i guess  i wish there were a better end to the rant and some nice  but everyone was okay with everything and work worked out  closure  but instead i'm stressed and wondering why i took 5 minutes to write out a message board post when i should have been doing something work related  and then i'm feeling a bit dejected and mad at myself that i'm paranoid enough to be worried about taking a 5 minute break       bleh  end transmission ,dlz08j

245,Toxic Bullying culture at work,i m in the u k  currently signed off work for stress  i ve been in my retail job 11 years  in that time my managers have tried unfairly dismissing me  and have blocked me moving up  both in and out of the company  through lying or being wilfully inflexible  in the last three years i was placed with an older colleague  he claimed the management were trying to bully him out  his mental health began declining  he became increasingly difficult to work with  he would rail at me over trifling differences of opinion on procedural things in front of customers  he would be absent for months at a time with stress  because he was in litigation with the management  they began managing at an increasing distance  that meant responsibility for running the shop all but fell to me    in june last year  my colleague completely lost the plot and started swearing at me and physically threatening me  i d never reported his behaviour before as i knew he had mental health issues and issues with the management  at the same time i couldn t continue being abused by my colleague  he d crossed the line so i reported him  but asked not to raise a formal grievance  i thought that if i gave him the space to reflect he d realise i wasn t his enemy and he d have room to climb down and apologise on his own  my manager had a different idea and decided to raise a formal grievance as a matter of his  duty of care  he convinced me that i effectively had a similar duty of care to ensure the issue was properly addressed so no one else would be bullied  i provided a statement  he was found  guilty  after an investigation  he wasn t fired  but told he would have to apologise and that there would be an external mediator brought in to the shop to work with us    whilst my colleague considered his position he was off from work  i told my manager i had serious concerns about working with my colleague again  he had had altercations with several other members of staff and tended to hold grudges after the event  my manager said he expected my colleague to hold a grudge against me  and that that was the reason he wanted me to continue to work with him  i would be a trap  he told me once again about my  duty of care  if i were transferred to another branch  someone else would need to be brought in  meaning the whole cycle would repeat itself  if i stood firm and he acted out again it would be brought to an end  whilst my colleagues own concerns about the management trying to get rid of him were in the back of my mind  i was still raw from what had happened between us over the preceding 2 years  the thought of allowing someone else to go through that swayed my decision to back my managers plan  my colleague did not return  but resigned    my manager immediately came up to me and thanked me profusely  saying he d been trying to get rid of the guy for 18 years  my heart sank  what had i allowed myself to be a part of  6 weeks later  a new manager steps in  all the responsibilities that had fallen to me in the preceding years were taken back  but so too was the small freedom to self manage my day that had gone along with that responsibility  i was being micromanaged on every aspect of the job  my colleagues told me the new manager had been criticising me to them behind my back  saying i was arrogant  useless  had an attitude problem and needed putting in my place  all the while  to my face  he kept calling me buddy  and was constantly patting me on the back  he then moved me to another branch  adding an hour to my day and extra travel costs  giving me no real consultation  i asked him to reconsider  but he was unmoved  i ve never had a bad staff review  nor failed to honour my contractual obligations in 11 years  in retrospect it s easy to see i was naive  but i genuinely hoped that  after my colleague resigned  things could get a little bit easier  a little less stressful  it s been anything but    i ve gone through my union  but the bar for constructive dismissal is so high that  even with statements from colleagues and years of email and whatsapp transcripts  which clearly show what was going on  there s nothing that can legally be done   i have to leave  but i can t afford to expose myself financially  all i can hope is for is a  negotiated exit  which is completely uncertain and could drag on for months  all the while i m in a limbo  being continually pursued by my managers from work  the manager even said he wanted to come to my house to find out about my  cited stress  as a matter of his  duty of care  making the stress worse    i just can t wait to put them all behind me and move on with my life  up the workers ,dm1qh9

269,Rough Week,this is a bit of a rant  i need to blow the steam out  tl dr at the bottom   my workplace is split into many manufacturing departments  but i tend to bounce around between them  i've been working for almost three months  almost to the end of the  probation  period  which is kind of a crock of crap  but okay  since i bounce around a lot  i sometimes don't work in a department for a while   at the beginning of this week  i went to a department i haven't worked at in about six weeks  important for story  as such  i couldn't remember exactly how to read the specifications for our products  i double checked with my supervisor  and he asked me  how long have you worked here  because you should know this by now  i explained it's been a while since i worked in the department  but he was still upset  sadly  i worked with him pretty much all of that day and the next  it was very obvious that i was bothering him for some reason   yesterday  he pulled me aside to  test  me on the paperwork  the test went fine  and i only overestimated one part of the material we would need to build the product  he was surprised and told me i did much better than he thought i would  internally  i was pretty pissed off because literally  every  job i've ever worked  80  of my coworkers think i'm stupid  but i'm used to it  so i just vented to my wife when i got home and that was that   this morning  he comes to me and says that he's been asked to notify my that if i don't improve i'll lose my job at the end of the month  of course  i'm pissed  i diplomatically asked why  and he explained that the two big things are efficiency and the paperwork  i will credit him that he's very honest and up front  which i appreciate  he assigned a whole page of work to me  which is quite a bit  i did fine and surprised him with some of my abilities  facepalm   at the end of the day  i asked him for more specifics  i pointed out that it is difficult for me to know how to improve when i meet the requirements on the checklist for the probation  yeah  i meet the hard requirements just fine  except maybe some paperwork stuff  i'll definitely admit that i'm not perfect and should work on the paperwork  he told me that he was ready for me to get fired earlier in the week over the paperwork  so he notified the owner and lead supervisor  then he said that the next day he told them to disregard what he said after i showed that i'm not fucking stupid  i asked on a scale of 1-10  10 being i keep my job for sure  where am i  a strong 6 or a 7   i told him that i am having a hard time seeing why i'm on the chopping block when i easily outperform many of the other employees  i might not be the all star  but i'm certainly better than others by a long shot  he agreed with me about that  he said he had told the upper ups that he wants me to stay  then he acted like it was fine  he also recommended i talk to the other supervisors since they have a say in my employment too   i'm pretty confident i'll keep my job  i don't suck at what i do  and i'm  not  stupid  what really pisses me off is that i'm in this situation because i made someone unhappy then he gave bad feedback about me  and he just acts like it's fine and we're cool  now i have to go through a round of ass kissing  which i know some of them don't like me  i'm quiet and don't talk to anyone really  so they aren't very personable in return which is understandable  another issue is that i was supposed to get a raise if i did well on the review  which i was pretty sure i would get  now that's out of question  no raise  maybe no job   i would just quit this job and find something else  but i live in a college town and this is the best hours   paying job i could find   tl dr supervisor thinks i'm stupid  complains to boss  boss says i have till the end of the month to prove myself  supervisor says next day that i'm doing better than he thought after i show that i'm not dumb  now i have to kiss ass to the other supervisors and hope i don't lose my job  but i definitely lost the raise i was going to get ,djfmaz

271,Bosses who are jerks for no reason,hey guys  new to the subreddit  great reading so far  i wanted to make a post about bosses who are jerks for no reason  it seems every job i've ever had  the boss was a jerk and or had a hot temper if things weren't done  his way  or if you made the fatal mistake of doing something wrong because the idiot boss failed to instruct you properly  in other words  you didn't read his mind and got chewed out for it  i just don't understand why bosses are like this    in my experience  it pretty much never inspires anyone to do a better job  in fact  it lowers moral and makes your job harder causing you to do shittier work  when i think back to all the times my boss got angry at me  almost every time he could have just calmy explained to me how he wanted a certain thing done  and the results would have been exactly the same  in other words literally every time they blow up  it's for nothing and all it accomplishes is to stress the worker out which will degrade their work performance   i can honestly say there is not one instance at my job  that i've had for 15 years now  where my boss  needed  to chew me out  yet he's done it countless times  this for me is one of the biggest reasons i hate the idea of going to work and dread it with a passion  never knowing what stupid ass thing my boss will flip about next  and it's not a question of  if  but rather  when  he's going to flip out  hate it so much yet i have to put up with it and i'm  not supposed to complain  because  he's the boss  as my idiot co-workers always say   apparently going to work means you have to have stress and just accept the fact that your boss treats you like shit at any given moment  usually when he's having a bad day and takes it out on you  just  because that's the way it is  shit is completely unnecessary and adds nothing of value to the company or anything else  and i'm sick of it  anyone else feel this way  that bosses just treat workers like shit for no fucking reason  and that's one of the worst aspects of work ,dk13wo

276,Don't ask me how my day is,just wanted to vent rant but this simple phrase invokes a sense of rage  as i can't stand how you are always obligated to say something positive like  good  or  great  etc  anything that is not positive is usually ignored or viewed with contempt  was almost always asked this question by my manager almost everyday and would almost answer with something abstract like  i don't know  or  i cannot summarize my emotions  which is the truth especially at that time there was alot going on in my life at the time  this would usually leave them with very little to respond back with  whilst i at least didn't hate my job this still remains true  i cannot stand feigning positive emotions it eats away at me slowly  so no my day is not  good  no thank you for asking  nor do i want your fucking attention either  this perhaps falls into a term i heard recently  toxic positivity  definitely happy to hear what you fellow comrades have to say here at least ,dkdkel

301,incentives,  the tangible incentives that any society can realistically hold out to the poor youth of average abilities and average industriousness are mostly penalties  mostly disincentives  'do not study  and we will throw you out  commit crimes  and we will put you in jail  do not work  and we will make sure that your existence is so uncomfortable that any job will be preferable to it ' to promise much more is a fraud ,dh8nca

304,"Has anyone ever had to do a ""work for benefits scheme""", scheme  is an appropriate term  its the practice of making you work 40 hours a week  usually at a mcdonalds or a gas station for no pay  and if you refuse to do it they will cut off your  100 a week unemployment benefit   they claim it gives you valuable work experience and makes you more employable   imagine putting that on your cv or linkedin,dke0a6
305,Aged and disability care jobs.

321,Anyone else grow more Misanthropic by the Day?,i'm on vacation right now from work because i'm going out of town this week  anyway i haven't thought of killing myself at all the last couple days and have generally been in a good mood  but  this world has been setup in a way that i don't think i can tolerate it the rest of my life  i don't know how any rational human being can be mentally physically capable of spending 8 hours a day doing repetitive crap for 8 hours a day then going home and watching tv until they fall asleep   people say you have to work to contribute to society but  what society  i couldn't tell you my own fucking neighbors name  humanity had the chance to build a society that people would enjoy living in shortly after they discovered agriculture and the industrial revolution  but  instead of using our brains to our advantage  which got us this far by the way  we decided that since there is plenty of food and no danger we'll just fuck like rabbits  and the rich took advantage of the fact and bought up all the land and resources  to rent or sell back to the rest of us at the expense of our time and sanity   lots of these jobs are manufactured as well because heaven forbid everybody doesn't have a job  and they keep inventing new and better shit for us to buy to keep the wheel moving  but  here's the thing  what if i'm completely happy with everything i have and just want to sit in a reasonably priced housing and enjoy it   why do you need to sell 30 years of your life to get something everybody needs to live like a house  why are parents so quick to get rid of their children when they are 18  don't you want a better life for your kids  just going to sell them into slavery rather than let them stay at a house that's already been paid for  if i ever have kids i would want them to have a better life than me  that means not wasting it doing stupid bullshit they don't care about just to support a life i forced on them  so they are free to stay indefinitely and they can inherit the house when i die  but  all that aside life feels like you've been shipwrecked in shark infested waters and you're supposed to find your way back to land   like really  i'm supposed to be happy when my whole life is orbiting the shit sun   sounds like something jim lahey would say  anyway yeah  how is any rational human being with the slightest amount of intelligence not pissed off and depressed all the time ,dhrqsk

331,I won't contribute to a system that has so far denied me personhood,for my refusal to work society has punished me by forcing me to spend every single one of my 25 years on this planet living with my parents    i accept that i will never have my own place  car  friends  girlfriend  clothes  money ect  i lost all contact with my friends and family  i am just a burden to my friends without money or a car  at this point i'm not willing to take part in a system that has let me suffer for as long as it has  i want to prevent people from being hurt by this system  not take part in it    the thing is that i don't need help  a psychiatrist can't help me because the psychiatrist is trapped under the same circumstances i am  what i really need is the ability to make decisions in terms of my own well being and livelihood  i need the things required to function in modern life  currently i'm being denied those things  talking won't fix that    people have told me before that opting out of this system won't change anything  but that's my entire point  this system doesn't have to deny people like me personhood  it chooses to do so based on a arbitrary number  i now strongly believe all humans deserve food regardless of their number  value  no human should have to give up years of their own life only to earn things necessary for survival  especially in a post hunter gatherer society  people who support this system don't believe everyone deserves life  they believe only workers deserve life    i wouldn't take part in such a clearly immoral system even if it was only taking a year of my time  but people willfully give up 40  in my opinion giving up 40 years of your life to do tricks to earn things every human deserves isn't a sign of mental maturity or something to boast about  there is no way you can give up 40 years and end up as as well rounded of a personhood as you would have if you spent that time with family  friends  learning  traveling  living at your own pace    currently under this system  people actually rally against the use of self driving trucks as it will decrease the amount of jobs  this system actually tries to create more work even if there is no work that needs to be done  the world we live in could already be much more automated if it weren't for arbitrary numbers preventing humanities true potential  we could already be educating everyone too  but instead we reserve education for those with enough money  i can't even imagine how a successful alien race would look at the idea of only educating certain members of our species based on paper amount  probably in fucking disgust like i do ,dkg3rq

336,Just quit entrepreneurship with neurotic business partner and want to die now,sorry for long post   tldr at the bottom  but it is an interesting story      i got a call from a female friend a few weeks ago to meet up to discuss business opportunities so we wouldn't have to run this rat race for life   i was skeptical at first  but the plan seemed legit and she seemed genuine   we had a grand scheme of building our business and she excelled at a lot of the things i didn't  and i did the same for the things she didn't   it was perfect and we were 2 physically attractive people in the health and beauty industry   we worked for the same corporate company before and had a friendship since then  so she was not unfamiliar      we met up literally every night for 4-5 hours even after juggling my 3 day jobs   we sat outside in the cold at starbucks strategizing our business and even brought fucking blankets for the outside of starbucks for when they kicked us out when they closed   we took photo shoots and everything and i was so motivated  but i should've seen the red flags sooner      she is a bisexual with a lot of masculine energy and is a demeaning control freak who is constantly moody and high on weed and caffeine   she would always explain her vision and then go on tangents which would make our meetings last way too long  and i'd try to bring her back down to earth to what we're actually planning   something tangible   she'd get frustrated when i couldn't understand what the hell she was talking about and asked for clarity   she'd talk about  reverse engineering  all the time and end up way into the future when i kept trying to pull her into wtf we have to do right now      most of the ideas i tried to contribute she'd think get impatient with  so i decided to just contribute in other ways while she did most of the work and i just showed up   plus she was more business oriented than i was   i thought maybe i wasn't understanding her vision  but she'd be full of oxymorons and kanye west type ego tangents  think mlm personality type people  but this wasn't an mlm      i talked to her about her miscommunication and her impatience and talking down to me   she apologized and promised to work on it and we pushed forward   we were even going to live in a house together   it was so we can make a calculated business move constantly filming our business in our home environment and generating revenue off of it   i am against moving in with women due to sexual tension in the living space  no sexism  just had bad experiences that were hard to get out of  but she was very butch to the point where she'd talk about how big her dick was etc   constant ego talk that i shrugged off   plus  i was so depressed and in a negative mind space before this project that i was desperate for a change anyway      she ended up making a move on me literally pulling me into her room and asking me to make her cum   i told her that if we're going to do business  we should not do this   the reality was i was not attracted to her because she is way too masculine for me   we agreed to keep it platonic   this should've been a bigger red flag to me  but i still saw her as a cool butch bisexual and more like  one of the guys   this incident is one reason why we met up in public from then on      then today  we have another photoshoot and we were having fun on the ride there  then like a flick of a switch  she turns into a moody bitch   her energy and attitude is just negative and she's telling me she's gonna flip if i fuck up   i've already had this discussion with her about how she should be encouraging and uplifting and not demeaning and shit  yet here she goes again   i try to get in my zen state and not let her disrupt me state of mind  but she ends up storming out the room with me and the photographer   we proceed without her and she comes back and flips out again   this pisses me off to the point where i end it all right then and there   i tell her i'm done      on the way driving her back  i tell her about her attitude and how we already had this discussion and this was supposed to be fun  but i can't do business with someone like her   she says she's always taking control and she doesn't want to  i tell her whenever i do she fucking shoots me down   then she attacks my masculinity saying she needs someone with a big dick to dominate   i immediately see that all this time she was fucking instinctively shit testing me and trying to mold me into some macho alpha male that would tame her and take control of her   i tell her it seems like she wants me to be someone else and i want her to be someone else and we can no longer do this  because she is a headache   she goes off on more talk that doesn't make fucking sense and i start to realize she is literally neurotic and undiagnosed with some type of personality disorder   i drop her off and realize that this is over and i have to go back to my shitty work life next week with no other current plan out of this rat race   i was so emotionally invested in this project that i feel depressed that it ended and want to kill myself going back with no end in sight        tldr  ex coworker  masculine butch bisexual caffeine  amp  weed addict  calls me to start up a business   i'm skeptical  but she convinces me   we meet up 4-5hours a night planning and executing our business for the last few weeks and plan to move into a house together to film said business to create content   she constantly talks down to me and is a control freak  then weirdly hits on me  i reject her  we push forward with strictly platonic business goal   during photoshoot  her attitude gets worse and she has a tantrum and i immediately quit   i have moment of clarity that she is neurotic and was looking for a guy with  big dick energy   her words  to tame her and out alpha her  which go figure  guys typically don't like   i start the same bullshit work schedule next week and i'm depressed and feel like killing myself with no current goals to look forward to working on to escape this fucking rat race once again back to square one ,dh8f4r
337,Returning to work after time out due to depression and suicidal thoughts,so some time ago i took sick leave due to depression and suicidal thoughts  i even posted about this on this subreddit when i initially did that   tomorrow i am going back to work  i do not feel ready at all  i still feel messed up  i can't stand to face the toxic environment at work  it was this environment that lead to me taking that time off  just for some context  some of the senior staff have lied about me which lead to some serious problems for me  even after i protested this i was told its my word against hers  my line manager knew i already go to a psychologist due to some mental issues i already have and still felt the need to be so overly critical to me over such small issues like for not taking in a notepad to a meeting  some of the staff also snitch on me on very small things like leaving 15minutes early  amongst other stuff i have to deal with    i was ready to hand in my resignation last friday  but due to some unforeseen circumstances i am going to have to delay this  i have no idea by how long  i just hope i don't fully crack and do something regrettable before i am able to hand in my resignation  i can't begin to imagine the relief i will feel when i hand in my resignation    when i see my friends at work who i care about deeply hand in their resignation to pursue a better path i get really happy for them  of course i'm gonna miss them but ultimately i am over the moon for them  they have escaped  i hope i will escape soon too ,dhi2q2

358,"Just came across this sub, wanted to hear your opinion on my point of view.", please read at least the tl dr before commenting    so from what i can see you guys are against working for 'the man'  you see capitalism as being a system of oppression and slave labour   i'd like to ask  what is the alternative    if everyone were to stop working there would be no food in your kitchen  no water in your tap and no power in your home  someone's job is to maintain the reddit server this post is stored on  someone's job is to make the computer or device you are reading this on  so my question to you good people is again  what is the alternative   if humanity automates every single aspect of our lives  what is left for us to strive for  don't get me wrong  i am fairly anti-capitalist  hence why this sub has been recommended to me  but i still think we all need to do something that contributes to society  else i believe we will all end up aimless drug addicts with no sense of purpose  see idiocracy   work has taught me so much in terms of discipline  commitment and self respect  yet if you had asked me when i was in school 'do you want to get up at 4 30 in the morning and spend 10 hours stacking shelves and mopping floors i would have said no   having to work was one of the best things that has ever happened to me  and it is only because of having a job that i am now able to make the most of my time on this earth and hopefully go on to make my mark on the future  i think in this day and age we should not have to work nearly as much as the people in charge seem to think  but i also believe that abolishing the need to work at a job you don't particularly want to do is an even worse idea than working too much  for society as a whole and for the individual who has yet to develop a sense of purpose    tl dr you see a utopia where everyone is free to indulge their passions  i see a dystopia where everyone exists in virtual reality 24 7 with an iv drip full of heroin  so people of r antiwork i ask you    what is the alternative to having to work   for the record i don't want any upvotes  but if you are going to downvote  please tell me why  thank you ,dionu6
359,"Your Time, Their Entitlement",i know this topic has been covered before by books like bullshit jobs  but i'd like to make my own points and observations about this    as we all know the eight hour day is borderline abusive to both physical and mental health in human beings  and yet employers insist on it to ensure the most legal production possible  we'll ignore how this is a factual fallacy and employees are markedly less productive during an eight hour day  what i want to talk about is how employers enforce these eight hours and  why  they enforce them   just as in my previous quasi-essay post   the orwellian workplace  i'll be taking examples from my own workplaces and applying them as practical representations of the behavior of employers    this entire week  thursday to thursday  my boss was on a vacation with his family  leaving me  the only other worker in the office  alone to deal with the day to day business  now  without his intense oversight i was able to relax significantly more  portion out my work  and complete everything necessary within the first half of the day  every day  leaving me little to do in the second half  however  i miscalculated and was today informally reprimanded as he felt it necessary to monitor my station with keystroke tracking software  obviously this was and still remains a serious ethical issue that is mercilessly protected by law  but the question remains  why did he care  everything that needed to be done was done  i met the necessary quotas  so why did he care if i wasn't working extra   that is a very simple question to answer  entitlement   as much as the rich enjoy calling the working class entitled and ungrateful  the truth is very much the opposite  your boss believes they hired you for eight hours and they will demand those eight hours out of you  to them  it doesn't matter that you've worked what they asked  their money  to them  is a reward they bestow upon you for being a good helper monkey  a privilege you should be grateful for  employers believe that  once they begin paying you  they own your time  that your time is no longer yours and is theirs to control  and that you have to dance to the tune    this may not be the conscious thought of every employer  but the underlying psychology is the same  because they are paying you by the hour  they believe that it does not matter how efficient you are in your work  so long as you work for all eight hours    of course  the opposite of this is true  without you giving up your time to produce for them  they would have nothing  and this is something we  as workers  have forgotten  at any moment i could stand up and leave and it won't matter any more how many hours i worked  he'll be shit out of luck with nothing to do but scramble to replace me    in closing  i would like to remind everyone that we have the power as workers  if you are the sole worker in your department  if you're the leader of a group that others rely on  if your job is unique  you have the ability to stand against these abuses and remind your boss who is supporting who  even on your own ,dj7efs

363,Can We Talk About Nepotism? (Warning: Venting Post),i've been reading this sub for a while now  i'm not sure if this is the right sub to post this topic question but do you know what really grinds my gears  nepotism in the workplace   its one thing to hire someone you know because of their sought-after skills and proven experience  its another to hire your child or spouse to do jack shit just because they're related to you    i feel particularly awful to my core knowing my college studies for a degree in the field i'm working in and past experience in the field i'm working in means practically nothing when my compared against a relative of the owner who has not gone to college for something related to the field we're working in and also does not have experience in the field we're working in  it feels even worse knowing that the owner's child who does not have technical experience is even allowed to comment on the possibility of a cost of living adjustment  to match inflation  or a raise based on performance merit  sounds like utter horseshit to me   from r antiwork's perspective  should someone like a secretary  who has been working as a secretary for 30 years  make more than someone that is billable technical and has experience in the particular field   tl dr  boomer boss hires family members despite their evident ineptitude  nepotism  gt  skills relevant experience as usual ,djfyvr

401,a follow up on 'work struggle sessions',a few weeks ago i posted that we're trying to organize small  local based talking groups with a few beers where people talk about their work  can vent and reflect on the systematic issues related to work   so far we had two and two more offshot-groups started specializing in given industries  and from initial reactions it's a tremendous success   where i live is not a very pro-social culture  people are rude in general and are rude to strangers  but when you get strangers to talk about their work and their experiences  which leads to talking about their personal lives  their parents  their coworkers  whatever  it opens the fucking floodgates  i'm not saying they leave as friends  but it does act as sort of a collective stress-relief and people want more and more   with that being said  we did find a couple of faultlines  the working class is in itself not just separated by trade  but also by corp hierarchy  there's people who are closer to the upper echelons who will have a very difficult time transitioning into any form of solidarity  there's a fair number of cynical people  and we're looking at ways to transform the groups so they're more forward looking lest they just sink into a hugbox  sector-based orientation seems like a good idea  as this type of activity builds up at least professional contacts so you can ditch if your job already sucks or find out ways how people in the same sector are fighting for better conditions   with that being said  i can totally recommend trying to start your own group  we don't moderate ours strictly  just have a couple of pointed questions on where do you work  what do you do  explained to a five year old  and people will mention a lot of struggle related topics  of boss overreach  shitty behavior  survival strategies  fight-backs  fight club mood comes when you ask people about their parents jobs  individual education contra parents education  job vs education and so on   take this forum 'offline' and local based if you can  it fights alienation better than just staring at the screen  and it can build real community    we're also experimenting with taking the talked-out experiences and giving them online platforms - reddit and similar platforms are not that popular here  we're still stuck in the blogging era  but talking about the actual matter and problem with work really drives readers   best  and throw questions at me if this isn't as clear,dg0n6s

415,An antiwork success story.,a few years ago  i was like many of you  i hated my job  the thought of going in and doing the same thing over and over again for 12 mind-numbing hours a day  5-6 days a week  gave me nightmares  it had me sitting outside work breaking down  my mental health was bad  i had no semblance of a social life and every week i thought about ending it all  i hated the fact that i couldn't see any way out of this hole that i had gotten myself in for the next 40-50 years  one particularly bad day i made a decision  there and then  i simply thought to myself    fuck this  enough is enough  and went in and quite my job on the spot  it was the best decision i've ever made  admittedly  for a couple of days i was beside myself with worry  i was thinking to myself   what the hell am i going to do  how am i going to survive  that's when i decided to be proactive and reorganise my life to the way i wanted it to be  i went back to college  thankfully  something that's free in my country  there i took a course on music production  a subject i was always interested in  but  while i was at college i also decided to get rid of all the ties that had been keeping me down in my life  i gave up my expensive flat and moved into shared accommodation  i paid off all my bills and got rid of any direct debits and credit cards  i paid off my overdraft and then cancelled it  i went back to basics  i removed myself as much as possible from the pursuit of material possessions as i could  i don't care about owning the latest gadget or newest clothes  i reduced my life down to the necessities  food and shelter  i went from paying out  1500 every month to paying  200  a couple of months into my course  and with my savings starting to take a hit  i thought i'd better go and find a part-time job to keep me ticking over  i got a job working the door of a local bar  it was 4 hours a night  3 nights a week  9pm - 1am  this easily paid for my reduced living expenses and still left me with an enormous amount of free time and money to study  play music or just generally have a social life again  i started loving my life and the 12 hours a week i was working were great  eventually i got interested in djing and it just so happened that the local dj in the bar i was working in was planning to leave soon  i asked the boss if i could take over for him as i had all the equipment  and he said yes and that he was actually going to ask me the same thing himself  so  here i am  7 years later  still doing what i love every week  i work on the door every saturday night  dj every wednesday  friday and sunday  i work no more than 16 hours per week and get paid a ton of money  i'm loving my life and am infinitely better off financially and mentally  the moral of the story  i guess  is put yourself into uncertain situations and always try and learn new things  the best thing i ever did was walking in to work that day and say  enough is enough  while quitting on the spot  it lit a fire under my arse and made me reevaluate my life and what i want to do with it  no job should have you sitting in the carpark crying at the though of having to spend a minute more in its employment  life's too short for that shit ,detx48
416,Spending 6-8 hours a day doing any one thing day after day is insane.,i think people realize spending too much time on one thing thing is unreasonable   you spent 5 hours playing video games  get a life   you spend 4 hours a day reading  i can barely read for an hour   you spent 3 hours at the gym  wow you're a gym rat dude   you spent 12 hours on that drawing  thats a long time      these things are all hobbies  and yet we're shamed for spending too much time on them  and not enough time at work  i spend 6 hours a day with a boss who i hate and a fraction of that time with my boyfriend who im often too tired to interact with in a very meaningful way after work      on a slightly different note  even passions can grow tedious after too long  i like drawing and video gamrs  but if you asked me to sit down and draw or play the same game for 6 hours it would get difficult  even if its a very good project or game  after a couple of days i would need a break  yet  we are expected to work thousands of hours for years doing the same things over and over again  its no wonder that people hate their work so much  even jobs that i would be passionate about for a month would start filling me with resentment    maybe i'm unusual but i dont think there is a dream job for me out there  i'm not built for the stress  and im not built for the inevitable monotony ,dfpfyy
417,Why Do Employers Think They Own Us?,when it is supposed to be they are paying us for our service  they act like they bought us as property instead  when it is simply the basic service that they requested in our contracts  i mean if i hired a plumber to do my sink i wouldn't have any right to yell at him to go faster  i wouldn't have any right to tell him he is twisting is tool with the wrong hand  i wouldn't have any right to tell him to not wear hats    amp x200b   but when it comes to employers they demand we change ourselves to fit their agendas  it just seems like they believe they have all the power is this the case  are we giving our services to them or are we their slaves to do their bidding for a certain amount an hour   things i worry about  guys things i worry about ,dfr4ny

425,The apprentice (UK) is such a shit show and it's a system of the moral decay of society,the premise of the programme is to have a business plan and to present it to lord sugar but in order to do that  you have to go through numerous tasks in order to sell  the entire show is a reflection of how poor character and being vicious leads you to success  the people who are honest are gone first  the manipulative  selfish  and egotistical people remain on  good character is not rewarded  bad character is  it's not a show about how it's good to be honourable  it's essentially watching capitalism in action where they sell whatever crap they can in order to  win  without having a concern about the consumers and if they fail  they deflect responsibility and blame in order to ensure they survive  the element which is the funniest is that the show is essentially rigged and the winner is already selected and so the people fight and moan over something they would have never got  kind of like how people fight and complain against a tax against people earning over ten million a year when they would have never earned that in their lifetime ,dez7ud

429,I’m more miserable in a comfy office job than I was in the military.,i wouldn t say i m anti-work per se  more anti - meaningless corporate zombie work    short backstory for those who care   i served 5 years in the military as an infantryman  which was infinitely more demanding than my current 8 hour a day  5 day a week office job  however  i never felt this anxious  hopeless  and depressed while serving  even though i would spend full weeks months sleeping outside in shit weather and working an average of 12 hours on a good day back in  the rear    all politics of the miltary industrial complex and imperialism aside  i felt i had a genuine purpose and knew my place in the world  and i had an intimate understanding of myself  i had a crystal clear understanding of what my tasks were for the day and what my role was in accomplishing a given mission  i also had a very strong community of people i actually considered a close family or brotherhood  as corny as that may sound  they weren t just  co-workers  and the shared hardships only served to strengthen that bond    not to mention  if i wasn t deployed i d get 3-4 days off for a holiday  as opposed to just the single day  and 15-30 days paid vacations after deployments  post-deployment leave    now  i sit behind a computer all day pretending to be busy  and have to pretend to care about the timely completion of a project to make some faceless rich person even richer while i can only hope for a slight raise after years of my life are dedicated to this    the motivation used to be life and death and winning wars  and i find it hard to muster up the willpower to behave with the same sense of urgency over useless corporate buzzwords and excel spreadsheets  i m just desperately counting vacation and sick days until i can take my next short stint of artificial freedom from this endless cycle    i genuinely feel more imprisoned and consumed by my work than when i was in the fucking military for christ sakes  this cannot be how humans were meant to live  this all feels so meaningless and i can barely find a reason to get out of bed every morning  i essentially get paid to act like i give a shit and it s more mentally demanding than i ever would ve imagined    just needed to rant  thanks for listening if you re still here ,df2bnz

Try being a health care assistant...,i see a lot of you office workers post  i just read a post where someone was basically complaining that they were bored at work for hours  with little to do   i'm sorry guys -  but please give a thought to us lowly  carers  because i  for one  would sell my soul  or what's left of it  to have a job like that   this past week as working for as an agency hca  i  along with another girl  had to help an elderly man who threw wet tissues in my face  said digusting sexual things to the both of us workers  he went to grab at her breasts and he groped my bum  he then hit me on the arm  delightful   we helped a lady who had mrsa  always fun helping people with illnesses that i can bring home with me   i helped an elderly man have a wash then had to put his dirty clothes back on him and steal a pad from another person's room to give to him  because apparantly the nurses didn't give a shit about him in this nursing home   he didn't have any pants or underwear - that's why i had to put the dirty clothes back on him  nurse just said  well  it's his wife's job to bring those in  i said  well  maybe there could be some in the laundry  she just ignored me and carried on writing   i got scratched on the face  good it missed my eyes  on my upper lip by an old lady during giving her personal care  nurse did not give a shit  it seems   i got scratched on the arm by another elderly lady and it drew blood  i asked nurse if the lady was on a behaviour chart that i could write the incident down in  nurse just shrugged and said  that's just the way she is    amp x200b   i work for 12hr shifts  this is not  rewarding  or  noble  work  i am tired of smelling old people's piss and shit  i am tired of senile old people physically attacking me because they stink of piss and they don't want to have a wash  i don't care that they can't help it   i need to get out of this work but at this point i can't lower my hours to train to do something else    amp x200b   i just want people to know that out of all of the places i have worked in 7 years  and as an agency carer  that number is a lot  i would say i have worked in 1  count it  one residential care home where the elderly people were looked after adequately  not well  just adequately  and the work load was managable for the workers   just the 1   i have been doing this work for 7 years   if you have family members or loved ones in a residential nursing home i want you to know that behind the scenes  the level of  care  they are recieving is most likely not good enough   for example  in so many places i've worked nurses and hcas outright lie about how much fluid intake  a resident has  for example  because in the late morning when we are supposed to help keep people hydrated  we are either  a  still doing personal care on people or b  finally getting our  late  as usual  break  i admit  if someone pressures me with  well  she had 200mls of tea in the cup on her table  i mean  she probably drank it all didn't she  i just now go along with it and say  yeah  i lie too   i've had a an elderly lady start crying because she was sat on her armchair and needed to go to the toilet  she needed a stand-aid to help her up and i was not allowed to di it by myself   must be x2 hcas  it was the second time of me answering her call bell because she needed the toilet  20 mins gap inbetween the calls  everyone including me was giving personal care busy with other people at the time  i said to her i'm so sorry you will just have to wait   if you have family members or loved ones in a home then please regularly visit them to make sure everything is okay with them because i am just telling you the truth that they have rushing  exhausted  starting-not-to-give-a-damn workers like me  looking after  them  it's the truth   when it comes to that time for my own mother i will be looking after her myself for as long as i possibly can - and then a bit more perhaps  i would never put her in a home  i know what they're like   this turned out too long  i'm ot expecting anyone to read it  i guess i just had to get this off of my chest  i need to get out of this ,dfgu7f

463,just a few thoughts on commissions.,so  i want to share my three bad experiences with earning commission as a fire protection technician   in all three situations the commission was a  factor in negotiating a lower than average pay rate  i'm curious to see  if this is an issue in other fields  i'm sure it is  but i'm really  interested in how commissions work in a perfect situation  ok  here we  go   side note - it's going to seem  like i'm speaking ill of fire protection companies  and i am  but from  what i've heard my experiences are the exception  not the rule   first  was a job fixing and selling fire extinguishers and emergency lights   i  took the job for  16 hr and 5  of all new fire extinguisher sales over   3k  for reference the most common f e  we sold was about  60   this  seemed sort of nuts  but the hiring manager assured me that with the  volume of work it would be no problem   what  he didn't tell me was that if you had a bad month  the next months  sales would go toward making up the difference  so if you made  2k in  january  you had to make  4k in february to break even   the  real issue is that a fire extinguisher has to look pretty bad to  replace it with a new one  otherwise if it lost pressure or was out of  date we would just replace it with a used extinguisher for a more  customer friendly price   basically the cylinder itself would have to be  compromised beyond repair either with rust or a good sized dent or  gouge  and even then you still have to convince the customer to buy from  you rather than home depot   so i  quickly found myself way behind considering i was new to the field and  had about two weeks of training   i started asking around for advice and  found out that a lot of these guys would do some shady stuff to make  their numbers  some guys would lie and say the building didn't have  enough extinguishers  others would smash them with hammers or damage  components until it was more economical to buy a new one  but the  consensus was that you had to hustle and cut corners if you want that  paper  so i left   i found another  job doing the same thing but this time it was  17 hr and the commission  was 7  of all sales and services over  22k  10  over  27k  and 15  over   30k  now i knew from the last job that the money was in the service   and i knew my last month at the last job i made  25k in service  this  was a good deal   after a month of  training i was killing it  first month   800 commission  second month    1000  all earned honestly  and all customers were happy  baboom   then  the boss' two brothers  both employees of the company  are both served  with divorce papers within a month of each other  don't feel bad  if  they wanted to stay married they shouldn't have been pricks   so facing  financial hurricanes  they asked for more money and so the boss made  them techs  fine  but i then come to find my schedules are getting  lighter and lighter and my commissions are dwindling   they went from  the  1000 range to the  200 range  and then nothing   i had days where i  had 9 hours to do about 3 hours worth of work  and the rest of the time  was just spent in the truck or running errands for the boss   i  come to find that the boss was just giving them the good jobs  making  them a ton of money  and just screwing the rest of us  cool beans  so i  and a few other guys ended up leaving  and i found another job   third  job  this was doing extinguishers and fire suppression systems in  kitchens and spray booths for  18 hr and 5  of everything over  22k    they assured me that i would be in charge of my schedule  they assured  me that every month they give out bonuses in addition to the commission  for the top earners  and they assured me that i would get 30  of all  emergency service  hell yeah  i can't go wrong here   so  the week i start working they decide they don't trust the techs to make  their own schedule   fine  i'll just tell them to load me up with work   they then decide they want us to spend more time on these jobs to make  the customers feel better  ok  i'll just be thorough at these places   and really look for things i can fix to make sure the place is perfect   it turns out that the majority of these places are chains  and the  contracts stipulate that i need special approval for any work outside of  a basic inspection  then it turns out the top three earners at the  company are the managers golf buddies and they get first dibs to go back  and do the work that i quoted  so i am out there doing maybe 4 jobs a  day making less than  500 towards my numbers a day  and they get to  vulture my high paying jobs that i did the leg work on   in  the last months at that job i found out that whenever a customer calls  to complain about the price of a service  the manager automatically  discounts it  which affects my numbers  i also found that i make  30 of  emergency calls unless the problem is our companies fault  which was  almost every time   phew  if you  guys made it this far thank you so much for reading my rant   the fact  that this is a super whiny post is not lost on me  i just want people to  see the games that some companies will play   i would say that after  these experiences i can't possibly be surprised anymore by garbage like  this  but i'm sure i'll eat those words   so  yeah  share your experiences with commissions or whatever frustrating  work stories  i will leave you with a quote that my dear mother told to  me after all of this had already happened  thanks mom    commissions are a way for rich jerks to underpay dummies    - momma hindsight,dh1wq9

469,Working with authoritarian women as a woman and work trauma,i have to share what it's like to work with bossy women as a woman  or at least for me  very long post ahead   i have a history of jobs that completely took advantage of me or were downright evil especially because of the women in positions of authority   my first job was at a tim hortons 7 years ago  but i got bulied by the cool kids working there and got fired for asking a question about the right kind of lid to put on lattes  which i barely ever had to make bc who tf drinks lattes from tim hortons anyway  the female supervisor deemed my question stupid because i should have known that  as someone who had worked there for barely three months and only 16 hours a week with no decent traning  but you know  that whole experience was enough to traumatize me  age 16  from working  i later learned that the bullying stemmed from the coolest of the cool kids because she was in love with my best friend and was jealous of me  so my main bully was some jealous girl and the one who got me fired was her best friend's sister    i then got a job at a grocery store  but i was extremely cautious at this point  i didn't trust my female coworkers  but i quickly realized that i wasn't going to be bullied this time  i had a great time adjusting to this environment after that  it was 90  female  but i generally got along with everyone  i can't say that i experienced anything outrageously wrong after 4 years of employment    i tried a new job as a receptionist for a popular hotel chain  it was during the summer and i was still working at the grocery store on the weekends  but at the hotel during the week  the woman who hired me told me that there was a chance i'd also work in the kitchen  being a receptionist was a dream to me because i had been working with food for 2 years and i was tired of it  an understatement  i reluctantly said that i wouldn't mind occasionally working in the kitchen  hoping that it wouldn't prevent me from being a receptionist  the woman  let's call her karen  had a face and a demeanor that i couldn't trust  i ended up working as a receptionist for   4 days  they trained me for the kitchen the week after  i then got scheduled for one more week in the kitchen  i got really suspicious that they didn't need an additional receptionist because they began significantly cutting some of the receptionists' hours  after yet another scheduled week of working in the kitchen  i knew that they didn't need me at the reception and that they had hired me solely for the kitchen  i was extremely frustrated  but struggled to quit because it meant returning to the grocery store full-time after being so close to my dream job at the time  so i sucked it up   then they  karen  did the most fucked up thing ever  at closing time  i was told by my kitchen boss  nancy  to clean the tables while she sweeps the floor  i found that strange because she had never separated our tasks like that before  we would usually do it simultaneously  it's worth noting that only the two of us worked in the kitchen during the week  the next day  i got called into karen's office after my shift  she sat me down and patronisingly told me that i wasn't the best fit for the job  i told her that i didn't want to be in the kitchen and that i was supposed to be a receptionist  even though i had expressed it before  she diverted the conversation to my eyelashes by complimenting how long and pretty they were  wtf  she used that distraction to bring up the pictures that she had taken of the floor the day before  it was especially dirty and she told me that it was unacceptable  i tried explaining that i only cleaned the tables  but she wouldn't hear it  she actually reprimanded me for accusing my coworker of my own mistake  which i wasn't trying to do  just like that  i was asked to go home  i was fired    for a long time  i couldn't wrap my head around what happened  i went up to my boss at the grocery store crying  telling her that i had just been fired and that i would therefore stay  she told me she had a suspicion that it wouldn't work out  a shitty thing to say to someone who was just fired  by the way  i obviously can't say whether karen orchestrated the whole thing just to fire me  but it felt like it was done on purpose  it was too coincidental  with nancy telling me not to do the floor that day  i don't know  i'll never know the truth   i ended up staying at that grocery store for 2 more years  i quit in november of 2017 because i was moving out of my dad's in december  i was a uni student desperate to find a better job than retail and the horror of boomers complaining about the prices of food i have no control over  all my attempts at hotel applications failed and i worked at yet another grocery store for a few months at the start of 2018  nothing too dramatic happened  but my two coworkers were male  so i didn't get many interactions with women   after 3 months  i finally managed to get a job at a hotel  a fairmont hotel  too  i wasn't a receptionist though  i was working for what they beautifully call  royal service  it's basically an on-site phone assistant that takes room reservations and room service orders  amongst other things  the female supervisor there was fucking awful  a french woman who was so stern and stuck up  she was always yelling at me for the most minor things  i got in trouble one time when it wasn't my fault at all  we had to report on what happened during our shifts  so any information that would be relevant for our coworkers the next day  in a  pass-on  it was an email that we had to send at the end of our closing shift around midnight for the following morning  my male coworker and i were doing the closing shift  but when i left  we had nothing written in the pass-on because it hadn't been busy  he was staying an hour more after i left  the next day  my supervisor was extremely unhappy with the pass-on  she called me to her office  which wasn't at all private so the discussion took place in front of all 3 of my coworkers present  and scolded me for writing that  nothing happened it was boring  in it  i had no part in that because my male coworker had written it  she had fire in her eyes as she was telling me how disrespectful it was  i could feel her hatred  i told her i didn't do it  she didn't care  when my male coworker showed up that day  he didn't at all get the same treatment  he admitted to doing it and she simply told him not to do it in the future  no fire in her eyes  that was it    that event was just a clear demonstration of her bias toward me in a long list of unfair things under her supervision  nobody liked her and people agreed that she had been unfair to me that one time  they went as far as to say that i was her personal scapegoat  it seemed like  she would scold me for the dumbest shit  we had so many stupid rules  too  it truly didn't make sense  i wasn't the only one getting yelled at repeatedly  but i seemed to have it the worst out of everyone   that leads me to today  i have a data entry job and my  boss  is sometimes unbearable  she is an accountant who's very condescending and who also loves to yell at you in front of other people  i still struggle to find my feet around these kinds of women  i'm not confrontational  in case you didn't notice  i never know how to react and i prefer to keep my mouth shut and suck it up  i've always been like this    i have no idea what i did to all these women over my years of employment  i just feel like it's the nature of women being forced to work with other women  a man has never treated me like this  i'm way more comfortable around a male coworker or authority figure than i am around a woman in these same positions  i'm curious to know if anyone else had similar experiences  i'm sorry if this is stupidly long and pointless ,dfkice

Want to get support and support others?,hi everyone  i have founded r workplace bullying  a few people have posted so far and are open to more feedback and support  the only rule so far is please respect other users at all times   the subreddit is still under construction  i kicked it off by linking to a few of the best articles and videos that i found so far  i have a full time job myself and semi-infrequent phone access so please help me by flagging any abusive or blatantly unhelpful comments and i will get to them asap    i was bullied out of my last job and had no idea what to do how to fight it and also felt constant anxiety about the fact that i was at a bully s whims for a job reference  or not  i also had this complex about needing to please the bully because i had never been labeled a  problem worker  before  i ended up being forced out due to the health problems it caused  i just wasn t well enough to do my work any more and that s when my bully boss doubled down and used it to  prove  i was not a good worker    i have no legal training  but would like to also have the space be a place where people can share experiences or credible info about how to take legal action against their employer  unionize  sue  formal complaint  if it will help do justice and restitution for bullying on the job  nobody should be bullied at work  please participate if you want ,deh0dk
526,Corporate Language is Cringey AF,i love when companies use the term  passion for customer service  in applications training videos workplace rewards  it truly shows how they're   a  super alienated from the material conditions of the working class  and or b  using orwellian psychology to attempt to brainwash their workers   let me make this clear  no one working an entry level job has a  passion for customer service  in fact  i'd assert that hardly anyone has a  passion for customer service  no one works at a grocery store because they love to be bitched at by boomers  and then proceed to make said angry self deserving boomer happy with free shit  we put up with it because we have to to pay the bills and literally not starve to death    yeah i love being bitched at by boomers for something that isn't my fault  i feel accomplished when i'm able to make that expired coupon work  said no one ever    so yeah  i can't help but get aggravated when i hear that retarded  passion for customer service  shit  the people that appear to have a  passion for customer service  are people who are just really good at faking it and have a lot of patience   i'd have a lot more respect for a company if they dropped the double speak and were honest   hey guys  we know we don't pay you shit  and we know you hate this job  but let's just make these grumpy boomers happy so we can make some money and not collectively starve  okay  fake it if you have to  love  kroger    but nah  let's just stick with the out of touch orwellian jargon ,ddctg2

529,Some thoughts and my current position,these are just some thoughts that i would like to share  also  if anyone has advice or a  way out story  i'd be glad to hear   i don't hate-hate my job  it's fairly decent  medium pay  and i even get to work from home at least once a week  more in the future  the reason i like working from home is partly because i work very little  still  every morning i'm absolutely dreaded to go to work  mind it's a 1h15min trip  every day is a struggle and every week feels the same  mon  amp  tue suck  wed  amp  thu are  fine  friday work from home  yay  weekend is usually fun  and there we go again   i think this all stems from having not enough time to myself to enjoy things  gaming  doggo    or work on myself  i would love to have time for leisure  fitness  cooking  laundry  keeping the apartment clean  doing groceries  taking walks with my dog     put this in combination with me not being interested at all in my job  the fact that my job does just about nothing for humanity or nature  and you have some depressing thoughts  the problem is my interests aren't very broad  so switching jobs is probably not a solution  the only solutions i see now are   - keep going  suck it up as long as i can take it  - find something i'm willing to put 40hrs week in  - switch to being a waiter part-time  i  enjoyed  working those as a student   more free time   - do something about the 40hr work week  - kill myself   i've been going to a therapist for the past 2-3 months  and i do feel some benefits  he tells me my problem is looking way too far ahead  i'm dreading the 40hr week for 40 years  i think he's partially right  but i'm also just not willing to be just another cog in the machine doing something i'm not interested in and it sucking away my time as a living being  i truly believe that 40 hours is too much for a lot of people to have a happy life  this is my strongest opinion  my therapist tells me this is just a thought  as in  everything is just a thought in your head  i honestly see what he's saying  but i just can't get over the fact that i'm so angry  amp  helpless at this issue and why nothing is done about it  a lot of times i think there's a fundamental problem with me  if almost everyone does it  why can't i  but then reasoning kicks in again  none of this makes sense  we have everything we need to live  why do we still need to advance at the rate we are going at now  countries want growth  but why is this only expressed in monetary values  a country's inhabitants are a major part of the country  why not strive for growth there   on and on  you get the jist   note that i've  only  been working for a little over 2 years  i've done loads of student jobs though  everyone said i would get used to it  but i'm not  i simply can't wake up happy knowing the day i have ahead of me     rant  tldr  not enough time  not interested in job,dbq0a0
530,Burnout is a huge problem.,i don t do bad in stressful environments  but the weekends are too short to really detox   sunday is spent preparing for your week   and saturday is spent doing chores  so i have little downtime   i want to take a few days off but i m a contractor   you re partnered in this environment  and i don t want to let her down ,dc9ab9
531,I'm really scared,i watched my dad's health decline from a 9-5 office job for years  to the point where he now is unemployed and has seizures as a result of stress   i watch my friends struggle with working in construction and other places they don't want to be   i worked in retail for a brief time and watched people older than me work two jobs to stay afloat   i'm graduating with a computer science job end of year  but the news of how tech companies treat workers and the harm their inventions cause scare me   i don't know what to do with my life  and how to avoid this nightmare scenario of my entire life being wasted doing something i don't enjoy  or that actively harms others ,dbzzgu
532,My workplace does an annual survey....,so  they do this workplace survey every year and they ask you bullshit agree disagree strongly agree strongly disagree questions about what it's like to work here  and it's confidential  at the end they ask you for 2-3 things that would improve your work environment so i said    flexible schedules without cutting into pay or vacation time  hourly wage systems are archaic   more autonomy  adults don't need to be  supervised   cooperative ownership of the company and workplace democracy ,dcdvhx

535,The “We” people at work,you all know someone like this  you finish a project  they will say  we finished the project  you have an upcoming task  they will tell you  we will have to   but it really means you will be doing it and we will take the credit  they even will fuck up their tasks and then will say we fucked up  like no  keep me out of your mouth i had no part in this  in my personal experience there s even been times where i will help them with a task  read  do it for them  and then i overhear them on the phone talking with a colleague about how they did that portion  not even a  we  this time    i m not sure where i m going with this but i just wanted to rant and thought you guys would relate ,dbwh51

539,I hate having to pretend to be upset about stupid shit,i work for a hotel company in the purchasing department  recently my hotels have gotten into the habit of ordering stuff when they re already out of it or sometimes the vendors just don t update us when something is out of stock  this ends up turning into me having to follow up with the vendor to rush them on deliveries and become aggressive when their orders are on back order causing us not to get them on time  i cannot stress enough how much i dont give a shit that you dont have any luggage tags and that the robe belts dont match  i seriously wasted 20 minutes today trying to write an email that made it sound like i actually cared  i hate being mean to these reps due to stuff they can t control  why do i have to  escalate  the situation why do i have to be nasty and mean to make people do things  i m sure if i m nice and understanding they ll be just as efficient  i m tired of pretending to be upset about stupid shit ,dc3uvr
540,I don't know if I'll be able to handle it., ok so i just really need to vent  sorry for my bad english btw    i'm 20 and studying what i love even if it will not lead to any job but studying some serious field doesn't seem to help a lot for this anyway  i'm working at minimum wadge in a busy restaurant at the same time and i'm already tired of all of this    i'm struggling with ptsd and depression since a couple of years  life already feels worthless enough without the nonsense of doing some exhausting meaningless task all day long  studying is what keep a bit of my sanity as i'm not totaly defining myself by the job i'm doing  i have something else for the moment  i'm not even able to study properly but going to my cours even if i'm failing is enough to make me feel that there is something else    i did the math and if i keep living with roommates  i could work only 4 days a weak but 4 days at the place i'm working means your back will hurt all the time  i panic more and more when i'm there  we don't even have the time to drink water while you're going medium rare near the stoves so don't even thing about taking a minute to breath    when i was in a really fucked up situation  i though about prostitution as a way to survive  turns out that i never had to do it but now that i see what the alternative is i start to think that it might be better  i've never seen it as something else than getting rape to get money but it seems more and more bearable  maybe i'd need to hit rock bottom to realise that everything was just fine  if only i could make enough money to get some therapy i'd see some hope but there is no way  i don't know how to do this ,dc4pzp
541,A rant about a (sort of) fulfilling job.,tldr  humans r shit  even good jobs suck sometimes  dealing with animal abuse and euthanasia is better than retail    so i work part time at my local animal control and i gotta say  as jobs go  it's the longest and the most satisfied i've ever been with work life  my coworkers are not  all  gossipy bitches  the management is  mildly  understanding and lenient  and the hours are  usually  very manageable with  reasonably  good pay  so overall  i can't complain  but once in awhile i still get this nasty sense that my job is nothing but cleaning up after other people's messes  be it mistreatment of an animal  people unwilling or unable to euthanize animals themselves  people losing animals in stupid ways  irresponsible breeders  or just people not having a smidge of common sense  90  of my job is because the human race is shit to the creatures they domesticated and brought into the world themselves  my coworker had to do six euthanasias yesterday for various reasons  some legit  some questionable  and is now at home drinking her weekend away   but i wouldn't trade this career for anything  because i've spent my time in retail and it is soul crushing on another level  and i never  ever want to go back to a job that is any less meaningful  i'm super scared that if i ever got fired i would never be able to find a job that was as good and i wouldn't want to continue living  working with animals is my last haven of meaning in life  if i didnt have that  i would be suicidal   thank you for coming to my ted talk  the end ,dc654c

545,Advice for living on part-time work with health issues?,hi anti work fam  i'm a 29 y o with a degree in electrical engineering  i've dealt with depression anxiety for 10 years and chronic pain for about 5  probably had chronic pain earlier but y'know  i've been in my current job for 2 and a half years and i filed for fmla about a year ago  with that i worked 30 hour weeks for a few months until my pain management was better  and since then i've worked 30-40 hours with usually taking unpaid time  i accrue about 3 hours of sick time every two weeks  and my vacation is gone for the year    i feel as though i got burnt out bad after 2 years in my first job after college  but i was making enough money to kind of afford quitting outright  money went fast though  and it took me months longer than i intended to find a new job  things were sort of stable for a bit but lately i've been having more fatigue issues  i'm feeling burnt out and done  when i try to make up time and work 9 hours  i'm fucked the next day  i feel forced to be dishonest about the hours i actually work because i just can't do it   i worry about losing my job a lot  or i worry i'm just going to feel forced to quit because of my health issues   i couldn't find a part time job when i looked for one because i can't do a lot of things physically  i ended up as a dog walker for 20-25 hours a week for 3 months but my paychecks were horrible  couldn't even pay my rent let alone health bills  has anyone had success living and working part time  my experience in college was that with part time i was always exhausted anyway ,ddcsmn

547,why do so many rooms/houses require you to have a full time job?,look  i get that you want someone who can pay the rent  no one wants to be left in the lurch financially  but it just seems so narrow minded to me and i suspect it isn't about whether or not the person can pay the rent  it comes from a belief that real  morally correct  responsible adults work full time  like if you don't spent your whole life at work you must be a druggo loser who plays video games all day and never washes your dishes   what's wrong with working part time  you know  having a sense of work life balance  my mum worked part time my whole childhood  raised me fine  didn't have debts  i had everything i needed and seven quite a few things i wanted  that's not even to mention there are people who work in alternative ways these days but definitely make enough money to make rent  creative professions  freelance work  fifo workers  etc   when i finish my degree  i'll take a full time job if i have to  but if i have the option i'd prefer part time because i'd like to  you know  have time for other things  because my identity is made up of more than just work  because we live in a beautiful wold and i want to enjoy it more than just for a few hours on the weekends between all my other errands   where i'm looking at moving the rent is not that high  wages are higher than average in my field  and having a degree i'm sure i'll be able to land one of these jobs and easily make rent while working part time  it'll certainly be more than i've ever had before  yet i'm worried people won't want me as a housemate or to lease to me if i'm not working full time  it's just such brainwashing over this arbitrary standard  and this is why i hate work culture   sorry for the rant ,dd4ysm
548,"my post about free work for job applications got deleted instantly, maybe it will be appreciated here",this was the post  ---   43  of my callbacks have required hours of free work before the first interview     was just going over my numbers for my job search    more and more employers want you to do some work before they even talk to you  it's always at least 2 hours  often quite a bit more  and if it's at their office you can add travel time and costs as well  a few times i've had the free work sprung on me at the first interview  which i think is a very dodgy practice    this is the kind of thing i mean   https slate com human-interest 2019 03 job-interview-work-assignments-free-labor html   i agree with alison green that this is unreasonable  in the comments you can many stories of people who did the work and were completely ghosted afterwards  i've been there  and it hurts like hell    it's fine to say that you should just pass on employers who want this  but if my numbers are any indication  that will deeply affect your job search  if you do the work  you could get wrung out pretty fast    if i had done all the free work employers have tried to give me  it would have run to over 100 hours by now  and not easy work you can dash off  a lot of it would have been equivalent to university assignments you would spend weeks on  magnify that out to all the jobseekers in the usa alone and it's a scary amount of free and fruitless labor being done by the unemployed    to the jobseekers out there  do you think this is acceptable   ---  on a more anti-work tip  i think this free-work-to-get-work trend is horrifying   this is  in addition to  free work via unpaid  internships  or unpaid internships for college credit that you have to pay tuition for  a whole other rant of mine   where is the line   or is there just gonna be no line ,dd82y7

553,Working as a mail carrier literally made me cry and made me feel I aged 20 years.,several years back i took a job as a city carrier assistant and was so excited  several months later my body and mind was a wreck    - 6 day work weeks  - 7 day work week during holidays  no lie  usps has contract with amazon and can ship on sundays  - carry a load of a work mule - old tin can work vehicles that would always break down  one time parking brakes didn't work and vehicle literally rolled down street as i chased it down after dropping off package - management asking workers to clock out and continue working - dogs let me tell you about dogs  i had ptsd regarding dogs for at least a year afterwards  several times i had to pepper spray loose violent ones  - the heat  rain  freezing cold  pollution  etc  didn't matter  you went out and worked - mailing into the night literally with head lamp and going through people's yards to drop off mail - junk mail  over 50  of the work load could be eliminated just be having a policy of no junk  one day a week we would get ad day where we had to load up 6 or 7 big parcels of local ads  each mailbox was to get one  - rashes between thighs  feet burning  paper cuts  rubber bands snapping  shoulder  amp  back pain  you name it - no reward for hard work  if you finished route early they would just go send you to help another - drunk citizens yelling at you  people filming you as they laugh watching a dog chasing you  harassing about if you got their paycheck  etc   i literally thought the heat would do me in as i live in the south  however  it was actually the cold one day  it was pouring down rain in just about freezing temperature  i had a mental breakdown and started crying  i wiped my tears and finished day  next day i was on first stop on route and turned around  i went into office laid keys down on manager's table and i was done  i think that was the most relief i had ever had in my life   during just a few months i went from optimistic post-graduate to a hardened bitter towards real life work person  in a way i'm glad i did the job because it opened my eyes to how real world literally grinds people down  if i wouldn't have i may have had a series of just tolerable jobs that were a slow simmer of negativity ,dcands

560,My take on how automation has been perverted and ruined working standards.,the 40 hour workweek is a relic of the industrial age  automation has made it possible to reduce the hours we need to work and live better lives  here's how that opportunity has been squandered   imagine you have a group project for school  there are four tasks to do  there are four of you in the group   now one of those tasks has been done automatically and easily  great  now each of you is responsivle for 25  less work  your remaining 75  can be done better because you aren't burned out  you turn in your project and all get as thanks to the automated help  next hear maybe another task gets automated and everybody keeps doing better   companies now are a teacher who says that since there are only three tasks  the fourth person is kicked out of the group and gets an f because he doesn't have a chance to get into a group at all by the deadline or the resources to do the whole project himself  he suffers a lot   the other group members gain nothing  and the teacher has just hoarded an a to himself    i hear you saying  but this analogy makes no sense  hoarding as doesn't get the teacher anything   well congrats  now you understand why sitting on millions you could never spend would make someone an asshole    automation should have made our lives better  instead its just being used to hurt people  this will hold technology back in the long run and prevent us from ever reaching a utopia society ,dcw2v8

604,I don’t know how many will believe me but...,i know how we can get society to allow us to only work if we want to and how much we want to  with all our desires being fulfilled along the way    it all revolves around the treatment of the cow   if we can stop slaughtering cows  and let them live as free as possible we will see significant increase in our leisure time  our leisure to work ratio will increase  our desires will be fulfilled   i haven t worked a day in my life by the grace of waheguru and i think i m sent here to help spread this message that we re not meant to slave away and sacrifice all our hopes desires to survive ,dc14p7

606,Help me I'm dying,doesn't it suck that while work is a struggle that not working is an even bigger struggle   the funniest part about being alive in the usa is that you are not allowed to buy food if you are unemployed  true  you may be able to apply for snap but i make  0 a month and i've never been accepted  it seems like you had to have worked for a long time before collecting any money from the government    it's just the darnedest thing that there is such thing as unemployment in the first place  you'd figure there would be enough to jobs to do for everyone on earth but for the 3  in the usa who can't find jobs it just seems odd  i really believe unemployment exists to keep labor costs artificially cheap   and whats weird  is i get to watch you people rant about how bad work is and while i whole heartedly agree ---i'm part of the 3  who don't work at all but wish i could    being a slave sucks  being unemployed  worse and i wish i could be a slave at least then i could buy things like fucking food   conclusion  life sucks for everyone  and why the fuck is it like this and where is the revolution ,dbzp6n
607,"On ""2 weeks"".",i've seen quite a few posts comments saying how putting in one's 2 weeks should just be ignored and one should quit on the spot  while i agree in principle  they don't really care if i'm gone or not  my main concern is with my coworkers  they don't deserve to pick up for my slack because i quit with no warning  bosses are usually very bad at getting to a replacement hire  but they usually start looking after a week  enough time for them to get someone to replace me  what explanation do you all have for quitting on the spot anyway ,dclvcf

611,Being Sabotaged at Work due to Jealously and Being Introverted/Hermit Like,i have worked a number of jobs before and it is always the same   people attack me since i am an introvert who doesn't like to drink  smoke or party   i am hermit like and love being alone doing my own isolated hobbies   i don't like being around a mass of people acting like animals in loud clubs filled with nasty cigarette smoke   people always looked down on me for being a loner  i don't even tell them about my personal life but they either assume things about so since i am quiet or they go and look up people from my past and get personal stuff about me   they also go and find out about my academic accomplishments and become insanely jealous which leads to verbal abuse  harassment  calling me stupid to feel better about themselves and bragging that they are better than me due to being more popular going to parties  which i dont even care for since i hate parties and dont want to be popular   they also constantly compete with me and talk trash behind my back to other coworkers to make me look bad and try to mentally abuse me to get me to leave due to fear that i do better than them  one senior even told me that he feared i took his job due to my credentials and performance at work    i actually like working and studying if the material is fulfilling but it is the office politics  people's jealous cruelty insecurity narcissim bullying and crap behaviour and the horrible capitalistic nepotism work system which i hate ,dcwyrl
612,Story time: Job Trial Edition,so i had a job trial as a barista at a little cafe yesterday  i was due to do a 3 hour trial so they could see if i was a good fit and to make sure i like the place   i only lasted half an hour  the lady on the coffee machine with me was so nit picky and rude  i tried to make conversation and be friendly but she just wasn t having it  she kept berating me to hurry up and got mad for making mess or making small mistakes and i was like  i ve only been here for 15 minutes   so eventually i got fed up and said  right well i don t want this job anyway so i m out of here  seeya  and walked straight out the door   the manager shouted out after me  go then  you re a pussy  you can t handle it   i shouted back  that s right  and never looked back   why is it so hard to find a workplace that ll treat you with at least a base level of respect ,decrvs
613,How can parents do it???,i am married  no kids  most of the time i cannot function if i don't get two full days downtime to begin work week   but i don't have any other chores that i have to do for kids which are so mindless  time consuming and monotonous  school runs  packing lunches  arranging birthday parties  managing tantrums   cleaning shit are just some few of the tasks i would be putting up with had i been a parent and i cannot fathom how i would maintain my sanity at the end of the day to begin work the next day   how do parents manage to even turn up to work and do something is beyond me  that's why maybe they are all shitty at their tasks to begin with as their minds are constantly all over the place thinking about what needs done at home or for school for kids  especially the ones with toddlers  these guys can't get enough sleep at night and still manage to come to work the next day  maybe half sleepy   i cannot do that  maybe i am not a human being or i am depressed or its my basic inability to cope with life whatever you call that  i cannot be a parent and work at the same time  and if i am so sucked by corporations for a penny's worth  i would avoid repeating the cycle and subjecting my kids to the same wage slavery anyway  ,ddikjy

616,Working as an Immigrant,working in itself as a resident of the country is hell but i am an immigrant on a work visa and that's like double times hell   one  your job is tied to your visa and vice versa  unless i have visa i don't get to apply for a job and once i have it i need to prove i have been on a continuous employment for a certain number of years if i need to settle down   two  unless i get citizenship leave to remain pr i cannot think of investing in house or getting married  potentially my spouse would either have to leave their job if they are from a different country or my home country and search a new one and in the worst case if a dependent is not allowed to work then that's half the income gone   three  employers very well know you are on a work visa and if they get a hint that you have taken a student loan in foreign currency which there is no way you will be able to repay back in your home country without having a job  it's their golden chance to take advantage of you to the max  so they make you work two to three times more than what you are paid for and your pathetic situation would mean you cannot refuse   fourth  you may or may not adjust to cultural differences and society in general and begin to feel extremely isolated and lonely  you would feel time slipping by and you being trapped in such a situation that you cannot take any risk of changing a job let alone quitting   i have seen a lot of my friends take student debts   go to universities abroad  compete with thousands of applicants  get into the rigmarole of the long queue and years of waiting for citizenship all the while being treated like a slave in eternal servitude of the work visa they were so proud to obtain in the beginning    this is not to discourage people but paint the true picture of what you are supposed to give up and how life looks like as an immigrant  many of these people come from third world countries which are basically shit holes but life is not rosy in the western world either    i am on a work visa and i have no student debt  i am not banking on a citizenship process here and have made alternative plans should my job not progress for a longer term  there is no way i am investing in a home abroad and being trapped into the cycle of wage slavery  people should think hundred times before taking expensive long term decisions  i cannot fathom how i would maintain my sanity if i didn't have a plan b  or c  or d ,dbwmut

624,Refusing to work: should you live or die?,in the human rights declaration it says    gt everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family  including food  clothing  housing and medical care and necessary social services  and the right to security in the event of unemployment  sickness  disability  widowhood  old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control    i've been thinking about whether this means you always a right to housing and food and being alive  or only if you work  in the first half it says everybody has those rights  with no conditions  in the second half it guarantees  security  but only to those without livelihood caused by things outside their control  so if you refuse to work  you deserve to have all the things to be alive  but no  security  i'm unsure what that means   it's just a small mind game anyways  right now in practise  you have to work to be allowed to be alive  which in my mind makes it ironic that many deny people the right to die  if i don't want to work i'm not allowed to be alive  but i'm also not allowed to die ,ddui3r
