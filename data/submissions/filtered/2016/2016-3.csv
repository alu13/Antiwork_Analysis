1,"""Work"" (xpost from r/SanctionedSuicide)",forced into life  you re told it s your duty to work for the privilege of living   to sustain an existence you had no part in making   you re expected to forfeit your time in a job that you hate to earn just enough to survive   to slave for pennies and save for a retirement you ll never receive   and so goes the cycle of living to work and working to live   wake with the alarm and commute to your cage   endure 8 hours of tedium and stress  frustration and fatigue  ass-kissing and office politics   come home exhausted  anesthetize yourself with tv  then head off to bed to do it all again   work  eat  sleep  repeat   like a broken record  over and over  again and again  day in and day out   this is your life  an absurd daily grind  8 hours a day  5 days a week   spend the weekends recuperating and doing the crap you couldn t do while you were working   cooking  cleaning  laundry  maintenance of a miserable life   a morsel of pleasure may be found here and there   but time keeps score  the clock ticks down   because the next thing you know you re back at your desk  back in the bondage of work   with another week s worth of shit to swallow ,49zo5a
