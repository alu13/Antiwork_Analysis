7,Looking for someone good with WordPress and has Dev Op Skills and you will get paid for it!,"So as some of you may have noticed, the site is still down. The guy who does my hosting has been trying for two days but isn't having much luck past securing the database and a few other things.

If you're great with WP stuff and wouldn't mind lending a hand or know someone like this, please feel free to message me or respond here! You'd definitely get paid for this though how much is a question of what the guy who does my hosting thinks.
