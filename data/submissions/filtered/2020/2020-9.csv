1,Plan your annual leave right!,hey guys   been reading this thread a lot more recently and found it helps when im feeling unmotivated or frustrated about working sometimes get a good laugh and it cheers me up   its nice knowing others feel the same but i found something that helped me feel better today i put in all my annual leave 30 days around all the busiest times during work so i will be working the bulk of my hours during the low season if you will and have lots of days off on mondays and fridays attached to the weekends during the peak busy times of year this really mentally splits up the drudgery and weeks of what feels like monotony and endless work  working 34 day weeks makes such a difference if youre really going through it i find staggering my holidays through out the year helps id get seriously depressed if i knew i didnt have annual leave for 6 months too scared to touch any sick days until i reach 5 years continuous service   remember to take care of yourself first,j0xvme

3,"""Class"" division among countries",as a developing country citizen i get bombarded everyday with media and people in general stating how great capitalism is and how wonderful it works for europe the us and many former british empire  colonies  and how our countries in the south emisphere are shitholes and should instead embrace their free market system  these people never stop and  guess what would happen to the wealthy countries if someday africa latin america asia and the middle east decided to stop giving their resources for nothing and providing cheap labour how long the living standard of the global north could be mantained if suddendly their governments and corporations had to retreat from the third world would they be as rich and powerful if they had to play fair instead of sinking peaceful nations into debt  with the world financial system or burn to ashes those that do not participate in this global scam,j1q4mj
4,Just venting,i use to work at a beauty store i have moved around states a lot this specific chain is all over the nation since working retail it has riddled me with anxiety to the point i cant stick with anything for more than 3 months   working with the public has destroyed me i have been called racist for telling customers to please not try on nail polish if theyre not going to buy it ive also been bitched out by my managers for not following black customers all throughout the store ive also been bitched at for not chasing thieves down in the parking lot im not risking my life for a fucking tube of lipstick   its so fucked i want to make money but i dont want to be miserable doing it i envy people who can grind it out my family thinks im super weak for not being able to amp im often the topic of conversation so they can deflect when it comes to their flaws   i understand why some people equate work ethic to productivity but i dont think employment should define a persons value,j26i1s
5,What if you could choose between a pay raise or that percentage of time off?,say for example youre due for a promotion what if you could choose instead of a 10 raise example only lol you took 10 of your pay period off  and you can continue to do so each raisepromotion cycle until youre working part time for that same salary or take the raise one year and the reduction in hours another i would like to have the option it kind of falls apart when most of us dont get raises and theyre less than 5 but anyway just a thought  personally 40 more years in front of a computer screen for 40 hours a week makes me pray for an option like this,j1v052
6,My request for a better work computer got denied. This works to my advantage.,i deal with maps one of the projects im attempting to work on for example uses topography of my county with a 1m resolution it takes a decent computer to do that in a reasonable time i have a decent computer aside from a graphics card i asked for a better one but they denied it so literally any time i do something like pan the map it takes a solid two minutes to reload doing anything more intensive can take an hour and the computer is pretty much unusable  now i also am severely underpaid for my skillset its roughly half as much and a promotion was also denied because of budget constraints thanks to covid  so i guess i have a legitimate reason to be on my phone all day i have the golden antiwork ticket ,j21nq0

8,Office politics are absolutely killing me. I work at a grocery store.,its a higherend store similar to whole foods im a cashier there ive been there for a few years its a job that a lot of people dont want and most people dont hold onto for long its a loud busy environment working with customers ranging from friendly to hostile to aggressive sadly theres an internal conflict in the store over who has to backup the cashiers when we start getting lines my manager wont help us out unless she really has to and immediately returns to her office when she can there are some staff that just refuse to have anything to do with it others will help out but are unhappy about it and become short with customers   the whole thing is so demoralizing because my employer is basically saying that my job sucks so bad that people fight over who will have to do it for a few minutes but acknowledgement of the work i do is nonexistent and compensation is restricted as much as possible there was one employee who made a big deal about it and argued a lot with upper management about my manager not helping out they fired him over it so now talking about it is totally taboo   i just keep thinking god damn this is a grocery store how can there be so much conflict,j2dzme

27,Corporalism and Grey Skies,currency floats in our society so much that currency is technically both in an absurd abundance as well as simultaneously being invisibly transparent the 8020 rule is very much so evident in the case of corporalism and currency as a cohesive society we spend our absolute most significant resources both in the form of technology and humans themselves in order to scrape on and off floating currencies out of corporalist jobs some humans are brilliant their value lies in their skillsets and mind most humans are hardworking their value lies in their numbers and lack of voice  considering the topic and reflecting it would be easy to conclude that this is in fact just how it is we spend our resources both individually and collectively to satisfy the corporal there is constantly a corporal cog that requires motion in the form of human fuel to break the cog would not singly do good nor singly do harm there is no longer any distinction between them a person x free of the cog is a person free of civilization and any person that x desires to interact with also has to be a person free of civilization too as minimal as the act of existing within a countrys borders would threaten the person xs freedom as well would the act of purchasing an egg for breakfast  despite unable to achieve freedom from the cog there are people thriving and blossoming one explanation would be to label the thriving as members of the 20 they are on the forefront when it comes to corporal interests meaning they have skillsets of actual use to the rest of the 20 the thriving ranges from the happy independent freelancers that makes enough money to sustain themselves to the ultrawealthy oligarchs that lives in unbelieveable luxury in common is their service to the cog the oligarchs money is a symbol of time quite literally translating to a members ticket that is consumed constantly but never exhumed due to its near infinite pool of content the cog does not operate in morality fuel is fuel meanwhile the freelancer is granted the privilege of a single ticket every once in a while completely independently as opposed to a worker from the 80s the freelancer celebrates the usage of the ticket and experiences both the joy of individual labor as well as the relief of cog duty  to differentiate between the individual laborers of the 20s and all of the 80s one has to look at the source of ones labor while the 80s labor is very rigidly given from a higher hierarchical position the 20s labor is always operating as equals devoid of hierarchies this gives enormous power and often a sense of pride to the 20s granting individual creative freedom if one pictures the cog duty ending by physically inserting ones ticket into it the 20s are always the ones doing the inserting as opposed to the neverincluded 80s in that sense cog duty could be entirely similar and even worse off for 20s compared to 80s meaning a member of the 20s could have labor so horrible and souldrenching while the member of the 80s could work in offices of gold and glitter with aesthetics luxurious the difference lies in the freedom of the two the 80s member owns nothing of value to the cog the 20s member has value and opportunities   this symbolical ended cog duty is another word for time given because of this definition one can further include another set of members to the 20s the hobbyists as time given is a signal for your mind to turn towards personal interests one could kill two birds with one stone by working with hobbies within 20s conditions as one goes to insert ones ticket into the cog one could already be filled with hours and hours of eustress and satisfaction only personal projects could grant one could even argue one would not need the time given at all because the time taken is all one needs there is no point in differentiating freelancers and hobbyists one could be both and one could be either but the most important is to differ them from the 80s,j2165p

52,Overemphasis on STEM,whats so great about stem every second job seems to be coding this and data that western universities seem to be churning out compsci and data grads by the bucketload while arts and humanities grads are laughed at and end up slinging espresso    i studied a humanities degree in european languages the communications and research skills that gave me were really useful in my prior career media and carried over into my current one it support  actually having social skills goes a long way    if we abandon the pursuit of the study of humanities language history etc in favour of churning out wellpaid i admit code monkeys which seems all the rage now we risk losing out on people who might see value in art and culture   what im trying to say is although stem and stem careers might be so hot right now lets not lose sight of what makes us us besides most of these stem jobs are either i in vulture capitalfunded startups whose end goal is an eventual sale to ii corporations,j1j2z2
53,Put in my two weeks today. Never felt better.,long story short my job was monotonous voluminous and unsustainable workload was getting worse and worse i worked in a field where we got busier during covid and then our company got transferred over along with the rest of the workload and the last 23 weeks have been nothing short of hell new systems etc plus monotony and never ending shit  i knew it was time to leave when my family asked if i was going to visit them on sunday an hour or so drive and i told them i couldnt because i was so burnt and drained i literally spent all weekend on the couch lifeless   i was like is this me wtf i cant even see my family im so drained in every possible way no no no no fuck this shit   im taking a break from working i understand my job is abnormally insane with workload but i need a month or two off ill figure it out i cant live like this anymore nobody in my office talks barely anybody laughs its tense stressful and all i hear is clicking of mouses and typing on keyboards coupled with people on the phone here and there  nope  i have an interview for a wfh position that i really hope i get but honestly i wouldnt be opposed to some time off this job has compromised my sense of self enough where i need to quit before i burn out completely i tried to nap earlier and i couldnt because my brain felt like a burnt out vacuum that wouldnt start  fuck work i am more valuable than mindlessly faxing things up to 85 times a day as well as reaching out on 86100 tjinhs plus any side tasks or emailsvoicemails we need to handle   ill miss my boss and maybe two co workers i cant wait to feel like myself again  fuck jobs that make you feel like a hamster in a wheel that never stops spinning,j2bftd

58,"Hired on as a cashier, now doing courtesy.",just like the title said when i went in for the interview it was for a cashier position  now however i work every weekday doing anything but cash  courtesy is essentially the store labourers i will do anything and everything from changing garbages pushing rows of 710 carts and sanitizing them due to covid  climbing an extension ladder to do the billboard outside etc  i specifically told my current boss at the time of the interview that cashing would be a great asset for my resume and also a transferable skill  unfortunately though i was on cash for maybe a months top from being hired now everything i do is completely unrelated  supposedly theyre short staffed but management says the store isnt hiring which makes 0 sense if youre short staffed  the biggest issue i have is that i actually dont mind cash at all  like i said its a skill that can be easily transferable but before these courtesy shifts took over i actually didnt mind my workplace coworkers are great its a fairly good atmosphere even management was decent  but doing a completely different job from what i was hired on is so mentally and physically draining i could care less about my coworkers courtesy is far more physical than cash and is basically nonstop doing various tasks back and forth at a very fast pace  ive voiced concerns that this wasnt what i was hired on for and have got back exactly a single 4 hour cash shift in like the past 15 months  another thing that is obnoxious to say the least is that i have never actually went on my breaks on time  the 15 minute break is always late no matter what daycircumstances and if my 30 minute lunch break isnt late its completely forgotten  the store acts like they want you to go on your breaks and constantly remind you early on only to tell you to do a task like 105 minutes before your break resulting in a latermissed one  and obviously it pays minimum wage and has little opportunity to advance or get a raise  every single shift i do is just so exhausting all i am capable of doing after is watching tv and going to bed  heck i even struggle to fall asleep knowing ill be doing it again  thats my little lecture here im trying to keep on pushing for cashier shifts but if i dont see any changes upcoming ill probably push past the line and decide to find a new job  i dont mind the company coworkers even the previous job the one i was hired for but what im doing now is honestly so tedious and boring it really is a mood killer,j264mb

62,"What type of company do you work for, and are you organizing at your job?",im really interested in labor organizing as a tool in a program of broader change i work at a smallish retail company around 100 employees over three local branches and weve been working with a national union to organize for an election to establish a local at our workplace its been slow going getting the votes we need to file for an election with the national labor relations board but were almost there   its a little scary the business has been hit hard by the pandemic and consequent shutdown measures capacity limits and people just not wanting to risk exposure to shop in person theres been talk of the business closing if our city has to shut down nonessential businesses again we can operate during a shutdown but it cuts incoming revenue by a lot im a little afraid that if we file for an election the owners will just close the business however the union were working with has helped a few of their locals seize their workplaces after closures and run them as collectively owned worker coops that would be the dream  i think that the collective bargaining power national union backing could give us would make our jobs better my workplace is also quite prestigious within its industry and in the city where i live so if were successful that also gives us an opportunity to serve as an example of what successful labor organizing can look like in an industry that is typically unionfree itd be nice to think that we could contribute to the strengthening of labor unions somehow  businesses are really afraid of unions amazon recently notified their employees that theyre being monitored for labor organizing activities this is illegal intimidation but the fines amazon would face if a complaint were filed mean nothing to them however people are still working to organize at amazon think of the change that could be achieved by a concerted effort to organize all amazon drivers programmers and warehouse workers if it was twentyfive percent successful just in one branch of operations amazon wouldnt be able to fight it for instance if one distribution center organized and filed for an election amazon would immediately close that center if 25 percent of their distribution centers filed for elections simultaneously theyd have a harder time quashing it i dont mean to downplay the work of people already organizing at amazon im saying theyre doing good work and they have a real chance at gaining some say in the material conditions of their employment  how do yall feel about labor organizing what size company do you work at ive been purposely vague about what we sell because i dont want to risk exposing our organizing efforts at all do you think unionizing your workplace could make your job tolerable,j2k92s

65,I’ve worked full time for two days and I already wanna quit,ive wasted the last 7 years of my life in a grocery store i guess i got way too comfortable and never looked for more because i was able to sustain myself and my lifestyle without much care even though the job sucked i still had time for myself   my boss approached me about going for a new position at a different store in a much wealthier area i regrettably said yes had the interview got the job i started there on monday and although im trying to stay positive its fucking hard the employees avoid me despite my best efforts to get to know people the customers are rich assholes who either dont speak to you at all or make you bend over backwards for them on top of that each day ive worked there were 3 call outs meaning i had to absorb the responsibilities of 3 extra people   being in my old store for so long i got along with everyone i received two farewell cards completely packed with messages from people its a complete night and day difference and i feel like i dont fit in at all here   idk man this shits just not worth it im going to start a six month coding academy lol on october 20th if its not too expensive i need a change asap because im gonna lose my shit if i have to stay in my new store any longer than i have to now let me go get ready for another 8 hours of bullshit ,j2mdqx

68,Working by Gaslight in the time of COVID,tldr employers are monsters and life is terrible this is a dumb rant    today in my work inbox was a letter from the hourly employees rep about a talk with the administration about employment security going forward ie how theres no security no big surprise but this blurb got me  gtnevertheless as sobering as the above uncertainty might sound the absolute last thing monsters university wishes to do  to any of its employees  is abandon them this is why employees were paid 100 of their wages through june 30th even if no hours were scheduled this is why employees the current priority being those who havent been scheduled since june 30th have been shifted to available positions in other departments when their position ended instead of being let go entirely desertion and mistreatment are not items on the agenda   gt   gtvp james p sullivan provided one sweeping example of a group of employees reassigned to different positions from what they were initially assigned our lifeguards given that our pool is closed until further notice but our outside track is open to the public our lifeguards are currently employed as safety ambassadors on the track monitoring for safety and enforcing social distancing this does not mean that when the pool reopens they wont be lifeguards again just that in the interim their position has changed and they are still earning wages  names have been changed to protect me from a defamation suit or something i dont know  i spent most of june fighting to get paid for weeks of work that my supervisor did not want to pay me for while also fighting for them to tell me what my hours actually were or if i had been fired or not hr and business services the latter of which sully is vp were places i contacted for help mediating this and a botched screencap text message revealed that those folks were all coordinating to craft emails to send to me under my supervisors name in order to gaslight me into dropping my claim  i did not by the way and forwarded that fumble along to the state along with the rest of the correspondence and eventually got my wages back but certainly not anything like the 100 of wages that the rep letter said the fight to learn how many hours they wanted me to work or not also made applying for unemployment a real treat and i lost weeks of benefits due to that  the bit about the lifeguards was the real thumb into the wound though as it was actually a clever way to keep people on the payroll but while they were coming up with that idea they were trying to screw me while i am doing a job that is meaningful and so difficult to replace that they wont fire me  it bothered me so much in such a cold pitinyourchest way that i had to write the rep a lengthy letter rebutting the assertion with the details of my experience and talking about the emotional and financial toll it took on me and my family  the letter was long so i wont post it but i wanted to post the snip from the last paragraph because it described just how bad im feeling right now  gtbut i nonetheless think that sentiment should have been applied to going forwardand not to where we have been because the amusement is only a tinge to a deep lonely sadness at seeing such cleverness be applied to reemploying people whose jobs are literally useless right now while the only effort put into addressing my continuing struggle to stay above water was to push me further down  so this isnt a post that will really grease up your guillotine i admit i just wanted to shout into the void or at the void because thats better than just sitting there as the void passes over and i hope it passes over quickly  i feel sad but also a hardtodescribe sense of disappointment which i called loneliness in my response in the repeated demonstrations that the people who hold my fate in their hands are not just cruel but incredibly careless and too stupid to be effective in their goals when your hurts are inflicted by someone clever or practiced it feels somehow a little less shameful especially if you succeed in the end but i do feel shame even if i should not to be put in such desperate circumstances by the sparring equivalent of a drunken walrus falling down a flight of stairs,j24idk

122,Work killed the happiness inside of me. Just leave me alone and let me be work at my own pace,after trying about 6 jobs in my 20s ive come to realize that no matter what i do ill always hate work i hate sucking up to bosses and acting like i enjoy seeing my coworkers i hate having that pressure to constantly produce results and prove myself i use to believe in genuinely befriending coworkers helping each other out and working together to achieve a common goal we can all be proud of but the corporate life has sucked it out of me everyone in the office always gives off the vibe that they only care about themselves and that theyre ready to throw each other under a bus if needed everything is so fake a superficial   my boss always tells me that hes here for me and wants to see me succeed but every time we meet he also hounds me about how im not progressing fast enough how im learning too slow how i dont understand this or that how he wants me to grow faster never really asks me how i am or how im feeling and dives straight into asking me what ive accomplished for the week if i didnt complete something fast enough for his standards he flies off the walls he likes to tell me how when he was in my position he always completed his assignments before the deadline and went above and beyond to contribute to the company obviously all hes not really here for me it sounds more like hes just here to see what ive produced and to tell me to work faster so the company can get more out of me for less what if i dont care about progressing fast what if i just want to go at my own slow pace what if i dont want to be an overachiever at the cost of my mental and physical wellbeing why cant people just be satisfied with me doing the bare minimum everyone learns and grows at their own pace and everyone has their own life goals too my job requirements never said must be a hard worker and plough through work as fast as you can so you can take on more if they want me to work faster work more then they should offer to pay me more too   ive gotten to the point where i dont give a flying fuck about getting promoted or being the top performing employee because it seems like the harder i work the more responsibilities i get and the more people expect of me sure i might get a small raise or recognition but compared to the torture i have to go through to get it no thanks im not hurting anyone by doing the bare minimum and i dont think anyone should be looked down upon for doing so when has being a super fast and hard worker been the standard   i dont even know what my point in writing this is other than im so sick of working the fake company cultures and being pressure to perform this subreddit is the only place where i feel like i can find people who understand me im just so sick of working and wasting my youth doing things i hate for money its like no one is ever happy  with just enough everyone always wants more more more out of their employees its always all about results and numbers all this company talk of were one big family is a lie its like just let me be let me be as lazy as i want as long as i deliver the bare minimum which is what is only required of me anyway let me live life at my own pace instead of constantly comparing me to other more experienced higher performing people and asking me why i cant be like them how about saying for once even though youre not progressing at the pace im use to i can see that youre learning and slowly getting better how fast you want to progress in this career and company is up to you so as long as youre happy and delivering the minimum were good instead of i gave you this assignment and expected you to complete it faster when i was in your position i completed assignments like this way faster than you this wasnt even that hard to do so i dont understand why youre so slow,j1njck

The test is marked incorrectly and there's nothing I can do about it yayyy,i currently work for my countrys civil service here in the uk and am applying for another job elsewhere in the civil service i did a verbal reasoning test and though something was fishy when i kept choosing the same answer weve all been there choosing b four times in a row on a multiple choice test  feels fishy doesnt it  anyway when you do the test you dont get told the correct answers but i had a look at the practice tests on the civil service jobs website which does tell you the correct answers  who here fancies giving this a go  read the following text and then then rate the accuracy of a given statement based solely upon what the text says   in 2011 the united nations started to promote the idea of national happiness measuring the happiness of their people encouraged countries to look at the wellbeing of their people and use this as an alternative to measures such as gross domestic product gdp   the first world happiness report was published in 2012 it summarised the state of world happiness factors that caused happiness and what this meant for government policy later reports have explored topics such as the importance of happiness for nations and what its objective benefits are as well as ranking countries on reported levels of happiness   critics have argued that the measurement of happiness is difficult countries may have conflicting data for example being high of selfreported happiness but also having a high suicide rate others argue that happiness relates to an individual talking about the happiness of a group is therefore meaningless   is this statement  happiness is a purely personal experience that has no benefits for other outcomes  a true  b false or   c cannot say,iytjs3

171,Work seen as a blessing!,please be kind to me this is my first post here   i was born as a girl child in india to an upper middle class educated family education was thrust on me competition was thrust upon me i participated in a competitive exam to get selected in top 50 students amongst 7 million people who applied i joined went through horrible bullying which almost broke me i couldnt take it anymore  but when i called back home to say i am breaking down i was told that if i come back home i will be married off to a person i havent even met this was not presented as a threat just a reality of life and reality of survival it was presented to me as a blessing that as an indian woman i was being given an option to be independent and work rather than be a subservient housewife  i was scared i persevered did very well in university did well through initial stages of my work life  despite the numerous sexual advances of my seniors offered in exchange for career growth which i categorically resisted yes thats what an independent woman in 1990s india had to go through   i ended up moving out of india to australia and ultimately settling down in uk as i wanted to get away from all the shit i was getting as a working woman in india also i felt the worklife balance is better anywhere outside of india  i fooled myself for years that i was lucky i escaped i have a well paid job and i am not being looked down upon for it or being exploited for it   but i broke down in my late 30s went into therapy i am surviving on medication now i still hold my job i am psychologically dependent on it as it was drilled into my mind since i gained conciousness that career is critical to my survival   starting to thing though where am i going is it all worth it is this all there is to life,ixv0fl

176,Is an anti work society realistic politically and practically?,ive been lurking on this sub for a few months and i totally agree with the majority on here that find work to be horrible and soul crushing personally i couldnt live a happy life if i had to work its nothing short of torture for me   but how would a society where no one worked actually look like assuming that we dont make huge strides in technology and have robots that do everything which isnt going to be any time soon   i see a lot of people on here decry working for the capitalist system for low wages while a few get wealthy that seems to be a huge problem for some people but honestly its not my problem with work  i just dont want to work period i hate the idea of having to get up a certain time in the morning having to answer emails etc it doesnt matter if workers owned the company it doesnt matter my wage or if i was doing it for the good for millions or to make one person rich i made really good money before i quit working i felt valued and my boss was great it didnt really matter i just hate work   but no political system as far as i know guarantees no work communists work i went to cuba and vietnam and they still have jobs they hate bullshit bosses just less inequality and much better social safety nets  even those who pull away completely from society like homesteaders work very hard some are not plugged into the capitalist system at all grow their food take care of lifestock solar panel for energy hunt for meat and some of them report working from sunup to sun down   my sense is that anti work people want to be provided food shelter healthcare and all the basic needs but have the freedom to pursue their own interests thats what i want as well but what would a societypolitical system like that look like like someone will have to work as doctors garbage men farmers etc how do we incentivize those people to do those jobs while the rest of us do nothing,j0bz3m

192,Possible solutions for not working. Solution 1: Homeless by choice,i have been brainstorming a bit and have been pouring over options for not working  theres been a lot of commiserating lately which is fine and good but no real solutions   so lets discuss  each week i want to discuss possible solutions no matter how crazy after all hardcore problems need hardcore solutions nor is one solution going to be for everyone  we also need to define work the way i define work in its negative context is any activity where you are doing the inconvenient or unpleasant stuff so an employer or owner does not have to while the owner or employer does not pay you enough to eventually not do such things or ever get ahead  lets talk about probably the most controversial of solutions  being homeless by choice  while this sub tends to focuses on the employer landlords take up half or more of income   if landlords can be eliminated more resources can be put towards owning things  even perhaps an inexpensive house in a less than desirable area or whatever agenda  on the surface this one is simple if not hardcore as hell and requires balls of steel you simply reduce what you own down to bare necessities and live in either a car or go grab a tent and stealth camp in wooded areas that get little traffic and hopefully remain undiscovered  i do not recommend shelters unless absolutely necessary because of strict rules not compatible with freedom safety and the fact most homeless services exist primarily for salaries often to the tune of hundreds of thousands or to spread cult like religions among a captive audience  positives   with no ties you can literally go anywhere dream job in another state you can move   you literally have nothing to lose job treating you bad what are they going to do make you homeless you laugh in their face   if you do work all that money can be put towards whatever agenda you want be this eventually buying a cheap house in the ghetto staying high or drunk which many do saving up for a plane ticket to a better country or area with better prospects whatever you could work 2 jobs and its all yours and unless you are homeless in some expensive overyped area like san franscisco you could have quite a nest egg   you are not scrambling around the first of the month zero stress from owing people   it can be revolutionary the stories of the rail kids of the 90s abbie hoffman and some not the posers in it for ad views the people on youtube are real you are sticking your thumb up at society and their machinations     negatives   this can not really be done if you have children or a family social services literally hang out in places homeless seek services taking away kids   you have to be somewhat mentally and physically strong this is lots of walking for necessities also lonely and can be demeaning aggravating existing mental conditions   while it is not illegal per se not to own or rent a place many communities make activities of daily living illegal it is illegal to hang around a place without buying something sleeping using the bathroom or pretty much existing this can be mitigated by scouting out hidden locations but in extreme urbanized environments with too many homeless already this may not be possible and works better in medium sized towns rather than mega metropolises   no storage you either have to hide stuff or literally carry everything with you clothes alone are very bulky and heavy and gets dirty and begins to smell anything left outside is considered abandoned so you have no recourse if stuff comes up missing it is possible to get a cheap storage unit but you cant live there and there may come a point where storage fees can exceed the value of what you are storing versus merely replacing things   you have less legal rights on foot or in a car than in a apartment or house cops have been known to stop and frisk or haul in people on questionable suspicions who look homeless   hygiene with no access to bathrooms and showers it is harder to keep clean and this can hamper peoples opinions there are work arounds like gym memberships the occasional hotel room and carrying wet washcloths but each has its shortcomings   you are passively hunted people dont like homeless they want them to go away this can be mitigated by not looking homeless   social standing will lose friends possibly spouseslovers must hide from others because of stigma this can be worked around through presentation hell you arent homeless you are a green urban explorer   thoughts,izi2sb

202,Check out this boomer employer/landlord of mine...,i have been working for this woman who is in her 70s for a year now its a camp host position with lots of acreage surrounded by national forest its so beautiful out here the kicker is i get to live out here for free but there is no pay whatsoever it doesnt matter how hard i work out here i still get nothing she has visited the property a total of two times since ive worked here she barely ever responds to my emails and calls now that oregon winter is fastapproaching she wants to know everything about my past says if i want to keep this job and a place to live i have to sign some documents for it to be legal   the previous camp hosts were given a credit card from her and ran up tons of cash advances since they had control over the website and facebook page when they got caught they held those things for ransom essentially they posted lies and left them up potentially killing tons of business weve had guests mention their serious concerns so i can only imagine the folks that didnt bother to inquire but thats my fault apparently   weve been dealing with the pandemic wildfire smoke guests dont want to bring horses to exercise in that for weeks after sky clears the owners refusal to invest money in the business we had to turn guests away because there is no working bathroom only an outhouse and the ongoing websitefacebook crisis but thats my fault too apparently  this is the email i got this morning removed personal details   thank you name for the information but i need you to elaborate more on   the college experience you said your gi bill ran out because it was expensive forprofit school why did you choose that collage you said you worked and went to collage where did you work etc etc while attending college how long did you spend in the service how long did you work at the last occupation in town  why was your position terminated   what are you getting in aid per month yourself and your mother  business name comes first because it is a business our business the sixth  business  we created  not bought not handed down one of 6 over a span of 60 years of time that we have 10 years of blood sweat and tears as well as 100s of thousands of dollars invested in just this one the same as everyone else who made it into the 3 i am not sure nor do i presume in any way that you are of this mentality but for the record i personally after working with those of your generation have come to a conclusion that they have no concept of what it takes to just manage a business let alone create your own business working every day 247  18 hr or more year after year denying yourself of everything except the absolute necessities to survive for a pittance never taking your eye off your goal watching that pittance grow into a substantial nest egg or enough to start that dream rolling and seeing that dream come into reality education iq nor money has anything to do with success grit is no 1 and was describes once as the tiny piece of sand in the oyster that turns into the pearl and that is so true but it takes a long time perseverance  never never give up  i have seen over and over this generation wants to start at the top but has no grit no drive no reality or concept of reallife skills i lay most of this on parenting or lack thereof well i got carried away but could write a book on this subject  as you have witnessed it only takes a couple of toxic millennials such as previous camp host 1 and previous camp host 2 who in my educated view are exemplary or void of all reallife reality and skills coning their way through life because they believe they deserved that certificate of achievement for merely getting out of bed each day and to hell with everyone else yet i saw qualities in both of them that were phenomenal but used for evil especially camp host 2 has shown and continues to display narcissistic personality which of course has nothing to do with millennials   it is critical that i as ceo of the company make sure i have the best people at business name in order to secure its future you are there because of my decision which was i still believe to be morally correct but as you are aware that was temporaryor like i said to give me time to figure out the future   when you found out about business name facebook site being trashed you said you could fix that  and insissted on doing so which impressed me i made it clear to you i could not and did not have the time to do that but she has not done this  i gave you numbers to call for a person to work with to help fix this i told you that needed to be taken care of asap   if our circumstances were normal i would have worked day and night on behalf of this business but i have not seen this commitment so it is time i make decisions to mitigate further damage by pursuing the best people to continue at business name  so once again i believe you could be a deserving asset but if you are thinking you are there or staying because of your own circumstances that will not be acceptable   i also want to reiterate that new camp manager move or not to move nov 1st has not been decided    just so you will no small children were not in the picture last march nor will it be in the best interest that they be allowed there now business name is in no way a homeless camp i expect to be notified in advance of any significant changes that affect business name or my ability to manage what is going on out there if it does not enhance the business which in the future will enhance everyones future it will probably not happen   your questions are welcome     we recently had a large horse event here and people told me theyve never seen the property look so good   my position wasnt terminated i quit so that i could spend my time on this business but she just assumes i was terminated    i dont know why she referred to herself as ceo she owns the property and business but its not traded    she made up this story that i agreed to fix her website and facebook page apparently for free too like everything else its her business that she would work 18 hours a day to make it work she claims but is unwilling to do anything about the websitefacebook page for a year now but now that she realized the business isnt making money she wants to point the finger at me    the previous camp hosts had a small boy so i dont know what the hell shes talking about   after a year she just decided she gets to demand to know everything about me and make me sign documents   in the previous email i told her i was a homeless veteran before this job so thats why she responded that she doesnt want there to be a homeless camp this coming from the woman who cries in christianity every chance she gets   she said she might be hiring a camp manager to take over the house so i may not even have access to laundryshowerfireplace etc during the winter its all up in the air and has been for the last two weeks extremely stressful  sorry for the rant but i had to get this off my chest and im hoping for some advice on what to do here if i sledgehammer her email to bits it will put my job and living situation in even more jeopardy all this right as winter here is approaching fast,izngzj

213,Why the f-ck are we making this guy deliver pizzas at 89 years old?,ill kick it off by saying that maybe this guy enjoys his job maybe it keeps him healthy and moving or maybe it just keeps him busy and with some extra spending money but at 89 years old this saddens me this ended up being a good story as the guy received a 12000 tip but it got me thinking what has the us become and for every person out there who works to stay young and fit theres many more who dont have a choice and are only working because uncle sam wants his cut right off the top till they lower you into the ground or youre sitting in a can up on a mantle somewhere its depressing,iyo8if

225,Lost in Scandinavia,reading the threads in here i get and understanding about the struggles of other parts of the world im from on of the sweden so feel very privileged in many aspects but i am truly tired of working  did study four years social work in university our government gives grants and loans like around 300 usd per week of study so after 35 years the loans where around 15k usd total i think if you dont study 100 its lower the education is free and the grants and loans are for living expenses everyone is eligible these numbers are calculated with todays exchange the interest on the loans today is 016 with a monthly payment of 60 usd  work in the governmentmunicipality most people with the same degree and earn around 4300 usd per month before taxes 3300 usd after taxes private sector is smaller and earns a bit more the education wasnt that hard and like everyone gets a job the salary after tax include pension payments healthcare and so on we also have 30 vacation days five more when you reach a certian age think its 40 or 50  it cost 10 usd a month to insure against unemployment so if you are laid of you get 80 of you salary for a year or so and after that a bit less even if you dont pay that you are insured but get less but its really hard to layoff people in sweden especially in the government  at my work we have flexible hours so you can come early and go home early come late and work late within some limits  even if this sounds like heaven compared to most countries my goal is to be independent not have to work so even if we have different starting points our goal is the same  hope someone is interested in this rant also im drunk and used google for the spelling,ixxw71

And what’s next?,i understand the concept of not working our lives away and agree that their needs to be a refocus on life happiness family etc but if we dont have people working all the time what will there be to do no outings no tours no flights or is the plan to go back to a homestead style communal living i would be down for that too but unfortunately we loose the technology no more internet or tv and life expectancy will go down without the production of medical equipment and drugs it would obviously need a complete restructure of our world and a large shift of the overton window but is having our lives outside of work worth it when we spend our time out of work just surviving like we had to a few hundred years in the past  tldr we stop working but whats next not against the idea just want to understand the methodology,izmbap

286,Watched “The Founder” on Netflix last night and it got me thinking. My thoughts...,released in 2016 but somehow id missed it til now its based on the story of how mcdonalds became the mega corp we know today  basically the background given in the exposition of the movie is that two brothers dick and mac mcdonald opened their first mcdonalds restaurant in san bernardino in the 30s during the great depression after many years of struggling to make a living by the 50s they had a booming business model as the first successful fast food restaurant that challenged the outdated drivein model they worked hard and their restaurant was a high success that they cared for and loved deeply they put their hearts and passion into the restaurant and were very content with their success  the entire arc of the movie however focuses on ray kroc a sleazy business man hellbent on turning mcdonalds into a franchise through lots of complicated twists and turns he eventually gets the brothers to agree to a contract to let him expand the restaurant and he starts opening franchises in cities across america at first he seems to share the love and passion of the brothers caring as deeply as they do about the restaurants and just wanting to spread the name but over the course of the film he becomes blinded by greed money influence and power he starts screwing over the brothers and bastardizing mcdonalds standards in order to make more money he starts recruiting his friends and trying to shimmy his way up the status ladder his marriage begins falling apart and all he can focus on is how to make more money and gain more influence at one point in the movie he says to his wife wow look at how happy this husbandwife couple i recruited to run one of my restaurants is so great how they work together as a team completely oblivious to his wifes heart breaking because he cant see the irony in his admiration for someone elses relationship truly he gets off on watching other happy couple generate more money for him while brushing his wife and their marriage to the side  long story short he fucks over the brothers basically forces them out of their position as the true owners of mcdonalds by creating a new corporation and stealing the mcdonalds brand name he forced the brothers the change the name of their restaurant and then opened his own mcdonalds in san bernardino to compete with the brothers original restaurant and puts them out of business  watching it got me thinking about how this corporatized rat race dick measuring contest mentally is now at 100000x what it was 70 years ago the hard of small business owners like the brothers is getting stamped out by vicious powerhungry greedy fucks like ray kroc who exploit the hardest workers who are just following their dreams and trying to do something meaningful with their lives im just thinking about how work itself isnt the problem long hours and blood sweat and tears isnt the problem the brothers had something that theyd built with their own hands and they were very happy to have what they did the problem is that there are just enough greedy rich bastards like ray kroc who all love themselves and their money so much that theyre willing to crush other people without so much as a moment of hesitation and all for what money power influence whats the point also worth noting that this motherfucker hoard his massive wealth of billions until his sorry ass kicked the bucket it wasnt until after he died that his new wife for whom he divorced his first wife after having a long affair eventually became a philanthropist and donated everything to the salvation army and other charities he was probably a controlling piece of shit and wouldnt let her touch his riches til he died  anyway sorry just rambling my thoughts def recommend the movie even though it made me angry it was well paced with very little filler content and the acting was good the actual events in the movie are mostly fictitious but basically representative of the actual story thanks for reading,iut80v

368,The Four Burners Theory showed me the myth behind achieving Work-life balance, were often working extremely hard and trying to find balance across the various realms of our lives im guilty of this too this was when i came across the four burners theory which essentially breaks your life into 4 quadrants  1 family 2 friends 3 health  4 work  the principle behind this theory is that in order to be truly successful in any of these areas the intensity of one of these burners needs to be turned down this sounds like a crappy deal but the truth is that life is full of tradeoffs and embracing that is the first step to thriving  there are seasons where some of these burners will thrive more than other and i personally choose to make temporary compromises in order to truly give myself to truly succeed at one thing there are a few ways that ive learnt to make the best of finding harmony between my work and the rest of my life including embracing limitations and incorporating seasonality   this has always been a really interesting concept to me and i dive deep into it here  httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkhawb5xqznmhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkhawb5xqznm  hope this helps give you a better idea of how to approach chasing balance in your life,iw4tmp

381,Tips for someone seemingly unable to work? (long),hello all first its really good to find this subreddit it makes me feel far less alone knowing that we are all going through it as sad as that is  in january found my dream job small local company only a 10 minute walk from my home where i could sit all day and had a boss who genuinely liked and cared for me for a little extra information i am an autistic and narcoleptic 20 year old with only a ged i am transgender english is not my first language and i have very limited mobility due to an inflammatory disease i try very hard to not let my life center around any of these but these things make it hard for me to find work at all  especially work that pays well but regardless of all that once covid hit the usa i was shit out of luck and the company i was working for went out of business  while i was on unemployment for some time i am no longer receiving benefits i cant file for unemployment because due to a lot of abuse growing up i have little to no medical records and i cant afford to get a diagnosis for any of my mental or physical illnesses even if i could i have heard terrible stories from people with my same inflammatory condition it is a semiunknown disease about the hoops they had to jump through amp lawyer fees only to be denied disability anyways and honestly after 6 months of little to no income i am really really terrified for the future i tried crowd funding for help with medical and food bills but seeing as i dont use a lot of social media that didnt help and only caused a lot of people to harass me online why i dont use social apps anyways   does anyone have any advice on how to get an income that i can survive on at least i have applied for maany remotework jobs only for them to say i cant qualify due to poor internet where i live i cant turn to sex work because of the nature of my disease and i cant create art to save my life is necking myself the only option here i really really really dont know what to do and soon it will be winter  if i cannot pay my gas bill i will quite literally freeze to death anyhow,iwxqef

396,This is all so wrong...,its all fucking wrong 8 hours a day locked  inside a cubicle isolated from your family and friends without the right to do anything you enjoy only working to survive and not starve to death plus commuting and then you have a few hours left but its night and youre too tired to do anything other than sit down and watch tv and you also have to eat and do hygiene stuff as well and your friends are too busy working and taking care of their kids to hang out with you so you end up alone in your dark living room watching tv or using social media only a week or two vacation when its summer and if you work in retail  or for some big corporations you get minimum wage   and if youre one of the very unlucky ones congrats you are now working in a sweatshop 10  12 hours a day with bad conditions from age 8 without workers rights personal freedom breaks or even being allowed to go to the bathroom you get paid not even minimum wage at this point you get like what 50 cents a month you waste your life and slave your days away just so that you can keep breathing you spend all these years and years every day doing the same thing locked inside a building away from all those people and things you love not allowed to leave or else you starve to death and you literally have to pay with not only your money but also your time go breath you have to pay to survive and i say survive because surviving and living are two different things  there are fucking 7yearolds working in mines in india 13 hours a day and the best worst case scenario for them is that they will get some terrible chronic condition that will follow them for the rest of their miserable lifeless life and kill them at age 40 or even younger and the worst scenario i can think of is them dying inside the mines of asphyxia or getting lost in them and no one ever finding them they waste their childhoods the most holy thing they will ever have and work away their youthful innocent worryless years only to make a bunch of fucktards richer a bunch of fucktards that pretend to care about the world and do charity but in reality they are the ones who cause so many problems in the first place these children walk around in broken ripped apart slippers that no longer fit them and their feet hurt and then these fucktards live in lavish mansions with pools private yatches 10 bedrooms and a bunch of other things that they dont need  there are 7yearolds being kidnapped and forced to work in chocolate plantations yet those 7yearolds will never taste chocolate themselves these 7yearolds will never have a childhood these 7yearolds will never know what it feels to get dirty in the mud with your friends after a good rain and looking at the rainbow fascinated together and calling all your siblings and your parents to see if as well they know what it feels like to be dirty from the labor dirty from the unbathedness but they dont know what it feels like to play in the sand right next to the beach with your cousins while doing cartwheels and playing tag they will never know what waking up late in a sunny saturday morning and going straight to the streets to meet your friends and ride your bicycles run and play together till the sun goes down feels like they will never know what your parents buying you a new doll for christmas or your birthday feels like their parents can barely afford existing and raising them they probably have barely played barely chased each other barely run barely had fun barely stared at  rainbows fascinated in their small short existences they will never know any of that  they ask me why i am antiwork well this is why i want a world where you dont have to pay to exist neither with your time nor with your money this system is broken broken to the core and cancer like that is normalized and romanticized by westerners who havent even lived a day like that omg11 shoutout to the parents who work like that so that their kids can live11 or uplifting news 80 year old woman finds job at a warehouse   no you middle class ignorant piece of shit this is nothing romantic this is nothing uplifting this is not something to celebrate this is not something to shed tears of joy looking at we should shed tears of terror this shit is terrifying its terrible and if says a lot of things about our world  we have so many things to afford housing electricity water internet technology food taxes i could go on yet the greatest price we will ever pay for any of the above is not money is not cash is not pennies but its time  end of rant,iw7xql

425,Just another rant about sacrificing your employees for your managerial mistakes / greed,quite a long rant tldr at the end  i work an office job for a big company its not atrocious but i clearly see a decline in the quality of the subjects i work on since last year  i got upset today when my supervisor he is not hierarchically above me but he basically controls the subjects i work on told me that i would probably need to go alone on a business trip for 2 or 3 days next week in order to do something thats normally not my job  i already went to this location a few weeks ago because i was one of the most relevant people to handle the work there was to do so even though i dont like business trips because im not more compensated despite having to dedicate my personal time to the company for a few consecutive days i was not fundamentally against it but this time its to do something that im not supposed to do and that i barely know how to do the reason i should go  i was told is because were short on resources people so already knowing the answer i naively asked but why dont we tell the management that we need more people  the answer was we constantly told them for the past 3 years and obviously nothing changed for the past 3 years so during all this time the team had to do and still has with what they had in order to make the project succeed or at least survive i should say  and thats exactly what the problem is people in this team counterbalance the lack of resources by working late doing more work than they should and doing work theyre not supposed  qualified to do not to mention the important amount of stress that they have to endure  so of course the management does nothing to help even though we tell them that there is a lack of resources the work is done and thats all that matters to them i think that the only way we could actually get more resources is by endangering the project itself simply by doing our work as we are supposed to do instead of overworking but thats not the teams mentality apparently my teammates want to do more even though it might burn them out  i always thought that this mentally was fucked up so out of principle i try my best to never work too late or for too long but this time i feel like they might force me to do like them even though i strongly informed my supervisor that i dont want to go and that i dont agree with the management policy he didnt insist too much but since the other people he asked refused to go too im afraid he will come back to me and pressure me   i must confess that i am more and more fed up with this job that makes less sense to me every day and i event recently considered to resign im not quite sure yet if that would be such a good idea but if my supervisor insists too much ill inform him that im considering quitting this job if he forces me ill quit  im not against discovering new things new places or learning things that i dont know yet but i dont want to be forced to do things i never asked and that i am not supposed to do and sacrificing myself and my family for the sole reason that the companys management is utter bullshit  ampx200b  tldr my supervisor wants me to go on a business trip for a few days in order to do something that i am not supposed to do that i dont want to do and that i barely know how to do because our management doesnt want to give us more resources and its a habit of this team to overwork themselves,iu3prq

427,"If society didn't exist, you would still have to work.",if nobody was forcing you to wageslave you would still have to come up with a means to shelter yourself and feed yourself which takes work the only thing forcing you to wageslave at that point is your own survival if you had the same antiwork attitude you would die the reality is that the privilege of complaining about work and wanting to stay home and smokesleepgame all day while at the same time not worrying about  dying is brought to you on the backs of people who do work  if you dont want to work then you cant take advantage of anyone elses work your xbox house food delivery cell phone even this website are all the products of peoples minds motivation and a hell of a lot of work  so take all that and throw it away when you finally decide to stop working because the only reason people wageslave is because their business has customers dont be a customer and force someone else to wageslave if you cant handle it yourself,irxaib

450,COVID outbreak at my former workplace one week after my last day. They weren't allowing WFH.,context i live outside of the us so bear that in mind as youre reading   im an attorney so even before covid working from home would have been something i could do most days unless im going to court or a meeting im mostly sitting at a desk all day so i never saw a need to be in office everyday from the jump then the court started having zoom hearings and meetings so there was even less of a reason to leave home but i worked in a law firm with a bunch of old people who need to physically see you slaving away in order to feel like theyre getting their moneys worth out of you   even when our prime minister put out a law saying that anyone who can carry out their job function from home should work from home they were still trying to force us to come in i got in at 1000 one morning and my supervisor who had been working from home for months at that point and who was hardly ever in office even before covid reprimanded me for being late and then made me do a bunch of things outside of my job function including delivering documents to court and to other attorneys offices even though i asked if the documents could be sent electronically no she specifically wanted me to be going out and about during a pandemic while she was safely in her home she said i hadnt paid enough dues in my career to be able to come in at 1000 during a pandemic when the government says i dont even have to be here period  that was the last straw for me and the next day i sent an email saying that i will be working from home until the government mandates otherwise she was annoyed but there wasnt much she could do i returned to office when the government ended mandatory wfh and then quit my notice period is 3 months so i was there until the end of august cases had been steadily rising and they were still forcing staff to come in   one week after i left im hearing that there are two confirmed cases and possibly more the firm is trying to keep it quiet and theyre still having people come in office lol theyre also being picky about whose covid test theyre willing to pay for i think i should be fine since i had stopped interacting with coworkers due to low morale and just not giving a fuck anymore i kept my office door closed most days and always wore my mask if i was leaving the confines of my office space to interact with a coworker  my new job allows me to wfh pays more and the work is more fulfilling i transitioned from civil litigation to human rights civil litigation literally brought me to the brink of my sanity i refuse to give my time energy and health to an employer who so blatantly doesnt give a fuck about me,it4emg

484,A very simple example of just how fucked up the labor for income paradigm really is.,lets say you worked in a factory you get word going round that the owner of the factory is seriously considering investing in new automation which would replace the need for much of the human labor in the factory including your job so now you think to yourself if he does that if he chooses to automate then i will loose my job and thus i will loose my monthly income of money which grants me access to food and shelter this is terrifying i dont want to starve to death cold on the street i depend on having this job to be able to survive  on the other hand i now recognize that if he does not automate at least for now i will then know with 100 percent certainty that me coming in here to do all this drudgery for 8 hours a day and 5 days a week  is objectively utterly unnecessary and it would be a pointless waste of my finite life on this planet to keep working here  ultimately given that my life depends on getting a monthly paycheck to be able to get access to the necessities of life  i am actually inventivized to want to be exploited 8 hours a day and 5 days a week to do this boring and unpleasant work in exchange for a paycheck even though i now know full well that it is completely unnecessary for me to do any of it  in no uncertain terms because of the society i live in i am being directly incentivized to beg for the opportunity to waste my short life doing bullshit work that a machine can easily do instead of me  all because i depend on a paycheck to be able to live,iui9cg

501,"Anyone identifying with ""Cultural Nihilism?""",i read a bit about nihilism and figured i agree with the cultural aspect of nihilism the others not so much   i believe that there will never be a right form of culture or social construct because my experiences and studies show me once again that humans arent meant to live in large social groups     all the stuff were experiencing in the world is just basic and mostly primitive human behavior and most people dont even notice that what they are doing just leads to even more issues      i feel like every concept we strive for nowadays equality freedom democracy  they are all just human concepts and none of them works in the way we pursue it     we as human beings forced our own perverted way of life and meaning into this world and feel like we have the godgiven right to act like the pinnacle of evolution    we act like we are on our way to perfection what we dont understand is that everything that doesnt fall under that perception of an ultimate goal becomes ugly and unwanted to us     we dont live in times of accepting we live in times of seeking false meaning in mundane and distracting concepts of what we believe should be true and we just believe we dont know     we change things until they fit our own expectations but dont realize that we have so different approaches to things that there will always be someone unhappy      the best we can do in my opinion is to stop organizing and gathering humans in large social constructs that will only lead to jealousy anger and injustice     especially that culture of blind discipline and obedience that tells you if youre not good in a particular area you just have to try harder,ishc0y

515,"Why can’t the government make working optional, pay for the necessities (food + water) and we work for everything else?",sorry if what im about to say is extremely ignorant honestly dont know the economic reasons but surely there is a way they can do this especially considering they fund other stuff unnecessary to basic survival  by necessities i mean at least food and water maybe also very basic shelter and basic health care   they could regulate the food and water intakes so that each individualfamily is given a certain amount of money that only covers basic food each person is able to get all nutrients required needed for each person so like a family of 2 adults and 2 kids would get a slightly different amount than 2 adults 1 kid and 1 baby    i think the only reason we have to pay for things in the first place except for people just wanting to get rich and have more than others and have powercontrol which isnt a valid reason anyway is so that there isnt a shortage of materials well plus the fact that people believe that if you do more work you deserve to get more in return which i will talk on that later but basic food and water should be for everyone regardless of anything   but back to the first point there shouldnt be a shortage of materials because many people are eating way too much than they need so that should even it out a little of the overeaters get less and the undereaters get more and if there did happen to be a shortage of food on the horizon they would be stupid not to stop it before it happened because they would be able to tell how much they are capable of producing vs demand they can instead regulate the amount of children we are allowed to have  which i know doesnt sound nice but it is important to take care of the people already on the earth first if we cant take care of everyone here in the sense that there isnt enough resources then producing more people is only going to worsen that plus we all know that overpopulation is a big issue for many reasons any for those that do really want children and this were to happen there are lots of kids that need to be adopted   i know it might not be that simple but neither is what is happening now its anything but but surely this is a better way   so why cant the government pay for our food and we pay for everything else and make working optional    for those of us who want to live extremely simple work free lives well away from capitalism then we would be free and happy to do so    for those of us who want to work and buy tons of materialistic things then we would be free and happy to do so    for those of us who want something in between or only part time work then we would be free and happy to do so    so why cant they make it happen    or rather is it that they can but they just wont because it benefits them personally as the money is in their pockets but surely if we all stood for this idea then the power of the people would overturn the power of those few,iukrwz

545,Please take care of yourself! You deserve to be happy!,to put things into perspective i work as a lead software developer at a very small early startup and ive been working like a dog these past few months while the world was burning down due to covid19 ive put in more than the required 8hrs every day never skipped a day of work or called in sick  a few days earlier i wasnt feeling well i was kind of depressed and tired of coding tbh i called my employer to let him know that i will be off for a few days since i wasnt able to focus on my work and was in need of a breather i was expecting to get a few days off without any hassle but guess what was his response he said i would love to give you a few days off buddy but i just set up an appointment with a potential client and we need to finish the following features as soon as possible     i was like why did you set up an appointment with a potential customer without even letting me know and he then proceeds to tell me that he mentioned it the day before which im pretty sure he didnt and that we need to start making money as soon as possible  making money is that all he cares about what about all that work that ive just put in cant the client wait a few more days   those are all the questions ive asked myself after my call with him and i came to the conclusion that no employer cares  ive been working all these kinds of odd jobs cashier barista cook and every single one of my employers had an excuse as to why i cant take the day off to myself   i became aware that i am just a resource a resource to be used to generate cashflow a resource to be squeezed until the last drop a resource to be thrown away when its no longer productive i am not a human but just a resource  as a young child i was always scared to voice my opinions i grew up like most other kids and have been told to go to college get good grades so you can find a good job  so i followed that path went to college worked all sort of jobs to pay my bills i worked during the day and improved my coding skills during the night i was always exhausted and thought to myself that once i get into software development everything will be better i just followed my parents advice  now i find myself spending my monday to friday in front of a computer close to 12hrs a day i am gaining weight and becoming unhealthy amp depressed is this what i was meant to do with my life am i gonna spend 50 years in this stupid job writing and debugging code all day is this what adult life feels like  this is what ive found myself listening to while working httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqi68giytnxshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqi68giytnxs  pretty sad isnt it i broke down and went for a walk outside while holding my tears i was bent amp broken ive decided that even though my boss didnt want to give me a couple of days off i was gonna take them anyways he can go to hell for all i care i turned my phone to airplane mode turned off slack logged out of my work email and most importantly i allowed myself to breathe  ive never felt better in my life that breathing room allowed me to start exercising amp eat healthier ive started smiling more and i became more enjoyable to be around  i think that as humans we are not meant for this kind of life we are meant to help each other in times of need and we feel fulfilled when we make each other happy i just helped my neighbor haul some stuff home and it gave me more fulfillment than my bullshit job ever did  i think we need to value happiness more that we value money we need to stop pushing people into jobs that kill their souls for the sake of money  remember that it doesnt matter if you are a bluecollar worker or a whitecollar worker you are still on leash  to sum this up i just want to remind you to please take care of yourself amp always put yourself first no matter the situation you are a valuable member of our society and deserve all the best   i would love to hear from you let me know your story by commenting below,isy9au

590,Is there an escape? (venting/seeking advice),this post might end up incoherent but this is something that ive been thinking about a lot lately i apologize in advance that i dont really know how to articulate this i dont even know if this is the right subreddit for this i just need a place to vent and maybe feel like im not insane  ampx200b  i 24f currently work in a very emotionally and mentally demanding livein direct care job in the social services field in the united states ive worked there for nearly two years now what i am is essentially a single houseparent in a group home for teenagers that have been removed from the home   ampx200b  nearly every day recently i find myself mentally distraught thinking about my job and about work in general i think about how im severely underpaid and underappreciated for the amount of time effort and energy i pour into my job i love the kids that i work with and some of my coworkers but the long hours are very rough the work itself can really take a toll on me emotionally and i am rarely recognized for doing well i actually often feel like im not doing well at all especially in the more recent weeks ive felt guilty for being so pushy about getting my breaks because were so shortstaffed but other than the weekends my breaks are the only time that i feel like i can truly be myself i find myself comparing myself to friends and family members that make significantly more money than i do for jobs that dont demand nearly as much of them i think about how simply by existing im being forced to participate in this society that is completely ruled by money and that ill never escape the need to make money to survive and pay my bills and loans the only careers im qualified for are in a field that demands so much of me drains me and has led me to experiencing what i assume is burnout i find myself feeling trapped and like im being erased by my job like im not a person outside of my job title until saturday and sunday ive been wondering if maybe social services isnt for me but whenever i explore and research different fields i come up against questions like would this be fulfilling for me and would doing this compromise my beliefs and how can i afford to go back to school when im already so deeply in student loan debt and i wish that i didnt care so much about how much money im making one of my main goals in life though is to live somewhere rural in a cottagecabin and i know that i need money to get to that point literally everything is behind a paywall and even when i get there ill need to keep working regardless to pay the aforementioned bills and loans and keep myself alive so i just feel stuck knowing that while id really prefer not to work at all or only do work that i enjoy when i choose to i still have to keep working no matter what i dont know maybe im just extremely burnt out from my current job and thats whats going on with me any time i think too hard about it i just start crying and i can never really explain what im feeling and what im going through i feel like there really is no escape from work from my life being ruled by work and by money for the rest of my life other than inevitable death to me the requirement to work is pretty much the worst part about being alive   ampx200b  also being this upset so often makes me feel ungrateful because these distressed thoughts are always drowning out everything else what i should be thinking about more often is what i am grateful for a place to live a happy and healthy relationship with a loving partner my family being alive and healthy financial semistability at the moment etc etc there is so much more to life than a job and work and earning money and owning things and i recognize that and believe that but i still just i feel like i cant break free from my mind sometimes  ampx200b  all of that being said does anyone else understand this feeling how do you cope with this how do you alleviate this kind of pain  ampx200b  is there a way to ever truly escape the hellscape workdriven society that we live in especially with bills and loans hanging over your head   ampx200b  i apologize for such a long post but i just needed to get this off of my chest and i need to feel like im not going crazy feeling this way,iqaw7f

618,Singing job application on LinkedIn,just saw a post on linkedin in my native language where someone does a singing job application to the tune of bohemian rhapsody  naturally its very cringy and awkward  however all the comments were extremely positive and stating ridiculous things such as all job applicants should apply like this  wow insert name here you will surely find a job soon now  the young woman making this video was also featured on the local news she said how difficult it was to find a job and that there were 120 applicants to the last job she applied to ultimately the segment came of more depressing than uplifting to me  nobody literally nobody mentioned either in the comments or in the news segment how fucking degrading it is to have to send in a fucking singing job application just to beg for a fucking job   jesus christ kill me already,irjtmz

626,I hate being part of a machine that makes other people miserable,hey guys i work as a debt collector in a call centre that services a major european bank that operates in my developing country and i really hate having to work for a bank i know first hand they do a lot of things wrong to keep its costumers in debt and even during this whole pandemic all they do is push for more and more profit while their costumers struggle financially   i want to tell you guys the financial sector is probably one of the worst features of capitalism and having even just minimum knowledge of what happens from the inside can destroy your self esteem and since a lot of the working class seems to support this system and shit over their fellow people if ww3 happens someday during my lifetime ill drink and celebrate as banks get purified with fire thats my dream,iqj2qj

631,One of the easiest ways to break free of the 9-5 hellhole,how do you make a centuriesold system like capitalism work for you  you find the skills it cant function without so you can grab it by the balls  i work as a freelance sales copywriter i find myself recommending this route to so many people sick of the corporate world i figured i might as well put it into a post maybe itll help someone here   this is for anyone who doesnt mind escaping the 95 lifestyle by taking advantage of and profiting off the system and even if youre not  being aware of this kind of fuckery will dramatically enhance your quality of life trust me  at the moment i make 3500 a month as a retainer writing sales copy and emails for a single company most days i only have 12 short emails to write which is usually no more than 2 hours of work  if i need to take a few days off  which i do frequently since im dealing with some severe health issues  my employer is more than happy to let me do it because of how much money my writing is making him  plus even if theres a recession going on like right now i never have to worry about finding work even if my employer goes out of business in fact what i do is so integral to the sales process that whatever businesses are surviving in a bad economy will need someone like me more than ever  the reason for all this is because the kind of sales copywriting i do is based on a very specific scientificallyproven form of marketing that targets specific psychological and emotional triggers in people to drive them to take immediate action   and its not just nonprofits and companies using this the basic psychological principles this style of marketing is based on have been widely used by people in positions of power all over the world for as long as humans have been able to communicate  only in the last 100 years have companies started using it for monetary gain  its called direct response marketing and without this crucial step to the sales process all business have a nearzero chance of making money due to the very nature of consumerism  politics  is pretty much nothing but direct response marketing appeal to your  voter bases pain points blame it on someone else explain how theyre  holding you back from your dreams amp ask for money to fix it ive  used the same sequence to write emails and sales letters for health  supplements and hitech garden hoses more times than i can count  this is why companies like amazon and apple and google are bending over backwards to steal everyones private data through their products and  services the secret most private thoughts of your target customers is  the kind of information that can easily be spun into billions and billions of dollars even with a barebones advertising campaign  because of that fact companies will pay you substantially more for your time so much so that youll eventually learn to stop charging based on time and start charging based on how much money your client estimates to make from your work  that makes it insanely easy to hit a 6 figure income once you know how to market yourself even if youre just a soso copywriter your skill is in so much demand it simply doesnt matter  so if youre looking for a way out of the 95 hellhole or just need a way to make more money this is probably one of the most efficient ways  by learning the skill that functions as the lynchpin to the capitalistconsumerist sales cycle  best thing is anyone can do this and no one cares about your resume only your ability to bring them results i had only 5 months of parttime experience working for clients all remote before i was fired from my last actual job i decided to try freelancing as a sales copywriter full time it was a little bumpy at first but im now stable enough that i dont have to look for work unless i want to make extra money im even learning how to charge companies highticket prices for my services like 5000 for a sales letter  and even if youre not on board with taking advantage of this terrible system hopefully this serves as an example of how much money your opinions and interests are worth to people in positions of power politicians and corporations use this in their every breath   we as humans are incredibly susceptible to it and they dont want you to know it,ipvibs

663,What is work? — A few thoughts on what it means to be anti-work, im not completely antiwork  even the more radical people on here keep making exceptions to their opposition to work and so im here to suggest we stop doing that the reasoning behind im not completely antiwork goes something like this   were opposed to capitalist exploitation of labor opposed to bosses and 40hour weeks opposed to how work is done in this system but were not against work when its voluntary meaningful or necessary  im afraid this doesnt clear things up it usually leads to comments about how the term antiwork is misleading and how the subreddit should be called antiexploitativelabor antiemployment antijobs or whatever else it leads to folks claiming theyre antiwork while busy making excuses for work that they deem necessary or worth keeping  when you describe your antiwork position as a stance against work that is exploitative unnecessary meaningless alienated or as a stance against the 40 hour workweek then you leave the door open to all kinds of reformist nonsense to the average liberal pretty much all work is at least in some way necessary and a good source for meaning and so they will happily agree with your opposition lets get rid of unnecessary jobs but keep the rest lets get rid of asshole bosses and find better bosses lets make work more fulfilling lets work towards a 30hour work week  these dreams of a slightly less shitty world are often highfived and upvoted because at least they push in the right direction good intentions leaving us with a vague incoherent watereddown version of antiwork an invitation to demand small changes to work rather than rejecting and abolishing it altogether     lets define our terms  wikipedia defines work as such  gtwork or labor is intentional activity people perform to support themselves others or the needs and wants of a wider community alternatively work can be viewed as the human activity that contributes along with other factors of production towards the goods and services within an economy  using this definition its not entirely clear what exactly separates working from other activities for example me writing a post for this subreddit can be considered work why not who are you to say its not done to support myself others or the needs and wants of a wider community what does it even mean to support myself where do you draw the line   arguably even my post here contributes towards the goods and services within the economy reddit wouldnt make much money without people posting and commenting creating a social platform and lots and lots of data  another example highlighting the vagueness of the wiki definition cooking when i prepare a meal for myself and others am i working is it work if a friend pays me to do it is it work if i do it 9to5 as part of my job in a restaurant  in the context of antiwork and radical politics or antipolitical traditions its generally a good idea to avoid such broad definitions if we want to take a stance against work we better use one that cant be applied to pretty much any activity under any circumstances   luckily plenty of antiwork authors and radicals have already given us definitions that are far more coherent and useable for our purposes  gtanother form of incomprehension involves confusion over what work is  this stems in part from the fact that the word can be used in ambiguous  ways i may indeed say that i am working on an article for wd or on a translation but when i am doing these things it is in fact not work because there is nothing compelling me to do them i have no obligation to do them i do them solely for my own pleasure and here is where the basic meaning of work and its destruction becomes clear     gt   gtwork is an economic social relationship based upon compulsion the institutions of property and commodity exchange place a price tag upon survival this forces each of us to find ways to buy our survival or to accept the utter precariousness of a life of constant theft in the former case we can only buy our survival precisely by selling large portions of our lives awaythis is why we refer to work as wage slavery a slave is one whose life is owned by another and when we work capital owns our lives wolfi landstreicher  willful disobediencehttpstheanarchistlibraryorglibrarywillfuldisobediencewolfilandstreichertoc64  and  gtmy minimum definition of work is forced labor that is compulsory production both elements are essential work is production enforced by economic or political means by the carrot or the stick the carrot is just the stick by other means but not all creation is work work is never done for its own sake its done on account of some product or output that the worker or more often somebody else gets out of it this is what work necessarily is to define it is to despise it    gt   gt modern work has worse implications people dont just work they have jobs one person does one productive task all the time on an orelse basis even if the task has a quantum of intrinsic interest as increasingly many jobs dont the monotony of its obligatory exclusivity drains its ludic potential a job that might engage the energies of some people for a reasonably limited time for the fun of it is just a burden on those who have to do it for forty hours a week with no say in how it should be done for the profit of owners who contribute nothing to the project and with no opportunity for sharing tasks or spreading the work among those who actually have to do it bob black  the abolition of workhttpstheanarchistlibraryorglibrarybobblacktheabolitionofwork   work as an institution  both definitions offered by black and landstreicher paint a picture of work that were all familiar with and its a lot more specific than the allencompassing wiki definition  work can be understood as a highly authoritarian institution  gtinstitutionshttpsenwikipediaorgwikiinstitution according to samuel p huntington are stable valued recurring patterns of behavior further institutions can refer to mechanisms which govern the behavior of a set of individuals within a given community moreover institutions are identified with a social purpose transcending individuals and intentions by mediating the rules that govern living behavior  similar to how the state forces us to be citizens pay taxes accept its rule and its monopoly on legitimate violence work forces us to be workers  sure you can make all kinds of excuses for the state it protects us its necessary it creates order how else would we deal with murderers and so can you make excuses for work nothing would get done without it its necessary people need order in their life how else would we deal with the lazy but dont cling to these ideas and call yourself antiwork  as long as you value the economic social relationship based upon compulsion and as long as you cant even imagine any alternative to work as an institution youre not antiwork you just want work to be a little nicer   lets be pragmatic keep it radical  now some of you probably want to point out how we cant just switch from having a workriddled society to a completely workfree society overnight and so the reasoning often goes its silly to be completely antiwork  ima be honest i dont know what a future without work might look like i dont need to know nobody really does anyway i also dont know how a future free of war and slavery might look like but i sure as hell oppose these things as well you can be pragmatic without making excuses for work we dont need to water down our opposition to work just because work is considered normal and necessary in this society  if we want to end work then keeping our perspective radical as in going to the root or origin fundamental is about as pragmatic as it gets liberals have sometimes advocated for nicer working conditions leftists have occasionally even fought for it but that only got us where we are today a world full of work more useless destructive and alienating than ever before  so heres my suggestion lets not reinvent work lets get rid of it,ipmwwb

676,"All my life, I was told not to turn my hobbies into a career because I’d end up hating it.",so i listened i grew up and went to college to get a boring degree that would help me get a nice cushy office job earn more money to find my hobbies on the weekends right  nope now i hate my job not making enough money and i also have no hobbies or interests anymore because i dont have the time money or energy to pursue them ive given up on the things i used to believe were part of my core identity and its turned me into a miserable piece of shit i have very few friends left because i cant connect with people on anything anymore  then theres my younger sister who actually did end up turning her childhood passions into quite the successful career she graduated from a very prestigious art school and does freelance illustration for lots of notable publications shes also a fantastic musician and has been on tour all over the country playing with various ensembles over the last couple years obviously not much performing right now with this lockdown stuff but shes living with her boyfriend and they are very happy together  but i have no future and no more interests or hobbies outside of work honestly im not even very good at my job and no marketable skills really i slugged my way through college without really learning anything new im just average at getting by i am fairly dece t at interviewing though good at pretending to have skills so might be able to eventually find a job thats less miserable but really the thought of trying to claw my way up the ladder in this corporate race for the next 40 years makes me wish i were dead instead,iqh94q

684,Sleeping on the job (and other instances of “time theft”),i would like to hear from other people who have found  successful to commit time theft at their current or past places of employment sleeping physically leaving the workplace while still on the clock and then punching out at the end of your shift spending 15 mins in the bathroom every hour of your shift i want to hear it all and how you got away with it maybe even if you got caught as long as you have a funny story about it  i work overnights and without getting into too much detail i am only really required to be conscious walk around the building and answer a mobile phone for the past month or so i have been sleeping at least 2 hrs each shift sometimes up to 4 hrs i create a makeshift bed on the floor of a room that doesnt see much use and keep the phone right next to my ear so i will wake up in case i receive a phone call   all in all this past month i estimate i have made about 629 sleeping i know this is not much in the grand scheme of things but it makes me happy to take advantage of an employer who takes advantage of me   i would encourage anybody and everybody to slack off sleep be on your phone as much as you can get away with at your job i know this is not possible at some jobs and i recognize the fact that im extremely lucky to be able to get away with this i would still encourage you to waste as much of your time on the clock as humanly possible  if employers dont want to pay a living wage give benefits or even full time hours and nothing seems to be changing we should waste their money the same way they waste our time our happiness our freedom etc,iqoxry
685,It's all pointless,longtime lurker first time poster i work for a membershipbased nonprofit there is one person in particular who gets away with not answering emails for weeks because she is married to a member but god forbid i make a mistake  today i uploaded a contact list to our email management system inserted our standard firstname greeting added the body of the email and hit send the email included both first and last names because apparently the list hadnt been separated out beforehand this isnt usually the case in the lists i download okay no big deal this was just a confirmation message letting a small number of people who applied for a volunteer position know we received their application   here i am working on 8000 other things when the person who had me send out the email freaks out saying hes very unhappy that we should send another email to everyone letting them know theres a problem with our system that no one will want to work with us anymore i let him know that this is just a small issue   this person is routinely nasty but again since he is a member he gets to say and do anything to staff my boss completely threw me under the bus in an email chain to him and after that i was asked to work late on a survey sent minutes before close of business   i am so angry im looking at this country us and part of its literally on fire and im the one one in my household working fulltime and most of my friends dont have jobs due to the pandemic and neither does my girlfriend there is a major election in under two months and people are dead or hurting   through it all ive worked and worked but this one relatively tiny error was such a big deal today   and i just cant i cant this is pointless   its taking everything in me not to be like hey dude get a hobby this email issue is not the end of the world,iqefaz

697,"If you let your kid train for their future job for 8 hours a day, you're mentally unstable",i have a friend who is like 15 and she is planning to join the circus when she grows up which is awesome at least she will do a job she will enjoy unlike us wage slaves or artists who never want to go profull time who are stuck in a system rigged against them   what disturbs me though is that her parents actually let her practice 8 hours a day every single day it might even also be on weekends she does online school early in the morning and then for 8 hours straight just practices in the same way a cubicle worker just works for 8 hours straight and she also has homework so that leaves her with little to no time for herself or social activities  it distrubs me that this is considered fucking normal i am very concerned for her i do not think it is mentally healthy for a kid to spend so much time away from normal kid stuff like being with friends silly high school stuff watching movies being in fandoms etc i am really sad that such work life imbalance is normalized for some people from literal childhood why do we think it is okay to do something from the moment you wake up to the moment you go to eat dinner how is this ever okay how is your whole damn life revolving around one single thing whether it is your job or your passion normalized we are more than just our jobs sure lets say that a man named joe is a worker but he is not just a worker he has other roles to fulfill in his life he is not just joe the worker he is joe the worker the father the husband the friend and perhaps even joe the painter or joe the celloist and my friends usernames in all the social media accounts she has are something along the lines of circusgirl15 which disturbs me even more i know i am not the right person to discuss this cause i am practically an internet addict and have suicidal thoughts every single day but what i hate more than people who work sitty soul draining office jobs that they are aware are not mentally healthy nor good for their work life balance and suffer in them is people who think being forced to do one single ting they  love by their employer for 8 hours straight every day or starving to death is an okay normal thing and are completely fine with it   i see this as a defilation of art art is supposed to be beautiful charming dreamy exciting fulfilling not an addiction not a thing that you are forced to have your whole life revolved around or you starve to death it is fucked up she is a kid she is supposed to be doing normal kid stuff while simutaneously enjoying her art and cultivating her talents not just having her whole life revolve around her future job even if it is a job she enjoys this is not okay she is more than just an acrobat she is a person with a personality probably has friends has family and will possibly find a spouse and may have children in the future se has many roles to fulfill in life not just her future job what on earth are her parents thinking are they stage parents or something   which brings me to the next topic i want to discuss which is people who have no identity outside their jobs people who are just joe the warehouse worker or just joe the builder or that is what they think they are not what they really  are people who only discuss their jobs their projects related to their jobs people who can only talk about jobs   personally i think if you spend more time working at mcdonalds working in a cubicle working at an office or even at a fucking circus than you spend with your friends and family then there is somethin seriously wrong with your life and you need to fix it and anyone who normalized tha during your childhood was clearly mentally unstable and an irresponnsible parent we are more than just our jobs even the jobs we love there is more to life than just work or just art there are relationships experiences trials challenges dreams goals travelling learning loving celebrating so many other things other than just working your days whether your job is an amazon employee or a fire eater for cirque du soleil life is complex full of different activities people relationships and experiences especially childhood and it should not worked away   as niechze said any man that does not have 23 of his day to himself is a slave whether he is a worker a statesman or a buisnessman  if your whole life and identity revolves around your job or even your future job as a chil worst case scenario then something is wrong with it doesnt matter if its a mind sucking shit office job or an exciting form of art life is more than just that and it is to be lived you have only one life no one on their deat bed wishes they spennd less time with friends and family to train for their future job   my two cents no i have to go to sleep this makes me even more suicidal than i already was and it also makes me feel guilty for some reason for not wanting to make my passions the loves of my life about money no i dont want to type my daydreams for 8 hours a day i am not a fucking robot i am a human i am more than just ayano the writer alright i am ayano the writer ayano the friend ayano the sister ayano the granddaughter ayano the believer ayano the thnker ayano the traveler ayano the activist ayano the lover of movement ayano the poet ayano the simple girl that

699,My old teachers view on work,  b oe d  when  had a proper job  used to take about 68 weeks  off sick every year in every company  worked for my  sickness rate was the highest of all pretty much most of  that time was taken off during the winter  it turns out that  had been suffering from depression for 20 years but nobody knew most of my illness was made up  just couldnt bear to go in to work  since  left full time employment in 2011 life has been so much better im happier really yes finances have actually improved a little even though  earn much less money and in these last 9 years ive probably only had about a week or two off actually sick  there are still days when  dont want to do anything but nowhere near as often as  used to and now  can usually push through them and fulfil my commitment  im pretty sure that there are millions of people who feel like me about work  bet there are millions out there who have loved working from home and dread it coming to an end but there are also loads of companies who it seems have noticed increased productivity and lower costs during this enforced change in working practices  really hope this serves as a analyst to shake up our economy and working culture for the benefit of everyone which of course is something the tories are terrified of ,inpsgp

727,"So burnt out from years of non-stop work, idk what to do.",long rant   so im fairly young at 25 i know i havent put in years of hard labor and feel guilty for complainingbut im still exhausted   my mother was the type to constantly demand more of me better grades more chores more after school activities always thinking about the next thing to achieve i started working as soon as i turned 16 i would work doubles every weekend and after school when i didnt have practice for the 4 different sports i played throughout the year to look good on my college applications   then i went to college i immediately fell extremely ill and was sick for literally a year straight did i have a break no i still continued school online with a full course load while working 40 hours at one job and part time at another once better i continued with full time school for 4 more years while i worked during every waking moment of free time   i swear i even remember the day i just cracked i was in my second year of an incredibly degrading service job and i feel like my mind just completely numbed out by the stress and pressure   after graduating i worked part time at an office job that i fucking hated they were so fucking stupidoutdated and ended up firing me bc i suggested using emojis in a marketing email subject line to get peoples attention they said it was unprofessional ok then at the same time i worked at ulta which was also a hell hole i was forced to con people into signing up for a credit card to not get my hours cut and in return id get these shitty free samples of like a pea size amount of products nobody wanted   then in may of 2019 i finally got what i felt like was the closest i could reasonably get to a dream job i worked with a bunch of other young people in a gorgeous office with lots of amenities dogs and unlimited time off then everything changed when we were bought by a huge corporation back in jan i could tell things were changing and at this point its hell i still feel incredibly bad for complaining bc at the end of the day its still cushy and i make decent money however my boss is now cracking down on our time off i got in trouble for taking time off when my dad had cancer and had to beg for 2 mental health days off this month despite not taking any time off since may   plus were doing insane revenue pushes and are being told that its going to get even worse for the last few months of the year and to not expect time off for holidays i have worked on accounts that have made a whopping 40 million total in the last 3 months alone along with another account that just got like 3 mil out of nowhere but my team is the only one who hasnt gotten any raises were told we cant get bonuses or anything either   the light at the end of the tunnel is that im being considered for a promotion next year which at first sounded awesome but the more i think about it i cant breathe i dont want a fuck ton more responsibilities for a measly pay increase when i work on stuff that earns god knows who literally millions of dollars   im just at a loss i live for friday nights and saturday mornings bc sat night and all day sunday im just dreading the week i try so hard to recharge but nothing works games tv cooking nothing i love brings me pleasure anymore i just refuse to live like this if this is going to be my life id rather kill myself   i have devised a plan to escape in 8 months and work for myself but i feel discouraged about whether or not itll work if anyone is interested im happy to go into it but yeah idk i just feel dead inside and it seems pathetic bc i know theres people working in sweatshops but even that doesnt make me feel like more grateful for helping rich people get richer you know,intm4i

759,Not clocking in early enough (again),i managed to piss my supervisor off again this morning by arriving on the factory floor for our morning meeting at 603am instead of 600am or earlier now i get that i start getting paid at 600am but it takes me time to switch into my uniform in the morning and get all of my required ppe on i walk into the building at around 553am get temperature checked at door asked questions to determine i dont have covid and put my lunch in the fridge   my coworkers have adapted to these changes by coming in like 1520 mins before their shifts which i consider ridiculous we used to be able to take our uniforms home but now we are no longer allowed   overall i know i sound a bit entitled but i dont see how they have grounds to threaten to deduct these few minutes from my pay for every time im late getting out on the floor but hey right to work means they can do whatever they want i guess,iosu4d

772,So tired of school,this might not be absolutely appropriate for this sub as its about school and not work but i thought school is pretty much the first and most important part in a life of work and where they condition you to be a good worker  i am very tired of school  i think a lot of people already agree on this but its not an effective supportive and longterm genuinely educating system your time and individuality is not respected   you are thrown into a class of 20 people with a single teacher you have to work at the speed of the teacher and majority of the class  no matter whether you need more or less time you have only a few ways of gaining information  the teacher and whatever they dictate you to write down and your textbooks which are barely used anymore because how goddamn outdated they are  you have just no control if your school says you will now have a lesson of chemistry you will have a lesson of chemistry class is too slow and your time is being wasted get used to it class is too fast and youd like to go back and understand from there on do it at home and not in class because you need to follow our rhythm  they dont want your genuine independence creativity or other methods of learning its a goddamn pain  they even have the audacity to automatically associate great grades with talent at least my teacher did i mean seriously you are just going to shove this black and white world view onto students you really believe good grades are a product of mere intelligence and talent  some of the people with the best grades were incredibly shallow they had no important hobbies or talents were not particularly good at anything and were some of the most boring and average folk and they are willing to sacrifice you alive for some cookie points and better grades  school injects a mad amount of competition and rivalry into childrenyoung teens competition alone is not bad but making it all about perfect grades and disregarding skills outside of that making many students feel hopeless for their future if they are not an absolute certain way   i still have a future ahead of me but just the experience of school and seeing so many miserable adults with jobs they hate makes me incredibly pessimistic i feel like youd be most successful by going against the grain and doing something yourself and basically employing yourself which is a failed dream of many and is a complete hit or miss or hitting the super rare chance of working a good job with good conditions and a feeling of satisfaction if these exist at all,ipdyec
773,American work culture is fucking disgusting,only in the good ole usa do people actually take pride in working abnormally long hours 405060 a week for straight up starvation wages with if lucky a small handful of days off per year oh but some even go as far as to take their pride further by not taking those days people are getting fucking exploited and theyll say welcome to the world  in that stupid fucking condescending tone like no jenny you fucking absolute idiot this is not normal you have a severe mental defect for believing it is youre just as fucking miserable as everybody else so quit lying to yourself not only all of that but the fact that people identify with their careers makes me sick why is the first question people ask you what do you do or how is work like for fuck sake is that all you serfs know how to talk about my answer to that is its fucking terrible thats what i would rather be doing anything else as would most of you if you werent so programmed by the hustle hard mentality america is literally mindless drones who love to be miserable and if you go any other direction than the mold they will feel nothing but the upmost content for you  fuck this fucking country and its stupid fuckin culture free healthcare but i worked for mine free education but i had to suffer and payback student loans like honestly nobody gives a fuck they can do it in europe they work far less hours enjoy far more leisure time can actually afford to travel and are encouraged to take the time to do so i dont think working would be nearly as bad if we followed suit to most of the first world european countries but as we have already covered the american rugged individualistic work hard mentality prevails and as such we wont enjoy the higher qol citizens of these other countries can enjoy tldr i hate it here and fuck you for bragging ans pretending you enjoy it or that you are somehow honorable for working like a dog,incpw4

776,I’m as close as I’ll ever get to not working.

795,How do I confront my boss about micromanaging?,hi there new to reddit this is my first post actually since i 23f graduated college last summer ive been working as a videographereditor at a relatively small tech company for over a year now but my position title has never changed from intern even though i have never received proper training and was not brought on via the internship program  the funny thing about all of this is that im the only video person the company has ever had despite having been around for decades and having locations all over the world so ive had to teach myself numerous programs skills etc to make up for all their video needs for the past year ive been told that they were in talks of hiring me as a fulltime or permanent employee but every time they said theyd give me an answer they kept pushing it out and telling me things are really busy so it has to wait my internship was supposed to only be 6 months long but here we are  im grateful to have a remote job right now and for a long time i had a really supportive supervisor who advocated for me often however his position was cut at the beginning of the pandemic to save costs my new supervisor cut my hours i signed something that said i could work 2040hrs a week and spent most of my first year working fulltime of course the document i signed regarding these specific hours or the email it was discussed in are nowhere to be found and told me im actually a part time temporary employee when she had hr check the system i had to rope hr in myself because she initially claimed i do not get benefits at all even though i have been receiving partial benefits as a part of my contract this whole time she also told me that there will never be a fulltime or permanent video position at the company despite what my past supervisor and one of the executives i work closely with led me to believe  my new supervisor underestimates the amount of time projects will take and questions whether there is actually 2025hrs of work for me almost every single week she knows all the projects im working on as they are listed on a sheet we both frequently update i feel like she is suspicious of how i spend my time at work which is especially frustrating because ive been busier than ever since my previous supervisor was laid off every day i feel like i have to prove that im doing the most which is negatively affecting my mental i have anxiety and depression dont we all and physical health i dont even take proper breaks for fear that my boss will think im slacking off thankfully my partner is able to bring me water and meals   ive developed a trustworthy reputation for my work at the company so im just confused by all this on top of that my supervisor knows that i can barely support myself currently as it is not that that changes anything how should i word my concerns and frustrations to her if at all im not sure of any way to do this without sounding rude or like an ungrateful disgruntled employee thank you for reading all of this sorry if i sound naive,ip2tti
796,"""Employee safety is our number one priority during this pandemic!.....Oh wait, our numbers are higher than we projected!? Fuck the employees!""",this is my company     when my state allowed nonessential manufacturing to start back up my company was all about safety they still pretend they are but its bs    they projected sales to be way down  so in our manufacturing department they said we only had to work four days a week  volunteer only  nobody had to come back mandatory until the late fall     but they didnt project that people were idiots in this country and would be ignoring the pandemic on a massive level and still buying and using our purely recreational item    all of a sudden everyone got called back mandatory  all of a sudden four day a week was out the window  six days  mandatory  every week  sometimes seven day mandatory    no more lunch break  only a 15 minute in the first and last halfpurely for safety reasons  gotta limit people in the cafeteria even though its empty and everyone sits in their car  nothing to do with production and screwing us  just safety   entire factory is filled with posters saying if you feel ill you are not allowed to enter the building  contact your supervisor and stay home    there must be one of those posters every 20 feet    guess what happens to people who are out of sick days and call out    written up  no actual change in the attendance policy    last thursday and friday i was vomiting and had diarrhea  thats obviously feeling ill  both are also covid symptoms    written up for it  this has happened to many other employees since weve come back    we only get five sick days  i had influenza in january all five of my sick days went out the window    the state guidelines tell employers to encourage their employees to stay home when sick  our company guidelines do the same according to these posters    but how the fuck do you write employees up when they actually stay home     this fucking system is a joke     im working 6 days one week 7 days the next  alternates back and forth weekly  been doing that since i came back to work in june    but two days out for actually being sick doing what the company told me to do and im written up   dont get me wrong the money is good  so i cant leave  average income in my city is like 24k  i make 60k     but this corporate bullshit is insane     the thing that really gets me is 90 of the employees are pissed off  moral is in the toilet but you bring up a union and most of them just freak out and spew antiunion propaganda theyve heard somewhere,iovbhe

801,My boomer coworkers are more fake than people I went to high school with.,im a white collar worker in my late 20s to be honest i have learned to not let work things affect me i dont stress i dont put in a ton of energy i just kind of do what im told and never strive to improve anything as i see that as useless energy  i have been told that i need to be more assertive about my work but i honestly feel like fuck that its not like im underperforming so they can suck it   i do get really frustrated about my coworkers though a few of my coworkers are annoying peacocks and i think they have an actual need to tell everyone about how busy they are daily its so cringy to listen to anytime our boss is around they start to talk in buzzwords all the time its legitametly patgetic to hear someone in their 50s or 60s lose all self respect and dignity trying so hard to impress a worthless manager half their age like that  today was annoying in particular because i was trying to work and three people in the cubical next to me were talking about how we need to continue driving in the left hand lane meaning increase the amount of work we all do so they are all jerking each other off with words talking about how much work they all do then they start to talk about their actual commutes to work then about how the roads need to be changed looking up the roads on google maps  then talking about the cars they drive then about podcasts then about their kids schools and on and on and on for almost an hour   like wtf i honestly do the bare minimum and i do not care one bit if they or anyone does the minimum as well but to make an outrageous try hard show about how much work they all do all agree that we as a company need to do more so they can act like they care then waste an hour doing nothing at all loudly is the most childish pathetic boomer behavior i hate that i have to spend my life around people like this and i want them all to retire asap so i dont have to deal with their bs but dont even get me started about how long their daily boring repetitive conversations about their 401k and retirement is,ip3dbg

806,I’m tired of working as a NURSE rant,i had been working as an rn since i was 21 i graduated nursing school at around 20 to be completely honest i had no choice of whatever profession i can take since its either be medical or go to law or accountancy and my asian parents were just pushing me to earn money fast even when i was barely an adult honestly having asian parents suck i wouldnt recommend it such a toxic you have to be better than mr bs daughters and pride over stupid material things and status culture probably one of the main reasons why i hated working in the first place   i moved alone and lived in brighton for a bit and met friends there and a lot of them folks my age are just living their lives the way they want to although some of them have illegal part time jobs they were still happy and do not give any fcks about whatever people think of em  for a while though it felt like i was hanging out with losers cause the more i spend time with them the more i realised these people have no direction in life leeching off the system pretending to be disabled and putting each other as their designated carers or whatever to get free housing and benefits  i hate working but i dont want to be a fcking parasite  i also lived in london and every single day when you take a commute in the morning i swear youre in a train full of dead zombies it made me so depressed and the busyness of it all made me anxiety worse hence why i moved again and moved back to the countryside  after moving for the nth time and not enjoying the nth hospital  company i applied to not enjoying the toxic medical environment not enjoying the commute not feeling any satisfaction or any gratefulness of helping people isnt my job supposed to be rewarding  it is for a tiny bit then again is it worth giving all of me my time to people who wont even remember my name the next day families who wont even remember the nurse who did everything run around get the meds inject the meds to save their family member they will remember dr smith though  covid19 happened and things got more shttier   no one has any idea how to handle things everything that weve doing at the hospital before were all apparently non effective and could not protect us from this disease   they change the policies every single day and im not even sure if its to protect us the public or their pockets  beginning of last week they told us not to use excessive ppe anymore because public health england says so and using minimal ppe is enough  all of this nightmare is getting to me ive been working so much over the last few months  ive been working 50 hours and even weekends  last wednesday my alarm didnt go off because my phone didnt charged and it was dead  i was so anxious and didnt know what to do i live about an hour away from work and will be super late if i even attempt to go  i decided i would just lie and call off sick  i couldnt think of any excuse but say i have a fever and i told them that and then they all panicked cause i forgot its a covid symptom and now i have to self isolate for 10 days take a test and the whole shebang  i took a test obviously its negative but my manager said i can come back to work if its negative and i feel better   i received my test yesterday and i still havent reported it to my manager yet cause i still dont want to go back   i probably would let them know later and come back to work tomorrow it would be months and months of overtime and not being able to sit down again   i hate it though im glad i saw this thread and know that i am not alone im waiting for a few more months save some money and do part time but it might not actually happen as soon as i want to cause my bf is at risk of losing his job  we need to pay the rent and we have two cats we need to feed but i honestly cannot wait to quit work forever  fck capitalism   please ignore the world salad,io3hve
807,31 minutes past the hour and no motivation to do anything,havent lifted a finger since my shift started just so tired of this daily grind i subject myself to just to earn a living wage only to have a couple precious hours at the end of the day to myself half of which is usually spent wondering where my time goes and if what i do truly has any true value certainly doesnt feel that way and probably doesnt in the grand scheme of things   there has to be more to life than this,ipfzw9

810,Burnt out from an internship,a few months ago i started an internship at a huge company im obtaining a masters degre and have a cummulative 12 years work experience but all i could find were internships the company is wellknown to be a good employer   i wake up at 6am to get to work before 8am and usually leave work around 67pm arriving home around 8pm sometimes later i could leave earlier but i refuse to take unpaid work home with me unless working from home  im never thanked for my work for which i earn slightly less than minimum wage not including the 2hr daily commute in fact my coworkers all hate and constantly complain about eachother pretty sure i heard one of them complaining to my boss that they have to help me with things and that im not doing enough lmao since i only work with said coworker on one of the 100 things i need to do and its physically impossible to give 110 at 100 things  in the beginning it was great i was still in training and hanging out with other interns all the time but once training was done i was expected to singlehandedly maintain and expand code for a tool thats integral for our whole department write important reports that are reviewed by government agencies organize the 1000s of physical and digital files we have organize and oversee a project from conception to completion and do the daytoday all at the same time with little guidance  im only a few months in and seriously considering quitting that nukes my chances at ever getting an actual job at said company but if i dont put the internship on my resume i should still be able to get other jobs  i know some interns who do nothing all day i know a lot more in the same boat as me managers treating them like fulltime employees on deadlines with vital tasks and constantly under pressure   when tf did internships like this become the norm  how do people live like this for 40 years   at least now i know i never want to work in this sector i dont know what my other options are though  please feel free to recommend jobs that pay a living wage that dont make you burn out in months ,ioxm5s

844,"I had an epiphany last night that I could live basically the exact comfortable life I have right now for the rest of my life, without a single ambition to achieve any more than this, and no one could force me to do otherwise",ive been thinking a lot recently about the heinrich bll story that everyone whos been on this subreddit for a while will recognize  gtone day a fisherman was lying on a beautiful beach with his fishing pole propped up in the sand and his solitary line cast out into the sparkling blue surf he was enjoying the warmth of the afternoon sun and the prospect of catching a fish   gt   gtabout that time a businessman came walking down the beach trying to relieve some of the stress of his workday he noticed the fisherman sitting on the beach and decided to find out why this fisherman was fishing instead of working harder to make a living for himself and his family you arent going to catch many fish that way said the businessman you should be working rather than lying on the beach   gt   gtthe fisherman looked up at the businessman smiled and replied and what will my reward be   gt   gtwell you can get bigger nets and catch more fish was the businessmans answer   gt   gtand then what will my reward be asked the fisherman still smiling   gt   gtthe businessman replied you will make money and youll be able to buy a boat which will then result in larger catches of fish   gt   gtand then what will my reward be asked the fisherman again   gt   gtthe businessman was beginning to get a little irritated with the fishermans questions you can buy a bigger boat and hire some people to work for you he said   gt   gtand then what will my reward be repeated the fisherman   gt   gtthe businessman was getting angry dont you understand you can build up a fleet of fishing boats sail all over the world and let all your employees catch fish for you   gt   gtonce again the fisherman asked and then what will my reward be   gt   gtthe businessman was red with rage and shouted at the fisherman dont you understand that you can become so rich that you will never have to work for your living again you can spend all the rest of your days sitting on this beach looking at the sunset you wont have a care in the world   gt   gtthe fisherman still smiling looked up and said and what do you think im doing right now  my fiance and i have been house hunting recently and my brain has been constantly spinning the same gears that theyve been programmed to i can only be comfortable feel secure be satisfied enjoy my hobbies feel like my dog has enough room to run around etc if i buy a biggernicer house its not good enough for me to stay at the same job i have now even though its tremendously easy decentlypaying work that i dont have to carry with me outside of working hours or respond to any latenight emails or texts from the boss  it just really struck me hard last night that she and i have had fun hanging out together in our quarantineish bubble almost every night for months now without other distractions getting in the way very much and even though im programmed to want more than this the whole goal of life should be to get to the exact point that im at right now where i get to spend my day in my comfortable house with the dog i adore working a job that doesnt require an exceptional amount of me and my night hanging out and having fun with the person i love the most of course having all of this and no job is the true ideal but if that life were attainable there wouldnt be a need for this subreddit  and when i started thinking about the fact that what i have right now feels really good and comfortable and fun my head really started unwinding when i started considering the fact that i literally could choose to live this exact life for the rest of my days and theres nothing that requires me to move up work harder look for a betterpaying job get another degree constantly have projects that i obligate myself to have a sidehustle work out have kids buy a new car or anything else at all if i wanted to use my same couches my same bed my same tv all until they literally fall apart thats my prerogative if i decided to never apply for another job or seek to move up the financial ladder in any way i could do that we could just go on renting this same house forever if we chose to  all of this is obvious but it struck me as profound because the need to move up in the world has been constantly embedded as something that im required to do ive always been a type a personality i have the ability and energy to work harder to make more money than im making now and knowing that it always seemed mandatory that i should work harder get that side hustle monetize my hobbies invest my money in the hopes of making money and it usually makes me feel guilty when im not working hard enough to achieve those ends because that feeling of you can work harder so you should work harder has always been deeply ingrained   ive always been more like the businessman wanting to have what the fisherman has but i think ive finally started to become the fisherman,im5r5f

846,The corporate elite says they can't pay workers a living wage or they'll go under. Is this bullshit?,note mods let me know if this is not the right place for something like this and ill gladly remove it also please let me know if i made any mistakes on crunching the data and ill promptly fix those     as protests increase in size in the street and millions of americans face evictions amidst the coronavirus pandemic we see corporations getting richer and richer most americans live paycheck to paycheck and several of them must hold more than one job to just make ends meet on the other side corporations claim that increasing the minimum wage and paying workers a living wage would cause their business to collapse  this is sheer horseshit matter of fact there is a simple way in which we can analyze what companies do with the money they dont need to run the business   simply well look at dividends and stock buybacks we can take this money from the rich shareholders and give it to the workers without any damage to business operations but first lets talk about what the fuck are dividends and buybacks and why you should care     lets think of a corporation as if it was a person privileged enough to make ends meet in this example which is not the case for a lot of people for the sake of argument sadly in this dystopian system people have mandatory expenses like rent food and debt costs if you dont pay those youll go homeless go to jail or starve however if youre lucky enough you may have some spare cash in the end of the month you may choose to save it spend it on a game on steam or anything else youd like to the key takeaway in here is that you already covered your needs and you can spend this money on whatever you see fit      we can look at corporations in the same way after accounting for all costs that they need to stay running and invest on the future theyll have some cash left in the bank this cash can go to any place management wants to currently corporations believe in maximizing shareholder value read as giving money to rich people to make them richer in order to do so they take this cash they have left and give them to those rich folks in order to do so they can use stock buybacks and dividends      think of dividends as just walking down to the houses of your rich investors and giving them a briefcase of cash buybacks are a bit more complicated think of it under the optics of toilet paper in the beginning of the pandemic in this case lets assume your investors have a stockpile of toilet paper we will then use all of our spare cash to buy toilet paper in mass from all of the walmarts and costcos in the country so that they look like thishttpscdnvoxcdncomthumborjkulapgusbsblxqcen2bfmwtv0c0x03000x14581200x800filtersfocal1260x4891740x969cdnvoxcdncomuploadschorusimageimage66494925shortage03132010jpg since theres not a lot of toilet paper around your rich investors can charge much more for their stockpiles of tp since people in the street desperately need to wipe their asses and will pay more to do so in reality buybacks do exactly the same thing but to corporate shares instead of tp     so since the business clearly doesnt need this cash what if we just gave all this money to the workers   now lets do a small thought experiment   lets redistribute the money to workers if we redistributed every dollar going to the top 1 from dividends and stock buybacks by giving it to workers how much extra money would you be able to make     methodology we take the money spent on stock buybacks and redistribute those equally to all workers so if a company spend 100 in buybacks and it has 10 workers each worker would receive 10 also its surprisingly hard to find free data on buybacksi really wonder why so well be doing this analysis with numbers from 2018      the dataclick here for datahttpsamericansfortaxfairnessorgstockbuybacks   cool lets look at some companies and see how much money theyve spent on those things current average worker pay is estimated from glassdoor im just throwing some examples in here if people have interest i could look into making a simple webpage where you can go through all this data since it takes some time to run those numbers     home depot    buyback amount authorized for 225 billion dollars on stock buybacks from 20172019   number of employees 400000  current average worker pay 1260hour26208 a year  how much workers could make workers would receive 55000 in the years of 20172019 or 27500 per year average worker salary would increase to 51500 per year  if you make 51500 per year your hourly salary would be 2641h  ampx200b  starbucks

receive 20378 in the year of 2018 average worker salary would increase to 43258 per year  if you make 43258 per year your hourly salary would be 2231h       southwest airlines    buyback amount authorized for 4 billion dollars on stock buybacks in 2018   number of employees 61118  current average worker pay 20hour42000 a year  how much workers could make workers would receive 65447 in the year of 2018 average worker salary would increase to 107447 per year  if you make 107447per year your hourly salary would be 57h     conclusion  this is just the tip of the iceberg as were looking at a limited amount of data and not even accounting for dividends and other things but i hope that this data helps to shed light on how much wealth is being directly stolen from the working class and

931,Rant about my own stupid decisions and an awful call centre job,september 2019 i finished a masters in developmental psych at the time i was working part time in an offprice retail store the money wasnt great but the hours were flexible around my uni schedule and i didnt mind the work i already had in mind that i wanted to do a phd so before i quit the store i did the bulk of writing out a huge proposal on my days off   i decided that the retail job has nothing more to offer me so i decide i just want a temporary full time job not working weekends for once doing something easier to earn some cash to pay some debts off then maybe work on my phd applications a little more maybe do some travelling   i find a job in a call centre its temp to perm so not quite what i had in mind but the recruiter tells me just do the 12 weeks and if you dont want to stay on permanently you can leave   then covid happened ive been there for 7 months i know i should be lucky that i had a job over lockdown but its hard to be pleased about such an awful job   i still havent been made a permanent member of staff if im a minute late logging into my computer i get a late form and have to make it up at lunch every day we get emails reprimanding is for something or other like were in school the clients that we work for at the call centre are extremely unethical scamming confused old ladies theyve been understaffed for a long time so the work load has been insane we are very closely monitored i just hate my life being so controlled and micromanaged   i mentally checked out of the job a long time ago ive been on sick leave for 3 weeks now and im due to go back in on monday and im terrified the thought of the job makes me sick to my stomach ive tried applying for jobs and also getting back into my phd applications but ive been stressing about finding a job asap before my leave was over so its made things even worse once im back it will be impossible to apply for new jobs or a phd course as both are essentially full time jobs and ill never get the time off to go for interviews   i love being in education and focusing on my own projects i hate this super controlled 95 life   i live with my parents so i wont be homeless or foodless if i leave and my parents agree that i should quit if i need to my mother actually worked at this company years ago and had to quit due to the strain on her mental health so they understand completely however the idea of having no income scares me to bits i have a little bit of money to cover my bills but not much im planning on going back next week handing my notice in on friday and working my notice so i can at least have two weeks extra plus my holiday hours to add to my funds   i cant believe ive gotten myself into this mess and i dont know how to get out i should never have left my retail job i am also having a quarter life crisis im 25 and nowhere near my goals i hate that my entire life has to focus around working and earning money   rant over,im58mn

943,I really don't like working for a company,i started working as a frontend developer in october of 2018 the first company i worked for payed good but the environment was very toxic and it was far away from our home also they did work for an organisation that i always felt ashamed for working for them and didnt want to work for that company but the pay was good with flexible hour after the pandemic started they told us to work remotely for a couple of months and it was awful for me i struggled concentrating or even being motivated to work so i told myself thats it i have to change my workplace i started sending my resume and i got interviewed for a very big company and i got hired this company has good environment but the pay is not good when i started we had to go to work eveyday but again the pandemic got worse and they told us to work remotely on saturdays mondays and wednesdays but in sundays and tuesdays we go to work i realized im very bad at remote work when im at home i dont want to work due to economic problems in my country the dollars worth got very high and now if my hourly salary is equal to less than 2 dollars its awful for a developer i need to buy an external harddrive and that costs half of my monthly salary i dont know with these prices how married people with kids live and can afford buying stuff  i also realized i dont like coding for a company i like coding in general but when it comes to doing it for this job i lose all my motivation and energy there are lots of concepts i like to learn but i dont have time for extra learning at work and in my free time im very tired  my contract is for three month because im a new employee and the first three month is for company to see if they are satisfied with my work and they really want me in the team i always imagine them saying they dont want me and then with the cold seasons starting and obviously the covid getting worse again in my country i can spend the rest of the year at home and doing the things i like or maybe i can think of doing something that i enjoy and also getting paid for but i dont have the guts to tell them myself that i dont want to work anymore my inner critic always makes me feel bad about these decisions  i dont know if i have the right to not wanting to work like this or im just a lazy spoiled person but thats how i feel about working for a company i like to have freedom i like to try new things but i always worry about money  i dont know what to do  i thought this subreddit is the right place to talk about this feeling  thanks for reading,il0lin

952,Can we talk a moment about the expectation to take 2/3 weeks of vacation per year?,here is a summary of the law regarding vacations in my province   if you worked at your job for less than 3 years they must give you 2 weeks of paid vacation per year   if you worked at your job for more than 3 years they must give you 3 weeks of paid vacation per year   if you have 2 weeks of vacation you may request a 3rd week of unpaid vacation that cant be refused by your boss  how are we expected to work 11 months in a row to take a vacation or 46 months to take a single week thats burnout fuel right here  and while looking this up i found even worse   the employer has the privilege of setting the date of the vacation they must tell you 4 weeks in advance  thankfully none of the jobs ive had to far enforced this imagine trying to plan a trip or activity of more than 3 days with your so friends or family but oh no your vacations dont match better luck next year  im very happy i dont have to deal with this but i cant imagine being stuck somewhere like that,ikw7nj

954,Walked Out.,  this is going to be a long one sorry  i mentioned in another post a few months back that i work in the retail department of a restaurant since the restaurant has reopened following lockdown going there has been absolutely soul crushing  people happily shopping with no masks on making fun of us for wearing masks leaning around the glass barriers at the registers without wearing masks to hear better in the last two weeks i have had no fewer than three people hand me something to scan but not before rubbing it on their uncovered faces first i cannot understand why its just beyond me at this point truthfully  in addition people have been far more impatient and angry when they enter our store despite the dining room now being open we still get the majority of sales through our to go option in no way is our restaurant fast food related but people have come to believe that everything on the menu should take a maximum of three minutes or less to be ordered paid for and brought out the restaurant is still operating on a skeleton crew to boot which only makes people angrier when they find out that even though its 5 pm on a friday night  there is only one person manning the to go station and doing everything themselves being a cashier we get most of the anger taken out on us the abuse has gotten worse and management has shown their true colors through all of this though i always have my suspicions of anyone in a management position  they are not even pretending to care about the employees anymore last week my coworker and i were chewed out by management on the sales floor in front of customers just because the hostess had stepped away from the podium i was working on a floor set and we had two cashiers already up there i dont know why any of that was our fault but apparently it needed to be shrug    but two days ago i had enough i was supposed to be the closing cashier things were going pretty much the same as usual but i have long stopped trying to be little miss sunshine on the clock it takes all of my energy now not to just have a nervous breakdown i think the issue of whether or not i am smiling behind my mask is irrelevant  anyway by the middle of the shift i was tired and fed up with serving people who had no patience or who thought it was funny to refuse to pay for their food unless i said please and no i did not play along  on top of this my only coworker at the time was a girl who has only been there like a week and a half so i was doing a bit of juggling  as im in the middle of a transaction new girl asks for my help the customer i was ringing up conveniently decided to walk away from the register to keep shopping yep so i just left my register altogether and tried to help out my coworker  the issue was over the correct amount of change she owed back a customer everyone who works in retail knows that no matter how long youve been there if you have officially finished the transaction but the customer  retroactively hands you a random amount of additional cash it can throw you way off such was the issue here so i grabbed the calculator and tried not to panic so i wouldnt struggle to think clearly the whole time this customer and his little gf are whispering and laughing to themselves and i end up messing up anyway still laughing quite heartily the man leans down toward me and tells me how much we owe him i am panicked and exhausted so all i do is give him a deadpan look and turn back to the calculator what he said to me next just made me completely snap he raised his voice at me and in an attempt to i guess intimidate me said dont you look at me like that girl its not my fault you cant count  and i was just done i looked at him said nope took off my radio and threw it on the floor grabbed my things from behind the counter and left just like that  my only regret was leaving the new girl on her own because that is not like me but i can honestly say that it happened so fast it was like i wasnt in control of my legs if that makes any sense  when i got out i messaged a coworker that they needed to get in touch with one of the managers there because the new girl was by herself and would need help i know i should have handled that part better but i was so tired of being humiliated and degraded by these people who dont even see workers as people  i wish i could say i feel relieved to be out of there but i dont  i feel drained and anxious because now its back to the job hunt and the whole experience as the people here know is an existential nightmare  the likelihood of my only being able to find employment in a situation exactly like the one i just left is overwhelmingly high and i am back to wondering if being alive just for this is worth it im not saying im suicidal im just really really tired and dreading every single second of the future sorry for the length but i needed to get this out of me,ikre7q

957,"I work 4 months out of the year, the rest of the 8 months I literally do whatever I want and I am more than comfortable.",i was about 21 years old broke working dead end jobs and i hated it i knew from a young age i hated the 95 i have always been an advocate for taking risk and trying new jobs in hope id enjoy it and i would become one step closer to becoming financially free a buddy of mine was explaining to me how he worked 2 months that last year and made roughly 10k  15k the minute he said that my ears perked up and i immediately had questions i asked him how is that possible that sounds like a mlm scheme  i dont believe you thats not possible what is the catch it was none of those things he was literally working a real job with a legit company and he showed me paystubs etc i was completely shocked and completely geared towards finding out more i did research online and found out that this was achievable and i immediately wanted to start i found a great company that had been around for 19 years family owned etc i told my buddy im going to give it a shot the company flew me out payed for an apartment for me trained me bought me all my tools needed to be successful i didnt invest 1 dime the whole time i worked other than food and going out my first 4 months working i made over 30k and i flew back home i was able to actually do things i was able to get my own apartment a dog i was able to go out and eat and buy things for myself i did what i wanted to do for 8 months straight not only that since i did well the company i work for flew me out to hawaii for a weekend and sent me on a 7 day cruise to mexico pre covid moving on to my second year working i made a whopping 90k in 5 months i worked longer so i can make more one of my beat friends works with me my girlfriend of six years works with me its completely changed our lives and has been nothing but a blessing and an amazing experience and its just getting started i know a lot of people are closed minded and arent open to taking risks and trying new things and i know when people read this post they arent going to believe me amp will find an excuse in their head to make themselves feel better about their situation there is a quote that states life should be an adventure not a bore and i live by that quote daily if people have any questions about what i do feel free to contact me personally and we can maybe discuss more in private i am not open to discussing what i do publicly because it is a very niche market and i know what a reddit post is capable of if anyone has any questions about where i live how many hours i work when i work or anything feel free to comment,iklgms
958,"Willfully giving up years of your life is a sign of immaturity, not maturity.",most people would say that becoming an adult is learning to be okay with giving up huge portions of your time to make a living they will argue that a person is immature if they are unwilling to give up their time in order to participate in capitalist market   in my opinion they have it backwards   not having the ability to recognize the importance of time is a sign of a immature mind time is integral in terms of the most important aspects of life spending time with loved ones seeking wisdom growing as physically and mentally healthy as we can   giving up your time to do things against your will in exchange for things no human need be deprived of is not a healthy way to spend a life this is one of the main reasons so many modern cultures are so unhealthy physically and mentally we are not allowed to live in a healthy way and learning to accept this is not a position to be defended or looked up to    market participation isnt maturity but mistaking it for maturity is very immature,iktz33
